A workshop on the dairy industry is scheduled for June 25, 2010, in Madison, WI.", "Consolidation has been a long-term trend in agriculture. Across the industry, including the dairy sector, rising productivity has led to fewer and larger operations along the production and marketing chain, including farms, cooperatives, processors, and retailers. Larger operations tend to have lower per-unit costs. As firms reduce their costs, they become more competitive and can increase sales and market share at the expense of less profitable firms. As a result, fewer dairy farms are needed to produce the same amount of milk. Firm size is a limiting factor for growth, however, once the gains to economies of scale have been exhausted.", "At the farm level, the number of farms continues to decline, although at a much slower pace during the last decade than in previous periods. Consolidation at the cooperative and processor levels has followed a similar path, in order to offset market power of large downstream entities and to satisfy demands from retailers to serve them more efficiently.", "Concentration has also been increasing in the dairy industry. Nearly all segments of the industry have become more concentrated over time. The primary concern many have with concentration is that it may reduce competition in the marketplace for agricultural and food products and result in market power (i.e., the ability of a firm to influence prices), putting at a disadvantage some segment of the population, such as producers or consumers. However, concentration may also result in efficiency gains, whereby cost savings are passed on to consumers through lower retail prices, which in turn can generate additional demand for commodities and benefit farmers. Another concern is how concentration affects price transparency in markets for dairy products and milk.", "In summarizing research findings for several agricultural industries, including the dairy industry, the Government Accountability Office concluded that most of the studies it reviewed found either no evidence of market power, or efficiency effects that were larger than the market power effects of concentration. However, the agency said experts generally agreed that concentration is likely to increase in the future, potentially raising greater concerns about market power and the manipulation of commodity or food prices.", "U.S. antitrust laws (specifically the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act) are concerned with competition in markets and not the protection of any individual competitor.

In calendar year 2009, the federal government spent more than $1 billion to support the industry through various dairy programs. Following appeals from dairy farmers for more financial assistance, Congress granted $350 million in October 2009 in the form of supplemental payments as well as government purchases of dairy products for domestic feeding programs. ", "Despite the government payments and program support, the number of U.S. dairy farms declined during 2009 by 3% to 65,000 farms as of December 31, 2009. During the same period, the number of dairy cows fell, and the subsequent decline in milk production, along with a simultaneous rebound in foreign demand for dairy products, lifted average farm milk prices, estimated at $15.10 per hundredweight for March 2010, up from $11.80 per hundredweight a year earlier. (Prices averaged $14.68 per hundredweight during 2000-2009.) Still, financial concerns remain for dairy farmers who lost significant amounts of farm equity during the milk price collapse and continue to contend with feed prices that are well above historical averages.", "The financial stress of 2009 and similar episodes over the years have led the industry and Members of Congress to reconsider the options available to handle fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers.

The early history of the dairy industry was also shaped by significant government intervention in the market, which continues today."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Marketing and Policy History", "paragraphs": ["In the mid-1850s, most milk was consumed by families on farms or fed to livestock; some was sold off farms but only for very local use. As urban areas grew, milk was sent to processors to supply these areas with both fluid and manufactured products. By the turn of the 20 th century, many producers had banded together into cooperative associations to bargain with milk handlers (fluid milk processors) as a way to offset handler market power. In the early 1900s, dairy farmers increasingly looked toward cooperatives to market their milk, specifically by negotiating with milk buyers using collective bargaining. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 confers limited exemption from antitrust liability to farmer cooperatives (see \" U.S. Antitrust Law ,\" below).", "By 1925, handlers were paying farmers for fluid-grade milk according to its use (fluid or manufactured products). This concept, known as \"classified pricing,\" is still in use today. Milk for fluid use is valued at the highest level, reflecting higher transportation and handling costs. ", "When the Great Depression hit, demand dropped sharply and the classified pricing system broke down. Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) were eventually established (and continue to function today) to stabilize the market and help equalize the market power of dairy farmers with dairy processors. Another motivation for establishing FMMOs was to ensure that consumers had adequate and dependable supplies of milk at reasonable prices. During this period, legislators also enacted import quotas on dairy products to protect producers from foreign competition. Eventually, during World War II, demand increased for farm commodities, including milk. ", "In the late 1940s, the government began supporting the price of milk (and other farm commodities) to protect against price declines through the dairy price support program, now called the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP). In 1985, an export subsidy program (Dairy Export Incentives Program or DEIP) was added to national dairy policy. Finally, a counter-cyclical income program (Milk Income Loss Contract or MILC) was authorized beginning in 2002. For more information on dairy programs, see CRS Report R40205, Dairy Market and Policy Issues ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advancements in Milk Marketing", "paragraphs": ["Advancements in milk marketing have dramatically changed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. In the early 20 th century, raw milk was transported by truck over short distances and by rail over longer distances (with milk packed in ice and sawdust) to processing plants. Distances ranged from just a few miles in \"local\" markets to several hundred miles in large markets such as New York, Boston, and Chicago. Milk was \"bottled\" mostly for home delivery, with only small amounts sold in stores. ", "Home delivery of milk characterized fluid milk marketing for decades, which highlights the historical \"local\" nature of production and consumption of fluid milk. However, throughout the second half the of 20 th century, several factors combined to reduce the cost of moving milk from producers to consumers, and ensuring a transition to what is now a national milk and dairy product market. These factors included improved roadways (e.g., the interstate highway system) and larger and faster trucks for bulk transport of milk (tanker trucks). By the 1970s, most retail milk was purchased in stores (or through food service), primarily in lightweight plastic or paper containers. ", "Bulk milk is now shipped, perhaps thousands of miles by truck, when market demands exceed local farm milk production. Similarly, individual dairy manufacturing plants ship products such as cheese, yogurt, and flavored milk to food distribution centers located across the country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Farm and Retail Price Movements", "paragraphs": ["A long-standing issue during the development of the dairy industry, and in other parts of agriculture, has been the relationship between farm and retail prices. Most recently, as farm prices of milk and other agricultural commodities fell in late 2008, retail food price declines were slow to follow. This decreased the farm value share\u2014the portion of the retail dollar that flows to the farmer\u2014and caused some in Congress to question whether processors and retailers were contributing to economic stress in the agricultural sector, particularly for dairy farmers. ", "In recent decades, across the agricultural sector, several factors have led to a declining farm share of the retail food dollar. These factors include gains in agricultural productivity, growth in demand for value-added products, and changes in food marketing. The farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products (not just dairy) was 41% in 1950, a time when many food products were sold with much less value-added processing or packaging than today. In 2006, USDA estimated that the average farm-value share of all food products of U.S. farm origin consumed was 18.5%. The remaining 81.5% was accounted for by a host of marketing factors, including labor (processing and retail sectors), packaging, profit, transportation, and energy. ", "For milk and dairy products, the farm share is approximately one-third of the retail dollar, which is greater than the all-food average, largely because other food categories such as cereals and bakery products have a higher overall degree of processing. While the farm share of the retail price bounces around from year to year, the overall trend for milk and dairy products was generally flat between 2000 and 2008. By product category, the farm-share trend was flat for whole milk, butter, and ice cream, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese.", "Examining changes in monthly farm and retail prices during 2008 and early 2009 indicates a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values and a widening of the marketing margin. Between July 2008 and December 2008, the farm price of milk reported by USDA fell by $0.33 per gallon ( Figure 1 ). Meanwhile, the average retail milk price fell only $0.28, with the difference between the retail and farm price (i.e., the marketing margin) increasing to $2.35 per gallon. In January 2009, the difference between the average retail price of milk and the farm price of milk reached a record-high $2.43 per gallon. ", "Throughout 2009, however, amid lower costs for farm milk and other inputs (e.g., energy and transportation), retailers reduced their prices and the difference between farm and retail prices declined sharply. The difference dropped to $1.69 per gallon in December, which is more than $0.25 per gallon below the recent five-year average margin ( Figure 2 ). In early 2010, farm prices weakened slightly and the price spread returned to the five-year average level.", "As described in CRS Report R40621, Farm-to-Food Price Dynamics , time lags in retail price response to farm price changes are generally months in length, even for perishables like milk. Another characteristic of food markets is that adjustments in retail prices from higher farm prices occur faster and with greater pass-through to the consumer than adjustments to decreases in farm prices, an economic phenomenon often referred to as \"sticky\" retail food prices. That is, retail prices follow commodity prices upward rapidly, but fall back only slowly and partially when commodity prices recede. ", "Economists have noted that certain aspects of consumer behavior (such as strong consumer store preference and responsiveness to high food prices by higher-income consumers), as well as store inventory management and retailing strategies, may limit retail prices from adjusting fully to downward farm price movements. As a result, these types of price movements do not necessarily imply abnormal or excessive market power by the retailer.", "Recent economic research has also found that the competition effects of supermarket services can result in stores attracting less price-sensitive consumers. For retail stores that differentiate themselves from competitors by offering additional services (e.g., banking, restaurant, pharmacy) rather than through prices, consumers might pay more for milk. In these cases, there can be a \"disconnect\" between farm and retail prices of agricultural products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dairy Industry Structure", "paragraphs": ["Consolidation has been a long-term trend in agriculture.

Operations totaled 65,000 on December 31, 2009.", "Steady increases in productivity (milk per cow) have more than offset declines in the number of dairy farms and cows, resulting in a steady upward trend in total milk production ( Figure 4 ). Meanwhile, domestic demand for milk and milk products, on a per-capita basis, has grown slowly, at 0.4 % per year since 1990. Rising consumption of dairy products such as cheese has offset a decline in consumption of fluid milk products. Exports of dairy products have increased in recent years, reaching record levels in 2008.", "The trend in farm numbers depends on the size of the farm ( Table 1 ). Between 2005 and 2009, farms with fewer than 500 cows registered declines, while farms with 500 to 999 cows held steady. In contrast, farms with 1,000 or more cows increased 20%, driven by significantly lower costs of production. In 2005, dairy farms with 1,000 cows or more had average costs of production of $13.59 per hundredweight, 15% below the average for farms with 400-999 head and 35% below the cost for farms with 100-199 head. Average costs were much higher for even smaller operations.", "Industry structure at the farm level can also be characterized by the volume of milk produced by farms of different sizes ( Table 2 ). In 2009, the largest portion of U.S. milk output (47%) was produced on farms with 1,000 head or more, while small farms (fewer than 100 head) accounted for only 16% of the total. An increase in the number of large farms has contributed to their producing a larger portion of U.S. milk output (the share produced by large farms rose from 35% in 2005 to 47% in 2009).", "Larger dairy farms enjoy \"scale economies\" arising in part from the use of large and highly automated milking parlors and feed delivery systems, which also allow for more effective use of labor. Also, large, modern buildings reduce per-animal housing costs, as do automated manure removal and handling systems.", "The structure of dairy farms also varies by region of the country ( Table 3 ). The average farm size is large in the western states (e.g., California, with 850 cows per farm). In contrast, Wisconsin has many small farms and an average farm size of 88 cows. The U.S. average is 133 cows per farm.", "Cost structure varies by state ( Figure 5 ). In the western states, where large dairy farms dominate the industry, operating costs have been affected by high feed costs in recent years because these farms purchase much of their feed (alfalfa and grain prices reached record levels in 2008). However, per-unit overhead costs tend to be relatively low because these costs can be spread over a large number of animals. In parts of the country where producers feed grain and hay that is produced on the farm, such as in Wisconsin, operating costs tend to be lower when grain and feed prices rise. These farms tend to have fewer dairy cows, so per-unit overhead costs are relatively high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cooperatives16", "paragraphs": ["A cooperative is an enterprise owned by and operated for the benefit of those using its services. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives often operate a complete milk distribution system, procuring raw milk from the farm, routing it where needed, managing or coordinating movements of processed or manufactured products, and managing surplus milk. Dairy cooperatives range in size and function, with some solely arranging for the sale of members' milk while others manufacture a wide range of products for direct sale to customers. ", "The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s as cooperatives merged to take advantage of economic gains from more centralized management of milk supplies and disposition. During 1940-1941, the number of dairy cooperatives totaled over 2,300 and accounted for just under one-half of farm milk marketings. By 2007, the number of cooperatives had shrunk to 155, while the co-op share of farm milk marketings had increased to 83% (with the remaining milk sold without cooperative affiliation). Over time, consolidations as well as strategic alliances among dairy cooperatives have enabled them to serve large retail customers by increasing volume and achieving operational efficiencies. Also, some economists contend that consolidation in the retail sector has encouraged consolidation within cooperatives.

Over time, the number of dairy firms has declined, with firms reportedly increasing their plant and firm size to reduce their costs and respond to the demands of high-volume retailers, large restaurant chains, and other customers.

The number of plants operated by the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies ranges from 9 to 81 plants ( Table 5 ).", "Concentration trends in the dairy processing and manufacturing industry are not unlike those in other food processing sectors ( Table 6 ). In 2002, the latest year of available data, the four-firm concentration ratio (the combined market share of the top four firms) was 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing. These figures compare with a mean industry concentration ratio of 49% for nine selected food processing industries. Several industries were substantially more concentrated than dairy, including meatpacking (59%) and soybean processing (80%). While the level of concentration in dairy processing is not unusually high nationally, local or regional markets can be more concentrated, which is a concern for some farmers and policymakers.", "Based on U.S. Census Bureau data, the level of industry concentration in the fluid milk industry has recently increased ( Figure 7 ), following a merger in 2001 between the two largest private fluid processing firms\u2014Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods. Nevertheless, industry concentration for fluid milk processing is just below the average level (49%) for selected food manufacturing industries.

Some policymakers and industry participants feel that concentration in the dairy industry has weakened market \"discovery\" of prices. Fewer buyers and sellers means that fewer transactions are made. Typically, markets work more efficiently when there are many \"observable\" transactions that provide sufficient information to all market participants about demand, supply, and prices. The move within the dairy industry to a more integrated market, with closer ties between various market players such as custom contracts or other pre-arranged transactions, results in fewer trades of products on the cash or \"spot\" market. In years past, these sales would account for a greater share of market transactions and provide a good measure of current prices. ", "The primary spot market for dairy is located at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk are traded. Actual quantities traded are quite small, but prices determined by buyers and sellers at this market are used to establish wholesale price contracts across the country, subject to premiums and discounts for factors such as quality and transportation. Wholesale dairy product prices are then used to set monthly minimum prices by USDA that milk handlers must pay for farm milk under the federal orders.", "Some dairy producer groups believe that the CME is an inadequate pricing mechanism because of perceptions that the market is too thinly traded, lacks transparency and sufficient oversight, and creates a highly volatile market that adversely affects producers. The GAO concluded in a 2007 study that \"certain market conditions at the CME spot cheese market, including a small number of trades and a small number of traders who make a majority of trades, continue to make this market particularly susceptible to manipulation.\" ", "However, the report also noted that if price manipulation were to occur, some industry participants claim it would be short-lived because many large participants in the cheese and dairy industry with diverse interests monitor the market and are prepared to participate in it. Reportedly, they would begin trading once prices became disconnected from underlying supply and demand conditions, potentially counteracting any attempted price manipulation. Nevertheless, some industry participants want sales volume to increase on the CME, thereby reducing the possibility of price manipulation. ", "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the CME itself monitor activities of the spot market participants for signs of price manipulation. In December 2008, several dairy industry participants agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through purchases of cheese on the CME in 2004.", "While there are apparently no current proposals on how to encourage additional volume, the CME recently announced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as an international dairy risk management tool, with six worldwide delivery points. Some producers and policymakers are also interested in improving overall dairy price transparency by expanding USDA's mandatory price reporting system for dairy products in terms of additional products (e.g., cheese other than cheddar) and/or frequency of price reports.

On January 22, 2010, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and several states filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Wisconsin, alleging that the purchase violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act. DOJ asserts that Dean's acquisition will, by eliminating an aggressive price competitor (Foremost Farms), lessen competition in the market to sell milk to schools and in a separate market for supplying fluid milk to grocery chains, restaurants, and other retail outlets in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. According to DOJ, \"The Acquisition's elimination of head-to-head competition between Dean and Foremost will hurt school milk and fluid milk purchases.\" Prior to the transaction, Foremost Farms had been losing fluid milk customers to other processors who could deliver milk to more distant locations as the customers preferred. As a result, the cooperative had been pricing aggressively in local markets against Dean Foods. The acquisition was not required to be reported to the Department of Justice beforehand.", "The lawsuit seeks to require Dean Foods to sell the dairy processing plants it acquired from Foremost Farms. According to DOJ, Dean Foods now has approximately 57% of the market for processed milk in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and the upper peninsula of Michigan. Dean Foods has stated that it believes the acquisition was in compliance with antitrust laws and benefits dairy farmers by providing a stable outlet for their milk. The company says the deal has already resulted in cost savings that benefit consumers and spur competition in the region. ", "The ongoing case against Dean Foods highlights the economics of consolidation in the U.S. dairy industry. In individual markets where there is excess capacity, such as in upper Wisconsin, as indicated by DOJ, it may be difficult for a smaller firm to aggressively compete indefinitely if some of that company's customers shift to other companies for market reasons (in this case, for a broader geographic reach by the supplier).

The defendants include Dairy Farmers of America, Inc. (DFA is the largest U.S. dairy cooperative), Dairy Marketing Services (DMS is a milk marketing organization formed by DFA and Dairylea Cooperative), Dean Foods (milk processor), and HP Hood (milk processor). The lawsuit claims that the defendants have conspired through contracts, agreements, mergers, plant closures, and other actions to control the supply of fluid milk in the Northeast, with the net effect of lowering prices received by farmers. ", "At issue is the state of competition in a milk marketing system once dominated by family-owned processors that were supplied by neighboring producers, many of whom were members of one of several cooperatives that were active in the region. According to the lawsuit, dairy producers must now affiliate with either DFA or DMS because the two firms have exclusive supply agreements with the region's dominant processors, Dean Foods and HP Hood. According to the lawsuit, the defendants, together, have used their market power to the detriment of dairy farmers in the Northeast, particularly independent producers and cooperatives.", "DFA has said the cooperative has helped to increase returns for dairy farmers through efficiencies leading to cost savings in field services, hauling, and administration. It maintains that rather than suppressing farmer prices, the cooperative looks for ways to increase producer returns.", "Observers note that it may take years for the litigation to be resolved. A similar (ongoing) case filed in 2008 involves multiple class action lawsuits in the southeastern United States against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA, and others."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remark", "paragraphs": ["From an economic and legal standpoint, determining the net effect of concentration\u2014namely, the potentially offsetting effects of market power (negative for some participants) and efficiency gains (neutral or positive for all participants)\u2014is complicated by the presence of many other factors that influence prices and the marketplace in general. Market power can be affected by such factors as product differentiation, ease of entering a market, or the structure of contracts between farmers and processors. Likewise, efficiency gains can stem from a variety of sources, including technology changes and business practices. Finally, economic events and government policies can certainly influence commodity prices, making it difficult to pinpoint effects of concentration on the dairy industry."], "subsections": []}]}}
