{"id": "RS22246", "title": "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF): Its Role in Response to the Effects of Hurricane Katrina", "released_date": "2007-01-19T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant provides grants to states to help them fund a wide variety of benefits and services to low-income families with children. TANF is best known for funding cash welfare benefits for families with children, but the block grant may also fund other benefits and services such as emergency payments, child care, transportation assistance, and other social services. Welfare programs are not usually associated with responses to natural disasters. However, the scope of Hurricane Katrina's displacement of families, the strain placed on responding human service agencies, plus the flexibility allowed states to design programs under TANF, made the block grant a potential source of help to the victims of this disaster. P.L. 109-68 provided some additional TANF funds and waived certain program requirements for states affected by Katrina. Under that act, all states were provided capped funding to aid evacuees from hurricane-damaged states. This report will be not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The TANF block grant is a fixed amount of funding paid to each state based on a formula. States design and administer benefits and services funded by TANF and have wide latitude in their use of block grant funds. States are required to share a portion of the cost of TANF benefits and services by expending some of their own funds on TANF-related benefits and services through a \"maintenance of effort\" requirement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TANF Cash Welfare Benefit Programs", "paragraphs": ["TANF is the major federal-state program providing cash assistance to needy families with children. While federal TANF grants help fund this cash assistance, states determine eligibility rules and benefit amounts which vary greatly among the states. There are no federal rules regarding eligibility and benefits for ongoing cash welfare, other than the requirement that it be paid to families with children that meet a financial test of economic need.", " Table 1 provides some basic information on cash welfare benefits in the states affected by Hurricane Katrina and some of their neighboring states. It shows both the maximum monthly benefit amount paid to a family of three as of January 2005 and the average number of families that received cash assistance in June 2006. The maximum monthly benefit is generally the amount paid to a family with no other income sources. TANF cash assistance benefits in this region are relatively low compared with those paid in other regions and states. For example, the comparable maximum cash welfare grant paid in New York City in January 2005 was $691 per month and the maximum cash welfare grant paid to a family of three in the urban areas of California was $723 per month.", "TANF imposes some requirements on states with respect to families receiving cash assistance. The purpose of the requirements is to ensure that receipt of cash welfare is temporary and to encourage movement off the rolls and into work. TANF requires that a specified percentage of its caseload be engaged in work or job preparation activities, limits federally-funded assistance to five years, and requires that cash assistance recipients cooperate with child support enforcement rules (establish paternity and assign child support to the state)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emergency Assistance", "paragraphs": ["TANF also gives authority to states to pay \"emergency assistance\" benefits. Emergency benefits are those that:", "are considered \"nonrecurrent, short-term benefits;\" are designed to deal with a specific crisis situation or episode of need; are not intended to meet recurrent or ongoing needs; and will not extend beyond four months.", "Families receiving such emergency benefits are not subject to the same requirements (i.e, work requirements and time limits) as are families that receive cash assistance.
