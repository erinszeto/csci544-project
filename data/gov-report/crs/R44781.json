The election of 2008 was noteworthy in that it led to four Senate vacancies as two Senators, Barack H. Obama of Illinois and Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, were elected President and Vice President, and two additional Senators, Hillary R. Clinton of New York and Ken Salazar of Colorado, were nominated for the positions of Secretaries of State and the Interior, respectively. Following the election of 2016, one vacancy was created by the nomination of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as Attorney General. Since that time, one additional vacancy has occurred and one has been announced, for a total of three since February 8, 2017.", "As noted above, Senator Jeff Sessions resigned from the Senate on February 8, 2017, to take office as Attorney General of the United States.

The current constitutional authority for temporary appointments to fill Senate vacancies derives from the Seventeenth Amendment, which provides for direct popular election of Senators, replacing election by state legislatures. It specifically directs state governors to \"issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, that the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointment until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.\" Since ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, the Senate records currently identify 198 appointments to fill vacancies in the office of U.S. Senator.", "During the period since ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, most states have authorized their governors to fill Senate vacancies by temporary appointments. At present, in 35 states, these appointees serve until the next general election, when a permanent successor is elected to serve the balance of the term, or until the end of the term, whichever comes first. Ten states authorize gubernatorial appointment, but require an ad hoc special election to be called to fill the vacancy, which is usually conducted on an accelerated schedule, to minimize the length of time the seat is vacant. The remaining five states do not authorize their governors to fill a Senate vacancy by appointment. In these states, the vacancy must be filled by a special election, here again, usually conducted on an accelerated schedule. In one notable detail concerning the appointment process, six states require their governors to fill Senate vacancies with an appointee who is of the same political party as the prior incumbent.", "Following the emergence of controversies in connection with the Senate vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Barack Obama in 2008, several states eliminated or restricted their governors' authority to fill Senate vacancies by appointment, while both legislation and a constitutional amendment that would have required all Senate vacancies to be filled by special election were introduced in the 111th Congress.

In some states the legislatures meet but once a year. As the Senate will have more power and consist of a smaller number than the other house, vacancies there will be of more consequence. The executives might be safely entrusted, he thought, with the appointment for so short a time. ", "James Wilson of Pennsylvania countered by asserting that the state legislatures met frequently enough to deal with vacancies, that the measure removed appointment of the Senators another step from popular election, and that it violated separation of powers by giving the executive power to appoint a legislator, no matter how brief the period. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut noted that \"may\" as used in the provision was not necessarily prescriptive, and that \"[w]hen the legislative meeting happens to be near, the power will not be exerted.\" A motion to strike out executive appointment was voted down eight states to one, with one divided.

The primary grounds for these contested appointments appear to have centered on whether vacancies happened during the recess of the legislature. According to historian George Haynes, throughout much of this time, \"the Senate refused to admit to its membership men who had been appointed by the governors of their several States when the legislature had had the opportunity to fill the vacancies, but had failed to do so by reason of deadlocks.\" Aside from this recurring controversy, the appointment of temporary Senators seems to have been otherwise unremarkable. A random survey of various states during the period from 1789 through 1913 identifies an average of 3.3 senatorial appointments per state for the period, with individual totals dependent largely on the length of time the state had been in the Union.

The decades following the Civil War witnessed increasing instances of both protracted elections, in which senatorial contests were drawn out over lengthy periods, and deadlocked elections, in which state legislatures were unable to settle on a candidate by the time their sessions ended. In the most extreme instances, protracted and deadlocked elections resulted in unfilled Senate vacancies for sometimes lengthy periods. According to Haynes, 14 seats were left unfilled in the Senate for protracted periods, and while \"[t]he duration of these vacancies varied somewhat ... in most cases, it amounted to the loss of a Senator for the entire term of a Congress.\"", "During the same period, the Senate election process was increasingly regarded as seriously compromised by corruption. Corporations, trusts, and wealthy individuals were often perceived as having bribed state legislators in order to secure the election of favored candidates. Once in office, the Senators so elected were said to \"keep their positions by heeding the wishes of party leaders and corporate sponsors rather than constituents.\"", "A third factor contributing to the rise of support for direct election of Senators was what one historian characterized as \"a long-term American inclination to strengthen representative democracy.\" As such, the campaign for popular election might be considered part of the series of state and federal laws and constitutional amendments intended to expand the right to vote and guarantee the integrity of election procedures. As the movement for reform gained strength, \"progressive\" elements in both major parties, and rising political movements, such as the Populist and Socialist parties, all supported direct election of the Senate.", "Action for popular election of Senators proceeded on two levels. First, beginning as early as the 1870s, the House of Representatives considered popular election amendment proposals. As support for this idea gained strength, the House approved a popular election amendment for the first time in 1893. Moreover, the House continued to approve popular election amendments by increasing vote margins a total of five times between 1893 and 1902; in each case, however, the Senate took no action. Faced with the Senate's refusal to consider a direct election amendment, the House put the question aside, and the question of popular election of Senators remained quiescent for nearly a decade, at least in Congress.", "Efforts to secure direct election of Senators met with greater success in the states during this period. After years of experimentation with different plans by the states, Oregon voters used the newly enacted initiative process in 1904 to pass legislation that had the effect of requiring state legislators to pledge to elect the Senate candidate who received the most votes in the popular primary election. The winner of the primary, who would then be elected Senator by the state legislature, would reflect the people's choice by one degree of removal.

This clause would have removed reference to the Senate from Article I, Section 4, clause 1, of the Constitution, and would have had the effect of eliminating federal authority over the Senate elections process. It has been described by historians as \"a 'race rider' which would deny to the federal government the authority to regulate the manner in which elections were conducted.\" Supporters of the clause asserted it guaranteed state sovereignty and restrained the power of the federal government, while opponents characterized it as an attack on the right of black Americans to vote as conferred by the Fifteenth Amendment, at least with respect to the Senate.

The right of the elected Senator to supplant the appointed one was challenged on the grounds that the governor had no legal right to issue the writ of election, because neither Congress nor the Maryland legislature had enacted legislation authorizing the special elections contemplated by the Seventeenth Amendment. The Senate debated the issue, rejected this argument, and seated the elected Senator. In the second case, the governor of Alabama sought to appoint an interim Senator to fill a vacancy created in 1913, after the Seventeenth Amendment had been ratified.
