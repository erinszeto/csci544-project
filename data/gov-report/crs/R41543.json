The location of these basins impacts the transportation of natural gas, as there is a reduced need for natural gas from the Rockies or Gulf Coast.

On June 26, 2016, the Panama Canal reopened for commercial business, after undergoing construction for an additional ship traffic lane. The newly expanded canal eliminates about 10 days in transit time from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to Asian markets, thus offering a potential shipping route for U.S. LNG. However, only 10% of LNG carriers are small enough to fit the canal; no LNG transits have been scheduled through the canal.

", "The use and disposition of water in the industry process of hydraulic fracturing is one of the main issues facing companies and regulators. As U.S. natural gas production continues to grow, this practice has raised concerns over the quality and quantity of drinking water in areas situated near hydraulic fracturing, the competition for other water users, and the disposal of wastewater. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it would undertake a study to assess any impact hydraulic fracturing might have on drinking water. A final report has not been released. ", "There is concern over deep-well injection and human-caused earthquakes. The wastewater produced from horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing is typically disposed through deep-well injection, in which the wastewater is injected into deep geologic strata. The concern is that deep-well injection may be linked to human-induced earthquakes, as the number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater has increased. ", "Emissions from the natural gas sector and the impact on human health is also a concern; specifically, methane emissions. As the primary component of natural gas, methane is a precursor to smog and a potent greenhouse gas. While state and local authorities regulate natural gas systems, in 2012 the EPA established national minimum air standards, or New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), to reduce methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the natural gas sector. In May 2016, the EPA updated the 2012 NSPS to include additional equipment in the gas production chain. The NSPS include natural gas well sites, natural gas processing plants, and natural gas compressor stations. Federal standards for methane emissions do not cover all sources of methane, such as offshore sources or coalbed methane production facilities. As the production of natural gas continues to expand in the United States, the issue of methane as an air pollutant may be a significant one for policymakers.

U.S. LNG exports have placed pressure on other countries to delink their gas exports from oil-indexed prices. Almost all natural gas that is traded internationally is under long-term contracts, usually 20 years in length, whether it is by pipeline or as LNG. This is primarily because natural gas transportation is expensive and long-term contracts are needed to finance construction of the transport facilities.

Over the last several years, the disparity between contract prices and spot prices has raised pressure on gas producers to do away with this concept.
