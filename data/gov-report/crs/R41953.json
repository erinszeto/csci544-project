Thus, there is no current federal tax benefit for most electricity currently generated using hydropower. Further, with many of the best hydro sites already developed, there is limited potential for growth in conventional hydropower capacity. There is, however, potential for development of additional electricity-generating capacity through smaller hydro projects that could substantially increase U.S. hydro-electric generation capacity. Excluding hydro from the renewables category, non-hydro renewables accounted for 8.2% of 2013 primary energy production.", "During 2013, certain tax expenditures for renewable energy did, however, benefit taxpayers developing and operating hydro-electric power facilities. Specifically, development of hydro-electric facilities has been supported with clean renewable energy bonds (CREBs). Additionally, certain hydro-electric installations may be eligible for the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) or the Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credits program. Given that hydro is supported by 2013 tax expenditures, one could also argue that hydro should not be excluded from the renewables category. ", "It may also be instructive to consider incentives that generally support renewable electricity separately from those that support biofuels. Of the estimated $23.3 billion in energy tax provisions in 2013, an estimated $1.6 billion, or 6.9%, went toward supporting biofuels. Excluding tax incentives for biofuels, 50.5% of energy-related tax incentives in 2013 were attributable to renewables. In other words, excluding biofuels from the analysis reduces the share of tax incentives attributable to renewables from 57.4% to 50.5%. Excluding biofuels from the analysis has a smaller impact on renewables' share of primary energy production. When biofuels are excluded, the share of primary energy produced in 2013 attributable to renewables falls by 2.5 percentage points, from 11.4% to 8.9%.", "In 2013, 10.1% of primary energy produced was from nuclear resources. The one tax benefit for nuclear with a positive tax expenditure in 2013 was the special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds. At $1.1 billion in 2013, this was 4.7% of the value of all tax expenditures for energy included in the analysis. Like many other energy-related tax expenditures, the special tax rate for nuclear decommissioning reserve funds is not directly related to current energy production. Instead, this provision reduces the cost of investing in nuclear energy by taxing income from nuclear decommissioning reserve funds at a preferred rate (a flat rate of 20%).

From the 1980s through 2011, most of the tax-related federal financial support for renewable energy was for renewable fuels, mainly alcohol fuels (i.e., ethanol). Starting in 2008, the federal government incurred outlays associated with excise tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel. The tax credits for alcohol fuels (including ethanol) expired at the end of 2011, while the tax credits for biodiesel and renewable diesel expired at the end of 2014.

From 2009 onwards, the increased costs associated with incentives for renewable electricity are largely attributable to the Section 1603 grants in lieu of tax credit program. The Section 1603 grant option is not available for projects that began construction after December 31, 2011. However, since grants are paid out when construction is completed and eligible property is placed in service, outlays under the Section 1603 program are expected to continue through 2017.", "Revenue losses for tax incentives supporting energy efficiency are also projected to decline through 2018. Most of the increase in revenue losses for efficiency-related provisions between 2008 and 2014 was associated with tax incentives for homeowners investing in certain energy-efficient property. The primary tax incentive for energy efficiency improvements to existing homes expired at the end of 2014. Extension of expired tax incentives for energy efficiency would increase the cost of energy efficiency-related tax incentives. ", "As was noted above, much of the projected cost of energy-related tax incentives in the out years is associated with expired or expiring provisions. Costs for certain provisions may extend beyond expiration for a number of reasons. In the case of the Section 1603 grant program, since outlays occur when property is placed in service, costs for this program will continue to be incurred long past its 2011 expiration date. Another example is the renewable energy production tax credit (PTC). The PTC is available for the first 10 years of production from a qualified facility. Thus, property placed in service in 2012 may claim production tax credits through 2022. Even with the expiration of the PTC for wind at the end of 2014, wind energy facilities that were under construction before December 31, 2014, may receive production credits for 10 years after it is placed in service. Revenue losses associated with tax provisions can also extend beyond a provision's expiration when taxpayers are allowed to carry forward unused tax credits, using credits to offset liability in future tax years.", "Accounting for expired provisions has additional implications for trends in tax-related support for different types of energy resources. Between 2013 and 2018, the cost of tax-related provisions that support renewable energy (both renewables and renewable fuels) is projected to decline from $13.4 billion to $5.0 billion (see Figure 3 ). The majority of the $5.0 billion cost in 2018 is associated with the PTC for wind, which expired at the end of 2014. Thus, in 2018, these incentives will no longer be available for new investments in renewable electricity. Of the $5.0 billion projected cost for renewable electricity provisions in 2018, $4.0 billion is from expired incentives while $1.0 billion is from incentives available for new projects in 2018. Extension of certain tax incentives for renewable energy, such as the production tax credit, would change this analysis.", "For fossil fuels, the cost of energy-related tax provisions was roughly $5.2 billion in 2013 (see Figure 3 ). This cost is projected to be $4.8 billion in 2018. Most of the tax incentives that support fossil fuels are permanent features of the tax code, and thus are not scheduled to expire.

In this work, the EIA defines subsidies to include spending and tax expenditure provisions. On the spending side, the EIA includes direct expenditures that result in payments to energy producers or consumers as well as energy-related federal research and development (R&D) funding. The EIA analysis also includes certain energy-related federal loan guarantees and federal electricity support programs in their tabulation of federal energy subsidies. On the tax side, the EIA study includes tax expenditures.

First, the EIA defines electricity production that is supported by federal subsidies. Next, the analysis examines all energy subsidies, categorizing these subsidies into those that support electricity production and those that support other uses of energy. The analysis then allocates electricity-related energy subsidies by fuel type.

Between 2010 and 2013, the estimated share of federal financial support decreased substantially. The share of federal financial assistance for electricity going to nuclear decreased from 21.0% to 10.0% between 2010 and 2013.

By 2010, the share of energy-related tax incentives attributable to renewables had declined to 68.1% (see Table A-2 ). The primary reason for this decline is that in 2009, \"black liquor\" qualified for fuels-related tax incentives. Thus, the tax expenditure estimate for tax credits for alcohol fuels was substantially higher in 2009 ($6.5 billion) than in 2010 ($0.1 billion). Annual changes in the estimated cost of energy-related tax incentives can result in substantial year-to-year changes in the proportion of energy-related tax incentives attributable to various energy resources.

However, the difference is small. JCT estimates that in 2010, the tax expenditures for qualified hydropower under the PTC are less than $50 million. During 2010, two awards totaling $88,000 were paid to hydropower facilities under the Section 1603 grant program. Hydropower has also received less in CREB financing than was awarded to solar and wind technologies.

Assume next that a project must have a real before-tax rate of return of 9% to cover taxes, depreciation, and payments to investors. Under these conditions, the effective tax rate would be 33%. Negative effective tax rates indicate that the tax code is actually subsidizing investment to the point where taxpayers are willing to accept a before-tax rate of return that is less than the after-tax rate of return for an investment. ", "Effective tax rates provide a single measure for the impact of the tax system on capital investments. Thus, there are many provisions in the tax code that can affect effective tax rates. In the energy sector, depreciation rules, investment and production tax incentives, and tax rules specific to the oil and gas sector are all important in the calculation of effective tax rates. ", "Effective Tax Rates for Energy-Related Capital Investments", "Effective tax rates in the energy sector suggest that the tax code provides greater incentives for certain types of energy-related capital investments. In 2007, the tax code created the largest incentive for capital investment in solar thermal energy generation facilities. In 2007, solar benefitted from a 30% investment tax credit as well as five-year accelerated depreciation. The 2007 effective tax rate for capital investments in solar thermal was estimated at -244.7% (see Table B-1 ). Wind, which benefitted from the production tax credit (PTC) as well as five-year accelerated depreciation, was estimated to face an effective tax rate of -163.8%. These effective tax rates suggest that the tax code creates strong incentives for direct capital investment in wind and solar energy resources. Overall, the effective tax rates for renewables and nuclear are substantially lower than the effective tax rates for coal and gas. Empirical evidence suggests that energy-related investments may in fact be influenced by tax incentives. Metcalf (2010) finds that investment in wind capacity is \"strongly influenced by tax policy.\" ", "Provisions in the tax code may distort investment decisions for other types of energy resources. The effective tax rate for capital investment in nuclear electric generation (-99.5%) also provides strong investment incentives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58 ) introduced a production tax credit for new commercial nuclear reactors. Despite these incentives, new nuclear facilities have been slow to develop.", "Various tax incentives available to the oil and gas industry also influence effective tax rates on oil and gas investment. Effective tax rates on investments made by non-integrated oil and gas firms are lower than for integrated firms. The primary reason for this difference is that non-integrated producers are able to fully expense intangible drilling costs (IDCs) and are able to take advantage of percentage depletion. Integrated producers can only expense 70% of IDCs and must claim cost rather than percentage depletion."], "subsections": []}]}}
