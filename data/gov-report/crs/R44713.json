U.S.-AU cooperation has traditionally focused on peace operations and conflict prevention and mitigation. U.S. aid for AU democracy-strengthening initiatives is another key focus of engagement. Other areas of cooperation include economic development, health, governance, peace and security capacity building, and criminal justice. Direct U.S. aid to the AU Commission (AUC, the organization's secretariat), which oversees AU program activity, is moderate; most U.S. aid in support of AU goals is provided on a bilateral basis or sub-regional basis. Consequently, such aid may not always be accounted for in analyses of U.S. support for the AU.", "President George W. Bush formally recognized the AU as an international organization in 2005, and a U.S. mission to the AU was established in 2006, making the United States the first non-African country to have an accredited diplomatic mission to the AU. In 2007, the first AU ambassador to the United States was accredited. In 2010, an agreement on U.S. aid for the AU was signed and in 2013, the AU and the United States established annual partnership dialogues and extended the 2010 aid agreement. Later in 2013, President Obama met with the AUC Chairperson, marking the first exchange between an AUC chair and a U.S. president. In 2015, President Obama addressed the African Union at its headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, becoming the first U.S. president to do so. How the Trump Administration and the 115th Congress may view and potentially engage with the AU has yet to be determined.", "The AU was established in 2002 as the successor to the now-defunct Organization of African Unity (OAU). The aim of the AU is to promote continental economic integration and socioeconomic development through shared political and economic institutions and the planned creation of a common African market. Other key AU goals include greater political and economic unity, peace and security, and stability within Africa; advocacy of common African positions in international forums; strengthened democratic governance and rule of law; respect for human rights; and gender equality and social justice, among others. The current AUC chair is Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa. Her priorities have centered on conflict resolution, support for transitional aid in post-conflict countries, AU monitoring of African elections, and efforts to boost economic growth and increase AU finance resources, among other goals.", "In July 2016, Dlamini-Zuma's tenure was extended until January 2017 after the AU Assembly (comprising heads of state and government) failed to agree on a successor. The Assembly also decided in July 2016 to impose a 0.2% levy on imports into Africa to fund AU programs and AU-led peacekeeping missions, to facilitate the intra-regional movement of persons through the expanded use of AU passports, and to speed the creation of a Continental Free Trade Area. It also addressed several country-level crises. Key AU challenges include organizational, technical, and skilled personnel capacity gaps and limited financial resources. Political tensions among member states, uneven commitment to AU goals and mandates across the region, and sovereignty concerns have also inhibited AU effectiveness.", "The AU's top decisionmaking organ is an Assembly of heads of state and government. Its decisions are overseen by an Executive Council, made up of AU members' foreign affairs ministers. Other notable AU institutions include the Peace and Security Council (PSC), which manages the AU's efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts, and the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) Planning and Coordinating Agency, which manages economic programs and projects.

U.S. support for the U.N. Security Council-authorized AU Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) and its troop contributors since 2007, for instance, stands at nearly $2 billion. U.S. support to the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS), a 2004-2007 AU peacekeeping operation in Sudan's western Darfur region, totaled roughly $472 million.

It is taking steps, however, to increase the proportion of funding its member states contribute, including through a new initiative to impose a small levy on imports into these states. If successful, such efforts may shape the future relationship between the AU and donors such as the United States.", "Congressional engagement with AU institutions has historically been relatively limited, although it has gradually increased as U.S.-AU relations have gained a higher profile, and as U.S. funding of AU peacekeeping and military intervention missions has also increased. Congressional appropriation and oversight activity has regularly focused on such aid. In recent years, some Members of Congress have met with AU leaders or traveled to AU headquarters to discuss with AU leaders common concerns and interests regarding the region. Still, little substantive recent legislation or congressional oversight activity has focused specifically on the AU.", "There is arguably considerable potential for expanded U.S.-AU ties and cooperation\u2014and for expanded congressional engagement with the organization\u2014given the AU's diverse program and policy activity, the limited extent of U.S.-AU development cooperation compared to some other AU development partners (e.g., the European Union), and a dovetailing of some U.S.-AU policy goals and interests. Current and prospective areas of cooperation include such issues as peace and security; trade and investment; and socioeconomic and infrastructure development; and science and technology cooperation.

Actions that interested U.S. policymakers might seek to counter through engagement with AU institutions include efforts by some African governments to ", "withdraw from the International Criminal Court or limit the scope of its efforts to achieve judicial accountability for human rights abuses in Africa; ensure U.S. financial support for AU military operations while limiting U.S. input into such missions' operational goals and conduct; subvert democratic processes and related constitutional measures at the national level; and limit the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons.", "Other Members may wish to more closely tie any U.S. aid to the AU to its pursuit of programs that comport with U.S. objectives, given that many in Congress may be leery of providing aid to multilateral institutions absent the ability of the United States to strongly influence decisionmaking by such institutions. In addition, given that the AU is an arguably bureaucratically cumbersome and technically weak entity, and presents a potentially politically challenging venue through which to pursue U.S. interests, some in Congress may prefer to approach relations with Africa primarily through a bilateral lens, and generally minimize U.S.-AU engagement. Such a strategy, however, risks reducing the ability of the United States to bargain with the region as a whole on such issues as climate change, trade, and action on other global issues in multilateral forums."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The African Union is an intergovernmental grouping that includes as members all countries in Africa except Morocco.

OAU members formed it to achieve the goals of the 1991 African Economic Community (AEC) Treaty more quickly. That treaty, which remains in effect, and the AU Constitutive Act, the founding charter of the AU, are intended to promote African regional economic integration and socioeconomic development through the phased creation of a common African market and shared political and economic institutions.", "Other key objectives identified in the act include greater political and economic unity, peace and security, and stability within Africa; advocacy of common African positions in international forums; strengthening of democratic governance and the rule of law; respect for human rights; and greater regional self-reliance, gender equality, and social justice. The act identifies \"noninterference\" by member states in their peers' internal affairs as a key AU principle, but unlike the OAU charter, it recognizes exceptions and grants the AU the right to intervene in member states' affairs in \"grave\" situations (e.g., to prevent crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide). It also allows states to request AU intervention to restore peace and security, and calls for the AU to reject unconstitutional changes of government, as well as \"impunity and political assassination, [... and] terrorism. ", "The creation of the AU was, in part, spurred by criticisms that the OAU's long-standing doctrine of noninterference in member states' internal affairs had often caused it to prioritize member state sovereignty over other principles in its charter, such as respect for human rights. The AU has proven more willing than the OAU to condemn unconstitutional changes in government, to suspend member states whose governments come to power through such means, and\u2014in some cases\u2014to investigate human rights abuses by member states. In many such cases, however, the AU has remained inactive, which has sparked some criticism. The AU's policy of providing immunity from arrest during AU forums to heads of state facing International Criminal Court (ICC) criminal prosecution has also drawn criticism from advocacy groups, as has its opposition to ICC actions against two sitting African heads of state and other high officials.

Key Agenda 2063 goals include the following:", "enhancements in standards of living and citizen well-being, especially in the areas of education and skills, health, habitats (e.g., urban services), gender equality, and youth empowerment; economic transformation and job growth, notably through agricultural investment and development and underpinned by infrastructure improvements, environmental sustainability, and climate resilience; increased political and economic regional integration based on the ideals of Pan Africanism (regional political and economic self-determination and solidarity) and greater African agency in global affairs; improved governance, deepening of democratic values, and \"entrenched\" respect for human rights, justice, and the rule of law; institutional and leadership capacity development; and regional peace and security.", "Agenda 2063 also discusses the trends and opportunities that underpin these goals, drivers and enablers of progress toward meeting them, and strategies for mitigating challenges. Planned programs for achieving these goals are diverse, but center on enhancing performance monitoring and evaluation, marshaling funding for the AU, and improving communications at all levels.

While the post is largely ceremonial and rotates annually, it offers a high-profile policy advocacy platform.", "One key challenge for Dlamini-Zuma and the broader AUC leadership has been to oversee AU efforts to resolve Africa's multiple conflicts, in concert with international agencies and donors. Simultaneously, the AUC must maintain high-level African and global attention on efforts to bolster diversified economic growth and broad-based socioeconomic development. While growth had been strong in much of the region over the last decade, generally weak commodity prices and demand in recent years have slowed growth in the many African countries that depend on exports of one or two raw commodities. Another AU goal is to secure adequate external and AU member funding for AU activities. Dlamini-Zuma has cited dependence on donor funds as a major AU concern. Donor funding is the source of almost all AU programmatic financing, with the balance coming from AU member assessments, which are often in arrears. Dlamini-Zuma has also prioritized efforts to streamline the AU Commission and make it more effective.", "Other stated Dlamini-Zuma priorities have included crisis resolution in multiple countries, reconstruction and transitional aid in post-conflict countries, and continued AU monitoring of African elections.

Dlamini-Zuma has also pushed, with limited success, to ensure that the sale of Africa's rich natural resources, especially minerals, produces broad-based economic benefits. She has also sought to increase gender equity, access to social services, and jobs; enhance AU institutional, technical and other capacities; promote ties with key external partners; and advance and defend shared African political and economic positions and interests in global contexts.

Armed conflict is also a source of large refugee flows in parts of Africa. ", "The AU takes several approaches toward strengthening peace and security. Some are broadly preventive: fostering support for inclusive development, accountable and transparent governance, democracy, and human rights. Others are more focused on conflict prevention or mitigation in particular cases through the various entities and processes that make up the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), a broad framework that encompasses diverse policies and institutional development efforts relating to peace, security, and stability in Africa.

It is, for example, currently seeking to resolve differences between Sudan and South Sudan, among parties to Sudan's internal conflicts, and between the parties to South Sudan's civil war, in concert with other regional organizations and actors. It is also supporting an EAC-led mediation effort to resolve Burundi's political crisis and an IGAD-led mediation for South Sudan. The AU has also repeatedly intervened militarily to address crises in Africa, usually on a first-response basis and often prior to deployments of larger U.N. missions.", "The most notable and long-standing AU intervention has been the U.N.

Benin, a non-LCBC country, is also contributing to the force. The MNJTF's mandate is to combat Boko Haram, a regional terrorist group of Nigerian origin that is active in the four LCBC countries. The United States provides substantial support to MNJTF member state militaries, and helped fund the creation of an MNJTF headquarters in N'Djamena, Chad.

Development of the ASF brigades has been slow, but all of the five ASF forces have made progress. The State Department's Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) provides capacity building aid to individual ASF contributing countries, and the United States has provided some ASF-related support to the AU.

In the interim, pending full ASF operational capacity, and in response to challenges faced by ECOWAS in marshaling troops for the African-led International Support Mission in Mali (AFISMA) in 2013, the AU Assembly established the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC; see text box)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice Issues", "paragraphs": ["The AU Constitutive Act prioritizes the promotion and protection of \"human and peoples' rights,\" in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.

It also requires member states to recognize and take \"measures to give effect\" to these provisions. The Charter is a potentially important vehicle for the administration of justice in a continent, where the rule of law is often weak, human rights abuses occur regularly in some countries, and a number of alleged cases of large-scale war crimes, crimes against humanity, and violations of international humanitarian law have occurred in recent years. Attempted enforcement of these provisions has nonetheless been the exception rather than the rule, and human rights conditions have not often been a diplomatic focus of AU institutions. ", "To help enforce the Charter and build a human rights protection system in Africa, the AU established the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (AfCHPR) headquartered in Tanzania, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) in The Gambia, and an AU Commission on International Law (AUCIL) in Ethiopia. The AfCHPR is charged with defending human rights throughout Africa, and has jurisdiction to hear cases and disputes regarding the interpretation and application of the Charter and related AU human rights instruments, as well as to issue advisory opinions relating to their application. The AUCIL helps codify and institutionalize international law in Africa, interpret the application of human rights instruments, and draft international treaties, and carries out legal research and legal capacity-building advocacy in the region. Activists, however, have questioned the effectiveness of these institutions, and several AU member states have either resisted the institutions' jurisdiction or declined to implement their decisions. ", "In addition to continent-wide justice mechanisms, the AU has periodically established special purpose commissions of inquiry, such as one formed in 2014 to probe human rights abuses in the South Sudanese civil conflict. One successful ad-hoc institution was an AU-Senegalese hybrid court that was inaugurated in Senegal to try former Chadian dictator Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 after the AU opposed Belgian efforts to extradite him; in 2016, the court convicted Habr\u00e9 of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to life in prison. Under a 2015 peace deal for South Sudan, the AU is also charged with establishing an independent hybrid court to try war crimes and other serious offenses committed during the conflict, although its prospects are unclear.

Some of its cases have dealt with matters involving AU entities, such as employment cases involving AU bodies and member states and an unsuccessful AfCHPR suit against the Libyan state alleging massive human rights violations. Most of its cases, however, have involved appeals by individuals alleging various violations of the Charter or other instruments by AU member state courts or other authorities, often in labor cases. The Court's deliberations and decisions have often focused on procedural issues, including decisions on admissibility. The court has made relatively few, if any, major international legal precedent-setting rulings that could change the legal landscape at the continental level. Its willingness to consider issues regarding the adequacy of national legal and institutional processes, however, makes the court a potential check on national judicial systems and as well as a mechanism for addressing alleged human rights violations by governments. This is significant, given that national systems are reportedly institutionally weak, politicized, or blemished by corruption in a number of African countries. Still, while the protocol establishing the court requires signatories to comply with its judgments, the manner and extent to which states may do so\u2014or to which the court may seek to enforce its decisions\u2014is largely yet to be determined.", "Prospects for the court may also be influenced by prospective changes in its makeup. In 2008, the AU Assembly decided to merge the AfCHPR with the Court of Justice, a body authorized by the AU Constitutive Act but not established. The resulting African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR) is to take over the mandates of the AfCHPR and would have jurisdiction over essentially all juridical matters and dispute resolution relating to AU decisions and to legal relations between member states. In addition, as a result of a 2014 AU Assembly decision amending the court's statute, the new court would also have jurisdiction in Africa over crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and certain other crimes. The new court may not be established for some time, however. For the 2008 and 2014 protocols to enter into force, 15 AU member states must ratify and deposit them; as of early 2016, when the most recent ratification update was issued, this threshold had not been met. ", "The amended 2014 statute defining the court's role is controversial because it does not define the relationship between the planned court and the ICC, and arguably represents a rejection of the ICC and its mandate to try genocide and other serious international crimes, for which the planned AU court is given jurisdiction. Moreover, the protocol\u2014unlike the Rome Statute creating the ICC, which many African states ratified\u2014would protect AU heads of state and certain other senior state officials from prosecution before the court during their tenure in office. This provision appears to relate to concerns by some African leaders over the ICC's attempted prosecution of sitting national leaders and seeming prioritization of cases in Africa (see text box). Criticism of the ICC has not been universal, however. Botswana, for instance, has strongly supported the ICC's work and approach in Africa.", "In 2013, mirroring a number of prior statements, the AU Assembly issued a decision on Africa's relationship with the ICC.

It also requested the suspension of ICC cases against Kenya's president and vice president pending their exit from office, as well as a deferral of the Kenyan and Bashir cases, pending a dialogue with the U.N. Security Council on the AU's ICC concerns. The Assembly also decided to push for reforms of the ICC's Rome Statute to address these concerns and to fast-track the expansion of the AfCHPR mandate to include genocide and related high crimes, among other actions. The Assembly has reiterated its demands and criticized the ICC several times since 2013, but has gained little traction on its proposed reforms.", "These actions have drawn sharp criticism from human rights groups and some analysts who see them as prioritizing leaders' political positions and power at the expense of accountability for serious violations of human rights. Often missing from deliberations over the AU's relationship with the ICC and the debate over African agency and/or AU institutional efforts to address genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes has been the role of other, ad-hoc international courts. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR); hybrid courts of mixed jurisdiction, such as the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL); and possibly national courts, such as the planned Special Criminal Court (SCC) for CAR, which is to be established with international support to complement the ICC in addressing major human rights crimes in that country.

Regional integration could have significant implications for potential increases in U.S. trade with and investment in Africa, since major disincentives for U.S. investors are the small size of many national markets; highly variable business rules and investment climates among countries; disparate treatment of investment and profit repatriation among countries; and large variances in tariffs and relative ease of undertaking cross-border trade among countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial and Technical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["While criticisms of the AU's effectiveness are common, some observers have noted that the AU's institutional development and pursuit of regional political unification have been relatively rapid, despite a lack of financial wherewithal and the presence of obstacles comparable to those facing similar efforts in richer regions of the world. Nonetheless, the challenges facing the AU are profound. Securing the financial resources to strengthen the AU's institutional, technical, and staff capacities is one key obstacle. In recent years, while member states have funded all or nearly all of the AUC's organizational operational budget (e.g., headquarters staff costs), with a handful of member states funding the bulk of such costs, roughly 95% of the AU program budget has been funded by external donors. The demise of the Qadhafi regime in Libya, which had provided large amounts of funding for the AU, exacerbated such trends. The AU has had to reduce its budget several times in recent years after receiving insufficient donor commitments to fund its initial plans.", "A number of efforts, often backed by foreign donors, seek to enhance AU technical, oversight, monitoring and evaluation, and fiscal management capacities, and the AU is taking steps to fund its activities from the resources of member states and gradually reduce its reliance on external funding. In June 2015, the AU Assembly adopted a new scale of assessment targeted, in part, at having AU member states fund 100% of the AU operational budget, 75% of the program budget, and 25% of the peace support operations budget. Under the decision, these targets are to be phased in over five years starting in January 2016. In a meeting in July 2016, the AU Assembly took an additional step toward attaining these goals when it instituted a 0.2% levy on imports into the continent, to be imposed over several years at the REC level.
