It is cost- and time-prohibitive to recreate all economic events. Some line items on financial statements involve subjective decisions or a degree of uncertainty as a result of using estimates. Audit procedures cannot eliminate potential fraud, though an auditor may identify fraud. Financial audits are not specifically designed to detect fraud, but an auditor assesses the potential for fraud, including evaluating internal controls designed by management to prevent and identify potential fraud, waste, and abuse. Auditors are required to consider whether financial statements could be misstated as a result of fraud. Effective internal controls could prevent or mitigate risks for fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, bribery, and other illegal acts. Fraud risk factors do not necessarily indicate fraud exists, but risk factors often exist when fraud occurs. In a few years, if DOD has improved its current business practices, future improvements might be less significant and more incremental. Even so, annual audits could potentially be a valuable tool to help DOD continue to improve its business processes. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of an Annual Financial Audit", "paragraphs": ["The annual audit gives Congress an independent opinion on DOD's financial systems and business processes. It provides a way for DOD to continue to improve its performance and highlights areas that need to be fixed. DOD has identified four categories of how the annual audit improves its operations, along with some examples: ", "Increases Transparency and Accountability. Holds DOD accountable to Congress and the taxpayers that DOD takes spending taxpayer dollars seriously through efficient practices. Auditing DOD helps improve public confidence in DOD operations, similar to other Cabinet-level agencies that conduct an annual financial audit. Streamlines Business Processes. Audits help reduce component silos and help leadership better understand interdependencies within DOD. The department might be able to improve its buying power and reduce costs, as well as improve operational efficiencies. Improves Visibility of Assets and Financial Resources. More accurate data could enhance DOD readiness and decisionmaking. Getting the appropriate supplies to warfighters helps improve their fighting posture. If a service does not know whether it has enough spare parts to ensure that aircraft are able to fly, it may spend significant amounts of money to get spare parts quickly to meet operational requirements. Accurate cost information related to assets, such as inventory and property, can help DOD make more informed decisions on repair costs and future purchases. Strengthens Internal Controls. Strengthened internal controls help minimize fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, they help improve DOD's cybersecurity and enhance national security. ", "In addition to the previously described identification of Blackhawk helicopters and parts, DOD is starting to see gains by eliminating recurring annual costs. For example, strengthening internal controls to improve operations at the U.S. Pacific Fleet has freed up purchasing power to fund $4.4 million in additional ship repair costs. Also, the Army has implemented a materiality-based physical inventory best practice to count assets at Army depots. The Army estimates this process improvement could help avoid approximately $10 million in future costs."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Since passing the CFO Act of 1990, which required 24 agencies to conduct an agency-wide annual financial audit, Congress has continued to express interest in DOD completing an annual audit. DOD completed its first agency-wide audit in FY2018 and a subsequent audit in FY2019. Both audits resulted in a disclaimer of o pinion . ", "The ongoing independent assessment of DOD's financial systems, arguably, provides Congress and DOD leadership with an independent third-party assessment of DOD's financial and business operations. Reliable systems that produce auditable financial information, including an accurate count and valuation of real estate and inventory, could help Congress provide better oversight and ultimately determine how funds appropriated for DOD should be spent in support of the NDS. ", "Further, the annual financial audit of DOD by independent auditors might provide DOD with a competitive advantage when compared to other countries' defense agencies. In many other countries, financial information\u00e2\u0080\u0094including a financial audit of defense agencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094is nonexistent or opaque at best and not readily available to legislators or citizens. ", "Many of DOD's financial management systems are also used for operational purposes. Testing of the financial management systems and other systems that interface with each other as part of the annual audit process can help identify and improve cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the conduct of military operations. DOD's efforts to fix its vulnerabilities and reduce wasteful practices, arguably, could enable it to respond to future threats more effectively.", "The implementation of new ERP systems and the complexity of auditing DOD might result in DOD not achieving a clean audit opinion within the next decade. Without each of the Armed Forces receiving a clean audit opinion, DOD will not be able to receive an agency-wide clean audit opinion even if all other DOD components receive a clean audit opinion. ", "Appendix A. DOD Agency-Wide Material Weaknesses", "Weaknesses and inefficiencies in internal controls are classified based on severity. Auditors identified 20 material weaknesses at DOD (see Table A-1 ) related to internal controls that range from issues with financial management systems to inventory management.", "A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that management will not prevent, or detect and correct, a material misstatement in the financial statements in a timely manner.", "In addition to material weaknesses, the auditors issue two types of deficiencies\u00e2\u0080\u0094a significant deficiency or a control deficiency \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that are less severe than a material weakness, but a combination or multiple instances of either deficiency can result in material weaknesses. ", "A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies that are less severe than a material weakness, but important enough to merit management's attention. A control deficiency is a noted weakness or deficiency that auditors typically bring to management's attention, but that does not have an impact on the financial statement unless a combination of them results in a material weakness. Improvements in either type of deficiency could improve the business process and help prevent waste, abuse, and fraud.", "Appendix B. Common Service Providers", "Some organizations within DOD provide common information technology services to other organizations at DOD. These organizations report to higher-level organizations. For FY2018, auditors completed 20 DOD service provider examinations\u00e2\u0080\u009414 resulted in unmodified opinions and 6 resulted in qualified opinions. See Table B-1 for more information, including auditors' opinions and the number of FY2018 NFRs issued. Service provider examinations provide a positive assurance as to whether information technology control activities were designed, implemented, and operate effectively to provide management reasonable assurance that control objectives function as designed or intended in all material respects. Examination procedures are limited in scope as compared to a financial audit. Component-level auditors can use these examinations' results to reduce redundant testing, saving time and money; see Table 1 for the list of audited DOD components. For FY2019, DOD expects to complete 23 common service provider examinations."], "subsections": []}]}}
