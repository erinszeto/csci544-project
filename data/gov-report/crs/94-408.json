The measure set certain minimum labor standards for workers employed in federal contract construction: notably, that contractors must pay their employees not less than the locally prevailing wage. The threshold for coverage is currently $2,000 and up. Construction crafts are divided into four components: commercial buildings, highways, residential, and heavy construction. Locality, in this case, is normally the equivalent of a county, though other options are possible. In addition, the Copeland \"anti-kickback\" Act of 1934 sets reporting requirements intended to aid in Davis-Bacon enforcement and compliance. Through the years, the Davis-Bacon requirements have been applied to dozens of program statutes that involve federal and federally assisted construction.", "Davis-Bacon has been amended over the years to expand its coverage and to strengthen enforcement. It has generally enjoyed strong bipartisan support throughout its history; but, the act has also sparked continuing controversy and opposition, especially from non-union contractors. Issues of policy concerning the act, raised initially in the 1920s and 1930s, continue to be debated into the 21st century. Seventy-five years after its enactment, questions remain about its economic impact, its scope and pattern of coverage, and its administration. Since the early 1950s, the act has been variously the focus of rulemaking, litigation, and legislative interest and, through the past quarter century, of all three.", "In 1934 and in 1971, the act was generally (but temporarily) suspended by Presidents Roosevelt and Nixon. From October 1992 until March 1993, it was suspended by President George H.W. Bush, but only for locations affected by Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. From September into November 2005, it was suspended by President George W. Bush for areas affected by Hurricane Katrina.", "Into the early 1990s, bills were introduced that would have repealed the Davis-Bacon and Copeland Acts outright, had they been adopted, eliminating the prevailing wage and reporting requirements from program statutes into which they have been incorporated. In the mid-1990s, a shift in political control in Congress seemed to forecast victory for those favoring repeal. But ultimately, the prevailing wage issue proved to be bipartisan and the statutes (Davis-Bacon and Copeland) remained unchanged. Prevailing wage/Davis-Bacon provisions have continued to be included in federal program statutes where construction has been a program component.", "With the advent of the 21st century, the Davis-Bacon debate has continued sporadically, but its focus, increasingly, has been upon the prevailing wage standards of program legislation. Given the experience of the past seven decades, it seems likely that Davis-Bacon will remain an issue of public policy for the immediate future."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Davis-Bacon Act was adopted in early 1931. It was amended during the middle 1930s and, then, quietly became a part of federal contract practice. During the middle 1950s, however, it gained more visibility as the Davis-Bacon \"prevailing wage principle\" was added to various federal program statutes. For more than 4 decades now, and continuing into the 21 st century, Davis-Bacon has been almost constantly a focus of public policy concern: as legislation, through administrative rulemaking, and in litigation before the courts.", "As amended, the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 requires, among other things, that construction contracts entered into by the federal government specify minimum wages to be paid to the various classes of laborers employed under those contracts. Minimum wages are defined as those determined by the Secretary of Labor (a) to be prevailing (b) in the locality of the project (c) for similar crafts and skills (d) on comparable construction work. The concept of wage was expanded in 1964 to include a fringe benefit component. The act has a coverage threshold of $2,000.", "In addition to direct federal construction contracts, the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage \"principle\" has been written into more than 50 federal program statutes. The act is supplemented by the 1934 Copeland \"anti-kickback\" Act (which requires weekly reporting of wages actually paid and an affirmation from employers that any deductions from wages due to employees have been proper) and by federal overtime pay and health and safety standards statutes. Further, some states have enacted \"little Davis-Bacon\" acts within their respective jurisdictions.", "The rhetoric, for and against the act, has changed little through the years. Does the act protect workers, help stabilize the construction industry, and serve the federal contracting community? Or, is it anti-competitive, preventing flexible workforce utilization? Has it been administered effectively and, if not, can it be administered in an equitable fashion? Is there sufficient objective information concerning the act to allow for fair assessment of the statute and its impact?", "This report examines policy issues the act has sparked through the years and which remain a part of the Davis-Bacon debate into the 21 st century. These include such questions as: wage rate determination procedures, reporting requirements under the Copeland Act, an appropriate threshold for activation of the statute, interagency relationships with respect to Davis-Bacon enforcement and compliance activity, administrative or judicial appeals procedures, the use of \"helpers\" and other low-skilled workers on covered projects, and the right of a President to suspend the statute as well as the conditions under which such a suspension may occur. That the fundamental premise of the act remains in contention after 75 years may be, itself, part of the public policy debate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Controversy Concerning the Davis-Bacon Act", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the act has enjoyed strong bipartisan support; but, at the same time, especially since the middle 1950s, it has provoked militant criticism. Federal agencies have disagreed, publicly, concerning the usefulness and administration of the act. It has been subjected to judicial review and interpretation, each new application becoming, in turn, a matter for further examination.", "Although the Department of Labor (DOL) has made certain changes in the act's administration, the statute itself has remained largely unchanged since 1935. Through the years, however, Congress has extended the act's provisions to cover an ever wider segment of federal and federally assisted construction; and, at least during the past several decades, such extensions of coverage have provided an opportunity for renewed debate concerning the act and its impact."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "On the One Hand", "paragraphs": ["Critics of the act argue, even were the statute justified in 1931, that it has now been rendered obsolete through market changes and enactment of other federal labor standards laws\u2014notably, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Further, they argue that the act is inflationary, adding to the cost of public construction and, thereby, potentially reducing the volume of construction and the number of federal construction jobs. Finally, they suggest that it is anti-competitive, discriminates against smaller firms, and is difficult to administer. Repeal or significant modification of the act, they note, would reduce the paperwork burden of doing business with the federal government and would allow contractors more flexibility in manpower utilization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On the Other Hand", "paragraphs": ["The act's defenders hold that Davis-Bacon is as important now as it was in the 1930s. It prevents, they assert, competition from \"fly-by-night\" firms that undercut local wages and working conditions and compete, unfairly, with local contractors for federal work. It helps stabilize the industry, an advantage, they suggest, to workers and to employers. In addition, Davis-Bacon may assure the consuming agency of better craftsmanship (if, when firms are required to pay not less than the locally prevailing wage, they tend to employ more highly skilled workers); and, supporters of the act add, it may reduce both the initial cost of federal construction through greater efficiency and decrease the need for repair and/or rehabilitation. At the same time, they point out, it deters contractors from fragmenting work and utilizing low-skill/low-wage \"pick-up\" crews and \"helpers\" and promotes skill transfer through formal apprenticeship programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Davis-Bacon Literature", "paragraphs": ["The Davis-Bacon literature is extensive and diverse.

In some cases, there has been a merger of scholarship with journalism.", "Through the years since the prevailing wage legislation was first considered at the federal level, there have been numerous congressional hearings that have reviewed the statute. However, these seem, often, to have focused broadly upon policy concerns rather than upon specific economic impact and its assessment.", "As the Davis-Bacon debate has evolved, arguments have progressed through several levels of affirmation and rebuttal, most of which, pro and con, are subject to further oft-repeated counter arguments. At large, there appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge of the act, its administration and impact.

Indeed, it emerged during a time of relative prosperity in the construction industry. The building industry, observed William Tracy of the Building Trades Department, AFL, was \"enjoying the greatest prosperity in its history\u2014with wages and hours of labor and improved working conditions better than ever before.\" But, it appears also to have been a period of turbulence and intense competition within the contracting community.", "During hearings before the House Committee on Labor in February 1927, Representative Robert L. Bacon (R-N.Y.) echoed Tracy's views. In New York, he noted, \"wages are fair and there has been no difficulty in the building trades between employee and employer ... for some time.\" Bacon wanted to keep it that way: in 1927, he introduced legislation to require that locally prevailing wage standards be met in federal construction work.", "Problems, however, had emerged with respect to construction of a federal hospital in Bacon's New York district. Local contractors, he explained, had submitted bids on the project that reflected local standards. But the contract was awarded to an Alabama firm. The latter, Bacon noted, \"... brought some thousand non-union laborers from Alabama into Long Island, N.Y.; ... They were herded onto this job, they were housed in shacks, they were paid a very low wage and the work proceeded.\" In Bacon's view, the least government could do, when contracting, was \"to comply with the local standards of wages and labor prevailing in the locality where the building construction is to take place.\" His measure did not seek to inflate wages artificially but, rather, to assure that government respected the existing local standard. The bill was not adopted.", "Similar legislation was introduced in 1928 and, this time, Bacon won strong support from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). In a note to Labor Secretary James J. Davis, Commissioner of Labor Statistics Ethelbert Stewart pointed out: \"The essence of the thing as I see it is: Is the Government willing for the sake of the lowest bidder to break down all labor standards and have its work done by the cheapest labor that can be secured and shipped from State to State?\" Steward expressed his full support for the Bacon bill, as did Davis. Indeed, to this point, the hearings had brought forth a body of testimony generally supportive of the prevailing wage concept, if not always of the specific provisions of the several differing proposals. But, once again, the proposal died when Congress adjourned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Enactment Emerges, 1931", "paragraphs": ["Late in 1930, after nearly a decade as Secretary of Labor (through the Administrations of Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover), Davis moved on to become a United States Senator.

Representative Bacon offered a companion bill.", "The language of the Davis-Bacon proposals had been worked out by a committee \"representing all of the departments\" of the Hoover Administration and \"unanimously agreed on.\" William N. Doak, Davis's successor as Labor Secretary in the Hoover cabinet, testifying in support of the Davis-Bacon legislation, noted that current contracting practices were \"not only disturbing to labor but disturbing to the business community as well.\" When the legislation was taken up in the Senate, Senator Robert LaFollette (Progressive Republican-Wisc.), chairman of the Committee on Manufactures, urged that the measure \"be speedily enacted.\"", "The report, submitted for the Committee by Senator Davis, stated that the \"measure does not require the Government to establish any new wage scales in any portion of the country.\" Instead, the report pointed out, \"[i]t merely gives the Government the power to require its contractors to pay their employees the prevailing wage scales in the vicinity of the building projects. This is only fair and just,\" it noted, \"to the employees, the contractors, and the Government alike.\" A similar report was filed by Representative Richard J. Welch (R-Calif.) for the House Committee on Labor.", "Neither report recorded dissent; but, when the measure was considered in the House, reservations were voiced. Representative Thomas L. Blanton (D-Texas), noted that the measure was \"the most ridiculous proposition I have ever seen brought before a legislative body.\" Observing that the bill imposed a wage floor (that not less than the locally prevailing wage be paid), Blanton objected that workers and contractors ought to be free to bargain for as high or low a wage as they might choose. \"You are taking away from American citizens, contractors, and laborers alike the sacred, inherent right of contract\u2014the right to make their own contracts for themselves,\" the Texan observed. \"We are thus proposing by this pernicious bill to interfere with a sacred, inalienable right that has given initiative and independence to men for ages past.\"", "In addition, Representative Blanton placed in the Record a letter from Comptroller General J. R. McCarl who raised questions of a different sort. Since the specific determination of prevailing wage rates was to be made after bids had been submitted, McCarl argued that none of the parties to the agreement \"could know at the time of contracting the prevailing rate of wages which the contractors must pay during the progress of the work.\" A. P. Greensfelder, President of the Associated General Contractors of America, seemed to concur in McCarl's judgment. He emphasized the uncertainty that would result, though agreeing, in principle, that contractors should pay not less than the locally prevailing wage rate.", "At the same time, Representative Anning Prall (D-N.Y.) suggested that the enforcement provisions of the legislation were insufficiently strong. But, he supported the bill and observed: \"If we find unscrupulous contractors attempting to beat the law, we can quickly amend it by putting teeth in it.\"", "In the end, the act was adopted without a roll call and, on March 3, 1931, signed into law by President Hoover."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Modifying the Davis-Bacon Act, 1931-1961", "paragraphs": ["Dissatisfaction with the act was soon rife, both with labor and contractors. The initial enactment had been a brief and relatively simple statement of policy. Armand Thieblot, who has written extensively about the act, suggests that it \"lacked effective mechanisms for either policing or enforcing\" its requirements, and that \"no provisions were made for informing laborers of the protections afforded them\" under the new statute. Trade unionists were concerned that the scope of the act might leave too many workers unprotected. The threshold had initially been set at $5,000, sparking labor's fear that contracts might be fragmented in order to escape the act's requirements\u2014a matter of special concern for the painting and decorating crafts. The AFL's Executive Council noted that the Davis-Bacon Act \"will prove a great benefit so far as it goes ,\" adding that \"[a]mendments to further benefit the building trades will be submitted at future sessions of Congress.\"", "Among industry objections, perhaps the most critical was the fact that wage rate determinations were made after bids were submitted. Thieblot, joining in the early reservations of Comptroller General McCarl, noted above, explains: \"Postdetermination of wages meant that a contractor could be forced to pay wages which, upon determination by the secretary of labor, were higher than the rate on which his bid was based.\" In effect, contractors (and, perhaps, especially those from outside of the area of work) were bidding blindly: agreeing to pay whatever wage rate the Secretary might determine to be prevailing in the locality.

Representative William Connery (D-Mass.), in an analysis not immediately challenged, recalled that \"representatives of the building trades, after a conference with Secretary Doak, made a deal with the Secretary whereby, if the President ... would issue an executive order on the Davis-Bacon bill they would be against any further legislation on the matter by the Committee on Labor.\"", "President Hoover's Executive Order provided that all Davis-Bacon contracts contain the following stipulations:", "That wages be paid in full not less than once a week, \"in lawful money of the United States ... and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account.\" That \"every person, while performing work of a laborer or mechanic on the public work covered by this contract, is to be regarded as employed as a laborer or mechanic by the contractor or subcontractor, regardless of any contractual relationship alleged to exist between the contractor or subcontractor and such laborer or mechanic.\" That payroll records \"are to be open to inspection by the contracting officer at such times as the latter may elect, provided that such inspection shall not interfere with the proper and orderly prosecution of the work,\" and that the rates payable under the contract \"shall be posted by the contractor in a prominent and easily accessible place at the site of the work\" where workers can view them.

How should problems of abuse under the act (notably, kickbacks) be dealt with? Should the protections of the act extend to production of prefabricated materials to be used in construction?

A Republican House and a Republican Senate passed the Davis-Bacon law and a Republican President, Herbert Hoover, signed it.", "So the Davis-Bacon provision we are talking about today is a 25-year-old Republican law.", "The claim of Representative Mack notwithstanding, Davis-Bacon was not regarded as a partisan enactment. The debate, both in committee and on the floor, involved Democrats and Republicans on each side of the issue.", "Third . At least some Members supported the act in terms of the benefits that it held for contractors. The act, recalled Representative Thor Tollefson (R-Wash.), \"has been valuable as a remedial measure to protect contractors and craftsmen from unfair contract bids.\" He added that a Davis-Bacon provision was necessary to eliminate existing unfair bidding advantages of contractors who pay low wages in areas where union rates prevail.\" The Tacoma Republican affirmed that the Davis-Bacon Act had assured all contractors \"[e]quality of bidding opportunity.\" It protects contractors \"against unfair competition and restricts the area of competition to economy and efficiency.\"", "Fourth . The issue of the cost impact of Davis-Bacon sparked a divided opinion. In a 1956 report on highway legislation, five Members dissented voicing complaints about the act based upon economy.", "How about the increased cost of highways if the Davis-Bacon [provision] were added? It is variously estimated at $2 to $4 billion, which means less highway for the money expended. The unfortunate part is that the administrative and bureaucratic redtape, which Federal wage fixing entails, causes waste from which no one benefits and for which the taxpayer must bear the burden.", "No source was provided for the projected cost estimate. And, conversely, Representative Mack of Washington declared that the act simply \"keep[s] wages ... at the prevailing rate.\" The act, he argued, \"does not raise wages but it does prevent wage cutting and it is wage cutting and labor standard lowering that we wish to prevent.\" Mr. Mack stated that the Washington State Highway Commission had endorsed the Davis-Bacon provision.", "Promptly, Gardner Withrow (R-Wisc.) declared his complete agreement with Mack that Davis-Bacon would not make the cost of highway construction \"any greater than it is now.\" Representative Withrow affirmed that \"the responsible road people in the State of Wisconsin declare that the cost under the Davis-Bacon Act as it is at the present time would not be any more than it is now. So,\" he concluded, \"the argument that it would greatly increase the cost of building roads is entirely a ghost and a phantom and is not substantiated by the facts.\"", "Similarly, a division of opinion had developed in the Senate. The initial highway legislation (1955) had been silent on the matter of Davis-Bacon coverage. Organized labor, during hearings, had urged that prevailing wage coverage be specifically provided; and, when the legislation was reported, a Davis-Bacon provision had been added. Senators Edward Martin (R-Pa.), Prescott Bush (R-Conn.), and Norris Cotton (R-N.H.) dissented from the report of the Committee on Public Works, arguing that this extension of Davis-Bacon requirements would expand the Federal bureaucracy, create paperwork and litigation, increase the control of the federal agencies, and pose definitional problems with respect to classification, locality and prevailing rate. On the floor, debate was extensive; and, at the initiative of Senator Dennis Chavez (D-N.M.), the prevailing wage language was dropped. Subsequently restored by the House, the provision was retained in conference and became law (1956).", "Fifth . The Eisenhower Era may have been a transitional era where Davis-Bacon was concerned. Some Members seemed bewildered that the act should be controversial. Representative Katharine St. George (R-N.Y.), for example, queried \"whether it is not a fact that the Davis-Bacon provision has been in the law for many years, and we have never heard any objecting to it until now.\" Similarly, Representative Frank Smith (D-Miss.) noted that \"[a]ll of our committee ... has voted many times for bills which include Davis-Bacon....\""], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Davis-Bacon During the 1960s", "paragraphs": ["Early in the 1960s, major federal construction programs commenced in defense and space and federal contract labor standards requirements took on a new importance.

Were a worker to install technical electronic equipment, for example, was the work part of the process of \"manufacturing\" and covered by the Walsh-Healey Act? Or, was it \"construction\" and subject to the somewhat higher wage requirements of the Davis-Bacon Act? The issue was further complicated by prefabrication of components for general construction. Was a \"batch plant\" some distance from a construction site still part of the \"site of work\" for Davis-Bacon purposes? These issues were not to be easily resolved.", "Complicating matters further, Congress adopted the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act in 1965 mandating labor standards for service workers\u2014but standards different from those in either Davis-Bacon or Walsh-Healey. Thus, a technical installation might be construction or manufacturing, or it could be a service operation.

Various proposals, each with a constituency of its own, were presented. Some thought review by a panel within DOL would be adequate. Others argued that such a system would never be wholly free from the hand of the Secretary whose staff's decisions were being reviewed. Judicial review was urged, but it was argued that it would be unworkable: that it would be cumbersome and costly, and that decisions would not be timely, an inconvenience to all involved and, possibly, causing delay of vital federal projects. Review by GAO was yet another option; but that, in itself, became a matter of controversy since the Comptroller General and DOL seem frequently to have been at odds over Davis-Bacon administration. If there were to be an in-house board, various practical administrative questions would need to be dealt with. For example, who would appoint its members? Where would it be housed? What would be its relationship to the Secretary, to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division within DOL, and to the Office of the Solicitor within DOL? If internal administrative appeal and review did not resolve a matter in dispute, would there be further options?", "As hearings continued through 1962 and 1963, no legislated review procedure had been finalized. Then, on January 3, 1964, Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz, dissenting from certain of the pending proposals, created administratively a Wage Appeals Board (WAB) which, he noted, would be \"directly responsible to the Secretary of Labor.\" The three member Board was \"appointed by the Secretary of Labor\" with one of the members to be designated chairman.", "The Secretary's order affirmed that the Board \"shall act as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Labor in deciding appeals, concerning questions of fact and law, taken in the discretion of the Board , from wage determinations issued under the Davis-Bacon Act and its related minimum wage statutes....\" On questions of law, the order decreed, the WAB would act on the advice of the Solicitor at DOL who would also represent the Department at each proceeding.", "Six months later, when Labor Solicitor Charles Donahue appeared before the Subcommittee (June 23, 1964), he assured the Members that DOL's review process was in place and functioning.

In 1964, upon that same assumption, Congress extended the definition of \"prevailing wage\" to include fringe benefits.", "Members supporting a fringe benefit component argued that contractors, working under a collective bargaining agreement, can normally be expected to provide unit members with fringe benefits: health insurance, paid vacation time, etc. Non-union firms may offer similar benefits but they are under no contractual obligation to do so. Thus, some reasoned, non-union contractors who offer few or no fringe benefits to their employees might be able unfairly to underbid union or other non-union employers who offer a portion of their total compensation package in the form of such benefits.", "Critics suggested that addition of a fringe benefit component would increase the cost of public construction. They argued that it would be difficult to calculate the value of fringe benefit packages that often varied greatly from one firm or employment situation to another. Finally, some asserted that, even were a fringe benefit component justified, it ought not to be considered as a free-standing issue but, rather, as part of general Davis-Bacon reform.", "When the Roosevelt Subcommittee reported legislation adding a fringe benefit component to Davis-Bacon wage calculations, it seems to have generated little controversy.

Congress, however, then refused to fund implementation of the \"helper\" rule and it remained as an open issue. Fifth . The Appeals Court concurred with the District Court that the changes in the reporting requirements of the Copeland Act would weaken Davis-Bacon enforcement, would conflict with statutory intent, and, therefore, would be beyond the authority of the Secretary. The Department continued to experiment with language to alter the Copeland reporting requirements and the issue became the subject of various legislative proposals, none of them enacted.

Thus, if these labor standards statutes (such as Davis-Bacon) are to survive, they may need to be justified anew, either through education or through experience, some of it perhaps painful.

Or, might it be feasible to re-codify Davis-Bacon (with the several related statutes) as a more general federal contract labor/management standards enactment?", "Third . The reemergence of the federal deficit and budgetary constraints resulting from security concerns may provoke a more critical review of assumptions made during earlier periods of our national experience. As a result, where certain statutes are criticized as imposing unnecessary costs or as presenting significant enforcement and compliance problems, there may be increased willingness to alter or to dispense with these older, perhaps less well understood, laws and to replace them with programs and regulations judged to be more vital to a younger constituency.", "For all of these reasons, it may be useful to review the evolution of the Davis-Bacon Act (and of other federal contract labor standards statutes as well) in order to provide a rational foundation for their reassessment and for the development of future directions of public policy."], "subsections": []}]}}
