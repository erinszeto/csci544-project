{"id": "R41879", "title": "Proposed U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement: Potential National Sector-Specific and State Export Effects", "released_date": "2011-06-20T00:00:00", "summary": ["In February 2011, the United States and South Korea finalized negotiations on a bilateral free trade agreement. As a result, the Obama Administration is expected to submit implementing legislation to the 112th Congress on the proposed U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). This report addresses congressional interest in the effects of this agreement on exports by state to South Korea by using two sets of data. Data developed by the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) are used to identify the possible direction of trade change for 40 industries at the national level. These results are paired with lists of each state's top 10 exports which provide a guide to the possible direction of trade for various state industries as a result of tariff elimination and tariff rate quota reductions under the proposed KORUS FTA. Improved access for services, liberalized investment regimes, and elimination of non-tariff barriers for a few goods and agricultural products are not captured in this analysis.", "Estimating the trade effects of a potential FTA, however, is highly sensitive to the assumptions used and to important limitations of the available data. Such estimates are especially problematic at the state level. As a result, the data in this report should be viewed as providing a general sense of the possible impact of the proposed FTA on state level exports. Over the full implementation period of the agreement, a broad range of economic factors can overwhelm the potential effects of tariff and tariff rate quota provisions. Whether a state's exports are higher as a result of the KORUS FTA will depend significantly on whether firms that now export take advantage of the market openings (e.g., declining or eliminated tariffs, expanding or phased out quotas) negotiated in this trade agreement. In addition, the extent to which state exports change in the same pattern as projected by the USITC estimates, will depend on the extent to which they echo the makeup of the respective industry at the national level.", "While South Korea is the United States' seventh largest trading partner, it accounts for less than 3% of all U.S. trade. It has a population one-sixth that of the United States. By comparison, Canada and Mexico, the United States' first and third largest trading partners, with whom the United States also has a trade agreement (the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)), accounted for 16% and 12% respectively of total U.S. trade in 2010.", "The impact of the KORUS FTA on the exports of individual states reflects both projected national effects on industrial sectors and the composition of industries within each state. Manufactured products currently dominate U.S.-South Korea trade, and the dollar value of exports in virtually all industries is expected to be higher than without a trade agreement. However, the greatest sectoral growth rate in trade is expected to come from agricultural exports, in states with large agricultural sectors. Higher imports in some industries, particularly auto and parts production, are not expected to affect gross exports, but could affect net exports.", "The discussion in this report is limited to presenting the effects of the KORUS FTA on U.S. exports to South Korea on a national level with possible implications at the state level. It does not present data on U.S. imports from South Korea at the state level because of data issues. Nevertheless, increases in imports in some sectors and in some states could be higher than increases in exports as a consequence of the FTA."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["This report provides indications of the possible effects of the proposed U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) on individual states. For each state the indications result from pairing two sets of data. The first set is based on U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC)-estimated changes in U.S. exports and imports at the national level after full implementation of the KORUS FTA, compared to what trade with South Korea would be under a no-agreement scenario. The second set, included in Appendix A , is Census Bureau data which tracks the annual movement of exports to their foreign destination\u2014in this case South Korea\u2014by state.", "Whether a state's exports are higher as a result of the KORUS FTA will depend significantly on whether firms that now export take advantage of the market openings (e.g., declining or eliminated tariffs, expanding or phased out quotas) negotiated in this trade agreement. In addition, the extent to which a state's exports change in the same pattern as projected by the USITC estimates will depend on the extent to which the industry in a given state echoes the makeup of the respective industry at the national level. However, because the model upon which USTIC estimates were based uses only highly aggregated sectors, the extent of that similarity or difference cannot be determined. Therefore, the indication of industries for which net exports (exports minus imports) are projected to increase or decrease as listed in Table 4 should be viewed as providing a general \"compass\" rather than serving as a precise global positioning system in projecting state industry export changes upon full implementation of the KORUS FTA. ", "Estimating the trade effects of FTAs, including the proposed KORUS FTA, is imprecise and highly sensitive to the assumptions that are used. For greater detail, see Appendix C , which discusses trade models used by the USITC and shortfalls associated with Census Bureau state-level trade data. As detailed in the appendix, such estimates are even more problematic at the state level for several reasons. One is the interplay between state industrial composition and problems inherent in the data to measure state exports to a foreign country. That is, the data tend to overestimate agricultural and/or manufacturing exports for some states, and underestimate them for others. In addition, the data capture the export value of the finished product and assign that entire value to the final state from which the product is exported. As a result, the data do not capture the value added by production that occurs in other states. Moreover, while trade agreements generally are comprehensive in nature and cover goods, services , and investment, estimates of exports focus narrowly on the goods sector and do not adequately represent the total impact of the agreements. In addition to the national-level estimates featured in this report, states may experience a broad range of benefits from liberalizing trade in services and reducing or eliminating barriers to investment flows. Provisions that reduce barriers to trade in services potentially could have a large and positive effect on the U.S. economy, since the United States is highly competitive in a number of services sectors and U.S. direct investment abroad often spurs exports.

Individual state shares of these exports varied from 21% (California) to 0.03% (South and North Dakota). When services exports are added, total combined U.S. exports to South Korea in 2010 totaled about $55 billion ( Table 1 ).

Goods accounted for $49 billion, or about 2.6% of total U.S. goods imports of $1.9 trillion. As a consequence, the United States experienced a merchandise trade deficit with South Korea in 2010 of $10 billion, or about 1.5% of the total U.S. merchandise trade deficit. Despite being the seventh largest U.S. trade partner, export opportunities for the United States are limited because of the size of the South Korean market, which consists of some 50 million consumers.", " Table 2 and Table 3 list key U.S. exports to and imports from South Korea, respectively.

(For more export and import detail, see Table B -1 .)", " Table 3 shows that U.S. imports from South Korea are narrowly focused and more concentrated than are U.S. exports. Nearly 70% of all import categories are concentrated in three broad sectors. These are: electrical machinery (especially telephone sets and other apparatus for voice/image/data transmission), non-electrical machinery (especially parts and accessories for office machines, refrigerators and freezers, and washing machines), and motor vehicles (primarily passenger cars, parts, and accessories).

With this slight reduction in the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, however, the overall U.S. trade deficit with the world would change almost imperceptibly. The USITC projects that, compared with a no KORUS FTA scenario, total U.S. merchandise exports to South Korea as a result of the FTA would grow over the 10-year implementation period, by about 24% an average of about 2% per year, and merchandise imports would grow by about 10%, or an average of about 1% per year, as indicated in Figure 1 . For most products, major increases in exports could occur in the latter part of the phase-in period. The study cautions, however, that without a full quantitative analysis of services trade and international investment patterns, simulation results of the USITC study in general should not be interpreted as changes in total imports and exports, or as implying meaningful information about the balance of trade impact of the entire U.S.-Korea FTA.

The results are reported as a range of high and low proportional effects (percentage increases or decreases in trade) and high and low potential changes in trade values for various sectors, relative to trade flows that would have occurred in 2008 if there were no FTA with South Korea. Table 4 lists these in three groups: (1) sectors for which increases in U.S. exports to South Korea are expected to exceed increases in U.S. imports from South Korea; (2) industries for which U.S. exports and imports are not expected to increase; and (3) sectors for which U.S. imports from South Korea are expected to exceed U.S. exports to South Korea.

The state identified in the data is that from which the merchandise starts its journey. It represents the origin of transportation , not the origin of production of the exports. According to the Census Bureau, there are a number of known limitations to the data. In particular, whenever shipments represent a consolidation of goods, such as through warehouses, the state with the warehouse will be credited with the exports, rather than the state of origin of the exports. This caveat is particularly relevant to agricultural products shipped from inland states down the Mississippi River for export from the port of New Orleans. In this case, New Orleans would be credited as the state of origin of the exports. In addition, when goods are stored and then exported by central offices or intermediaries, export data would understate exports from the original production state and overstate exports from the office or consolidation point.

Detailed U.S.-South Korea Trade Data", "Appendix C. Trade Models and Data Issues", "Trade Models", "Trade models of the type used in the analysis of the KORUS FTA are part of a class of economic models referred to as computable general equilibrium models (CGE) that incorporate data on trade and a range of domestic economic variables on nearly 100 countries. As a result of this large number of countries, and the vast amounts of data that are used, the models can provide important insights into the mechanisms by which changes in tariffs or other parameters can affect a range of countries. For practical reasons, however, the data in the models must be limited, so the models necessarily must sacrifice some level of precision in their estimating abilities. Since such trade models originally were developed with the intent of analyzing the economic effects of such multi-country trade agreements as the Uruguay Round, this lack of precision was not considered to be an important drawback. However, this lack of precision may be an issue when the models are used to estimate the effects of bilateral trade agreements, especially at the state level, where the overall amount of trade and, therefore, the impact of the agreement, is expected to be less than that of a comprehensive multilateral agreement. In addition, such models do not account for changes in exchange rates, since such effects were considered to be neutral in a large multi-country trade agreement. Movements in exchange rates, however, could have an important impact on trade patterns that involve countries that are parties to a bilateral trade agreement.", "In addition, estimates derived from trade models represent a static analysis that does not represent the dynamic effects that likely arise from trade agreements. In particular, the estimates are based on the assumption that all other economic factors would remain constant during the time leading to full implementation. The estimates also are based on the assumption that the composition of trade between the United States and South Korea at the time the estimates were made, in this case 2001 data projected to 2008, would also remain constant. Considering the dynamic nature of both economies, however, these assumptions appear to be unrealistic and may limit the usefulness of the final results of the trade model. If the U.S. and South Korean economies continue to change over the next decade at the rate experienced during the past decade, both economies and the composition of trade between them likely will differ appreciably from what can be projected from current data.", "In order to mitigate some of the limitations of the trade model, USITC industry analysts refined the estimates\u2014that is, they prepared a qualitative assessment, of the potential impact of the agreement at the industry level. These estimates provide an analysis of the immediate impact of the agreement and of the phased elimination of tariffs and tariff rate quotas on 40 broadly-defined industrial sectors and on a group of 20 narrowly defined industrial sectors and their sub-sectors. Both of these groups of industries are used in this report to provide estimates of the impact of the KORUS FTA on state-level industries. ", "State Export Data Issues ", "As mentioned, this report uses Census Bureau data on the origin of movement of commodities by state to estimate exports to South Korea as a result of the KORUS FTA. The Census Bureau's Origin of Movement (OM) Data Series is compiled from the Electronic Export Information (EEI) filed by exporters or their agents. The OM data series tracks exports from the zip code where their documented transportation begins, not the origin of production, to the country of their foreign destination. The data represent a shipment of one or more kinds of merchandise from one exporter to one foreign importer on a single carrier. The state identified in the data is that from which the final merchandise starts its journey. According to the Census Bureau, there are a number of known limitations to the data. In particular, whenever shipments represent a consolidation of goods, such as through warehouses, the state with the warehouse will be credited with the exports, rather than the state of origin of the exports. This caveat is particularly relevant to agricultural products shipped from inland states down the Mississippi River for export from the port of New Orleans. In this case, New Orleans would be credited as the state of origin of the exports. In addition, when goods are stored and then exported by central offices or intermediaries, export data would understate exports from the original production state and overstate exports from the office or consolidation point.", "Generally speaking, the origin of movement (OM) data tend to overestimate exports from port states such as California and New York and underestimate exports from such interior states as Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota. This miscounting is particularly prevalent when products are either consolidated or stored by central offices or intermediaries before entering official export channels. In such a case, the state-level export data do not provide a precise picture of the product composition of exports from each state to the world or to individual countries such as South Korea. Despite this limitation, these data provide the best available indication of what is produced and exported from each state. ", "The issue of underestimation or overestimation is less of a problem among manufactured goods than among agricultural products. For manufactured products, the origin of movement and the origin of production often coincide. Typically, manufacturers ship their exports to a foreign destination directly from the factory gate or from a nearby distribution facility. In these instances, the state where the product is manufactured receives credit for the export. CRS estimates that OM data underestimates manufacturing exports by 25% or more in 10 states and overestimates them in 12 states, as shown in Table C -1 . However, manufactured products from different states sometimes are consolidated for export before shipment. When this occurs, the state-of-production-origin is lost. Instead, the state where these manufactured goods are consolidated receives credit for the entire value of the export, even though those products were manufactured in other states. In general, coastal states with large ports such as California, Texas, or New York record higher exports because of these consolidated shipments, while inland states report lower exports. ", "Several other issues\u00a0affect state-level trade statistics for manufactured goods.\u00a0Value-added considerations are not taken into account in recording state level exports. The OM data series only reports the sales price and the state from which the completed/finished product is exported. It does not capture value added by myriads of workers and businesses in states where intermediate steps were taken toward the completion of complex manufactured export goods, such as automobiles and aircraft \u2013exports that are comprised of thousands of parts produced in many different locations. As a result, the OM data seriously underestimates value added in many states. See Table C -1 for a list of states whose exports are overestimated or underestimated by the data series. ", "Accounting for agricultural exports by state, however, is particularly complicated. The Census Bureau explicitly warns that the OM state export data tend to understate agricultural exports from farm states and inflate agricultural exports from states with major ports that handle large volumes of bulk agricultural commodities (e.g., grains, soybeans) and high-value shipments of processed foods. By CRS calculations, OM data underestimate agricultural exports by at least 25% in more than 28 states, and overestimate such exports by the same extent in 12 states.", "Bulk agricultural products in particular are overwhelmingly sold in many interior states to intermediaries, who ship them by barge or rail to major coastal ports to await export. Other unprocessed agricultural products are produced in one state but sent to a warehouse in another state, or to a facility for processing into a food or beverage product, before being exported. When shipped, these products are not counted as exports of the state where the commodities were produced but rather as exports from the state where they began to move to foreign markets. For instance, corn and soybeans produced in Iowa, Missouri, and other Midwestern states are shipped down the Mississippi River for consolidation at the elevators located in New Orleans. Also, a food product produced in Idaho, and then shipped to a Washington wholesaler or freight forwarder for sale abroad, could be credited as an export of Washington state instead of as a export from Idaho under the OM state export data collection system.
