Annual food price inflation dropped to 1.8% in 2009 and 0.8% in 2010, driven by the global financial crisis and its aftermath. In 2011, improving U.S. and global economic conditions led to a 3.7% rise in average food prices. However, since 2012, food price inflation has averaged 2.5%\u2014due in part to continued sluggish economic growth and stagnant wages, which combined to weaken consumer purchasing power.

", "Under most circumstances, the availability of many close substitutes is likely to make consumers more sensitive or responsive to price changes, because they have the opportunity to switch to similar alternatives. In contrast, a lack of substitutes may give the consumer little choice but to continue to purchase the available good, even as its price rises, especially if it is deemed a necessity. Strong ethnic or cultural tastes and preferences may endear a person to a particular food type such that he or she will continue to purchase that food as its price rises even in the presence of abundant substitutes (for example, ethnic groups that are accustomed to eating rice at every meal may be reluctant to switch to bread or potatoes even if the price of rice rises relative to those other foods). ", "Rapid or unexpected changes in retail food prices will impact some consumers more than others depending on income levels and the importance of the affected food items in consumers' budgets. In general, if an item represents a very small portion of the consumer's budget (for example, consider salt), then a consumer is less likely to respond to a price change. For the average American consumer, basic food staples such as bread, potatoes, pasta, and rice tend to take smaller shares of the food budget (relative to meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, and more processed food products), and, as a result, consumers are less responsive to a change in their price. In contrast, high-valued food items such as expensive cuts of meat or seafood probably represent more costly (and infrequently purchased) delicacies for most households. As a result, most households will tend to be far more responsive to changes in the prices of such high-valued products than for basic staples. Often a price change for an item within a specific food group may result in consumers switching to lower-quality items within that food category\u2014the classic example being a switch from steak to hamburger when meat prices rise. In contrast, a widespread price rise across all food groups may engender substantial reshuffling of consumer food budget allocations as households try to meet their nutritional goals with their limited budgets.", "Of course, the absolute size of a consumer's disposable income is also important in determining actual purchasing power. For households with smaller incomes, the food budget itself is likely a larger portion of total household expenditures, and such households are likely to be more responsive to price changes across all food categories than are higher-income households.", "In summary, lower-income consumers who spend a significant share of their household budget on food are likely to be impacted more severely by rising food prices (and are likely to be more responsive to price changes) than high-income consumers with lower food budget shares.

For example, as incomes increase in less-developed countries, it is common to see per-capita expenditures on meat and dairy products increase. In contrast, when incomes decline, consumers tend to pull back from more expensive options.

This is an important point because the energy price index has seen its weighted share of the CPI gradually increase over time and, although energy's current weight share of 9.7% is slightly more than half that of the food weight share of 15.3%, energy price inflation is far more insidious than food inflation to the extent that energy costs figure in the retail price of practically every other component of the CPI."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consumer Income and Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["A household allocates its available income across a range of expenditure, savings, and investment choices.

An array of costs are layered on top of the price of the raw agricultural commodity, including handling, transportation, storage, and processing, as well as the insurance, financing, and advertising costs necessary to move the product to the retail customer. ", "The relative importance of these marketing costs varies widely for different retail food products depending on the degree of processing and transformation (i.e., cleaning, packaging, shipping, advertising, etc.). As a result, economic forces such as higher energy costs or increased labor rates do not impact all food categories equally. More highly processed food products, where the farm-level commodity value contributes a small share to the final price, are less influenced by farm-level price changes than are those food products that have very little marketing and processing as part of the final retail product\u2014for example, eggs, fresh meat, and certain fruits and vegetables."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Annual Price Movements by Major Food Categories", "paragraphs": ["Food price inflation is not felt evenly across all food groups, but varies widely in terms of both the timing and the relative magnitude.

In 2009 and 2010, most food groups experienced very modest price inflation (0.5% and 0.3%, respectively); several categories experienced price deflation. Food price inflation turned upward sharply across most food categories in 2011. Food price inflation returned to its long-run trend of about 2.5% in 2012 with the notable exception of beef and poultry products, and fats and oils, which were up sharply. High feed costs and lack of pasture during 2012 (due to a severe drought across the Plains States and Cornbelt) contributed to substantial declines in livestock and poultry populations and cut into cattle feedlot and chicken grow-out profit margins, thus sparking concerns\u2014but not shortages\u2014at the retail level. Tight animal product supplies in 2011 and 2012 supported most animal product prices at above average price inflation levels during those years. As feed supplies rebounded in 2013, the hog, poultry, and dairy sectors began to expand (the beef sector is constrained by biology from rapid expansion).

Also, evidence (as presented in the following charts) suggests that highly processed foods more consistently adhere to steady, stable upward price trends dependent on general economic conditions. In contrast, prices for less-processed retail food products\u2014such as eggs, milk, and fresh fruits and vegetables\u2014respond far more quickly to changes in both farm commodity prices and economic conditions.", "Monthly price indexes ( Figure 14 ) for the four principal food groups\u2014cereals and bakery products; meats (including beef, pork, poultry, and seafood); dairy products (including milk, cheese, ice cream, and other); and fruits and vegetables (including fresh as well as processed)\u2014reveal variations of the \"common theme\" of price movement.

The dairy price index rose declined sharply from mid-2008 through 2009, before moving steadily upward from mid-2009 until 2015. The fruit and vegetable price index has shown considerable volatility. A general upward pattern has been punctuated by significant deflationary movements during 2007, 2009, 2010, late 2011, and again heading into 2015.", "Animal product prices ( Figure 15 and Figure 16 ) show a similar pattern of decline between 2008 and 2010, before rising into 2015.

Low cattle populations are expected to support beef prices through 2015. However, the rapid expansion of the hog sector in 2013 and 2014 has pushed supply past current demand, thus triggering lower prices heading into 2015. Poultry prices have been more stable and have ticked upward since late 2010, helped in part by high beef prices and consumer switching of meat choices. Perhaps the most dramatic and volatile of the individual animal product price indexes has been eggs ( Figure 15 ), which underwent a severe deflationary period from mid-2008 through 2009 before growing steadily into 2015. Stronger egg production coupled with the global economic crisis dampened prices starting in the latter half of 2008. General economic growth has pulled egg prices upward steadily since mid-2009, just surpassing their mid-2008 peak in June 2013.", "The individual components of the dairy group ( Figure 16 ) followed distinctly different patterns. Cheese and fresh milk prices exhibited deflation from mid-2008 until late 2009 due to initially tight supplies and expensive feed costs, followed by increased supplies and a sharp drop in demand. A resumption of U.S. and global economic growth (albeit slow) has helped sustain price increases in late 2009. The dairy sector experienced a slow down with the stalling economy in 2012 and 2013 before surging upward in 2014 as the general economy surged.", "The overall dairy index mimics closely the cheese index since cheese is the principal use category and accounts for much of dairy price formation. Prices for highly processed ice cream showed a far more stable pattern and have generally reflected overall economic conditions. ", "Similar to ice cream, the price index for processed fruits and vegetables ( Figure 17 ) has tended to follow general economic conditions. In contrast, the price indexes for both fresh fruit and fresh vegetables have exhibited greater volatility, incorporating aspects of both the general economy as well as supply and demand conditions for the raw commodities. The ongoing drought in California is likely to have a major impact on the state's agricultural production. Long-term moisture deficits across most of the state remain at near-record levels. Because California is the major U.S. producer of fruit, vegetables, tree nuts, and dairy, the drought has potential implications for U.S. supplies and prices of affected products. USDA currently projects combined U.S. fruit and vegetable prices to rise by 2% to 3% in 2015, with fresh fruits projected up 2.5% to 3.5%. The price indexes for highly processed snacks, sugar and sweets, and fats and oils ( Figure 18 ) are similar to other processed food products or products with inelastic demand\u2014they tend to follow general economic conditions. Again, the prepared-food group (which includes frozen and freeze-dried prepared foods) and the carbonated beverages indexes tend to follow the swings in consumer demand as reflected by the general economy ( Figure 19 ).

SNAP is the largest of these programs and accounted for 73% of federal food and nutrition assistance spending in FY2014. SNAP provides monthly benefits for eligible participants to purchase food items at authorized food stores.", "A substantial portion of spending on food and nutrition assistance programs is in the form of entitlements (i.e., mandatory spending) whereby eligibility and participation rates govern outlays. For mandatory programs, food price inflation leads to more spending on domestic assistance efforts. Increasing prices encourage those who are eligible, but not participating, to enroll. They also translate directly (albeit with a time lag) into higher benefit payments and per-meal subsidies for \"entitlement\" programs in which benefits are indexed to food-price inflation. However, many of these programs also include discretionary components where outlays are determined through the annual appropriations process. Increasing prices place pressure on appropriators to provide more funding to support caseloads for \"discretionary\" programs like the WIC program.", "The 2008-2009 global economic crisis\u2014with its higher unemployment, income loss, and lower effective household purchasing power\u2014following on the heels of higher retail prices, brought on higher participation rates and greater costs for domestic food aid programs. Although the U.S. economy resumed growth during 2010, unemployment ranks have been slow to follow. This is reflected in high SNAP participation levels, which hit an all-time high of 47.8 million (or 15.2% of the U.S. population) in December 2012.
