Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) program, authorized under Title IV, Part D of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended, is the primary federal student loan program administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED). The program makes available loans to undergraduate and graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students to help them finance their postsecondary education expenses. Four types of loans are offered: Subsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduate students; Unsubsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduate and graduate students; PLUS Loans for graduate students and the parents of dependent undergraduate students; and Consolidation Loans through which borrowers may combine multiple loans into a single loan. For FY2016, ED estimates that 20.4 million loans (not including Consolidation Loans) totaling $109.2 billion will be made to students and their parents through the DL program. Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program loans are no longer being made; however, outstanding FFEL program loans are due to continue being repaid over the coming years.", "FFEL and DL program loans are low-interest loans, with maximum interest rates for each type of loan established by statute. Subsidized Stafford Loans are unique in that they are only available to undergraduate students demonstrating financial need. With certain exceptions, the federal government pays the interest that accrues on Subsidized Stafford Loans while the borrower is enrolled in school on at least a half-time basis, during a six-month grace period thereafter, and during periods of authorized deferment. Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans are available to borrowers irrespective of their financial need; and borrowers are responsible for paying all the interest that accrues on these loans. FFEL and DL program loans have terms and conditions that may be more favorable to borrowers than private and other nonfederal loans. These beneficial terms and conditions include interest rates that are often lower than rates that might be obtained from other lenders, opportunities for repayment relief through deferment and forbearance, loan consolidation, and several loan forgiveness programs.", "This report discusses major provisions of federal student loans made available through the DL program and previously made through the FFEL program. It focuses on provisions related to borrower eligibility, loan terms and conditions, borrower repayment relief, and loan default and its consequences for borrowers.

Ford Federal Direct Loan (DL) program\u2014authorized under Title IV, Part D of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), as amended, and administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED)\u2014is the primary source of federal student loans. Several types of loans are offered through the DL program: Subsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduate students; Unsubsidized Stafford Loans for undergraduate and graduate students; PLUS Loans for graduate students and parents of dependent undergraduate students; and Consolidation Loans through which borrowers may combine their loans into a single loan payable over a longer term, which varies according to the combined loan balance. For many years, essentially the same set of loans was also available through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, authorized under Title IV, Part B of the HEA; and the majority of loans made were FFEL program loans. The SAFRA Act terminated the authority to make new FFEL program loans, effective July 1, 2010. ", "Both the FFEL and DL programs are descendants of the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program, which was originally enacted under Title IV of the HEA to enhance access to postsecondary education for students from low- and middle-income families by providing them access to low-interest student loans. Under the FFEL program, loans were originated by private sector and state-based lenders and were funded with nonfederal capital. The federal government guaranteed lenders against loss through borrower default, death, permanent disability, or, in limited instances, bankruptcy. The federal government also entered into agreements to provide participating lenders a variety of incentives designed to ensure that nonfederal capital would consistently be available to support FFEL program student loans. FFEL program loans are serviced by private sector and state-based lenders; and state and nonprofit guaranty agencies receive federal funds to play the lead role in administering the federal loan guarantee. While no new loans are being made through the FFEL program, outstanding FFEL program loans are due to be repaid over the coming years.", "Authorization for the DL program was enacted under the Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ( P.L. 103-66 ). The program was established with the goals of streamlining the student loan delivery system and achieving cost savings. When enacted, the program was originally intended to gradually expand and replace the FFEL program; however, provisions calling for a \"phase-in\" of the DL program were repealed under the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 ( P.L. 105-244 ). For the nearly two decades that both the FFEL and DL programs were in operation, IHEs were able to participate in the program of their choice.", "The DL program uses a different administrative structure and draws on a different source of capital than was used in the FFEL program. Under the DL program, the federal government essentially serves as the banker\u2014it provides the loans to students and their families using federal capital (i.e., funds from the U.S. Treasury), and it owns the loans. Schools that participate in the DL program may serve as direct loan originators or the loans may be originated by a contractor working for ED. Federal contractors hired by ED service DL program loans.", "The DL program is the largest federal program that provides direct aid to support students' postsecondary educational pursuits. In FY2016, ED estimates that 20.4 million new DL program Stafford Loans and PLUS Loans, averaging $5,342 each and totaling $109.2 billion, will be made to undergraduate and graduate students, and the parents of undergraduate dependent students; and it estimates that 503,000 Consolidation loans, averaging $55,244 and totaling $27.8 billion, will also be made.", "In the recent years, numerous changes have been made to the terms and conditions of DL program loans. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 (CCRAA; P.L. 110-84 ) incrementally lowered, from 6.8% to 3.4%, the fixed interest rates charged to undergraduate borrowers of Subsidized Stafford Loans made during the four award years spanning July 1, 2008, to June 30, 2012, and established the income-based repayment (IBR) plan. The Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act of 2008 (ECASLA; P.L. 110-227 ) increased the amounts students may borrow in Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA; P.L. 110-315 ) reauthorized the HEA and made a variety of changes to loan terms and conditions. The SAFRA Act, part of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA; P.L. 111-152 ), terminated the authority to make new loans under the FFEL program after June 30, 2010. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) eliminated the availability of Subsidized Stafford Loans to graduate and professional students for periods of instruction beginning on or after July 1, 2012; and terminated the availability of certain repayment incentives for loans made on or after July 1, 2012. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21 st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141 ) extended the 3.4% interest rate to apply to Subsidized Stafford Loans made from July 1, 2012, to June 30, 2013. Most recently, the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-28 ) established a new market-indexed, fixed interest rate structure for DL program loans made on or after July 1, 2013.", "This report discusses major provisions of federal student loans made available through the DL program and previously made through the FFEL program.

Of particular importance with regard to undergraduate students is the fact that PLUS Loans\u2014the loans with the most flexible borrowing limits\u2014are only available to the parents of dependent students. At the same time, undergraduate independent students are extended higher personal borrowing limits than dependent students. The operating assumption is that the postsecondary education expenses of dependent students will be financed by students and their parents, whereas independent students will be financing their expenses without parental assistance. The types of loans available to undergraduate students and their families align with this assumption.", "Dependency status also determines which set of income and assets is included in need analysis calculations (discussed below). Need analysis calculations for a dependent student are based on the income and assets of both the student and the student's parents, whereas need analysis calculations for an independent student are based on the income and assets of the student (and if applicable, the student's spouse).", "Grade level is based on student progression according to the academic standards of the school the student attends. For undergraduate students, progression to a higher grade level for purposes of awarding Stafford Loans does not necessarily correspond to the start of a new academic year. For instance, a student who continues to make satisfactory academic progress, but does not progress to the next grade level could receive Stafford Loans more than once as a first-year student. Once the student accrues enough credits to progress to the next higher grade level, the student would become eligible for the higher borrowing limits available to second-year students.
