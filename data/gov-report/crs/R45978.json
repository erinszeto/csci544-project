Both historical and recent legislative and executive efforts centered on outdoor recreation have identified the economic importance of outdoor recreation. In 2016, Congress passed the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act ( P.L. 114-249 ), which directed the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the Department of Commerce to create an account that would measure the outdoor recreation economy. BEA released the first official Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) statistics in September 2018 and updated them in September 2019.", "According to the ORSA statistics, in 2017, the current-dollar value added of the outdoor recreation economy was $427\u00c2 billion, or 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP). ORSA statistics show that supporting activities, such as construction and travel and tourism expenses, accounted for approximately half of value added. Conventional outdoor recreation activities, as defined by BEA, accounted for another 30.7% of real outdoor recreation gross output; o ther recreation accounted for 19.3%. The outdoor recreation economy grew by 3.9% in 2017, faster than the 2.4% growth for the overall U.S. economy, and has grown approximately 9.9% since 2012. Real gross output, real compensation, and real employment all grew faster in the outdoor recreation economy than in the overall economy in 2016. BEA reports that the \"arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry\" was the largest contributor to the outdoor recreation economy in 2017, accounting for $112.9 billion of current-dollar outdoor recreation value added, followed by retail trade. These two sectors were also the largest industries included in the ORSA statistics for both compensation ($67.3 billion) and employment (2.1 million) in 2017. BEA released prototype statistics for states, which found that Hawaii, Montana, Maine, Vermont, and Wyoming had the five highest proportions of state GDP generated from outdoor recreation in 2017.", "In addition to the ORSA statistics, which are measured for the nation as a whole or for individual states, federal agencies sometimes measure the specific economic impact of federal lands. According to some studies, visitors to federal lands generated $55 billion in value added in FY2012 and $53.9 billion in value added in FY2016 (FY2017 dollars). Differences in methods, data, and assumptions mean any comparison between these figures and the ORSA statistics can be highly general at best.", "It is difficult to precisely measure the total amount of outdoor recreation that Americans engage in, due to differences in data collection, measurement, definitions, and other factors between sources. One source, the National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE), measures the number of people who engage in 17 different outdoor activities and how often they do so. According to the NSRE, over 194 million respondents (approximately 82% of respondents) engage in the most popular form of outdoor recreation (visiting developed sites) in a given year. Americans report engaging in the most popular surveyed activity, viewing nature, over 32.4 billion times in a given year, although this activity is a major outlier. Rates of participation in surveyed activities vary substantially and can depend on geographic location, proximity to recreation resources, demographic factors, and other influences.", "In FY2017, lands managed by the four federal land management agencies (the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and National Park Service) had approximately 596 million visits. Lands managed by other federal agencies (the Bureau of Reclamation, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and United States Army Corps of Engineers) also had significant visitation. Visits to the lands of these other agencies sometimes exceeded visits to lands managed by the four federal land management agencies. Although publicly owned lands (including federal lands) generally have the greatest amount of recreation visits, private lands can dominate certain types of recreation, particularly in the eastern United States."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress plays an overarching role in shaping outdoor recreation throughout the nation through legislation and oversight.

The Secretary noted that \"credible data on the tangible economic benefits of public lands\" would be a valuable resource for stakeholders, including Congress, and that the study would count the contributions of the outdoor recreation economy in a \"comprehensive and impartial\" way. Later that year, Congress explicitly authorized these efforts through passage of the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act. In addition to ensuring the availability of economic data on outdoor recreation, the act ensured methodological uniformity with other statistical activities of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) that analyze the economic impact of private industries.", "The act directed the Secretary of Commerce, acting through BEA, to assess and analyze the outdoor recreation economy of the United States and its contributions to the economy generally. The act required the Secretary to consider employment, sales, and contributions to travel and tourism, in addition to any other items the Secretary considered appropriate. Consequently, BEA developed the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA), an account using the same data and methods as BEA's gross domestic product (GDP) statistics. ", "BEA released the first ORSA prototype statistics for comment in February 2018, and it released the first official ORSA statistics in September 2018. BEA released the most recent ORSA statistics on September 20, 2019. Congress has indicated general approval of the ORSA and directed BEA to develop regional statistics in future years; BEA included state-level prototype statistics in the 2019 release. The House Appropriations Committee also directed the Department of Commerce, in coordination with the agencies of the Federal Recreation Council, to continue to refine the account and to report on the feasibility of identifying amounts allocated by the federal government to outdoor recreation efforts.

The most recent ORSA statistics, released in September 2019, measured the period from 2012 to 2017. ", "The ORSA \"measures the size of the outdoor recreation economy and the link between outdoor recreation and the broader U.S. economy.\" BEA constructed the ORSA by isolating outdoor recreation spending and production from the broader industries and categories that BEA already tracked. BEA compiles data into industry accounts (e.g., retail trade, manufacturing, construction, and others) and uses all this data to calculate gross domestic product (GDP). The ORSA is a satellite account in that it isolates and combines the parts of many individual industries that are related to outdoor recreation. For example, as described by BEA, existing industry accounts show \"the production of all apparel, whereas the ORSA shows the production of apparel used specifically for outdoor recreation activities, such as wetsuits and hiking boots.\" ", "The ORSA divides outdoor recreation activity into core activities and supporting activities. Core activities include the production and purchase of goods and services used directly for outdoor recreation, such as equipment, fuel, concessions, and fees. Supporting activities are defined as goods and services that facilitate access to outdoor recreation activities, such as travel and tourism expenses, local trips, construction, and government expenditures that support outdoor recreation (including local, state, and federal spending). BEA also organizes its statistics using conventional and broad views of outdoor recreation. The conventional activities include \"all recreational activities undertaken for pleasure that generally involve some level of intentional physical exertion and occur in nature-based environments outdoors,\" such as camping, fishing, hiking, and hunting. Other activities include additional activities undertaken for pleasure that occur outdoors that may not meet the conventional definition (i.e., do not require intentional physical exertion or occur in a nature-based setting), such as outdoor concerts and festivals and games and sports fields. The two categories of activities can be combined to generate a broad view of the outdoor recreation economy.", "BEA calculates the ORSA from the same data used to calculate GDP broadly. \u00c2\u00a0As such, the ORSA is directly comparable to other BEA products, including other satellite accounts, like those for arts and cultural production. In addition, the estimates used to create the ORSA follow internationally recognized standards for national accounting, including creating GDP, value added, and other measures. Thus, in theory, the ORSA results can be compared to other measures of GDP, gross output, and value added, although differing assumptions, data, and methods may influence to what degree other measures are equivalent to ORSA statistics. As described above, the ORSA combines data from many different BEA industries; thus, although very general comparisons can be made, direct comparisons risk double-counting. For example, comparing the size of the ORSA to the size of the apparel industry would be inaccurate, because some value added from the apparel industry is included in the ORSA.

The outdoor recreation economy accounted for 2.2% of GDP. As shown in Figure 1 , supporting activities, such as construction and travel and tourism expenses, accounted for approximately half of outdoor recreation value added in 2017, approximately $213.9 million current dollars. Conventional outdoor recreation accounted for 30.7% of value added. Other recreation accounted for 19.3%. ", "BEA organizes its accounts by industry. BEA reports that the arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest contributor to the outdoor recreation economy in 2017, accounting for $112.9 billion of current-dollar outdoor recreation value added. The second-largest industry in 2017 was retail trade, accounting for $95.7 billion of current-dollar value added. Figure 2 provides a full breakdown of contribution to value added by industry. ", "BEA reported that the outdoor recreation economy generated approximately 5.1 million jobs in 2017. The arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest industry included in the ORSA for both compensation ($67.3 billion current dollars) and employment (2.1 million) in 2017. Retail trade was the second-largest industry for both compensation ($49.8 billion current dollars) and employment (1.6 million) in 2017. ", "The largest amount of value added in 2017 from an individual conventional outdoor recreation activity (as defined by BEA) came from boating/fishing, accounting for approximately $21\u00c2\u00a0billion in current-value dollars, or approximately 5% of value added from outdoor recreation (see Figure 3 ). The activities that generated the most value added are not necessarily the most popular, according to an FS participation survey. For example, although equestrian activities were among the six largest activities in terms of value added, an FS survey found that equestrian activities were among the three smallest activities for number of participants (see \" National Outdoor Recreation Participation \" for more information). ", "Although much of the economic activity tracked by BEA to calculate value added can be linked to a specific activity (see \" About the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account \"), some economic activity cannot. For example, multiuse apparel and accessories (such as backpacks, bug spray, and other items) that can be used for many activities accounted for approximately $48.6 billion in current dollars, or over 11% of value added. ", "In real terms, the outdoor recreation economy grew 3.9% between 2016 and 2017, faster than the 2.4% growth for the overall U.S. economy. Real gross output, compensation, and employment all grew faster in the outdoor recreation economy than in the overall economy in 2017. Between 2012 and 2017, the outdoor recreation economy grew by approximately 9.9%. ", "In 2017, BEA released prototype statistics on the percentage of each state's GDP from outdoor recreation (see Figure 4 ). BEA's preliminary results found that Hawaii, Montana, Maine, Vermont, and Wyoming had the five highest proportions of state GDP from outdoor recreation. However, other measures of economic importance vary considerably by state. For example, California, Florida, and Texas had the highest total outdoor recreation value added. Wyoming, Hawaii, and Alaska and Maine (tied) had the highest percentage of state employment from outdoor recreation. The relative importance of recreation in individual states depends on the size of the outdoor recreation economy, the state's economy generally, and the state's employment and compensation patterns. It is unclear to what extent these estimates may change if BEA adjusts its methods for calculating state statistics. Official state statistics are scheduled for release in fall 2020.", "Other Estimates of Economic Activity", "In addition to the estimates created by BEA, researchers, advocacy groups, and industry associations create estimates of the outdoor recreation economy. Many groups estimate impacts of individual activities, sectors, geographic areas, or outdoor recreation areas (e.g., angling, winter snow sports, a given watershed, or a given state). The broadest of these is the Outdoor Industry Association's (OIA's) Outdoor Recreation Economy report, which has been produced annually since 2006. Prior to publication of the ORSA, OIA estimates were sometimes cited to gauge the size of the outdoor recreation economy as a whole. ", "According to OIA's 2017 report, the outdoor recreation economy generated $887 billion in consumer spending, the majority of which ($702 billion) was trip and travel spending, including airfare, lodging, fuel, groceries, tickets, lessons, guides, and other unspecified expenses spent anywhere away from home. OIA estimates that the outdoor recreation economy directly supports 7.6 million jobs. OIA also estimates that the outdoor recreation economy generates $65.3 billion in federal tax revenue and $59.2 billion in state and local tax revenue.", "OIA's estimates of the size of the outdoor recreation economy, and other estimation efforts, cannot be directly compared to the ORSA. This may be due to differences in method, assumptions, measurement, or statistics reported. Specifically, the OIA reports measure consumer spending and tax revenue, which are not part of the ORSA and are not directly comparable to any statistic reported in the ORSA. OIA's estimate of jobs (7.6 million) is higher than BEA's estimate of jobs (5.2 million), but it is unclear to what extent the data reported are similar in measurement or whether they represent the same year.", "BEA excluded exports and imports in its calculation, and these figures may be captured in OIA's statistics. BEA states that external reports on the outdoor recreation economy that include \"activities with a high share of spending on imported goods and services (such as apparel) will likely have higher estimates than the ORSA.\" BEA also states that other reports may include spending on items not used for outdoor recreation (for example, bicycles used for commuting). In general, because other reports do not give the same statistics as the ORSA, and due to methodological differences, it is unclear whether (and to what degree) the ORSA and other reports may or may not be in disagreement, despite apparent large differences in results. ", "The results of the ORSA and OIA reports have certain broad commonalities. For example, both reports find that large amounts of economic activity are driven by activities requiring relatively expensive purchases, such as vehicles (for example, boating or off-highway vehicle activities). Both reports also find that expenses related to travel, such as lodging, airfare, and food away from home, constitute large shares of the economic activity generated by outdoor recreation.

The NSRE measures both participation (the number of respondents who report engaging in the activity at least once over the course of a year) and consumption (the number of times the respondent indicates engaging in the activity). The survey does not estimate the total number of participants in outdoor recreation generally, only participation rates in the 17 activities studied. The most recent NSRE was completed for the period 1999-2009, and an update is ongoing. ", "The NSRE estimated that, for the activities considered, a maximum of 194 million people (visiting developed sites) and a minimum of 8 million people (primitive skiing) participated every year (see Table 1 for additional details). FS estimated that approximately 82% of NSRE respondents participated in visiting developed sites, the activity with the highest participation rate. In terms of the frequency with which participants engaged in each activity (shown as \"Activity Days\" in Table 1 ), FS estimated that participants engaged in the most popular activity (viewing nature) over 32.4 billion times; this activity, however, is a major outlier, and participants engaged in the next several most popular activities between 8.3 billion and 1.8 billion times. ", "Between 1999 and 2009, FS estimated that participation in nature-based outdoor recreation generally increased. The number of U.S. participants in the surveyed activities increased by 7.1% over this period. Certain activities, such as those oriented toward viewing and photographing nature, off-highway vehicle activities, and several physically challenging activities (e.g., kayaking, snowboarding, surfing) had relatively large increases in participation compared to the average over this period. ", "More people overall participate in outdoor recreation in the eastern United States than in the western United States, in large part because most of the U.S. population resides in the East. However, participation rates (measured as the number of participants per hundred people) are higher in the West for all activities except hunting and fishing. In addition to this broad trend, demographic factors, such as population size, age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and income, are correlated with the rate of outdoor recreation. For example, relative to the general population, people engaging in hunting and fishing are more likely to be rural residents, and people engaging in skiing and snowboarding are more likely to be urban residents. Availability of and proximity to recreation settings also are highly correlated with the rate of outdoor recreation participation. ", "The amount of recreation that occurs on lands of differing ownership\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example, federal, state, local, and private\u00e2\u0080\u0094likely varies widely by activity and location (see section on \" Recreation Visits to Federal Lands \" for further discussion of recreation on federal lands). ", "Approximately 60% of lands in the United States are privately owned, and approximately 28% of the total land area is federally owned; the remainder is in a mix of state, local, tribal, and other ownerships. Over 92% of federal land is located in 11 western states and Alaska. The uneven distribution of federal land between the eastern and western United States influences what lands provide outdoor recreation opportunities in different regions of the United States, particularly given that, for some federal land management agencies, at least half of visits to the properties they administer come from people who live within 50 miles. ", "FS found that private lands were a more important recreation setting in the East, with the total number of recreation visits on private lands in the East nearly four times the number in the West. In the West, respondents reported that they spent the majority of activity days in all surveyed activities on publicly owned lands of any kind. In contrast, respondents in the East spent the majority of activity days in some surveyed activities on private lands and some on publicly owned lands.

From the standpoint of public lands management, there is often congressional interest in how the government's provision of recreational opportunities translates into economic activity in communities around federal recreation resources. Legislation, hearings, and congressional reports have indicated the significance of this economic activity as a policy consideration in contexts involving federal lands. In the past decade, federal agencies and interagency groups have conducted studies measuring economic contributions specific to federal lands. Because these studies examine multiple agencies under a single framework, and because they report value added, the results are comparable to one another. In the sense that value added is a consistent concept, they also may be generally comparable to other measures of value added, such as the ORSA results, although differences in methods, data, and assumptions mean any comparison can be, at best, highly general. ", "According to these studies, in FY2017 dollars, visitors spent approximately $54 billion in the local economies of federal recreation areas in FY2012 and $49.8 billion in FY2016, generating $55 billion in value added in FY2012 and $53.9 billion in value added in FY2016 (see Table 2 ). The studies indicate that outdoor recreation on federal lands directly supported 880,000 jobs in FY2012 and 826,000 jobs in FY2016. ", "The authors of the studies in Table 2 limited their studies of visitor spending to areas within 50 miles of the federal recreation site. The authors state that this limitation provides a conservative estimate. Although research suggests that many visits to federal recreation sites do indeed originate from nearby, the nationwide estimates discussed above (see \" The National Outdoor Recreation Economy \") indicate that a large proportion of economic activity derives from travel-related expenses. If the travel-related portion of economic activity related to federal sites is not being captured in these results because that activity occurs more than 50 miles from the federal recreation site, these studies may undercount the true value. Similarly, results of national studies indicate that activities requiring major purchases (e.g., vehicles) account for a large proportion of the outdoor recreation economy. If visitors do not report such expenditures, it also may result in undercounting. The agencies used different methods to measure visitation and economic activity; thus, estimates may be only generally comparable.
