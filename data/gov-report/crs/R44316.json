The persistence and intensity of the drought, which began in 2011 in some areas, has received considerable attention from Congress. To date, federal legislative proposals have focused primarily on the management of federal water projects, support for drought-related programs, and needs of fish and wildlife for water. A broad policy question is how Congress might address western drought, drought in any part of the United States, and gaps in water supply and demand.", "Several bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress that would address issues associated with drought. They include S. 176, S. 1837, S. 1894, H.R. 2898, H.R. 2983, and H.R. 3045, among others. Of the bills considered to date, H.R. 2898, the Western Water and American Food Security Act, and S. 1894, the California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2015, have received the most congressional and public attention. On July 17, 2015, H.R. 2898 passed the House, and on October 8, 2015, both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 were the focus of a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. There are reports that a draft bill addressing differences between H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 is being negotiated; however no new bills have been introduced.", "Although H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address some common issue areas and include some similar provisions, the bills' approaches often differ in important ways. Both bills focus on water projects and management during drought, and do not attempt to address the broad suite of drought impacts and policies (e.g., effects on wildfire and agricultural assistance programs).", "To date, the focus on both bills has centered primarily on provisions related to the management and operations of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP) in California; however, S. 1894 would authorize several programs and activities that would aim to benefit water users and increase water supplies, including water recycling and desalination. H.R. 2898's supporters contend that the bill would, among other things, improve the flexibility and responsiveness of CVP and SWP operations during the current drought in California and beyond. Supporters also contend that activities authorized under H.R. 2898 could increase water supplies to users facing curtailed allocations and improve the science and data collection activities for identifying the effects of operations on listed species. Broadly speaking, supporters of both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 contend that the legislation would allow for maximum available water supplies in a manner that is consistent with existing laws and regulations; however, S. 1894 would provide fewer directives for project operations. Others believe the bills could harm listed species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205).", "H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 have generated both support and opposition from stakeholders and have raised questions about their potential implementation. The bills also raise a number of questions for Congress to consider when addressing drought, including how to reconcile environmental protections with demand for more water and increased pumping from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers Delta to support CVP and SWP water contractors. Related questions include whether the Administration is already maximizing water supplies at federally operated water projects and whether water project management and operations pursuant to the ESA and other laws should be adjusted to better account for water resources challenges. The bills also raise other issues, including what principles and approaches should guide federal involvement in water resources management and how much (if any) support the federal government should provide for drought preparedness and relief efforts. Related topics may include the preferred mix of federal and state leadership in addressing drought; the proper balance of federal investment in surface water storage and in new \"alternative\" water supplies (e.g., water recycling and reuse, desalination); and the geographic scope of drought-related assistance, authorities, and programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Widespread drought is a recurring phenomenon for much of the country, and is especially acute for the We st, where drought conditions such as low water supplies and soil moisture are prevalent. Several western states, including California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, and portions of Montana and Idaho are experiencing extreme\u2014and in some cases exceptional\u2014drought conditions (see Figure 1 ). Congressional interest in addressing water resource management during drought has been heightened due to the effects drought and water constraints have had on agriculture, communities, industry, recreation, natural resources (e.g., rangelands and forests), and the environment in general. ", "Although the federal government invested heavily in the development of water supplies in the 20 th century \u2013 primarily through construction of irrigation projects in the arid West \u2013 the federal government generally defers to state and local governments in surface and groundwater allocation. Federal efforts to prepare for and respond to drought and water supply impacts have thus been inherently limited in recent decades. To date, federal legislative proposals to address current drought conditions have focused on managing federal water projects, supporting new or expanded drought-related projects and programs (including those at the state and local levels), and mitigating the effects of drought and water management on agricultural production, municipal and industrial water supplies, recreational resources, and the environment. Several bills introduced in the 114 th Congress would address these issues. These bills include S. 176 , S. 1837 , S. 1894 , H.R. 2898 , H.R. 2983 , and H.R. 3045 , among others. On July 17, 2015, H.R. 2898 , the Western Water and American Food Security Act, passed the House. For months, certain House and Senate Members have been negotiating new language to resolve differences in the bills and address concerns by federal and state governments. A draft House bill was reportedly circulated during discussions on the FY2016 Omnibus; however, no bill was amended nor introduced. There was also discussion of a new Senate bill addressing outstanding issues and state and federal concerns; however no bill was introduced. Negotiations are reportedly still underway, and new language is expected in the second session of the 114 th Congress.

These bills were the focus of a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on October 8, 2015. Both bills contain key elements of proposed legislation in the 113 th Congress that was not enacted. Broadly summarizing, both bills contain provisions that focus on water infrastructure and water conveyance in California and some west-wide and national programs that address water management and drought. Some of these provisions would be triggered by drought and water conditions or declarations, and others would result in permanent changes in water management. Further, some provisions in the bills are associated with specified states (typically the 17 western states, Hawaii, and Alaska), whereas other provisions may have national application. Many provisions of H.R. 2898 have no specified authorization of appropriations; S. 1894 , by contrast, contains provisions that authorize either funding subject to appropriations or mandatory funding for certain activities. Many provisions in both bills are specific to the projects and programs of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)\u2014in particular, management of the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California\u2014but others are associated with different federal agencies (e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [the Corps], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]). Some provisions would amend existing programs and activities, whereas others would authorize new federal programs and activities. Both bills focus on water projects and management during drought, and do not attempt to address the broad suite of drought impacts and policies (e.g., effects on wildfire and agricultural assistance programs).", "H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 have generated both support and opposition from stakeholders and have raised several questions about their implementation, if passed. For example, with respect to managing federal water projects in California, both bills would direct managers to maximize water supplies for users while adhering to applicable laws and regulations. Some contend such provisions provide water managers the directive and authority to increase water supplies; whereas others assert that this provision could lead to long-term negative effects on species. Some controversy is rooted in how the bills address implementation of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205 ), including water management under federal biological opinions (BiOps) designed to protect Delta smelt and salmon populations (see box on page 9 for information on BiOps). For example, two federal BiOps currently limit operations of the federal CVP and the California State Water Project (SWP) at certain times of the year. These BiOps were developed to assess the effects on threatened and endangered species of proposed changes in the coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP beginning in 2004 and again in 2008. Both BiOps found that the proposed changes in operations, including increased pumping, would likely jeopardize the continued existence of Delta smelt and several salmon and other species listed as threatened or endangered under the federal ESA. As a result, both BiOps include specific actions that limit pumping and call for reservoir releases to protect listed species. Such actions in turn have resulted in reduced water supplies for CVP and SWP water users, particularly in wet or above normal water years. ", "To address CVP and SWP management under the BiOps, both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 would direct agency officials to maximize water supplies, consistent with applicable laws and regulations; however, H.R. 2898 differs from S. 1894 in that it would alter the implementation of portions of federal BiOps for Delta smelt and salmon. For example, H.R. 2898 includes a new definition or standard for determining the status of listed species and would require higher levels of pumping than currently allowed, unless agency officials showed that the increased levels would be harmful to the long-term health of the species. H.R. 2898 also would direct agency officials to pump at the highest levels allowable under existing BiOps for longer periods. Supporters of H.R. 2898 contend that such changes would improve the flexibility and responsiveness of the management and operations of the CVP and SWP and could potentially make available additional water to users facing curtailed allocations. Opponents contend it could have detrimental effects on species in the short and long term, and may actually limit agency flexibility. S. 1894 also directs agency officials to increase pumping at certain times by pumping at the highest range allowable under existing BiOps, but it does not include a new standard for determining the effects of such pumping on species. S. 1894 also is explicit in refraining from altering existing environmental laws.", "The bills contain several similar provisions such as addressing nonnative species, expediting environmental reviews, and increasing science and data collection on listed species, among others.", "The bills differ in their approaches to other policy areas, such as constructing new surface water storage projects and providing support for alternative water supplies, among other things. At the October 2015 Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, the Administration expressed concerns with several provisions in H.R. 2898 and noted several concerns with S. 1894 . However, in speaking on both bills, the Administration disagreed \"with the idea that new legislation will salvage more water than the operators on the ground are wringing from the system every day.\"", "Another question that has been raised is the potential value or effectiveness of each bill providing additional water supplies if a strong El Ni\u00f1o produces above normal precipitation this winter. Some stakeholders have noted that provisions in the bills would afford water managers added flexibility to take advantage of high-precipitation events due to a strong El Ni\u00f1o-influenced weather pattern. Forecasters have noted that although a strong El Ni\u00f1o system could improve water supply conditions, such an event is unlikely to end the current drought. As California experiences its fourth year of drought and the Southwest endures more than a decade of drought conditions, western water management likely will remain an issue before Congress. As a result, elements from one or both of these bills (as well as from other bills) likely will receive continued attention from Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues Specific to Drought and Water in California", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address drought-related water issues specific to California, which is among the states experiencing the worst of the current drought. Many of these provisions focus on the CVP, which is one of the largest and most complex water resources projects built and operated by Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior (DOI). (See Figure 2 .) The project spans hundreds of miles and delivers water stored in reservoirs to farms and cities throughout California's Central Valley. The CVP delivers water to contractors throughout the state, largely serving agricultural water contractors as well as some municipal and industrial (M&I) contractors. A somewhat parallel state system, the California State Water Project (SWP), serves primarily M&I water users and some agricultural users. It is operated in coordination with the CVP. In order to move water through the CVP and SWP, extensive pumping is required. Water deliveries and pumping within the CVP and SWP are often controversial for a number of reasons. ", "Legislation addressing the management of the CVP and SWP is particularly controversial because the coordinated operation and management of these projects involves a complex web of federal and state law\u2014including state water rights priorities; water delivery contracts; federal, state, and local agency policies; and multiagency agreements. Achieving consensus on such legislation is often difficult because a change in any of these factors can affect several parties and interests, including potentially altering the timing or amount of water made available to such parties or the underlying ecosystem. As a result, H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 have raised a number of questions among interested stakeholders. For example, if water pumped from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers' Delta (Delta) is directed to be increased beyond the status quo, where will that increased water come from and what effect might it have on other water users, various species, or in-Delta water quality? Similarly, if involuntary reductions to specified CVP and SWP users are not allowed for certain specified water users (e.g., contractors, or those in certain watersheds as in H.R. 2898 ), could such prohibition result in reduced water supplies or a change in the timing of water available to other water users who are not specified? How would such directions be reconciled with requirements that the CVP be operated in conformity with state water law and under the standard that there shall be \"no redirected water supply or fiscal impacts?\" How can such impacts be avoided, and, if they cannot, who might bear responsibility or pay for unavoidable costs? Lastly, what would be the implications of constructing the state WaterFix project based on the proposed provisions?", "This section discusses proposed legislative changes that would address the drought in California, including changes specific to the CVP and SWP, and those that would affect other projects and areas.

Under some provisions, this issue is addressed. For example, Section 103(e) of H.R. 2898 would direct the Secretary of the Interior (the Secretary) to consider relevant provisions of the Delta smelt BiOp or \"any successor biological opinion\" when implementing Old and Middle Rivers (OMR) flows; however, such language does not appear in all cases.", "H.R. 2898 would also define a new standard to measure the status of species.

The apparent exclusion of indirect actions in the definition under H.R. 2898 could be interpreted to narrow the scope of the law, potentially allowing for the exclusion of some actions covered by current regulations. For instance, it is unclear whether the term negative impact on the long-term survival in H.R. 2898 includes a species' critical habitat, which is considered under the ESA to be essential to the long-term health of the species.

Others contend that this definition would still require compliance with the ESA standard and that it therefore complements existing standards rather than replacing them. For example, proponents of H.R. 5781 in the 113 th Congress, which also included this definition, stated that actions under the bill would be consistent with existing laws and regulations and that existing ESA provisions and regulations therefore would remain in effect. Either way, the standard would likely require new and additional determinations by DOI for listed species.", "The phrase negative impact on the long-term survival used in H.R. 2898 sometimes is qualified by other terms, which has the potential to further alter its meaning. For example, Section 103(e)(2) of H.R. 2898 refers to an \"imminent\" negative impact on long-term survival. The bill provides no definition of what constitutes imminent, and it is unclear how water managers might interpret this term. For instance, some might interpret the term as referring only to effects that could readily be measured in the short term (e.g., take levels at the pumps) and omitting effects that might be realized in the long term.

By contrast, the current BiOp uses data from 2006 to 2008 to determine a cumulative salvage index, which is then used to calculate incidental take levels. The recalculation of incidental take under H.R. 2898 is likely to result in a higher incidental take value (allowing more agency flexibility) than is currently used because Delta smelt levels are higher, on average, when calculated using data since 1993 than when calculated using data from 2006 to 2008.

It also would direct the Secretary of the Interior to document all \"significant decisions\" under the Delta smelt BiOp. This provision appears to set up an active adaptive management approach intended to collect data on smelt distribution in the Bay-Delta and to inform managers how to minimize salvage and maximize pumping. This approach does not appear to be altering the implementation of the BiOp; rather, it is calling for an increase in data collection that eventually may be used to justify modifications to RPAs under the BiOp. It is unclear if these modifications to the Delta smelt BiOp would trigger re-consultation under ESA regulations or if this process would be bypassed and changes implemented immediately.

If a lower flow rate were to be implemented, H.R. 2898 would require a series of conditions to make the change. Some of these conditions would center on obtaining evidence from real-time monitoring and near-term forecasts using salvage models that show a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of the Delta smelt is imminent. H.R. 2898 also would mandate an increase in flow rates above -5,000 cfs (i.e., increased pumping) if information indicated that the higher flow rate would not have an \"imminent negative impact on the long term survival of Delta smelt.\" This analysis would be done for current as well as future BiOps addressing Delta smelt.

For example, some note that the flow rate of -5,000 cfs in the legislation is at the high end of the allowable flows under the Delta smelt BiOp during certain times of the year and might have detrimental effects on Delta smelt and other species. They also contend that the approach of setting a high baseline for flows and then measuring its effect on smelt could harm the species in the short term, decreasing the chances of mitigating effects on the population in the long term. As discussed earlier, the use of undefined qualifiers with the standard included in H.R. 2898 of negative impact on the long-term survival of De lta smelt could create additional uncertainty as to how this standard would be implemented.

A framework for identifying offsetting actions and estimating how each action would affect the survival of salmonid species is provided in Section 202(e) of H.R. 2898 . After the framework is established, Section 202(g) would direct an evaluation of alternative management measures based on the recommended actions and their potential effect on salmonid survival. If the evaluation determines that an alternative measure would offset the existing effects of restricting water supplies\u2014and that implementing the alternative measure is feasible\u2014then the alternative measure would be implemented to increase pumping rates to the maximum extent possible while maintaining equivalent through-Delta survival rates for listed salmon species. These actions would be intended to offset the effects of pumping on salmon populations. Thus, if conservation actions were to result in greater survival for salmon, more pumping could occur. Section 202(h) of H.R. 2898 discusses oversight responsibilities for adaptive management under the BiOp and would direct that operational criteria be developed to coordinate the management of Delta smelt and salmon under the BiOps.", "Supporters of this approach contend that scientific studies suggest that multiple factors affect salmon and Delta smelt in the Bay-Delta, including pumping rates, invasive species, and pollutants, among others. (See Figure 4 .) Mitigating the effects of one or a suite of these factors on the salmon population might increase survival, which could allow for more pumping. Critics of this approach, however, might contend that associating a conservation action with an increase in salmon survival may be difficult to determine because of the multitude of factors affecting fish. They might contend that this approach is not needed because if conservation actions increase survival of Delta smelt and salmon, existing processes to calculate incidental take levels in the BiOps might record a greater abundance of individuals, thus allowing for an increase in pumping. The question of how individual conservation actions might lead to an increase in the abundance of Delta smelt and salmon could be answered, in part, by Section 202(f) of H.R. 2898 , which would direct the Assistant Administrator of NOAA to determine the percentage increase in survival of salmon as a result of alternative conservation measures. While scientifically challenging to consider the number of factors that affect salmon in the Delta, this directive might allow managers to quantify the survival of salmon due to conservation measures. With estimates of survival, it might be easier to calculate incidental take levels of salmon when pumping operations are adjusted. Further, adaptive management could be used under the provisions of both bills to determine how alternative management measures are working.", "S. 1894 would not direct managers to create management regimes that offset the effects of increased pumping beyond what is prescribed in the BiOps. Instead, S. 1894 is tied to the salmon BiOp, which calls for some conservation measures to be implemented but does not propose increasing flow restrictions if these measures are completed. Section 201 of S. 1894 , however, would authorize several actions that aim to help threatened and endangered fish populations. These actions might resemble the alternative conservation measures listed under Section 202(g) of H.R. 2898 . Examples include implementation of nonstructural barriers at Delta Cross Channel gates (see \"Operation of the Delta Cross Channel Gates,\" below), alternative hatchery salmon release strategies, and a trap-and-barge pilot project to increase fish survival in the Delta. S. 1894 also would direct agencies to implement the NOAA Salmon Recovery Plan, which contains several conservation- and flow-related projects to increase salmon populations.

For example, projects and actions meeting the minimum requirements under law for addressing species and water quality might not fully account for long-term effects. In addition, requiring managers to maximize water supplies in implementing projects and actions might be interpreted as narrowing their discretionary decisionmaking flexibility to address long-term effects. Therefore, although maximizing water supplies could benefit water users under drought conditions, the long-term effects on factors such as species viability, recreation, and water quality would be unclear. Further, DOI states that this provision in both bills contains potential legal uncertainties associated with the maximum quantity of water supplies standard.", "The directive to maximize water flows, used in both bills, also might raise the question of how agencies would provide the \"maximum quantity of water supplies possible\" to CVP and other contractors and, relatedly, how they would make such a determination consistent with laws and regulations. Implementation of the provision could be difficult and possibly contentious, according to the Administration's statement of policy. For example, agencies and water users may not agree that particular actions are providing maximum water quantities. Notably, under the status quo, some observers already believe the agencies are maximizing water supplies to the detriment of species, whereas others contend that the agencies are not doing enough to maximize water supplies within the parameters of existing laws and regulations. Further, some advocates fear that the maximization language may result in reduced reservoir levels, thereby creating larger water supply shortages in future years and jeopardizing urban water supplies. ", "In a broad sense, some may respond that if either bill is enacted, agency actions specified under this provision would be directed to maximize water supplies as a priority over other considerations (e.g., water quality or habitat conservation), albeit within parameters allowed under existing laws and regulations. In response to this concern, some might contend that other factors, such as water quality and species needs, are addressed in laws and regulations that would prevent harm.

Section 306 would authorize the Secretaries to manage reverse flows in the OMR at -6,100 cfs or more during specific periods if real-time monitoring indicates that there is no significant negative impact on the long-term survival of Delta smelt. Currently, ESA BiOps for salmon and Delta smelt prohibit OMR flows more negative than -5,000 cfs, which were considered unsafe for imperiled fish species when the BiOps were written. This provision would direct managers to maintain -6,100 cfs flow unless a significant impact on Delta smelt is found. It is unclear how this flow rate would be adjusted if impacts to salmon, water quality, or other species are found. Further, some might question the extent of the term significant as used in the provision. The qualification in part implies that some negative effect would be allowed (up to significant ); however, without the term being defined, it is unclear what type of effects on smelt would be needed to lower flows. Such ambiguity could hinder management decisions or leave them vulnerable to criticism. ", "Section 307 of H.R. 2898 also would authorize a new period of temporary operational flexibility for CVP and SWP operations during the winter. The temporary period would be authorized for 56 cumulative days after October 1 of each water year. Temporary period operations would be triggered during certain high-flow conditions on the Sacramento River\u2014specifically, on days that California DWR determines that the daily average flow of the Sacramento River is at or above 17,000 cfs. Under these conditions, more negative flows could occur than otherwise would be allowed on the OMR under the BiOps. However, Section 307(a) of H.R. 2898 would appear to direct flows that lead to a daily average of -7,500 cfs over the temporary period of operational flexibility. This provision likely would result in temporarily increased pumping and additional water supplies for some CVP and SWP contractors compared to what otherwise would be available. ", "Some might question whether additional water supplies exported out of the Delta during this time could lead to short-term or long-term water quality issues. Freshwater flows to the ocean not only help maintain a salinity gradient in the Delta, but also provide dilution of other water pollutants from run-off or other sources. If water flows to the ocean are significantly reduced, the salinity gradient might move further east into the Delta and provide less freshwater for other purposes, potentially causing negative effects to the ecosystem and water quality. However, if water flows are sufficiently high to the ocean to maintain or surpass the desired salinity gradient, and other water quality factors remain stable, then increased pumping might have a diminished effect on water quality. ", "The effects of CVP and SWP operations on water quality and flows for species are addressed, in part, by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). H.R. 2898 states that the Secretaries actions under this section (Section 307) should be consistent with applicable regulatory requirements under state law, which addresses water quality. ", "Section 307(c) and (d) of H.R. 2898 would limit the extent of these flows due to environmental effects. For example:", "Section 307(c) would authorize the Secretaries to impose requirements under the salmon and Delta smelt BiOps during the period of temporary operational flexibility if they determine that the requirements would avoid a significant negative impact on the long-term survival of listed species (in the short term) beyond what is allowed under ESA, as long as the requirements do not impose a reduction in water supplies for CVP and SWP users. It is unclear what baseline of water supplies for users is being referred to in this provision. Would the limit be a reduction from -5,000 cfs, the amount prescribed in the BiOps, or from -7,500 cfs, as prescribed for temporary operational flexibility? Managers may impose any requirements under the BiOps during the period of temporary operational flexibility provided that they do not reduce water supplies for the CVP and SWP. It is unclear what requirements could be implemented in situations where there is an effect on species, since water flows to CVP and SWP apparently would not be reduced. Section 307(d) would require actions to be consistent with state law and regulations and would allow for \"less negative\" OMR flows (i.e., less pumping) during the initial sediment flush each water year \"for a minimum duration.\" This approach might be undertaken to avoid movement of Delta smelt that could increase entrainment at CVP and SWP pumps during this time. Section 307(d)(3) would require that Section 307 not affect implementation of the salmon BiOp from April 1 to May 31 of each year, except to provide emergency water supplies without resulting in additional adverse effects \"beyond those authorized under\" the ESA. Thus, the application of the salmon BiOp would be effective for a least a two-month period, unless the Secretary of Commerce determined that such actions would not be in violation of the federal ESA. It is unclear how Section 307 would affect the application of the salmon BiOp during other parts of the year. Section 307(d)(4) would direct the Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with FWS and NMFS, to undertake a monitoring program that generally would attempt to identify any negative impacts associated with the temporary flexibility being authorized under the section, including exceedance of incidental take levels under the ESA. It also would direct the Commissioner to identify actions to mitigate any negative impacts of the section. This authority would not call for modifying temporary flexibility if negative effects are found, but it would call for identifying actions to mitigate the impacts. The provision is silent on what these actions might be and if they might involve reducing water flows. Section 307(e) would provide that CVP and SWP operations resulting in flows \"less negative\" than -7,500 cfs (i.e., less pumping) before the 56 cumulative days of operational flexibility authorized would not be counted toward the 56-day cumulative period in the legislation. Therefore, only days with a daily average flow of -7,500 cfs would be counted toward the 56-day cumulative total. This provision would provide a greater chance that a flow rate of -7,500 cfs would be used for at least 56 days. Data for 2014 flow rates at the Freeport gauge on the Sacramento River indicate that this temporary operational flexibility could have occurred for approximately 33 days, when average daily flows were above 17,000 cfs. H.R. 2898 would direct the commissioner to use emergency ESA consultation procedures if actions necessary to implement this provision would exceed 56 days, with certain limitations. Section 307(g) would stipulate that in making determinations under this section, the Secretaries would not be required to provide supporting detail at a greater level than feasible within the time frame given to make a determination.

The RIFIA approach in S. 1894 also would shift a larger share of costs to nonfederal interests: it would authorize low-interest loans to fund half of the costs of qualifying projects, but the other half would be financed on the private market. ", "The use of the RIFIA approach itself brings up a number of other issues. Several issues that arose during debate on the WIFIA provisions of WRRDA 2014 could come up in connection with consideration of the RIFIA provisions of S. 1894 , including the role of states; whether state water infrastructure financing agencies should be eligible to receive RIFIA assistance; and whether a portion of the RIFIA assistance should be set aside for projects in small communities. ", "The RIFIA provisions also raise federal budgetary and revenue issues. CBO typically scores legislation reported by congressional committees for its effects on discretionary and mandatory, or direct, spending. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) typically scores such legislation for its effects on revenue. Revenue loss to the U.S. Treasury is subject to pay-as-you-go procedures. The JCT estimated that the WIFIA provisions of WRRDA 2014 would reduce revenues because states would be expected to issue tax-exempt bonds for project costs not covered by WIFIA assistance. To avoid the pay-as-you-go problem, Congress included in WRRDA 2014 a provision prohibiting recipients of WIFIA assistance from issuing tax-exempt bonds for the non-WIFIA portions of project costs. However, in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act ( P.L. 114-94 ), Congress repealed this restriction, in response to criticism by stakeholder groups. The proposed RIFIA provisions would not bar the use of municipal tax-exempt bonds to finance the nonfederal share of projects. However, S. 1894 states that RIFIA may not provide assistance unless sufficient funds have been appropriated to offset any decrease in federal revenue resulting from the use by a state or local government of municipal tax-exempt bonds or specified tax credit bonds for the nonfederal portions of a project. The bill does not identify legislative offsets for any such decrease in federal revenue. A potential issue for Congress is how the offset requirement in S. 1894 might affect the legislation or implementation of the proposed RIFIA program."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Broader Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["This section discusses broader or crosscutting issues for Congress that the bills pose.

This section summarizes some of these provisions and discusses their potential implications for the ESA. ", "The broader implication for ESA under both bills is that agencies would be managing water supplies to the maximum extent possible (according to varying standards set in each bill) for users. It could be interpreted that water needs for Delta smelt and salmon will just be met according to parameters set in the bills. This approach to addressing the resource needs of species listed under ESA could set a precedent for how other listed species are managed with respect to limited resources. This perspective is tempered by proponents of the bills who state that these provisions would support the implementation of ESA and that neither bill would amend ESA.", "Both bills contain provisions that could limit the discretion of a federal agency to manage water resources to conserve and recover listed species under the ESA. For example, the bills would authorize the approval of projects and activities that aim to maximize water supplies while remaining consistent with existing laws and regulations. This provision might be interpreted to limit agencies' discretion when operating the CVP by directing them to maximize water supplies. This provision could make anticipating and responding to the water needs of species, especially in anticipation of long-term effects on the species, a challenge for federal agencies managing water. For example, maximizing water supplies in the present could have future consequences for species that might not be detected immediately or cannot be addressed before the effects on the population are realized. Furthermore, maximizing water supplies for users might not allow for a buffer to guard against unforeseen environmental circumstances that could affect listed species. This possibility could be countered, in part, by real-time monitoring of species populations, which would be authorized in both bills. ", "Both bills would authorize an increase in data collection and monitoring of Delta smelt and salmon, which would likely improve the scientific understanding of how water operations affect these species. H.R. 2898 would authorize several activities to increase the real-time monitoring of listed species and measure the effects of water operations on the species' populations. In several cases, the data from these activities could be used to alter water operations to increase either water for users or water for species. Proponents of these provisions contend that they will increase scientific support and transparency for water operations. Although critical of several provisions in H.R. 2898 regarding modifications to the implementation of the BiOps, DOI stated that provisions would improve data gathering, monitoring, and scientific analyses that would benefit real-time monitoring and provide a framework for discussion. This could support adaptive management efforts to manage fish in the Delta, and reflect efforts to incorporate adaptive management in other ecosystems where endangered species are located (e.g., the Lower Colorado River). ", "Provisions under H.R. 2898 that would alter some aspects of the Delta smelt BiOp and change the implementation of the salmon BiOp have caused some to contend that H.R. 2898 , if passed, would set a new precedent for how ESA is implemented, put listed species in peril, and politicize the implementation of ESA. Others note that H.R. 2898 would create conflicting directives because some sections would be implemented in a manner consistent with ESA and other sections would direct implementation of operations beyond those allowed under current ESA BiOps (e.g., specifying pumping rates and other activities not currently allowed), potentially causing harm to listed species. These contentions could have nationwide implications for how species are treated under BiOps. For example, some might refer to H.R. 2898 , if passed, as a precedent for proposing exceptions to BiOps created under ESA guidelines on a species-by-species basis. Proponents of H.R. 2898 contend that provisions addressing Delta smelt and salmon would be implemented within the framework of the existing BiOps. Further, they assert that H.R. 2898 would not amend ESA. ", "Other examples of provisions in H.R. 2898 that would alter the implementation of the BiOps include creating a new standard for measuring the effects of projects and activities on listed species, not adhering to seasonally based triggers mandating variable flow rates for salmon under the RPAs of the salmon BiOp, and authorizing a new method to calculate incidental take for Delta smelt. Supporters of the bill contend that changes proposed under H.R. 2898 are needed to update the BiOps with new data, science, and increased monitoring to maximize water supplies for users. Critics argue that these changes would override existing BiOps and increase stress on fish populations that have been steadily declining in the last few years. They also claim that these provisions could have broad implications for other listed species. ", "The overall approach to addressing the needs of Delta smelt and salmon under H.R. 2898 would contrast with the approach taken by the Delta smelt and salmon BiOps. Under the current BiOps, the consultation process determines if a project will affect the species or its critical habitat. If the project will do so, the Secretary will suggest reasonable and prudent alternatives that would not jeopardize the continued existence of the species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of its habitat. H.R. 2898 would set a baseline level for flows to maximize water supplies to CVP and SWP water contractors and then work from that baseline to determine if the flows are harming listed species. This method would require changing flow parameters under the BiOps and creating a new approach to measuring the effects of flows on species. This approach could be interpreted as shifting the responsibility for determining the effects of water operations on species to water managers on a continual basis, rather than relying on analyses done in preparation of the BiOps, which could be based on outdated science. This shift would allow for more operational flexibility for water supply purposes and would increase the data collected on species that could be considered for setting operations. Proponents of this approach state that these proposed changes are within the framework of the existing BiOps.", "Critics of this approach state that the baseline level of flows proposed under H.R. 2898 is higher than that mandated under the BiOps and could have unknown short- and long-term environmental consequences for species. Further, they contend that this approach could create situations in which the effect of water flows on species might not be realized until after the species has been harmed. DOI also has stated that the approach proposed under H.R. 2898 would include specific operations that appear to be inconsistent with ESA and result in conditions that would be detrimental to species."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maximizing Water Supplies for Users", "paragraphs": ["The objective of both bills appears to be to increase water deliveries and reliability for water contractors, in particular water users south of the Delta. Neither bill contains assurances for delivering a certain amount of water or quantifies an amount of additional water to be generated by activities authorized in the bill. Based on this uncertainty, some may question how much more water might be delivered to users by each bill, if enacted. Both bills contain broad language that would direct agencies to maximize water supplies. It is uncertain how much water could be delivered to users from specified projects authorized under each bill and other existing projects. Both bills would provide federal agencies with broad discretion to conduct operations that would maximize water use while still adhering to state and federal laws and regulations. It is unclear how agencies would provide the \"maximum quantity of water supplies possible\" to CVP and other contractors and, relatedly, how they would make such a determination consistent with laws and regulations.

For example, agencies and water users may not agree that particular actions would provide maximum water quantities. Notably, under the status quo, some observers already believe that the agencies are maximizing water supplies to the detriment of species, whereas others contend that the agencies are not doing enough to maximize water supplies within the parameters of existing laws and regulations.", "Some may question if the actions that would result from these bills and the broad direction to maximize water supplies for users might have unintended or long-term consequences for species and ecosystem factors in the Bay-Delta. Some contend that if managers were required to maximize water supplies in implementing projects, their discretionary flexibility to make decisions would be narrower. Therefore, maximizing water supplies would aim to benefit water users under drought conditions; however the long-term effects of these actions on other factors, such as species viability, recreation, and water quality would be unclear.

For example, Section 312 of S. 1894 would authorize support to a wide range of projects but would set a nonfederal cost share of 75% for nonfederal projects and 50% for federal projects. Such a requirement would be in notable contrast to past policies, in which the federal government has funded 100% of the construction costs for federally authorized water projects but has required that project beneficiaries repay their shares of the federal investment for these projects over 50-year periods (sometimes without interest).", "Coordination among federal and state governments (as well as other interests) also may be of interest to Congress. For example, coordinated operations between the federal and state governments are extremely important in determining water deliveries in California's CVP, as well as in other drought-stricken areas. Issues associated with addressing federal, state, and local coordination, including the extent to which the federal government can or should defer to state and local laws and decisions, may receive consideration in drought-related legislation.

This funding would need to be repaid by project beneficiaries in accordance with laws governing Reclamation projects. For its part, S. 1894 would authorize significant new discretionary and mandatory funding in various programmatic areas; some of these funds would not have to be repaid.
