Congress has appropriated more than $7 billion since FY2008 to CCS activities at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The Obama Administration has promulgated rules on CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-burning power plants and entered into a global agreement to limit CO2 emissions. Congress remains divided over those executive branch decisions. DOE, however, has continued to embrace CCS as part of the Administration's strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants.

Nine individual projects garnered approximately $2.65 billion of the $3.4 billion\u2014about 78%. Each of the nine projects was awarded more than $100 million, and these projects illustrate that DOE prioritized large-scale demonstration projects with Recovery Act funding. The lion's share of funding went to DOE's flagship CCS project FutureGen, which was awarded nearly $1 billion from the Recovery Act.", "Authority to spend Recovery Act funds expired on September 30, 2015. Of $3.4 billion allocated for CCS activities, approximately $1.4 billion went unspent as of the spending deadline. The largest portion of the unspent funds, $795 million, was intended for FutureGen, which DOE suspended in February 2015. FutureGen faced various impediments that led to its cancellation, including delays in receiving required injection well permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, court challenges to its plan to sell electricity, and a lawsuit from an environmental advocacy group. Several other large CCS demonstration projects also were canceled, suspended, or failed to spend all of their Recovery Act funding before the 2015 deadline.", "Some stakeholders argue that DOE's CCS programs have been inadequately funded, providing less incentive than they should for deploying CCS. One study concluded that even the financial boost from the Recovery Act was insufficient. To be sure, large-scale CCS projects are complex endeavors, requiring substantial capital investment and multiyear planning and construction schedules. However, the conclusion that more federal funding by itself would be sufficient to support development and commercialization of CCS technology may be overly simplistic. DOE acknowledges that many of the Recovery Act-funded projects were technologically difficult and challenging, but it does not consider the relinquishment of unspent funds to signify project failure. DOE notes that due to its spending on CCS and its partnerships with industry, the costs of capturing CO2 have dropped significantly and its projects have stored more than 10 million metric tons of CO2.", "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) final rule for reducing CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel power plants, part of the Administration's Clean Power Plan, found plants incorporating partial CCS to be the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER).

Technical feasibility, however, is just one factor of many that determine whether a project successfully reaches its goal of producing electricity and capturing CO2 at commercial scale. EPA states that implementing partial CCS in the rule is likely to boost future research and development in CCS technologies and to make CCS implementation more efficacious and cost-effective.

DOE states that the mission for the DOE Office of Fossil Energy is \"to ensure the availability of ultra-clean (near-zero emissions), abundant, low-cost domestic energy from coal to fuel economic prosperity, strengthen energy security, and enhance environmental quality.\" Over the past several years, the DOE Fossil Energy Research and Development Program increasingly shifted activities performed under its coal program toward emphasizing CCS as the main focus. For example, the coal program represented between 60% and 70% of total Fossil Energy Research and Development appropriations from FY2010 to FY2015\u2014even without Recovery Act funding\u2014indicating that CCS has come to dominate coal RD&D at DOE.

A preliminary assessment of Recovery Act-funded CCS projects might help to inform lawmakers about factors that affect the rate of progress of developing and demonstrating CCS technology.

EPA based its claim, in part, on an example of demonstrated, full-scale operations in the electricity-generating industry, as well as on other smaller projects that are reasonably predictive of results at full scale. In a separate rule, also part of the CPP, EPA found that CCS was not the BSER for existing power plants.", "Several of the projects cited by EPA in the final rule received Recovery Act funding and are discussed below. The project cited in most detail to support EPA's final rule, however, was Boundary Dam, a Canadian venture that is the world's only full-scale, fully integrated, and currently operating power plant with CCS. The Boundary Dam project received about $240 million from the Canadian federal government; the overall cost was about $1.3 billion, according to one source.

Accordingly, Table 1 shows the Recovery Act funding amounts in one column for 2009, but those funds were available through FY2015. Zeroes in the columns for FY2010 through FY2015 indicate that no new Recovery Act funds were made available during those years.

Activities in this category include programs pursuing fossil energy R&D and support activities. The largest activity is Program Direction ($114.2 million in FY2016), which provides DOE headquarters support and federal field and contractor support of the overall fossil energy R&D programs. These activities support CCS-related activities directly and indirectly. The next-largest activities are Natural Gas Technologies ($43 million in FY2016) and Unconventional Fossil ($20.3 million in FY2016), which support collaborative research to foster safe and prudent development of shale gas resources, the reduction of methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure, and research on gas hydrates.

The remaining four projects listed in Table 2 are large, industrial-scale demonstration projects under the ICCS program. The projects in each category were awarded more than $100 million. They are listed to illustrate that DOE prioritized large-scale demonstration projects with Recovery Act funding. For comparison, the ICCS projects not included in Table 2 (combined in the All Other Projects category; see Appendix for detailed listing by project) are smaller in scope and received Recovery Act funds in amounts ranging from less than $1 million to $72 million, averaging about $12 million.", "The CCPI program originally provided federal support to new coal technologies that helped power plants to cut sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury pollutants. As CCS became the focus of coal RD&D, the CCPI program shifted to reducing GHG emissions by boosting plant efficiencies and capturing CO 2 . The ICCS program demonstrates carbon capture technology for the non-power plant industrial sector. Both these program areas focus on the demonstration component of RD&D. FutureGen was unique as originally conceived because it was intended to include the full CCS spectrum\u2014capture, transportation, and storage\u2014as one state-of-the-art, unified facility.

That situation led, in turn, to uncertainty about the alliance's ability to secure private-sector funding to make up the rest of the project costs after Recovery Act funding was exhausted. The FutureGen Alliance had expended nearly $200 million of Recovery Act funding at the time of cancellation, leaving approximately $795 million unspent ( Table 2 ).", "By itself, FutureGen's cancellation resulted in, by far, the largest dollar amount of CCS-related Recovery Act funds left unspent: $795 million of a total of $1.4 billion unspent overall, or 57%. Including FutureGen, approximately 43% of all CCS-related Recovery Act funds were unspent as of the September 30, 2015, deadline ( Table 2 ). Excluding FutureGen (i.e., subtracting $995 million from the total awarded and $795 million from the total left unspent), the percentage of unspent-to-awarded funds improves to about 26% for CCS-related Recovery Act-funded projects. In addition to FutureGen, two other projects listed in Table 2 were canceled or suspended: Leucadia Energy, LLC, an ICCS major demonstration project, and American Electric Power (AEP) Mountaineer. These projects spent 5% and 12% of their total Recovery Act awards, respectively. FutureGen spent close to $200 million, or 20% of its total project award.

Bush Administration in 2003, the plant would have been a coal-gasification facility that would have produced and sequestered between 1 million and 2 million tons of CO 2 annually. The project changed fundamentally five years later in January 2008, when DOE announced that it was \"restructuring\" the FutureGen program away from a single, state-of-the-art \"living laboratory\" of integrated R&D technologies\u2014a single plant\u2014to pursue instead a new strategy of multiple commercial demonstration projects. After passage of the Recovery Act, FutureGen changed again. DOE under the Obama Administration announced its plans to build FutureGen 2.0, which differed from the original concept for the plant. FutureGen 2.0 aimed to retrofit an existing power plant in Meridosia, IL, with oxy-combustion technology rather than to build a new, state-of-the-art plant.

For example, many other CCS projects plan to sell the captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a long-standing practice of injecting CO 2 into aging oil fields to boost production. In contrast, FutureGen planned to inject CO 2 into the subsurface for permanent sequestration. To do so, the project required a first-of-its-kind injection permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2014a Class VI Underground Injection Control well permit, issued under authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act ( P.L. 93-523 ). Projects that inject CO 2 for EOR purposes are not required to obtain Class VI permits. EPA issued its first Class VI well permit to FutureGen on September 2, 2014, four years after Recovery Act funding was awarded and only one year before the deadline for spending Recovery Act funds. ", "In addition, FutureGen encountered challenges in court that may have contributed to the project's delay. For example, the project received approval in late December 2012 from the Illinois Commerce Commission for a power procurement plan that would have guaranteed that utilities would purchase only FutureGen-generated electricity for 20 years. That action faced a challenge from the Illinois Competitive Energy Association, which represents retail electricity suppliers, among others. FutureGen survived the first challenge in the Illinois Appellate Court in July 2014, but in 2014 the Illinois Supreme Court agreed to consider another appeal. The court had not decided the issue by the time DOE canceled FutureGen funding.", "FutureGen also faced a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club against the project. The environmental advocacy group argued that FutureGen did not obtain the proper well permit and would be in violation of the Clean Air Act (P.L. 88-206). The CEO of the FutureGen Industrial Alliance, Inc., Ken Humphreys, filed a motion with the Illinois Pollution Control Board to expedite the review of the case. Humphreys testified that \"time is of the essence in this case,\" and that \"one billion dollars ($1B) in contractually-obligated government funding and seven hundred million ($700M) in commercial financing is at stake if the case is not resolved expeditiously.\" His testimony continued, \"The Claim casts a dark shadow over the ongoing commercial financing effort, which raises investor concern.\" Further, Humphreys acknowledged that major construction spending could not occur prior to resolution of the lawsuit. ", "The court challenge, lawsuit, and other actions likely contributed to delays in construction and the concomitant expenditure of Recovery Act funds. Those delays eventually led to the project's termination. FutureGen was a technically challenging project as well, but the technical challenges do not appear to have been causes for undue delay in project construction. Rather, uncertainty in the legal, financial, and regulatory spheres probably were more acute challenges to keeping the project on schedule to meet its September 30, 2015 spending deadline.

It was manifest in DOE's allocation of approximately $2.65 billion of the $3.4 billion in Recovery Act funds to nine large-scale demonstration projects (listed in Table 2 ).

Nevertheless, the conclusion that more federal funding by itself\u2014per the quote above\u2014is what is needed to support development and commercialization of CCS technology may be overly simplistic. The ability for projects to achieve \"financial close\" goes beyond lack of sufficient funding for several projects discussed above, notably FutureGen, the AEP Mountaineer project, and the other projects listed in Table 3 that were initially selected to receive Recovery Act funding but withdrew for various reasons. Further, delays in the timelines for the Hydrogen Energy California and Summit Texas Clean Energy projects, under DOE CCPI Round III, led to each project relinquishing more than $100 million in Recovery Act funding. The complexity and risk inherent in each of these projects no doubt affected the projects' ability to attract private financing, which may have led to project delay, but financial considerations were one of many challenges.", "FutureGen, in particular, faced various impediments that led to its cancellation despite receiving nearly $1 billion of Recovery Act funds. As briefly discussed above (see \" Challenges and Delays \"), these impediments included delays in receiving the required injection-well permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, court challenges to its plan to sell electricity, and a lawsuit from an environmental advocacy group. FutureGen, a genuine first-mover project with a more than 10-year lifespan, may have been the highest-profile CCS project in the United States, which could have drawn additional attention from CCS opponents. For these reasons and likely others, FutureGen was unable to move its construction schedule forward at a sufficient pace, despite having more than $990 million in Recovery Act funds available to expend over a five-year period. At the end of five years, FutureGen had spent only 20% of its Recovery Act award."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "paragraphs": ["Of the four CCPI large-scale CCS demonstration projects listed in Table 2 , three projects\u2014Hydrogen Energy California, Summit Texas Clean Energy, and NRG Energy/Petra Nova\u2014are still viable and could eventually become operational. Two of the three projects had to return about $226 million of the $486 million in awarded Recovery Act funds, however, which put further strain on private-sector financing for those projects. Including FutureGen and AEP Mountaineer, the five electricity-generating large-scale CCS demonstration projects expended 55% of awarded Recovery Act funds and left the remaining 45% unspent. Of the CCPI projects funded by Recovery Act dollars, NRG Energy/Petra Nova was the only one to expend all its Recovery Act-awarded funds. This project has begun construction and appears to be closest to becoming operational of all the CCPI Round III projects.", "Of the three ICCS large-scale demonstration projects in Table 2 , only one\u2014Leucadia Energy, LLC\u2014failed to expend its Recovery Act award and left about $249 million unspent. The Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., large demonstration project is currently operational and has captured and stored more than 2 million metric tons of CO 2 since late 2012. The Archer Daniels Midland large demonstration project is scheduled to begin operations sometime in 2016. All other ICCS projects appear to have expended their Recovery Act funds prior to the September 30, 2015, deadline.", "The example of the Kemper County Energy Facility in Kemper County, MS, an integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant that will be owned and operated by Mississippi Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company, provides insight into several Recovery Act-funded projects. DOE awarded Southern Company Services a cooperative agreement under the CCPI Round II program, prior to enactment of the Recovery Act and the CCPI Round III awards, to develop gasification technology called Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG TM ). The Kemper project may be the first electricity-generating power plant with CCS to begin operations in the United States. DOE awarded Kemper $270 million, a figure comparable to Recovery Act awards for CCPI and ICCS large demonstration projects shown in Table 2 . Similar to many of those projects, the complex Kemper project experienced schedule delays and cost overruns. Currently, the projected start date is the third quarter of 2016, and the project's overall cost has increased from less than $3 billion to more than $6.6 billion. The technical challenges for a first-mover demonstration plant of its kind, and the concomitant escalating cost estimates, lend credence to the shape of the cost curve trend shown in Figure 1 , in which demonstration plants are at peak cost between development and deployment. Most, if not all, of the large CCPI projects likely fall along that portion of the cost curve depicted in Figure 1 . In contrast to the Recovery Act-funded projects listed in Table 2 , the Kemper project did not face a September 30, 2015 spending deadline.", "DOE acknowledges that many of the Recovery Act-funded projects were technologically difficult and challenging, but it does not consider the relinquishment of unspent funds to signify project failure; rather, DOE takes the relinquishment of funds to mean that the projects simply did not meet the requirement to spend the funds by the deadline. DOE notes that due to its spending on CCS and its partnerships with industry, the costs of capturing CO 2 have dropped significantly and its projects have stored more than 10 million metric tons of CO 2 .", "Despite these achievements, some stakeholders conclude that the DOE CCS program \"has not reached critical mass with regard to the commercialization of CCS in the time frame needed to meet stated U.S. goals for CO 2 emissions reductions.\" Even though Recovery Act funding predominantly targeted large-scale demonstration projects, \"significantly more CCS/CCUS pilot and demonstration projects are needed in order to commercially deploy the technology.... Without adequate demonstration, there can be no commercialization.\" ", "The level of funding for CCS projects is a perennial issue for Congress. Given that a substantial amount of appropriated funding through the Recovery Act for CCS demonstration projects went unspent, Congress may examine the broader policy, financial, and regulatory factors that posed challenges to several large Recovery Act-funded demonstration projects and led to their delay or cancellation.
