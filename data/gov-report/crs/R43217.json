Remittances represent a substantial percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in several developing countries. Whether remittances can be leveraged to support U.S. foreign development policy is another issue of concern to some Members of Congress. Some analysts argue that since remittances are comprised of private transfers between family members and friends, U.S. efforts should be directed to reducing the transaction costs involved in remittance transactions. Others note the potential beneficial development aspects of remittances, including promoting investment and access to financial services, and encouraging government programs to help stimulate these positive effects.", "Remittances and U.S. Immigration Policy. Members may want to consider the interplay of U.S. remittance policy and U.S. immigration policy. A major goal of U.S. policy on remittances is increasing the attractiveness of regulated remittance systems to potential remittance customers, without regard to their legal status. Thus, U.S. Treasury officials allow remittance providers to accept certain foreign-issued means of identification to meet their customer identification requirements. Some Members argue that policies like these may undermine U.S. immigration laws and advocate restricting remittances to those with legal status under U.S. immigration laws.

There are ongoing efforts to improve remittance data. ", "Remittances are currently defined as the sum of three entries in the IMF's annual Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook: workers' remittances; compensation of employees; and migrants' transfers. ", "W orkers' remittances are defined by the IMF as transfers (cash or in kind) by migrants who are employed and considered resident in another country. If the migrants live in the host country for one year or longer, they are considered residents, regardless of their immigration status. C ompensation of employees includes wages, salaries, and other benefits of border, seasonal, and other nonresident workers (such as local staff of embassies) away from their home country for less than a year. Migrants' transfers are the net worth of migrants' assets that are transfers from one country to another at the time of migration (for a period of at least one year), such as in the case of temporary workers.", "A remittance transaction typically involves a sender, a recipient, intermediaries in both countries, and a payment system used by the intermediaries ( Figure 1 ). Remittances can be sent through informal or formal channels. Informal channels have been labeled by various terms, including \"alternative remittance systems,\" \"underground banks,\" and \"informal value transfer systems.\" The most well-known is hawala (hawala means \"transfer\" in Arabic), which originated in India and has been in use in South Asia and the Middle East for several hundred years. These services are less expensive than formal banking or money transfer arrangements, can provide anonymity for all parties involved, and can reach countries where there is no formal banking sector, in some cases even arranging for hand delivery of the cash. While most use these systems for legitimate purposes, their lack of documentation and anonymous, informal nature may make them attractive for money laundering and/or terrorist financing purposes. ", "Formal channels involve intermediaries that are officially licensed to operate money transfer businesses. These consist of banks; non-bank financial institutions, such as credit unions, savings and loan institutions, and post-offices; and money service businesses such as Western Union or MoneyGram. Increased use of technology in developing countries has also facilitated the use of mobile and other alternative payment options.", "The price of sending a remittance can vary significantly. A number of factors affect the transfer fee charged, including the regulatory and administrative costs, the volume sent, the transfer mechanism, the receiving country's financial infrastructure, and the level of market competition (in both the sending and receiving country). In addition, the exchange rate used in the transaction can significantly affect the amount actually delivered to the recipient. ", "For the most part, the cost of sending remittances has declined slightly in recent years, but substantial progress would need to be made to meet the G8 target of 5% of total cost set in 2009. According to World Bank analysis, the global average remittance cost has declined from 9.81% of the total transaction in 2008 to 7.53% during the first quarter of 2016. Among the major economies, the United States is among the least costly from which to send money ( Figure 2 ). For the first quarter of 2016, the average cost to send a remittance from the United States was 6.04% of the transaction. The World Bank also tracks the cost of sending remittances from the main remittance providers. Recent data show that banks continue to be the most expensive providers, followed by post offices.

According to the World Bank, remittances to developing countries are estimated to have risen to $432 billion in 2015. Official remittance figures do not include informal remittance flows, which may account for an additional 35% to 75% of total remittance flows.

While remittances serve as an important component of a diversified mix of external finance in emerging market and middle-income countries, for the poorest countries, remittances are an essential anti-poverty tool, comprising a significant share of national economic activity. Tajikistan, for example, has been dependent on remittances since an armed conflict between 1992 and 1998 claimed over 100,000 lives, destroying the economic infrastructure. Approaching 20 years after the end of the conflict, remittances account for around 42% of national GDP.", "In nine countries, the total value of remittances exceeds 20% of their total GDP.

MSBs cover a broad variety of enterprises ranging from the small and simple to large firms with numerous branches or outlets. MSBs include the U.S. Postal Service, because it issues money orders. Western Union and MoneyGram are the two largest money transmitter companies and their agents are often located in a wide variety of other businesses, including supermarkets, check cashing agents, gas stations, liquor stores, convenience stores, and currency exchange offices. The main reason foreign remittance customers use MSBs is that they are often \"unbanked\"; that is, they do not have an account with a depository financial institution.

Another constraint for bank provision of remittances is underdeveloped financial systems in many of the largest remittance-receiving countries. Since many recipients lack a bank account, they prefer to collect remittance money in cash. International wire transfer, however, is only an option when both the sender and receiver have access to deposit accounts at depository institutions. Unlike the \"closed loop\" payment system used by MSBs, banks and credit unions generally use \"open loop\" payment systems such as wire transfer systems and correspondent banking channels. MSBs, by acting through retail store locations such as grocery stores, often have more extensive distribution networks in the countries in which they operate than do traditional financial institutions.", "As consumer demand for remittances has grown over the past two decades, banks and credit unions have shown a greater interest in directly providing remittance services to consumers. Remittance services can be a way to bring low-income migrants into the financial mainstream and introduce them to other financial products and services, such as interest-bearing savings accounts, checking accounts for paying bills (a replacement for money orders), free and secure check cashing services, and small dollar loans, among other services. Credit union participation has also been encouraged by the development of the World Council of Credit Unions' International Remittance Network, a credit union network for international money transfers.", "To generate more remittances business, since 1998, U.S. depository institutions have had the option of transmitting remittance transfers through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. The ACH system is a system that clears and settles batched electronic transfers for participating depository institutions. Since financial transfers are batched together and sent on a fixed schedule, banks can charge a lower price than for traditional international wire transfers, which are sent individually. The originating institution combines the payment instructions from its various customers and sends them in a batch to an ACH operator\u2014the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's FedGlobal Payments Service or the Clearing House's Electronic Payments Network\u2014for processing.

Importantly, remittances are a private transaction, and thus any official policy efforts, they argue, should be narrowly focused on reducing the cost of remittance transactions and creating additional opportunities for labor migration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remittances and U.S. Immigration Policy", "paragraphs": ["Members may consider the interplay of U.S. remittance policy efforts and U.S. immigration policy. Some Members of Congress, however, have raised concerns that current customer identification policies, which do not require a remittance customer to provide documentation of legal U.S. immigration status, may undermine efforts to enforce U.S. immigration laws. In light of this concern, Senator David Vitter has introduced S. 79 , Remittance Status Verification Act of 2015 , that would require remittance providers to impose a 7% fine on any sender of remittances that is unable to provide documentation of their legal status under U.S. immigration laws. Other efforts to restrict the ability of migrants to send remittances have been passed at the state level. ", "Some analysts argue, however, that restricting remittances through taxes or additional customer identification rules would not deter migration to the United States and would only drive remittances underground to informal methods of money transfer. In addition to increased AML/CFT risk related to informal money transfer systems, shifting remittance flows to informal channels may impede policy efforts to use remittances as a means to promote access to financial services."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
