Under employee choice, employers may select a metal level of coverage (e.g., silver or gold) in which all QHPs at that level are made available to its employees.

When an issuer provides premium information to an employer, the issuer may offer the employer the per-member premiums, or the issuer may offer the employer composite premiums. Composite premiums are average enrollee premium amounts; to develop composite premiums, an issuer divides the total premium amount (based on the summation of per-member rating) by the total number of enrollees to develop an average premium amount per enrollee.

To the extent that such features attracted small employers and issuers to the SHOP exchanges, the SHOP exchanges were potentially a vehicle for increasing small employer offer rates and reducing the cost of small group coverage by increasing competition in the market. However, as discussed in various parts of this report, implementation of many of the aforementioned features was delayed in 2014.

ACA included many health insurance market reforms that apply to coverage sold in the small group market (including through SHOP exchanges). For example, beginning in 2014, small group health plans have to cover the essential health benefits (EHBs). The EHBs are a defined set of benefits, and covering the EHBs may increase the cost of some health plans. To the extent a small employer finds obtaining ACA-compliant coverage unappealing (perhaps because compliance is seen as increasing the cost of the coverage), the small employer may choose not to purchase coverage to offer to its employees. Or the small employer may choose to self-insure, provided it is allowed to do so under state law, because self-insured employers can offer coverage that does not have to comply with all of ACA's market reforms. Either way, the small employer will not purchase coverage in the small group market, and will have no reason to use a SHOP exchange. ", "In 2013, media reports indicated that some small employers took advantage of the ability to early renew . Provided it was allowed under state law, an issuer could allow a small employer that would typically renew its plan in 2014 (per the terms of the contract) to renew its plan prior to 2014. For example, instead of renewing a plan in January 2014, a small employer may have had the opportunity to renew the contract in November 2013. Going forward, the small employer's contract year would be November\u2013October. If an existing plan was renewed in October 2013 with a 12-month contract, the plan would not have to comply with 2014 ACA market reforms until it renews in October 2014. A small employer that took this option would have no need to purchase a plan through a SHOP exchange for at least part of the 2014 plan year.", "Similarly, under a transitional policy first announced by CMS in November 2013, issuers offering coverage in the small group market could choose to continue coverage that would otherwise be cancelled. Pursuant to the policy, state insurance commissioners could choose whether to enforce compliance with specified ACA market reforms. Presumably, if state insurance commissioners chose not to enforce compliance, then issuers could renew coverage for small employers that would otherwise receive cancellation notices. The transitional policy was extended in March 2014; pursuant to the extended policy, coverage renewed for a plan year between January 1, 2014, and October 1, 2016, does not have to comply with certain ACA market reforms, provided the coverage meets specified conditions. Just like small employers that opted to early renew, small employers that were (and still are) able to provide coverage that is not completely ACA-compliant have no reason to purchase coverage through a SHOP exchange.", "Finally, some of the external factors affecting SHOP exchanges have less to do with small group market coverage and more to do with improved access to other types of coverage. ACA includes provisions that make it easier for individuals to access coverage in the nongroup market. It creates individual exchanges and provides financial subsidies to lower-income individuals purchasing nongroup coverage through those exchanges, and it expands the Medicaid program. If a small employer found that its employees were able to easily obtain coverage outside of group coverage as a result of these provisions, the small employer may lack an incentive to provide coverage to its employees, regardless of the potential attributes of a SHOP exchange. These factors may be particularly salient to small employers not subject to ACA's employer penalty\u2014those employers with fewer than 50 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SHOP Exchanges in 2015 and Beyond", "paragraphs": ["Some of the internal and external factors affecting SHOP exchange performance in 2014 will change while others will remain in place in 2015 and beyond. In addition, new factors will likely affect how issuers, employers, and consumers interact with SHOP exchanges going forward. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Internal Factors", "paragraphs": ["It is expected that some currently delayed features of SHOP exchanges will be implemented in 2015 and in future years. For example, as discussed in this report, there are indications that SHOP exchange websites will generally be more functional going forward. HHS has indicated that on-line enrollment will be available in all FF-SHOPs in 2015. Also, the employee choice function is to be implemented in some FF-SHOPs in 2015 and is expected to be implemented in all SHOP exchanges in 2016 and beyond. The availability of these features may attract greater SHOP participation from employers and issuers. ", "In 2016, the definition of small changes for purposes of the small group market and SHOP exchange eligibility. Beginning in 2016, a small employer is defined as having 100 or fewer employees. Larger firms (those with between 50 and 100 employees) are generally more likely to provide coverage than smaller firms; as such, the definition change may increase enrollment in SHOP exchanges (provided the larger employers decide to purchase coverage through SHOP exchanges). The change in the definition coincides with implementation of the employer penalty on employers with 50-99 employees; this could further incentivize these employers to provide coverage (although not necessarily through a SHOP exchange). In 2017, states have the option to open the SHOP exchange to large employers, which could also change employer and issuer participation patterns in SHOP exchanges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Factors", "paragraphs": ["At the same time the SHOP exchanges change internally, the broader health insurance market will evolve as ACA-related changes continue to occur in the market. By the end of 2014, any coverage that was renewed early will have expired, and small employers will have to obtain ACA-compliant coverage for plan year 2015 if they want to continue to offer coverage. Also, the transitional policy may expire or be extended (depending on decisions made by state insurance commissioners), which will affect whether small employers have to offer ACA-compliant coverage. ", "It is difficult to say how SHOP exchanges changes coupled with the potential requirement to provide ACA-compliant coverage will affect participation in SHOP exchanges. CRS is not aware of data that estimate the number of small employers that early renewed or opted for the transitional policy and therefore may need to purchase ACA-compliant coverage in 2015 or later years. It is also difficult to predict whether the requirement to offer ACA-compliant coverage will incentivize small employers to stop offering coverage or to continue offering coverage. If small employers continue to offer coverage, does the increased functionality of the SHOP exchanges incentivize them to offer through the SHOP, or would they obtain coverage outside the SHOP exchanges?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Employer Contributions to FF-SHOP Exchange Coverage", "paragraphs": ["This appendix explains the methods an employer purchasing coverage through an FF-SHOP exchange may use to determine its contributions toward employees' and their dependents' health insurance premiums. Table A-1 illustrates how an employer's contributions to health insurance coverage obtained through an FF-SHOP in 2014 may be determined. For the purposes of the example, the employer offers coverage to all of its employees and their dependents, and none of the employees or the dependents use tobacco products. Because this example is in the context of an FF-SHOP in 2014, and employee choice is not allowed in FF-SHOPs in 2014, the employer may select only one QHP to offer to its employees. ", "In the example in Table A-1 , an issuer provides an employer with per-member premiums based on the base rate of the reference plan selected by the employer and the age of all enrollees (column D multiplied by column C to obtain the per-member premiums in column E). According to regulations, either state law or the employer may require that the FF-SHOP base the employer's contributions on separately calculated composite premiums rather than the per-member premiums; however, HHS has indicated that FF-SHOPs are able to accommodate composite ratings for employees only. Provided composite premiums are used for employees only, the resulting employer contribution toward each enrollee's coverage is determined by multiplying the employer contribution percentage (column G) by the composite premiums for employees (column F) or the per-member premiums for dependents (column E). The employer then pays the resulting contribution (columns H, I) toward each enrollee's premium. ", " Table A-2 illustrates how an employer's contributions to health insurance coverage obtained through an FF-SHOP that allows employee choice in 2015 may be determined. As in the previous example, the employer offers coverage to all of its employees and their dependents, and none of the employees or the dependents use tobacco products. Because this scenario takes place in an FF-SHOP that allows employee choice in 2015, the employer can select more than one QHP to offer to its employees. ", "In the example in Table A-2 , the employer selects one plan to serve as the reference plan on which contributions are based (but employees will have the option to select other plans according to the FF-SHOP's particular employee choice arrangement). As in the 2014 example, regulations provide that either state law or the employer may require that the FF-SHOP base contributions on separately calculated composite premiums, but HHS has indicated that FF-SHOPs are able to accommodate composite ratings for employees only (column G). However, different from 2014, an FF-SHOP may permit employers to define different contribution percentages for different employees (full-time and part-time) and their dependents (columns H, I). Provided the composite premiums for employees and per-member premiums for dependents are used, the resulting employer contribution toward each enrollee's coverage is determined by multiplying the applicable employer contribution percentage by the applicable premiums. The employer then pays the resulting contribution (columns J, K) toward each enrollee's premium for the QHP selected by the enrollee."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
