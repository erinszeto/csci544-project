(3) As reported to the House,H.R. 1588 included provisions at Subtitle A of Title XI related to government-widepersonnel management. The bill also included provisions for a National Security Personnel System(NSPS) for DOD at Subtitle B. Many of the provisions had originated in DOD's April 2003 proposaland had been included in H.R. 1836 , the Civil Service and National Security PersonnelImprovement Act, reported to the House, amended ( H.Rept. 108-116 , part 1), by the Committee onGovernment Reform on May 19, 2003.

On June 4, 2003, the Senate struckall after the enacting clause and substituted the text of S. 1050 in H.R. 1588. TheSenate then passed H.R. 1588, amended, by voice vote the same day. (6) H.R. 1588, aspassed by the Senate, included, at Title XI, personnel provisions on pay authority for criticalpositions, the experimental personnel program for scientific and technical personnel, and personnelinvestigations that were not included in the House-passed version of the bill or S. 1166 .", "Senator Susan Collins, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,introduced S. 1166 , the National Security Personnel System Act, on June 2, 2003, andit was referred to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

Following the hearing, Senators Voinovich and Thomas Carperasked the Comptroller General, David Walker, to respond to several additional questions. Hisresponse, submitted on July 3, 2003, included the following comments.", "[I]t is critical that agencies or components have in placethe human capital infrastructure and safeguards before implementing new human capital reforms.This institutional infrastructure includes, at a minimum (1) a human capital planning process thatintegrates the agency's human capital policies, strategies, and programs with its program mission,goals, and desired outcomes, (2) the capabilities to develop and implement a new human capitalsystem effectively, and (3) a modern, effective, credible and, as appropriate, validated performanceappraisal and management system that includes adequate safeguards, such as reasonable transparencyand appropriate accountability mechanisms, to ensure the fair, effective, and nondiscriminatoryimplementation of the system.", "Although we do not believe that DOD should wait forthe full implementation of the new human capital system at the Department of Homeland Security(DHS), ... we do think that there are important lessons that can be learned from how DHS isdeveloping its new personnel system. For example, DHS has implemented an approach that includesa design team of employees from DHS, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and majorlabor unions. To further involve employees, DHS has conducted a series of town hall meetingsaround the country and held focus groups to further learn of employees' views and comments ...DOD ... needs to ensure that employees are involved in order to obtain their ideas and gain adequate\"buy-in\" for any related transformational efforts.", "[W]e suggest that DOD also be required to link itsperformance management system to program and performance goals and desired outcomes.... [This]helps the organization ensure that its efforts are properly aligned and reinforces the line of sightbetween individual performance and organizational success so that an individual can see how her/hisdaily responsibilities contribute to results and outcomes.", "In our view, it would be preferable to employ agovernmentwide approach to address certain flexibilities that have broad-based application andserious potential implications for the civil service system .... broad banding, pay for performance,reemployment, and pension offset waivers. In these situations, it may be prudent and preferable forCongress to provide such authorities on a governmentwide basis and in a manner that assures thata sufficient personnel infrastructure and appropriate safeguards are in place before an agencyimplements the new authorities.", "Based on our experience, while DOD's leadership hasthe intent and the ability to transform the department, the needed institutional infrastructure is notin place in a vast majority of DOD organizations.... In the absence of the right institutionalinfrastructure, granting additional human capital authorities will provide little advantage and couldactually end up doing damage if the authorities are not implemented properly by the respectivedepartment or agency.

On July 14,2003, Senators Collins, Voinovich, Stevens, and Sununu wrote a letter to their Senate colleaguesexpressing their support for, and sharing their views on, the personnel provisions of S.1166.

Many of the details that will govern theoperation of these areas are currently under discussion by DOD and the labor organizations. A townhall briefing in March 2006 revealed the following details, which are subject to continuingcollaboration between the department and the unions.", "Classification. Positions will be grouped into broad pay bands based on thenature of the work and the competencies required to perform them. Performance, complexity of thejob, and market conditions will determine the progression of employees through a pay band.Positions descriptions will be less detailed. Managers will have flexibility to assign new or differentwork to employees. Classification decisions could be appealed. There are expected to be four careergroups -- Standard (covers 71% of DOD's white collar workforce), Scientific and Engineering(covers 18% of DOD's white collar workforce), Investigative and Protective Services (covers 6% ofDOD's white collar workforce), and Medical (covers 5% of DOD's white collar workforce).

Proposed Career Groups, Pay Bands, and Salary Rangesfor the National Security Personnel System", "Performance Management. The system will directly link pay, performance,and mission accomplishment. It will have five rating levels -- \"Unsuccessful,\" \"Fair,\" \"ValuedPerformance,\" \"Exceeds Expectations,\" and \"Role Model.\" The performance of employees will berated on responsibilities, behaviors, skills, and tasks. An individual's technical proficiency, criticalthinking, cooperation and teamwork, communication, customer focus, resource management, andleadership will be evaluated. Employees who perform at Level 3, \"Valued Performance,\" Level 4,\"Exceeds Expectations,\" or Level 5, \"Role Model,\" will be eligible for a rate range adjustment, alocal market supplement, and performance-based pay. Individuals who perform at Level 2, \"Fair,\"will be eligible for a rate range adjustment and a local market supplement. There will not be any payincreases for those employees whose performance is rated at Level 1,\"Unsuccessful.\"", "Compensation. An employee could receive three types of pay adjustments --a rate range increase, a local market supplement, and a raise based on performance. The rate rangeincrease may vary by pay band. Employees must perform at Level 2, \"Fair,\" or higher to receive arate range increase. The local market supplement will be included in base pay and will be based onmarket conditions in a geographic area or for an occupation. This increase could differ from oneoccupation to another within a given area. Employees must perform at Level 2, \"Fair,\" or higher toreceive a local market supplement. The performance-based adjustment will be an annual pay raiseor bonus based on job performance. Employees must perform at Level 3, \"Valued Performance,\"or higher to receive a performance-based pay increase. High-performing employees could receivehigher pay raises. The rate ranges and local market supplements will be reviewed annually. Apromotion will result in a minimum six percent salary increase. Employees will not lose pay uponconverting to the new system. Individuals eligible for a within-grade increase will receive apro-rated salary increase.", "Staffing. The hiring process will be streamlined. Qualification requirementsfor positions will recognize DOD's unique mission. Some occupational categories will have longerprobationary periods for evaluating new employees. Veterans' preference rights willapply.", "Workforce Shaping. An employee's retention standing in a reduction in force(RIF) will be determined by tenure, veterans' preference, performance, and seniority. Multiple yearsof performance ratings will be used in making RIF determinations.

The regulationsprovide for a variety of new features that would be unique to DOD. For example, the regulationsestablish a new labor relations board that would assume some of the duties that are performedcurrently by the FLRA. The regulations would also expand management rights beyond whatcurrently exists under chapter 71.", "The regulations provide for the creation of a National Security Labor Relations Board(NSLRB) that would do the following: conduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair laborpractices; resolve issues relating to the scope of bargaining and the duty to bargain in good faith;resolve disputes concerning requests for information; resolve exceptions to arbitration awards;resolve negotiation impasses; and conduct de novo reviews on all matters within the Board'sjurisdiction. (35) Underthe regulations, the Board could also issue binding department-wide opinions for matters within itsjurisdiction upon request of a department component or a labor organization.

Certaindecisions by the NSLRB, including those involving negotiability disputes and arbitral awards, couldbe reviewed by the FLRA. Under the regulations, the FLRA would have to accept the findings of factand interpretations made by the NSLRB and sustain the NSLRB's decision unless the partyrequesting review could show that the NSLRB's decision was (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse ofdiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) caused by harmful error in the applicationof the Board's procedures in arriving at such a decision; or (3) was unsupported by substantialevidence.

OPM issued the final rule to establish the new pay system, andto implement a higher cap on aggregate compensation for senior executives, in December 2004. (71) Significant changes forthe SES included the replacement of six pay rates or levels (ES-1 through ES-6) with one broad payrange; an increase in the cap on base pay from Executive Schedule level IV (EX-IV) to EX-III; theaddition of a second, higher cap on base pay, EX-II, for agencies whose SES performance appraisalsystems have been certified by the OPM, with the concurrence of OMB; and the elimination oflocality pay.

Previously, 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5382 requiredthe establishment of at least five rates of basic pay, and each senior executive was paid at one of therates. For agencies whose appraisal systems have not been certified, the cap on SES base pay in2006 is $152,000 (EX-III). (Previously, the cap would have been $143,000 (EX-IV).) For agencieswho have received certification, the cap on base pay in 2006 is $165,200 (EX-II).

Considering thechanges made to the caps on basic pay, which resulted in the establishment of caps at levels II andIII of the Executive Schedule, the elimination of locality pay might be viewed as a practical matter. However, senior executives employed by an agency whose performance appraisal system is notcertified could be adversely affected by the loss of locality pay.", "Total Compensation. The performance appraisalcertification process was established by another statute, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L.107-296 ; 116 Stat. 2135, at 2297), which also shifted the cap on total compensation. For seniorexecutives subject to a performance appraisal system that has not been certified by OPM, the cap ontotal compensation remains EX-I ($183,500 in 2006). For individuals subject to a certified appraisalsystem, the cap has shifted upward to the Vice President's salary, which is $212,100 in 2006. Thesignificance of this change has to do with timing.
