Such teens are assisted in becoming self-sufficient, developing job skills, learning how to become good mothers, obtaining help in gaining access to child care, and in planning for the future. Renewed interest in such homes occurred in 1995 during the welfare reform debate. With the passage of the welfare reform bill in 1996, the state block grant for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) was created.

It does not, however, define a maternity home or indicate how one differs from a second chance home. The Social Policy Action Network (SPAN), which was a private nonprofit national resource center for these homes, defined second chance homes as \"places of refuge for the most vulnerable teen mothers and their children. They are community-based institutions that build social capital.\" Depending on a community's need, such homes can be located in both urban and rural areas of a state.", "The purpose of a second chance home is to assist and support young teen mothers in becoming self-sufficient by completing high school and developing job skills, to learn how to become good mothers by properly caring for their child, to help them gain access to child care, and to provide advice in planning for the future. According to SPAN, the main criteria for second chance homes is that they serve parenting teens (some will accept pregnant teens and allow them to remain in the residence with their infants for at least six months or longer after birth), and that they are residential. SPAN indicated that second chance homes not only provided a stable, nurturing atmosphere for teen mothers, but safe, nurturing environments for their offspring. Second chance homes were said to be unique because most offered access on site \"to child care, education, job training, counseling, and advice on parenting and life skills.\" Staff also assist the residents in obtaining outside social services, child care and in making future plans.", "Second chance homes can be individually operated or can be operated and funded by agencies with broader missions and services. Churches and nonprofit organizations across the nation have operated group homes for teen mothers for a number of years. After the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law, several states joined the effort to create and operate second chance homes by supporting programs that were community-based or conducted by faith-based groups using TANF or state funds."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of Maternity and Second Chance Homes", "paragraphs": ["Second chance homes provide a substitute living arrangement for unwed teenage mothers and their children who cannot live at home due to extenuating circumstances, such as violence, physical abuse, or unsafe living conditions. Earlier versions of this concept can be traced back to the mid-1880s. Before that time, support for unwed teen mothers was primarily provided by family, friends, and churches. In 1883, however, Charles Crittenton, a wealthy businessman and philanthropist, founded the first \"rescue home\" (named for his daughter Florence) that eventually became a chain of what later were called private maternity homes, to better support such mothers. Through moral and religious instruction, directors of these establishments tried to ensure that the mother did not bear more out-of-wedlock children. Subsequently, an extensive network of private maternity homes for \"women in crisis\" was established across the nation. The Florence Crittenton homes, described as one of the best known networks of maternity homes in 19 th century America, \"shielded mothers from psychological or material worries during and after their confinement; ... provided nutritional and medical services that encouraged healthy deliveries; ... helped stressed individuals become better prepared to mother; and ... helped arrange adoptions\" for mothers who lacked the means to raise their offspring. The average length of stay in the homes was about 20 months, and 60% of the mothers put their children up for adoption.", "In 1935, when the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was enacted, primarily to help widows care for their children, federal funding to assist unwed mothers was established for the first time. George Liebmann, an attorney and former counsel to the Maryland Department of Social Services, reports that as a result of the AFDC program, the framework of the local maternity homes began to disintegrate. Through the AFDC program, cash aid was extended to unwed mothers to support and care for children in their own homes. Eventually, and also as a result of changing social attitudes toward non-marital births, maternity homes were widely viewed as obsolete. Around 1980, Liebmann indicates in a 1995 article, the number of maternity homes \"bottomed out,\" and since that time the number of homes has been struggling upward. A survey of maternity homes conducted in the mid-1990s revealed that 215 such residences were located across the nation.", "In September 1995, during the Senate's welfare reform debate, there was support for the SCH concept, with passage of an amendment to provide $150 million (over six years) as seed money for states to support community-based homes for teen mothers under the age of 18. The SCH concept differed from the maternity home by requiring young mothers from unstable families to live with their children under adult supervision in the SCH as a condition for receiving welfare. Although included in two versions of the welfare reform bills that subsequently were vetoed by President Clinton, the SCH concept and principles attracted support in states and communities and revived interest in the concept.", "On August 22,1996, the welfare reform bill (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) was enacted into law ( P.L. 104-193 ). The law established block grants to states for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and replaced the AFDC program. Funds may be used through TANF for second chance homes at state discretion. In addition, TANF (1) prohibits cash assistance to unmarried teen parents (under 18) unless they live with their own parents, guardians, or another adult relative, or other appropriate adult supervised living arrangement; (2) requires states to provide or assist unwed teen parents, who are on welfare and because of extenuating circumstances cannot live at home, in locating a second chance home, maternity home, or other appropriate supervised living arrangement; and (3) defines second chance homes.", "SPAN reported that a renewal of interest in second chance homes could be attributed to three factors\u2014(1) a decrease in state welfare caseloads directed more attention to the needs of young teen mothers and their need for secure, stable housing; (2) state welfare surpluses brought attention to options, such as second chance homes, which initially appeared to be too expensive at the beginning of welfare reform; and (3) President George W. Bush made second chance homes one of the mainstays of his philosophy of compassionate conservatism.

SPAN suggested that a primary goal should be understood and supported by the entities funding the program, state and local social service agencies, community groups, and the teen mothers. For example, Massachusetts administrators chose safety as the state's primary goal for SCH providers. Consequently, state officials made contracts with private agencies to establish 27 second chance homes to provide safe and stable housing for unwed teen mothers and their children. New Mexico chose education as its primary goal and focuses on providing secure housing for teen mothers and assistance in preventing additional pregnancies, so that they can complete high school and strive to go to college.", "Proponents maintain that short- and long-term goals that might be established for second chance homes include stressing the importance of protecting and nurturing the children of the mothers, reuniting teens with and stabilizing their families, building the self-esteem of the mothers, suggesting alternatives to abortion, and keeping foster care mothers united with their children, among others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Teen Families Are Served?", "paragraphs": ["Most teen mothers who live in and are assisted by second chance homes have experienced troubled lives. Many such mothers have undergone difficulties, which might include living in poverty stricken and oftentimes abusive families, suffering persistent neglect, and possibly using drugs. A new challenge they must confront is parenthood. Living in a structured second chance home might not be easy for some teen mothers because in a large number of cases, such a setting might be the first time they are required to follow strict rules and meet certain expectations. Because of such backgrounds of potential residents, not all second chance homes are qualified to serve all teen mothers. SPAN noted that generally, teen mothers under age 14 might be better suited for foster care because of their inability to assume primary responsibility for the care of their offspring. Consequently, second chance home providers have to determine whether there are teen mothers that they will not serve.", "SPAN gave several tips that second chance home providers could consider when deciding which teen mothers can or cannot be assisted. These tips included\u2014determining the age range of teens to admit; deciding what time limits, if any, will be set for periods spent at the home; deciding whether teen fathers will be provided residential services; and determining how to handle custody issues (that is, whether minor teen mothers living in such residences will remain in the custody of their parents, or be in the custody of the state). Because of the criteria that most second chance homes apply, some teen mothers will not be accepted. In such instances, SPAN advised, program providers should be aware of alternatives that are available to such teens.", "Information in SPAN's Second Chance Homes National Directory indicated that of the 95 second chance home providers who responded to their survey, all (except two, which specifically indicated that they also assist pregnant teens) served teen families (which consist of a mother and child ), and assisted such mothers of ages that ranged from as young as 12 to as old as 29. The time limit of stay ranged from no limit, to one or no more than two years. Some of the providers precisely indicated certain limits, such as, when the mother completed high school and found permanent housing, or when the child turned three years of age. Others indicated the time limit as it related to the type of housing or the specific program in which the mother was involved, such as two years for those living in group homes, and two years for those involved in a foster care Independent Living program. HHS reports that in some cases, second chance home providers involve the fathers of the offspring and assist them in obtaining access to services that they might need in becoming good parents, and in acquiring skills that will lead to employment.

No state or community, however, directly operates a SCH, but instead contracts with nonprofit organizations to operate the homes. Among the first states to allow funding for a network of such homes were Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, and New Mexico. In 1999, statewide networks for such homes began in Texas, Rhode Island, and Nevada. In 2001, Georgia began a statewide program to operate second chance homes. Several communities in Missouri, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Vermont have used Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funding to open second chance homes.

Stable housing is provided for the homeless while they increase their job skills and income to enable them to live as independently as possible. SHP funds may be used for (1) transitional housing within a 24-month period, and up to six months of follow-up assistance for former residents to help them adjust to living independently; (2) permanent housing for homeless persons with disabilities to maximize their ability to live independently; (3) supportive services to help meet the immediate or long-term needs of homeless persons and families; (4) supportive services that are not provided in conjunction with supportive housing for homeless persons; and (5) \"safe havens\" for homeless mentally ill persons who live on the streets and are not yet ready for supportive services.", "Funding for SHP, which is awarded as competitive grants, is provided through the Homeless Assistance Grants account. Consequently, SHP funding assistance is restricted only to homeless persons and to homeless families with children.

Also, SHP funding could be used to provide supportive services for such mothers including \"child care, employment assistance, outpatient health services, food, and case management.\" Furthermore, agencies could use the funds to assist these homeless teen mothers with permanent housing, counseling concerning employment and nutrition, security services, and ways to find additional help at the federal, state, and local levels.", "Grants can be awarded to state and local governmental organizations and other governmental entities, to private nonprofit groups, and to community mental health organizations that are public nonprofit groups.

HHS reports, however, that there have been several analyses regarding service delivery approaches of different programs that documented how the programs worked and provided descriptions of the teen mothers and their children. As a result, insights have been gained regarding the needs of the mothers and their children, as well as in some cases, program outcomes, such as subsequent employment, education or subsequent pregnancies.", "Successful outcomes have been reported, according to HHS, by several states or programs related to reductions in repeat pregnancies, compared with the state average, higher rates of mothers completing school, lower rates of child abuse and neglect, improvements in the health of mothers and children, higher rates of mothers becoming employed, and a reduction in their dependency upon welfare. New Mexico, which began its state-sponsored second chance homes project in 1990 and has the oldest operation of such homes in the nation, operates 10 second chance homes with the capacity to serve 80 teen families. All needy teen mothers and their children are served (as long as the mothers stay in school). New Mexico has had less than 1% of its residents experience repeat pregnancies while living in the homes. The mothers are allowed to stay until they are 22 years of age. Services provided include supervision, case management, family planning, educational assistance, job training, health care, counseling, life skills training, and child care.", "Massachusetts, which was one of the first states to create a network of second chance homes (beginning in December 1995), operates 15 such homes statewide through state centralized services and assists pregnant and parenting teens ages 13 to 19. Data collected through its Department of Transitional Living Programs indicate that there were fewer repeat pregnancies (about 2% ) among teen mothers living in second chance homes than the statewide average. Furthermore, SPAN reported that over half of the teen mothers in Massachusetts who left second chance homes in 1998 made notable progress in school, in learning to manage their personal budgets, maintaining the health requirements of their children, such as immunizations, and in mastering good parenting methods. The homes provide services such as counseling, case management, and some on-site GED training, and child care. Massachusetts once had 21 second chance homes across the state and had the capacity to help 120 teen families on TANF and 16 teen families in the child welfare system. SPAN reported, however, that because of a lack of funding, Massachusetts closed some of its second chance homes. Consequently, the housing capacity to assist such teens might have diminished. It remained, however, the state with the largest network of such homes and, according to SPAN, was a good model of how state-run homes should work.", "Texas, which began operating second chance homes in 1999 and has four sites, serves teen mothers on TANF under age 18 and their children as well as pregnant teens eligible for Medicaid. Services provided include case management, counseling, mentoring, parenting classes, child care, school-to-work services, and transportation. Its home located in San Antonio reports that 90% of babies born to residents weigh more than the average birth weight for teen births, which are expected to be high risk for low birth-weight.", "HHS cautions that there are limitations in using these results to make informed policy decisions about designing programs to assist such mothers because: (1) results were based upon the participants' self-reports that were not independently validated for accuracy, (2) information was based on the reports of a very small number of mothers; and (3) results reflected the outcomes of mothers who remained with the programs or were tracked after leaving the programs. HHS found that in nearly all cases, there was no other group used to compare outcomes in order to determine whether participating in second chance homes specifically made a difference compared with what could have otherwise occurred.", "The need for evaluation, HHS concluded, is being recognized as a fundamental part of a new program's design. Such information, HHS believed, not only could inform program operators and sponsors about the general success of a second chance home in accomplishing intended outcomes, but could be useful in informing others interested in starting or redesigning a second chance home.", "HHS suggests four key issues and challenges that might be considered as more program administrators try to conduct accurate program evaluations. They are:", "\"Program size and capacity\"\u2014Most second chance homes accommodate a very small number of teen mothers and their children at one time, usually six or eight. Because of the small numbers, rigorous impact evaluations are more difficult. \"Measurements\"\u2014Determining certain outcomes for mother and child, such as acquiring a high school diploma or GED, might be easily quantified. Other outcomes, such as good parenting skills or increased self-esteem, might not be easily or quickly determined and might not surface for extended periods of time. \"Comparison\"\u2014For rigorous impact evaluation, there is a need to use two comparable groups. Second chance homes participants, however, would be difficult to separate into two distinct groups. \"Neither program operators nor researchers,\" HHS states, \"would support the denial of services to teens and their children for purely research purposes.\" Often, however, there are places where there is more demand for service than the ability to serve. In such instances, applicants who are not selected, HHS suggests, could be included in a study to compare outcomes. \"Follow-up and tracking\"\u2014Certain key outcomes needed to determine the effectiveness of second chance homes can be measured only after an extended period of time. These outcomes include long-term employment, subsequent higher earning and self-sufficiency, and child development outcomes. Many of the evaluations of second chance homes have data collected about participants while in the program. Tracking such teens after they have left a program, however, has proven to be very difficult."], "subsections": []}]}}
