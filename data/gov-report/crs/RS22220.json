Current eligibility requirements include (1) verification of an applicant's disability, (2) filing a claim, (3) a \"recent work\" and \"duration of work\" test, (4) verification that an individual has not reached normal retirement age, and (5) a five-month waiting period from disability-onset.", "In implementing the five-month waiting period for SSDI benefits, Congress sought to set a time frame that would be long enough for a short-term injury or illness to be corrected, but would also deter individuals who can work from applying for benefits. The first month counted as part of the waiting period can be no more than 17 months before the month of application, and benefits can be applied retroactively for up to 12 months. The Social Security Administration (SSA) encourages eligible individuals to apply for benefits as soon as possible after the onset of a disabling condition.", "The waiting period does not apply to individuals who have been previous recipients of SSDI in the five years prior to any current disability.

During this waiting period, SSDI benefits cannot be paid.

In 1954, Congress made the first provisions for loss of work due to disability and included language that exempted a period of disability from being counted when determining retirement benefits. Two years later, Congress authorized the payment of SSDI benefits to persons over the age of 50 after a six-month waiting period. The age requirement was removed in 1960. In recent years, Congress has introduced a variety of legislative initiatives to reduce or eliminate the five-month waiting period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congress's Justification for Instituting a Waiting Period", "paragraphs": ["In 1955, the House Ways and Means Committee recommended passage of the proposed Social Security Amendments and discussed the rationale for a six-month waiting period between the onset of disability and eligibility for federal benefits. A committee report cited the unique nature of the federal definition of disability and called its requirement that a disabling condition be expected to result in either death or long duration \"more exacting\" than the disability definitions commonly used by commercial insurance carriers at the time, many of which had their own six-month waiting periods. In addition, the Ways and Means Committee expressed that the six-month waiting period was \"long enough to permit most temporary conditions to be corrected or to show definite signs of probable recovery\" and would be of sufficient length to make it \"unprofitable for a person who can work not to do so.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to the SSDI Waiting Period", "paragraphs": ["Two significant changes to the original six-month waiting period have been passed as part of the creation of the SSDI program. The first change eliminated the waiting period for disabled workers who were previous SSDI recipients or who had a previous disabling condition in the five years prior to the onset of their current disability. To be exempted from the waiting period, the previous disabling condition must have met the statutory definition of disability as provided in Title II of the act.", "In their reports to the House and Senate on the 1960 Amendments, the Ways and Means and Finance Committees affirmed that the six-month waiting period for those with previous disabilities as a possible barrier to return to work efforts, stating that", "Most disability insurance beneficiaries who return to work do so despite severe impairments. Where a disabled person becomes employed without any improvement of his condition, a more or less slight change in his situation can result in the loss of his job and make him once again eligible for disability insurance benefits. Other disabled persons, whose medical conditions may improve sufficiently to require termination of benefits, may subsequently grow worse again and become reentitled to benefits. A new six-month qualifying period during which they receive neither earnings nor benefits imposes a hardship on them and their families, and may be a real bar to any further work attempts.", "The second change to the SSDI waiting period reduced the waiting period from six to five months. The intent of this change was to reduce the financial burden on applicants, and the Ways and Means Committee reported that \"reducing the waiting period from six months to five months would diminish the financial hardships faced by those workers who have little or no savings or other resources to fall back on during the early months of long-term disability.\" The Senate Finance Committee went further than the House and recommended reducing the waiting period to four months."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Income Supports During the Five-Month Waiting Period", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Supplemental Security Income", "paragraphs": ["Title XVI of the act authorizes Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for individuals who meet the statutory test of disability or are over the age of 65 and who fall below specific income and asset thresholds. SSI beneficiaries need not have any prior work history or meet the insurance requirements of SSDI, and there is no waiting period between the onset of a disability and eligibility for SSI benefits. In December 2012, of the 8.4 million disabled-worker beneficiaries aged 18-64 receiving SSDI benefits, 1.1 million or 13.1% also received federally administered SSI benefits. Thus, SSI can be used by some disabled workers to lessen the economic hardship faced by the lack of earnings and benefits during the SSDI waiting period. SSI benefits are not available to residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, or the U.S. Virgin Islands. ", "The maximum federal SSI payment, referred to as the federal benefit rate, is $721 per month for an individual living independently and $1,082 for a couple living independently in 2014. Forty-four states and the District of Columbia add a supplement to this benefit for their residents. The amount of the federal benefit, plus any state supplement, may be reduced or offset by some earned and unearned income. Since most SSI recipients have other income, the average monthly SSI payment is less than the federal benefit rate. In December 2013, the average federally administered SSI payment was $546.38 for adults aged 18 to 64.

In addition, claimants are either not receiving monthly benefits to replace lost wages or are receiving only SSI benefits, which are usually lower than SSDI benefits. A July 2012 analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the elimination of the five-month waiting period would increase outlays to SSDI by approximately $8.0 billion dollars in 2022 (about 4% of program outlays).", "One impact that may not be as clear, however, is the role that the waiting period plays in discouraging possible beneficiaries from applying for benefits.
