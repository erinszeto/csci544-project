The 1978 Actfollowed India's 1974 peaceful nuclear explosion, which demonstrated to most observers that nucleartechnology originally transferred for peaceful purposes could be misused. That test also providedthe impetus for creating the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).

U.S. officials encouraged India to make a comprehensive declaration of its civilianinfrastructure. (5) In variouswritten and oral statements to Congress, State Department officials seem to suggest that morefacilities under safeguards would be better than fewer, but critics (on both the U.S. and Indian sides)have suggested that some facilities would be more important to include or exclude. For example,the CIRUS reactor, reportedly the source of plutonium for the 1974 nuclear test, despite India'spledge to use it only for peaceful purposes, is important to some critics to declare as civilian and place under safeguards because of its controversial past. To U.S. officials, facilities associated withthe fast breeder reactor program, which could produce plutonium for weapons in the future,reportedly would be key to get under safeguards, particularly if the United States wants to cooperatewith India in the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership program. (6) To Indian officials, however,the fast breeder reactor program is key to the future of India's three-stage nuclear fuel cycle and mustbe kept out of safeguards for maximum flexibility and energy independence. (7) ", "Several nonproliferation critics of the potential agreement have suggested that no matter howmany facilities India places under safeguards, the opening of the international uranium market --forbidden to India since 1992 by the NSG -- in effect frees up India's domestic uranium for itsnuclear weapons program, and therefore, would assist the Indian nuclear weapons program. (8) Consequently, only India's haltin the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons would ensure that U.S. assistance does notaid India's nuclear programs. (9) Indian officials note that the peaceful nuclear cooperationagreement is not about limiting their strategic program, just about expanding their peaceful nuclearprogram. Some critics have suggested various options for placing specific facilities under safeguardsto diminish the potential \"surplus effect\" of opening up that uranium market. (10) ", "One observer, Robert Einhorn, has suggested that in the absence of a fissile materialproduction halt, safeguards on Indian facilities serve primarily a symbolic role in demonstratingIndia's commitment to nonproliferation. (11) Nonetheless, the safeguards approach, according toAdministration officials, is key to assuring that the United States complies with Article I of the NPT-- that U.S. cooperation does not in any way assist a nuclear weapons program in a non-nuclearweapon state. U.S. officials have stated that a voluntary safeguards arrangement like those of theother five nuclear weapon states would not meet our NPT Article I obligations. In their view, Indiamust accept some kind of safeguards arrangement that allow safeguards to endure in perpetuity. Indian officials, on the other hand, suggested that having the same responsibilities and practices asother advanced nuclear states translates into a voluntary safeguards arrangement.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["India's nuclear program, from its inception in 1948, has been described as inherentlydual-purpose. (13) Withthe establishment of its Atomic Energy Commission in 1948, India pursued both civilian and militaryapplications of nuclear energy. The first indigenous research reactor, Apsara, was developed in the1950s. Canada provided early assistance under the Colombo Plan, as did the United States underthe Atoms for Peace program. A humiliating defeat in a border war with China in 1962, followedby China's first nuclear test in 1964, intensified India's drive for nuclear weapons. India turned tothe CIRUS (Canada-India Reactor United States) reactor, as the source for plutonium for its 1974\"peaceful nuclear explosive\" test. Foreign assistance dwindled after the 1974 test, but Canada hadalready transferred the blueprints for heavy water reactors under an agreement for peaceful nuclearcooperation. As a result, India developed a fairly independent nuclear infrastructure that supportedboth civilian and military purposes. For example, plutonium separated in India's reprocessing plantshas been used both for weapons and to make mixed oxide fuel (plutonium mixed with uranium) fornuclear power plants.", "India's nuclear fuel cycle development has been driven by an acknowledged lack of uraniumreserves. In India's view, energy independence could not be derived from domestic uranium reserves-- estimated at 0.8% of world reserves, or 50-60,000 tons -- but could be from production ofplutonium, recycling of spent fuel, and utilization of thorium (estimated at 32% of worldreserves). (14) As a result,India planned 40 years ago to develop a three-stage fuel cycle to reduce its reliance on uranium anduse thorium. The first stage would rely on natural uranium-fueled reactors to make plutonium; thesecond stage would use that plutonium in fast reactors blanketed with thorium to produce U-233(and more plutonium); and the third stage would use U-233 fuel and thorium fuel in fast reactorsblanketed with thorium to produce more U-233 for use for future fuel. India has not advancedbeyond the first stage of the fuel cycle, aside from running a fast breeder test reactor (40 MWth FastBreeder Test Reactor or FBTR) based on a French design and a small research reactor that usesU-233 fuel (Kamini). ", "The Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Anil Kakodkar, asserted in a speechin March 2005 that indigenous uranium resources would support 10 GWe of nuclear installedcapacity but that breeder reactors, using plutonium bred from indigenous uranium, could support 500GWe of power generation. (15) The current energy plan is to have 12 GWe installed capacityby 2015 and 20 GWe by 2020. Reportedly, the increase to 20 GWe would be achieved through amix of pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), light water reactors and fast breeder reactors,including construction of 5 fast breeder reactors of 500 MWe each and the import of 8 light waterreactors of 1000 MWe each. (16) India's indigenous, pressurized heavy water reactors (fueled withnatural uranium) are planned to provide just half of that 20 GWe capacity (i.e., 10 GWe), but someobservers have suggested that indigenous supplies of uranium may not support that many reactorsand that India's uranium crisis is already acute. (17) For example, India's Jaduguda uranium mill produces just 220tons of yellowcake a year, whereas the 13 operating natural-uranium fueled reactors require 300 tonsper year, and consequently have reduced their operating capacity from 90% in 2002-2003 to 81%in 2003-2004 and 76% in 2004-2005. (18) According to two reports, the Department of Atomic Energy hasbeen unable to mine certain uranium deposits because local governments have not yet givenclearance.

(21) Canada built the first two CANDU-type reactors at Rajasthan, and India built the remaining eleven. Most of these produce about 220 MWe, whereas the new Russian reactors at Kudankulam willproduce 1000 MWe.

It has been used for various experiments,research and production of radioisotopes, and training. CIRUS and Dhruva are located at the BhabhaAtomic Research Center (BARC) in Trombay, while Kamini is located at Kalpakkam. ", "The CIRUS reactor has been the subject of controversy between the United States and Indiafor much of its life. The United States supplied heavy water, which was not subject to a safeguardsagreement, under a 1956 contract in which India pledged to use the material for peaceful purposesonly. Yet this reactor reportedly produced the plutonium used in India's 1974 peaceful nuclearexplosion. Many nonproliferation experts maintain that India violated its 1956 contract with Canadaas well as its contract with the United States. Most recently, according to answers to questions forthe record submitted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 2, 2005, the StateDepartment notes that:", "At the time, the debate on whether India had violatedthe contract was inconclusive owing to the uncertainty as to whether U.S.-supplied heavy watercontributed to the production of the plutonium used for the 1974 device and the lack of a mutualunderstanding of scope of the 1956 contract language on \"peacefulpurposes.\"", "Several nonproliferation experts have criticized the Administration for not taking thisopportunity to resolve this 30-year-old controversy.

Doing so, would \"respect the peaceful uses assurance of our original agreement.\" (24) ", "The Dhruva reactor is a larger, 100 MWt reactor that began operation in 1985. It is the otherreactor that most observers assume is dedicated to India's nuclear weapons program.

Specifically,Under Secretary Joseph said that safeguards would have to be applied in perpetuity,and that voluntary safeguards arrangements would not be defensible from anonproliferation standpoint. The Administration also asserted that \"The safeguardsmust effectively cover India's civil nuclear fuel cycle and provide strong assurancesto supplier states and the IAEA that material and technology provided or createdthrough civil cooperation will not be diverted to the military sphere.\" (29) ", "One interpretation of those phrases suggests that a credible plan would (1) beperceived to strengthen the nonproliferation regime; (2) be a complete and defensibledeclaration of its civil nuclear facilities and programs; and (3) mitigate perceptionsof nuclear weapons status for India.

(31) Since otheradvanced nuclear states with fast breeder reactors have placed them under safeguards(Japan and France), placing Indian breeder reactors under safeguards would mitigateperceptions of a double standard for India. Given their ability to produceweapons-grade plutonium, fast breeder reactors have been a proliferation concernfor many years. Moreover, safeguarding breeder reactors would limit the amount ofweapons-usable plutonium worldwide that is not safeguarded, which is clearly anobjective of U.S. nonproliferation policy.

Although India had hoped for asafeguards arrangement like those of the nuclear weapon states, where facilities canbe put on and taken off a safeguards list at will, the United States has said that sucha voluntary safeguards arrangement would not be acceptable. Therefore, in thisscheme, placing a facility on the civilian list would eliminate it from any potentialuse for the weapons program. While Indian officials have said that the July 18thagreement is not about their weapons program, their decisions about the separationplan were fundamentally guided by their future needs in the weapons program. Prime Minister Singh told the Indian Parliament on February 26, 2006 that indeciding on the scope of the separation plan, India took into account its", "current and future strategic needs andprogramme after careful deliberation of all relevant factors, consistent with ourNuclear Doctrine...[which envisions] a credible minimum nuclear deterrent to inflictunacceptable damage on an adversary indulging in a nuclear first-strike.

If not, India mustconsider whether to \"hedge\" its future requirements by keeping some existingfacilities out of safeguards so that they can produce plutonium or highly enricheduranium for weapons in the future, or to build new production facilities in the future.

In addition, India woulddeclare 3 heavy water plants (Thal, Tuticorin and Hazira) as civilian, but these wouldnot be subject to safeguards; 9 research facilities would be declared as civilian also,but these would be considered \"safeguards-irrelevant.\" ", "India's enrichment facility would not be covered, and India's offering up theTarapur Power Reactor Fuel Reprocessing Plant (PREFRE) for \"campaign\" modesafeguards after 2010 is a continuation of its current policy.

Burns noted that the arrangement \"achieved a degree of transparency andoversight and impact on the Indian nuclear program that was not possible for threedecades.\" (47) ", "Figure 2 shows a rough depiction of how the final separation applies toIndia's civilian and military nuclear facilities.

UnderSecretary of State Nicholas Burns told reporters on March 2, 2006, that \"It's not aperfect deal in the sense that we haven't captured 100 percent of India's nuclearprogram. That's because India is a nuclear weapons power, and India will preservepart of its nuclear industry to service its nuclear weapons program.\" (48) Althoughfew observers would have expected to get 100% of India's nuclear program undersafeguards, one question that arises is whether the 65% mark meets theAdministration's own standard that \"The safeguards must effectively cover India'scivil nuclear fuel cycle.\" (49) ", "The Administration has defended the separation plan most recently ascredible and defensible in this way:", "For [the separation plan] to be credibleand defensible from a nonproliferation standpoint, it had to capture more than justa token number of Indian nuclear facilities, which it did by encompassing nearlytwo-thirds of India's current and planned thermal power reactors as well as all futurecivil thermal and breeder reactors. Importantly, for the safeguards to be meaningful,India had to commit to apply IAEA safeguards in perpetuity; it did so. Once a reactoris under IAEA safeguards, those safeguards will remain there permanently and on anunconditional basis. Further, in our view, the plan also needed to include upstreamand downstream facilities associated with the safeguarded reactors to provide a trueseparation of civil and military programs. (50)", "It should be noted that although declaring 65% of India's reactors as civilianwill result in placing almost two-thirds of the current reactors under safeguards,power reactors constitute just one part of the nuclear fuel cycle. Reprocessingcapabilities are key to India's three-stage nuclear fuel cycle development plan, andthe separation plan provides nothing beyond the intermittent safeguards applied at thePower Reactor Fuel Reprocessing Plant (PREFRE) already.", "Some observers could argue that a strictly quantitative approach does notaddress the question of whether the plan is defensible from a nonproliferationstandpoint. Here too, the kinds of facilities included could be key. For example, interms of preventing terrorist access to fissile material, safeguarding facilities likereprocessing and enrichment plants and breeder reactors would provide a greaternonproliferation benefit because the materials produced by these plants are a fewsteps closer to potential use in a bomb. In addition, safeguards on enrichment,reprocessing plants, and breeder reactors would support the 2002 U.S. NationalStrategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction, in which the United Statespledged to \"continue to discourage the worldwide accumulation of separatedplutonium and to minimize the use of highly-enriched uranium.\" (51) ", "Breeder Reactors. As notedearlier, breeder reactors, which are key to India's intended second stage of fuel cycledevelopment, have been generally regarded as a proliferation concern because of theirproduction of weapons-grade plutonium. (52) India plans to build at least five commercial-scalebreeder reactors and would have the option of dedicating any one or more of thoseto its military program. Public statements by Indian officials suggest that they haveconsidered the breeder reactor's usefulness in producing plutonium for the strategicarsenal, and some domestic critics have suggested that India should clarify thepurpose of the breeder program once and for all. A key obstacle may be the amountof unsafeguarded plutonium available as initial fuel, raising the question of howfuture civilian breeder reactors would be fueled. Would plutonium from the 10additional reactors India will be placing under safeguards be used to fuel the reactors,or would India purchase safeguarded plutonium from other states? If the latter case,would this conflict with the Administration's policy of discouraging the worldwideaccumulation of separated plutonium? ", "Other Facilities. Prime MinisterSingh told the Indian Parliament on February 26 that \"We will offer to place undersafeguards only those facilities that can be identified as civilian without damagingour deterrence potential or restricting our R&D effort.\" (53) AlthoughCIRUS, Dhruva, the Fast Breeder Test Reactor, and the planned Advanced HeavyWater Reactor have been described by Indian facilities as being research facilities,they are not included. The 9 research facilities that will be declared as civilian areconsidered safeguards-irrelevant, probably because they will have little if any nuclearmaterial in them to be safeguarded. ", "The absence of research facilities could call into question how far India'sseparation plan has ventured into the mainstream of nonproliferation. IAEAsafeguards for non-nuclear weapon states include all facilities where nuclear materialis present, including research and development facilities. The case of precedents inother nuclear weapon states is not applicable, since the IAEA tends not to inspectvery many of the sites or facilities on the voluntary safeguards eligible lists.Likewise, the absence of reprocessing and enrichment facilities on the separation planalso could be interpreted by some as falling short of the objective of bringing Indiainto the mainstream of nonproliferation. In particular, the Bush Administration hasidentified enrichment and reprocessing technologies as sensitive parts of the nuclearfuel cycle that should be limited and has proposed specific arrangements for assuredsupplies of nuclear fuel that would obviate the need for states to conduct their ownenrichment and reprocessing. (54) ", "India's one operating facility at Rattenhalli is reportedly used to enrichuranium for the prototype naval fuel reactor. Naval fuel occupies a curious place inIAEA safeguards. Full-scope safeguards agreements, the kind that non-nuclearweapon states have, include a provision for the non-application of safeguards tonuclear material to be used in non-peaceful activities -- and naval fuel would be onesuch non-peaceful activity. However, no non-nuclear weapon state has everimplemented this provision for the non-application of safeguards. Under Paragraph14 of the INFCIRC/153, a state is required to inform the IAEA that ", "the use of the nuclear material in anon-proscribed military activity will not be in conflict with an undertaking the Statemay have given and in respect of which Agency safeguards apply, that the nuclearmaterial will be used only in a peaceful nuclear activity; and that during the periodof non-application of safeguards the nuclear material will not be used for theproduction of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosivedevices.", "Brazil has placed its enrichment facilities under safeguards, despite havinga naval fuel program, which also raises the question of how far India's separation planconforms to the standards of the nonproliferation mainstream. The five nuclearweapon states have not encountered this problem thus far, since they have not placedany naval-related facilities on their safeguards-eligible lists. It is not clear whichprecedent would be less desirable -- placing India's naval fuel facilities undersafeguards and then going through steps for the nonapplication of safeguards, orsimply not safeguarding them at all on the grounds that they are of direct nationalsecurity significance.
