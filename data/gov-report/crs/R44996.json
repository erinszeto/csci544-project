Congress has shown a strong interest in executive branch implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act, including executive branch decisions related to arms sales to Taiwan, which are called for by the Taiwan Relations Act, and other security-related support for Taiwan. Over the decades since 1979, many Members have pressed the executive branch to ease self-imposed U.S. restrictions on contacts with Taiwan officials and representatives, which they consider to be inappropriate for a former treaty ally that has evolved to become a flourishing democracy, the United States' tenth-largest merchandise trading partner, and its second largest customer for Foreign Military Sales.

Mindful of the views of her supporters, Tsai has declined to embrace the position that Taiwan and mainland China are both parts of \"one China,\" although she has not refuted it either. The PRC has ratcheted up pressure on her to endorse the concept, which her predecessor from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, Ma Ying-jeou, had accepted with caveats.

The Dutch East India Company administered most of Taiwan until 1661. The Spanish maintained settlements in northern Taiwan from 1626 to 1642. Migration from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan continued throughout. ", "In 1661, Zheng Chenggong, also known as Koxinga, led a force of more than 25,000 men from the Chinese mainland to Taiwan. They expelled the Dutch and established a civil administration in opposition to China's Qing Dynasty rulers. Zheng died in 1662. His son continued the struggle against the Qing until his death in 1681. The Qing established control over Taiwan in 1683.", "In 1895, at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Taiwan remained a Japanese colony for 50 years, until the end of World War II. The Republic of China, which was founded on January 1, 1912 on mainland China and led by the Kuomintang Party (KMT), assumed control of Taiwan on October 25, 1945, also known as \"Retrocession Day.\" In February 1947, residents of Taiwan staged an uprising against KMT rule. KMT forces put down the unrest by force, at the cost of as many as 28,000 lives, in what is now known as the February 28 or \"2-28\" Incident. ", "In December 1949, after losing a civil war on mainland China to the forces of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the KMT moved the seat of the ROC across the Taiwan Strait to Taipei, Taiwan. An estimated 1.5 million to 2 million Chinese fled with the KMT to Taiwan. Families whose forebears arrived in Taiwan with the KMT in the 1940s are known in Taiwan today as \"mainlanders.\" Ethnic Chinese whose forebears lived on the island before the arrival of the KMT are known as \"Taiwanese.\"", "On Taiwan, the KMT administered decades of authoritarian one-party rule. In May 1948, while still based on mainland China, the ROC National Assembly adopted \"Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion,\" suspending many of the freedoms outlined in the ROC constitution. The National Assembly imposed martial law on Taiwan on May 20, 1949. Martial law remained in effect for 38 years, until July 15, 1987, when President Chiang Ching-Kuo lifted it in the last year of his life. The move ended military censorship and the trial of citizens by military courts and opened the way for political liberalization. Taiwan legalized the formation of political parties in 1989 with passage of the Law on the Organization of Civic Groups. The DPP, founded in September 1986 with strong support from native Taiwanese, claims credit for a major role in \"toppling the KMT's one-party dictatorship.\" The National Assembly formally cancelled the \"Temporary Provisions\" in 1991.

Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was Taiwan's first non-KMT president, serving two terms from 2000-2008. Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT served two terms from 2008 to 2016.Taiwan presidents are limited to two four-year terms. In January 2016 elections, the DPP won both the presidency and, for the first time, control of the legislature. The DPP describes itself as \"the party of democracy, freedom, human rights, and a strong Taiwanese identity,\" the latter in contrast to the KMT, with its roots in mainland China.

In 1971, however, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 recognized the PRC's representatives as \"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations,\" and expelled \"the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek,\" the ROC's then-President. (See \" The United Nations and Its Specialized Agencies ,\" below.) Since canceling the related \"Temporary Provisions\" in 1991, the ROC government has claimed \"effective jurisdiction\" only over Taiwan, the archipelagos of Penghu, Kinmen (also known as Quemoy), and Mazu (also known as Matsu), and a number of smaller islands.

The World Economic Forum (WEF), a Switzerland-based non-profit organization, in 2016 ranked Taiwan as the 14 th most competitive economy out of 138 economies surveyed, based on an assessment of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of an economy and, in turn, its prosperity. A 2017 survey by the Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei (IEAT) assessed Taiwan to have the 16 th most competitive trading economy out of 54 major countries surveyed, down from ninth in the 2011 survey. (The United States ranked first.) ", "Taiwan's GDP growth has been relatively slow in recent years, rising by 0.7% in 2015 and 1.5% in 2016. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) projects Taiwan's real GDP will grow by 2.2% in 2017 (see Figure 2 ). Taiwan's economy depends on international trade. Taiwan's exports of goods and services in 2016 totaled $331 billion, equivalent to 63% of its nominal GDP. In 2015, Taiwan's global merchandise exports and imports fell by 10.6% and 16.6%, respectively, and each barely changed in 2016. However, during the first seven months of 2017, Taiwan's exports and imports grew by 12.5% and 14.9% respectively (see Figure 3 ). ", "Taiwan faces a number of economic challenges, including declining competitiveness for many industries, inability to participate in various regional trade agreements, stagnant wages, and lack of job opportunities for some college graduates. While the island-wide rate of unemployment in Taiwan is relatively low at 3.8% (as of July 2017), the rate for those aged 20-24 is 13%. Many young Taiwan professionals have sought better-paying positions elsewhere, including in mainland China. The Taiwan government reports that more than 720,000 Taiwan citizens are working outside the island, 58% of them in mainland China. Nearly three-quarters of those workers have college degrees or higher. ", "Taiwan's share of global merchandise exports fell from a peak of 2.5% in 1993 to 1.6% in 2016. Taiwan officials attribute this trend in part to the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements (RTAs), especially among other major Asia-Pacific economies. Taiwan is currently not a party to these RTAs, in large part because Beijing pressures other countries not to sign trade deals with Taiwan. Taiwanese officials have expressed concern that Taiwan's exclusion from RTAs could harm the long-term competitiveness of many Taiwan industries, which could reduce trade flows and diminish economic growth. Taiwan has reportedly sought free trade agreements (FTAs) and/or bilateral investment agreements (BIAs) with several countries, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Australia. The January 2017 U.S. withdrawal from the TPP appears to have complicated Taiwan's strategy for joining the TPP. Taiwan had sought U.S. support for its eventual membership.", "A key Taiwan government initiative aimed at boosting domestic innovation, economic growth, and job creation is the \"five plus two\" innovative industries program. The first five industries are the \"Internet of Things,\" smart machinery, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, green energy technology, and national defense. The \"plus two\" industries are high-value agriculture and the circular economy (dealing with recycling and re-use of resources). In addition, Taiwan's Executive Yuan in May 2017 approved an eight-year $58 billion \"Forward-Looking Infrastructure Development Program\" focused largely on investments in railways, aquatic environments, green energy, digital technology, and urban and rural facilities. ", "Externally, Taiwan's government has launched a New Southbound Policy, aimed at reducing economic dependence on the PRC and \"developing comprehensive, mutually beneficial relations with countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and South Asia, Australia and New Zealand\" through economic and trade collaboration, people-to-people exchanges, resource sharing, and regional connectivity. Challenges for the program include pressure from the PRC on Southeast Asia countries not to cooperate with Taiwan, and Taiwan's lack of representative offices in two target countries for the New Southbound Policy, Cambodia and Laos. Still, Taiwan's strategy to diversify its economic ties may have led to positive results in the case of foreign tourism in Taiwan. In 2016, the number of mainland Chinese tourists to Taiwan fell by 16.2% over the previous year, but an increase in tourists from elsewhere, mainly from Asia, helped boost the overall level of inbound tourists to Taiwan by 2.4%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taiwan's Engagement with the World", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Diplomatic Partners", "paragraphs": ["Taiwan maintains full diplomatic relations with 20 states.

The decisions of the tribunal which impinge on the interests of the ROC, especially with regard to the status of Taiping Island, have seriously undermined the rights of the ROC over the South China Sea Islands and their relevant waters. The ROC government does not accept any decisions that undermine the rights of the ROC, and declares that they have no legally binding force on the ROC.", "Taiwan has not been a party to talks between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the PRC aimed at forging a Code of Conduct for the South China Sea, an exclusion Taiwan blames on \"China's relentless effort to suppress it internationally.\" In August 2017 remarks, however, President Tsai pledged that, \"Despite our exclusion from South China Sea regional dialogue, Taiwan will nevertheless continue to safeguard freedom of navigation and overflight in the area.\"", "In the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 ( P.L. 114-92 ), Congress included Taiwan in the South China Sea Initiative, the purpose of which was described as, \"increasing maritime security and maritime domain awareness of foreign countries along the South China Sea.\" The initiative targeted the countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Fourth, we did not agree to set a date certain for ending arms sales to Taiwan , and the statements of future U.S. arms sales policy embodied in the communiqu\u00e9 do not provide either a timeframe for the reduction of U.S. arms sales or for their termination. The U.S. statements are fully consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and we will continue to make appropriate arms sales to Taiwan based on our assessments of their defense needs.", "\"... As to our position on the resolution of the Taiwan problem, we have consistently held that it is a matter to be worked out by the Chinese themselves. Our sole and abiding concern is that any resolution be peaceful. It follows that we see no mediation role for the United States nor will we attempt to exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with the PRC .", "\"I would also like to call your attention to the fact that there has been no change in our longstanding position on the issue of sovereignty over Taiwan . The communiqu\u00e9, paragraph 1, in its opening paragraph simply cites that portion of the joint communiqu\u00e9 on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the PRC in which the United States acknowledged the Chinese position on this issue; that is, that there is but one China, and Taiwan is a part of China.", "\" It has been reported in the press that the Chinese at one point suggested that the Taiwan Relations Act be revised.
