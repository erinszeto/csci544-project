Apart from questions about what the policy entails, issues have arisen about whether U.S. Presidents have stated clear positions and have changed or should change policy, affecting U.S. interests in security and democracy. This CRS Report, updated through the 113th Congress, analyzes the \"one China\" policy since U.S. Presidents began in 1971 to reach understandings with the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan calls itself the Republic of China (ROC) and does not recognize the PRC. There are three sets of issues: sovereignty over Taiwan; PRC use of force or coercion against Taiwan; and cross-strait dialogue. The United States recognized the ROC until the end of 1978 and has maintained non-diplomatic engagement with Taiwan after recognition of the PRC in 1979. The State Department claims an \"unofficial\" relationship with Taiwan. The United States did not explicitly state Taiwan's status in the U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques of 1972, 1979, and 1982. The United States \"acknowledged\" the \"one China\" position of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.", "Since 1971, U.S. Presidents\u2014both secretly and publicly\u2014have articulated a \"one China\" policy in understandings with the PRC. Congressional oversight has watched for any new agreements and any shift in the U.S. stance closer to that of Beijing's \"one China\" principle\u2014on questions of sovereignty, arms sales, or dialogue. Not recognizing the PRC's claim over Taiwan or Taiwan as a sovereign state, U.S. policy has considered Taiwan's status as unsettled. With added conditions, U.S. policy leaves the Taiwan question to be resolved by the people on both sides of the strait: a \"peaceful resolution\" with the assent of Taiwan's people and without unilateral changes. In short, U.S. policy focuses on the process of resolution of the Taiwan question, not any set outcome.", "The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979, P.L. 96-8, has governed U.S. policy in the absence of a diplomatic relationship or a defense treaty. The TRA stipulates the expectation that the future of Taiwan \"will be determined\" by peaceful means. The TRA specifies that it is U.S. policy, among the stipulations: to consider any non-peaceful means to determine Taiwan's future \"a threat\" to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of \"grave concern\" to the United States; \"to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character;\" and \"to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion\" jeopardizing the security, or social or economic system of Taiwan's people. The TRA provides a congressional role in determining security assistance \"necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.\" President Reagan also offered \"Six Assurances\" to Taipei in 1982, partly to continue arms sales.", "Policy makers have continued to face unresolved issues, while the political and strategic context of the policy has changed dramatically since the 1970s. Since the early 1990s, U.S. interests in the military balance as well as Taiwan's security and democracy have been challenged by the PRC's military buildup (particularly in missiles) and potential coercion, moves perceived by Beijing for Taiwan's de jure independence under the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) president (2000-2008), and resistance in Taiwan by the Kuomintang (KMT) party to investing in self-defense. After the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou became President in May 2008, Taipei and Beijing reduced tension and resumed talks\u2014beyond seeking detente. With President Obama since 2009, a rhetorical convergence emerged about \"peaceful development\" of cross-strait ties. However, disagreements remain about the PRC's goal of political talks for unification, Taiwan's status, Taiwan's self-defense, and U.S. arms sales and other cooperation with Taiwan. On September 23, 2014, 29 Members of the House sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, calling for a new Taiwan Policy Review (after 20 years) to examine expanded engagement with Taiwan."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Part I: U.S. Policy on \"One China\"", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Background", "paragraphs": ["Taiwan formally calls itself the Republic of China (ROC), tracing its political lineage to the ROC set up in 1912 after the revolution that started on October 10, 1911, in China to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. The ROC uses October 10 to commemorate the national day, celebrated as \"Double Ten.\" The ROC does not recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC) founded in Beijing by the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1949. The PRC claims that the ROC ceased to exist in 1949 and that Taiwan is a province of \"one China.\" (The Qing Empire had incorporated Taiwan as a full province in 1885-1895, when more settlers moved from China to the island.) The PRC and ROC do not recognize each other or two Chinas. The ROC refers to the other side of the strait as the \"mainland.\" The PRC opposes recognition of the ROC and seeks unification of Taiwan with the mainland as a part of \"one China,\" without renouncing the use of force. In any case, since 1949, the ROC has governed only on Taiwan, and the PRC has ruled mainland China.", "Previously called Formosa, Taiwan never has been ruled by the CPC or as a part of the PRC, and until 1945, had never been ruled by the ROC. In Taiwan after World War II, October 25, 1945, or \"Retrocession Day,\" marked the ROC's claim of \"recovering\" Formosa from Japan. However, upon Japan's surrender, that was the first time that the ROC's military forces had occupied the island of Formosa. When the Qing Empire ceded in perpetuity Formosa to Japan under the Treaty of Shimonoseki of 1895, the ROC was not yet in existence. Moreover, the colony's people did not have a say in self-determination of their status or identity. The Kuomintang (KMT), or Nationalist Party of China, has contended that the ROC claimed Formosa at Japan's surrender in August 1945, with no country challenging the island's status. The ROC under KMT forces led by Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taipei in 1949, when the Communist forces led by Mao Zedong took over mainland China. Taiwan's people have faced social, ethnic, linguistic, and political issues of whether to identify with Taiwan or China, with two major groups of local \"Taiwanese\" and \"Mainlanders\" (people who retreated to Taiwan with the KMT forces and their descendants).", "One of the first major powers to support reforms and the new republic of progressive leaders in early 20 th century China, the United States recognized the ROC from 1913 until the end of 1978. The United States then shifted to recognize the PRC, with its capital in Beijing, under the U.S. \"one China\" policy. By the early 1970s, the United States had looked to switch the diplomatic recognition to the PRC, while figuring out a framework to sustain engagement with Taiwan. Since 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), P.L. 96-8 , has governed policy toward Taiwan.", "Paying particular attention to congressional influence on policy, Part I of this CRS Report discusses the U.S. \"one China\" policy concerning Taiwan since the United States (under President Nixon) began in 1971 to reach understandings with the People's Republic of China (PRC) government in Beijing, which has insisted on its \"one China\" principle . Part II comprehensively reviews the evolution of policies as affected by legislation and articulated in key statements by Washington, Beijing, and Taipei.

In the 1990s, some Members in Congress pushed for changes in policy toward Taiwan. Questions about the \"one China\" policy arose again after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui characterized cross-strait relations as \"special state-to-state ties\" on July 9, 1999. Beijing responded vehemently with calls for Lee to retract the perceived deviation from the \"one China\" position and reiterated long-standing threats to use force if necessary to prevent a declaration of independence by Taiwan. The PRC also opposed U.S. military intervention. The Clinton Administration responded that Lee's statement was not helpful and reaffirmed the \"one China\" policy. Some questioned whether the TRA requires U.S. defense of Taiwan against an attack from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's military.", "Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, at a July 21, 1999, hearing, said that Lee \"created an opportunity to break free from the anachronistic, Beijing-inspired one-China policy which has imprisoned U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan for years.\" Representative Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the International Relations Committee, wrote in a September 7, 1999, letter to Clinton that it is a \"common misperception\" that we conceded officially that Beijing is the capital of the \"one China\" that includes Taiwan. He wrote, \"under no circumstances should the United States move toward Beijing's version of 'one China.'\"", "Since 2001, some congressional leaders have stressed continuity in maintaining the \"one China\" policy. During the George W. Bush Administration, leaders of the House and Senate stressed support for Taiwan as a democracy, rather than its independent status. Moreover, Members voiced concerns about cross-strait tension arising from actions taken by both Beijing and Taipei.", "Senator Richard Lugar, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in May 2001 that \"for many years, successive U.S. administrations have affirmed that there is one China and that the people on Taiwan and the people of China should work out a plan for peaceful unification.\" He also referred to a debate on the nature of the U.S. obligation to \"defend democracy in Taiwan\" and to prevent a \"forceful military unification of Taiwan and China.\" Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the International Relations Committee, spoke in Beijing in December 2002 and dismissed notions that U.S. support for Taiwan was geared toward containing or dividing China. He said that \"the bedrock of the very strong support for Taiwan in the U.S. Congress\" is the shared experience as democracies. Moreover, Hyde highlighted Taiwan's significance as a model of a \"Chinese democracy\" that proved democracy is compatible with Chinese culture.", "U.S. views were shaped by developments in Taiwan and concern about cross-strait tension. On August 3, 2002, President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gave a speech using the phrase \"one country on each side\" of the strait, surprising Washington even before the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Leading up to the presidential election on March 20, 2004, Chen advocated holding the first referendums (on the same day as the election) and drafting a new constitution with a timetable. Though symbolic steps, Beijing reacted with alarm and warnings.", "On the eve of his visit to Washington, PRC Premier Wen Jiabao warned on November 22, 2003, that China would \"pay any price to safeguard the unity of the motherland.\" On November 29, President Chen surprisingly announced that he would use one provision in the referendum law passed by the opposition-dominated legislature two days earlier and hold a referendum on China's threats on the day of the presidential election. During his meeting with Premier Wen in the Oval Office on December 9, 2003, President Bush stated that he opposed Chen's efforts to change the status quo, drawing criticisms that Bush sided with Beijing's belligerence. The Taiwan Caucus in the House wrote a letter to President Bush, criticizing his stance as a victory for the authoritarian regime of the PRC at the expense of Taiwan's democratic reforms.", "On the TRA's 25 th anniversary , the House International Relations Committee held a hearing on April 21, 2004. After congratulating President Chen Shui-bian on his re-election in March 2004, the Administration further clarified U.S. policy toward Taiwan and warned of \"limitations\" in U.S. support for constitutional changes in Taiwan. At that hearing on the TRA, Representative James Leach, chairman of the House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, stated that Taiwan has the unique situation in which it can have de facto self-determination only if it does not attempt to be recognized with de jure sovereignty. He urged Taiwan's people to recognize that they have greater security in \"political ambiguity.\" He called for continuity, saying that \"together with our historic 'one China' policy,\" the TRA has contributed to ensuring peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. In his second inaugural address on May 20, Chen responded to U.S. concerns, excluding sovereignty issues and a referendum from his plan for a new constitution by 2008. Leach represented the United States at Chen's inauguration. At a subcommittee hearing on June 2, 2004, Leach praised Chen's address as \"thoughtful, statesmanlike, and helpful\" as well as \"constructive\" for dialogue with Beijing. Later, to mark the 25 th anniversary of the TRA on April 10, 2004, the House voted on July 15, 2004, to pass H.Con.Res. 462 (Hyde) to reaffirm \"unwavering commitment\" to the TRA.", "Some in Congress also had concerns about challenges to U.S. interests in reducing tensions and fostering dialogue across the strait. In March 2005, China adopted an \"Anti-Secession Law.\" On March 16, the House passed (424-4) H.Con.Res. 98 (Hyde) to express grave concern about the \"Anti-Secession Law,\" and the House Taiwan Caucus heard a briefing by Taipei's Representative. On April 6, 2005, the House International Relations Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific held a hearing on China's \"Anti-Secession Law.\" President Chen announced on February 27, 2006, that he will \"terminate\" the National Unification Council and Guidelines. Senator John Warner, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, told Admiral William Fallon, Commander of the Pacific Command, at a committee hearing on March 7, 2006, that \"if conflict were precipitated by just inappropriate and wrongful politics generated by the Taiwanese elected officials, I'm not entirely sure that this nation would come full force to their rescue if they created that problem.\" In July 2007, Representative Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that it was impractical for Taiwan to seek membership in the U.N.", "A convergence emerged rhetorically among the PRC, Taiwan, and the United States on cross-strait \"peaceful development\" after Ma Ying-jeou became president in Taiwan in May 2008 and cross-strait tension reduced (partly due to a resumption of dialogue). As Taiwan and the PRC became closer, U.S.-Taiwan engagement strengthened. Congressional concerns included issues about whether and how the United States and Taiwan might strengthen political, defense, and economic cooperation, partly to sustain U.S. interests in security, democracy, and prosperity in Taiwan and its international space. On March 24, 2009, the House passed (by voice vote) H.Con.Res. 55 (Berkley), and 30 Senators sent a letter to President Barack Obama to mark the TRA's 30 th anniversary . On June 16 and October 4, 2011, the House Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, held hearings on \"Why Taiwan Matters.\" At the latter hearing with an official panel, Ros-Lehtinen stressed adherence to President Reagan's Six Assurances to Taipei. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campell used his testimony for a rare reaffirmation of the Six Assurances, reiterating in particular the assurance of not having any prior consultation with the PRC on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The Administration and Congress supported Taiwan's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) .", "Congress passed legislation in support of Taiwan's participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, Representative Ed Royce and Senator Robert Menendez, introduced bills to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan at ICAO. Signed by President Obama, H.R. 1151 (Royce) became P.L. 113-17 on July 12, 2013.", "Among other legislation for consideration, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced, on September 14, 2011, the Taiwan Policy Act ( H.R. 2918 ) to enhance ties with Taiwan in comprehensive ways. On August 1, 2013, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the Taiwan Policy Act of 2013, H.R. 419 (Ros-Lehtinen).", "On March 14, 2014, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing to mark the 35 th anniversary of the enactment of the TRA . On April 3, the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs held a hearing on the TRA. In response to Senator Marco Rubio, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel did not clearly reaffirm the Six Assurances. After the hearing, Russel clarified to reporters that the Administration remained committed to the Six Assurances as well as the TRA and three Joint Communiques. On April 7, the House agreed (by voice vote) to pass H.R. 3470 , which combines H.Res. 494 (to affirm the TRA) and the Naval Vessel Transfer and Arms Export Control Amendments Act (to authorize the transfer by sale of up to four excess U.S. Navy Perry-class frigates to Taiwan, among other stipulations). On April 9, 52 Senators, led by Senators Menendez and James Inhofe, sent a letter to President Obama to mark the TRA.", "Broad policy issues include whether to review U.S. policy in view of significant changes since the last Taiwan Policy Review in 1994. Some observers have said that the improved cross-strait engagement and reduction of tension since 2008 help U.S. attention to shift to expanding cooperation with a rising China. Others have argued that the self-imposed restrictions on the relationship with Taiwan go beyond the TRA (which did not stipulate \"unofficial\" ties), the reality of official contacts, or the U.S.-PRC joint communiques. They also have concerns that the restrictions undermine critical communication with and denigrate Taiwan, undermining U.S. leverage and interests. An overall issue is whether to pursue further normalization of the relationship and expand engagement with Taiwan, including in the defense, diplomatic, and economic domains. Congress could examine the State Department's restrictions on contacts between Executive Branch officials and Taiwan's officials in the \"Guidelines on Relations with Taiwan\" to carry out an \"unofficial\" relationship. A related issue has been whether to resume and continue visits by Cabinet-rank officials to Taiwan.", "On the 20 th anniversary of the Taiwan Policy Review of 1994, Representative Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, led a total of 29 Members to send a letter, on September 23, 2014, to Secretary of State John Kerry, calling for expanding engagement with Taiwan. The Members stated that \"in view of the fact that there is now a fully free and democratic Taiwan, we feel strongly that there is a need today to undertake a new and thorough Taiwan Policy Review, laying the basis for further expanding relations with Taiwan and thereby enhancing continued peace and stability in the region.\" The State Department, on October 14, acknowledged that, under the TRA, the United States maintains commercial, cultural, and other ties with Taiwan's people, dropping an insistence of the State Department that the bilateral cooperation is \"unofficial.\" The Department's letter cited the \"one China\" policy as based on the three U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques and the TRA but did not cite the Six Assurances. The State Department acknowledged that it continually reviews and improves the interactions with Taiwan but did not refer to specific ways of improving cooperation.", "The Obama Administration's strategic \" rebalancing \" of comprehensive diplomatic, defense, and economic priorities to the Asia-Pacific raised issues about Taiwan's roles and whether the strategy considers Taiwan's security role narrowly in the Taiwan Strait or more broadly in the region. At a hearing in October 2011, Assistant Secretary of State Campbell testified that the United States sought a \"rebalancing\" of comprehensive priorities to focus more on the Asia-Pacific region. He stated that \"a critical part of that overarching strategy is building a comprehensive, durable, and unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan.\" Campbell stressed that \"the bedrock of that relationship is our security relationship.\" After not mentioning Taiwan in an article in Foreign Policy on \"America's Pacific Century\" in October 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the same subject the next month in Honolulu and added that the United States has a strong relationship with Taiwan as an \"important security and economic partner.\" At a conference of defense ministers in Singapore in June 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta discussed the strategic refocus to Asia and mentioned Taiwan by saying that the United States strongly supports the efforts of both the PRC and Taiwan to improve the cross-strait relationship. He added that \"we have an enduring interest in peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\" Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs Jose Fernandez visited Taipei in August, and he spoke about economic exchanges with Taiwan in the context of the rebalancing toward Asia.", "In sum , Congress has exercised important roles in legislating and overseeing the TRA of 1979, as Congress and the President have recalibrated the U.S. \"one China\" policy over the decades. Since the early 1990s, U.S. interests in the military balance as well as Taiwan's security and democracy have faced continued challenges due to the PRC's military modernization, moves perceived by Beijing as promoting de jure independence under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s president (2000-2008), and resistance in Taiwan by the Kuomintang (KMT) party to raising defense spending and strengthening self-defense. Moreover, since 2000, political polarization in Taiwan has raised the importance of U.S. policy toward Taiwan for fostering U.S. interests there. These interests include sustainable stability, U.S.-PRC engagement, Taiwan's democracy, peace, and prosperity (with a global impact), and economic ties with a major trading partner\u2014ultimately a \"peaceful resolution\" of the dispute over Taiwan. At the same time, the dominance of partisan politics in Taiwan has reduced U.S. leverage to advance some U.S. priorities.

The concept of \"one China\" has been complicated by the co-existence of the PRC on the mainland and the ROC on Taiwan since 1949, while they have not recognized each other. Taiwan was never ruled by the CPC or as part of the PRC.

After political liberalization began in 1986, Taiwan became a democracy, with a new basis for the government's legitimacy and greater say by voters about Taiwan's status. The PRC's Tiananmen Crackdown of 1989 dramatically proved the limits to liberal change on the mainland. The original strategic rationale for U.S.-PRC rapprochement faded with the end of the Cold War. In May 2000, the DPP's Chen Shui-bian became President of the ROC, ousting the KMT as the ruling party in Taiwan for the first time in 55 years. Under the DPP, the government in Taipei made greater use of the name \"Taiwan\" (vs. \"ROC\"). The KMT reemphasized \"ROC\" in 2008 and pursued closer ties with \"mainland China.\" The two sides held the first formal meeting since 1949 between officials in charge of cross-strait affairs on February 11, 2014.

The PRC's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's 1984 proposal of \"one China, two systems\" sought to define Taiwan as a Special Administrative Region under the PRC after unification.

The PRC's December 1978 statement on normalization of diplomatic relations with the United States said that the Taiwan question \"has now been resolved between the two countries.\" However, the U.S. statement of December 1978 on normalization stated the expectation that the Taiwan question \"will be settled\" peacefully by the Chinese themselves. The TRA of 1979 also stipulated the U.S. expectation that the future of Taiwan \"will be determined\" by peaceful means. A Representative who managed the legislation for the TRA as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, Lester Wolff, wrote that \"in no sense of the word, through the TRA and/or other relevant documents including the Shanghai Communique, has Congress of the United States ever attempted, except to support self-determination for the people of Taiwan, to determine the final destiny of Taiwan.\"", "President Reagan's 1982 statement on arms sales to Taiwan declared that \"the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people, on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, to resolve.\" Under U.S. policy, \"settlement\" or \"resolution\"\u2014not stated as \"unification\" or \"reunification\"\u2014of the Taiwan question is left open to be determined peacefully and with a shift to stress a resolution by both sides of the strait (rather than involving the United Nations (U.N.) or another country). In a rare public statement on this U.S. stance, in August 2007, a National Security Council official said that \"the position of the United States Government is that the ROC\u2014Republic of China\u2014is an issue undecided ... for many, many years.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peaceful Settlement", "paragraphs": ["Third, the questions of the PRC's possible use of force, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and possible U.S. help in Taiwan's self-defense were left contentious and critical for U.S. interests.

Washington has not promised to end arms sales to Taiwan, although the Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 was terminated on December 31, 1979. In the surprise announcements of December 1978 on diplomatic recognition, the United States stated its interest in a peaceful resolution, but the PRC countered that Taiwan is China's internal affair.

There have been issues about whether and how U.S. statements of intentions might be clarified to specify the conditions under which the U.S. military might help to defend Taiwan and the U.S. stance on Taiwan's sovereignty or efforts to change its declared political status. Questions also have persisted about the extent of the U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan, given President Clinton's 1996 deployment of two aircraft carriers near Taiwan, President Bush's initial statement in 2001 of doing \"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself,\" and Taiwan's budgetary limitations in self-defense capabilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Has U.S. Policy Changed?", "paragraphs": ["Apart from questions about the language in the key statements on \"one China,\" policy questions have arisen about whether successive Administrations have changed the U.S. position since 1971 to adapt to changing circumstances and whether such shifts have advanced U.S. interests.

Some in Congress and others, however, have contended that U.S. policy has changed in some important areas.

In short, U.S. policy has stressed the process (peaceful resolution, cross-strait dialogue, with the assent of Taiwan's people, and no provocations or unilateral changes by either side) rather than the outcome (e.g., unification, independence, confederation).

The State Department also wrote that", "In neither [the Japanese Peace Treaty of 1951 nor the Treaty of Peace between the Republic of China and Japan of 1952] did Japan cede this area [of Formosa and the Pescadores] to any particular entity. As Taiwan and the Pescadores are not covered by any existing international disposition, sovereignty over the area is an unsettled question subject to future international resolution. Both the Republic of China and the Chinese Communists disagree with this conclusion and consider that Taiwan and the Pescadores are part of the sovereign state of China. The United States recognizes the Government of the Republic of China as legitimately occupying and exercising jurisdiction over Taiwan and the Pescadores.", "However, accounts of President Nixon's secret talks with PRC Premier Zhou Enlai in China in 1972 reported that Nixon made promises on the question of Taiwan in return for diplomatic normalization that went beyond the communique issued at the end. The Carter Administration later called the promises: \"Nixon's Five Points.\" Also, according to Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth's March 1999 testimony, Nixon pledged no U.S. support for Taiwan independence (second time after Kissinger's 1971 promise): \"We have not and will not support any Taiwan independence movement.\" With the release on December 11, 2003, of declassified memoranda of conversation of the secret talks between Nixon and Zhou, there was confirmation that Nixon stated as first of Five Principles that \"there is one China, and Taiwan is a part of China. There will be no more statements made\u2014if I can control our bureaucracy\u2014to the effect that the status of Taiwan is undetermined.\"", "The United States did not explicitly state its own position on the status of Taiwan in the three U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques. In 1972, while still recognizing the ROC, the Nixon Administration declared that it \"acknowledges\" that \"all Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait\" maintain that there is one China and Taiwan is a part of China, and that the United States did not challenge that position. After shifting diplomatic recognition to the PRC, the United States, in 1979 and 1982, again \"acknowledged the Chinese position\" of one China and Taiwan is part of China. However, the 1982 communique further stated that the United States has no intention of pursuing a policy of \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan,\" while President Reagan's accompanying statement said that \"the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people, on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, to resolve.\" The TRA did not discuss the \"one China\" concept. In 1994, the Clinton Administration stated after its Taiwan Policy Review that the United States had \"acknowledged\" the Chinese position on one China and that \"since 1978, each Administration has reaffirmed this policy.\"", "Despite these apparent similarities in U.S. policy statements, some contend that the U.S. position, since originally formulated in 1972, has adopted the PRC's \"one China\" principle\u2014rather than steadily maintaining neutrality and equal distance from Beijing and Taipei. In 1982, Senator John Glenn criticized both the Carter and Reagan Administrations:", "The ambiguous formulation agreed upon in the 1979 joint communique went considerably further in recognizing the PRC's claim to Taiwan. Although the word \"acknowledged\" remained, the object of our acknowledgment shifted noticeably. We no longer just acknowledged that both Chinas asserted the principle that there was one China, but instead acknowledged the Chinese position that there is but one China. By dropping the key phrase \"all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain\" one could interpret that we had moved from the position of neutral bystander noting the existence of a dispute, to a party accepting the Chinese assertion that there is one China. Clearly, this was the PRC's interpretation.... More recently, Peking's threats to downgrade relations with the United States, unless Washington agreed to end all arms sales to Taiwan, prompted President Reagan to write to China's Communist Party Chairman, Hu Yaobang, in May 1982, and assure him that, \"Our policy will continue to be based on the principle that there is but one China.... \" We now assert that it is our policy, U.S. policy, that there is but one China, and although not stated, indicate implicitly that Taiwan is a part of that one China. The use of the qualifier \"acknowledged\" has been dropped altogether.... I do not believe that anyone can dispute that the U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan has changed dramatically over the last 10 years. Let me reiterate one more time, in 1972, we acknowledged that the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait maintained that there was but one China. Today it is U.S. policy that there is but one China.

The opposition to Taiwan independence seemed to go beyond the promises made by former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and President Nixon in 1971 and 1972 of no U.S. support for Taiwan independence. Later, that wording was apparently changed from opposition to a neutral stance of non-support. This letter reportedly formed the basis of what were later known publicly as the \"Three Noes.\"", "At the 1997 Clinton-Jiang summit in Washington, the two leaders issued a joint statement which included a U.S. position: \"the United States reiterates that it adheres to its 'one China' policy and the principles set forth in the three U.S.-China joint communiques.\" While that joint statement did not include the \"Three Noes,\" the Administration designated the State Department's spokesperson to say two days later that \"we certainly made clear that we have a one-China policy; that we don't support a one-China, one-Taiwan policy. We don't support a two-China policy. We don't support Taiwan independence, and we don't support Taiwanese membership in organizations that require you to be a member state.\" While in China for a summit in June 1998, President Clinton chose an informal forum to declare: \"I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy, which is that we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which statehood is a requirement.\"", "Some questioned whether the \"Three Noes,\" especially as it was publicly declared by the U.S. President while in the PRC, was a change in U.S. policy. U.S. non-support for a one China, one Taiwan; or two Chinas can be traced to the private assurances of the Nixon Administration in the early 1970s. However, the Clinton Administration, beginning with its Taiwan Policy Review of 1994, added non-support for Taipei's re-entry into the U.N., which became an issue after Taipei launched its bid in 1993. In response to President Clinton's \"Three Noes,\" concerned Members in both the Senate and the House nearly unanimously passed resolutions in July 1998, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Taiwan.", "The Clinton Administration, nonetheless, argued that the \"Three Noes\" did not represent a change in policy. Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 25, 1999, Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth stated that \"every point made there [in the \"Three Noes\"] had been made before by a previous Administration and there was no change whatsoever.\" In a written response to a question from Senator Helms, Roth cited as precedents for the \"Three Noes\" a 1971 statement by Kissinger, a 1972 statement by Nixon, a 1979 statement by Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, and President Reagan's 1982 Communique."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "President Bush on Taiwan's Independence, Referendums, Constitution", "paragraphs": ["On April 25, 2001, when President George W. Bush stated the U.S. commitment to Taiwan as an obligation to use \"whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself,\" he also said that \"a declaration of independence is not the one China policy, and we will work with Taiwan to make sure that that doesn't happen.\" Visiting Beijing in February 2002, Bush said that U.S. policy on Taiwan was unchanged, but he emphasized U.S. commitment to the TRA and a peaceful resolution, along with opposition to provocations by either Beijing or Taipei. After Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian said on August 3, 2002, that there is \"one country on each side\" of the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. National Security Council (NSC) stated, in a second response, that \"we do not support Taiwan independence.\" With Jiang Zemin at his side at a summit in Crawford, TX, in October 2002, President Bush himself stated that \"we do not support independence.\"", "However, there have been questions about whether the Bush Administration adjusted U.S. policy after President Chen Shui-bian surprised the United States in August 2002 with a speech on \"one country on each side\" and a call for a holding referendums. Specifically, there was the issue of whether President Bush gave assurances, at closed meetings starting at that summit in October 2002, to PRC President Jiang Zemin and later President Hu Jintao that the United States was \"against\" or \"opposed\" (vs. non-support of) unilateral moves in Taiwan toward independence and/or the status of Taiwan independence, in the interest of stability in the Taiwan Strait. A position in \"opposition\" to Taiwan independence would represent a shift in policy focus from the process to the outcome and go beyond President Nixon's \"Five Principles,\" which expressed the neutral stance of \"non-support\" for Taiwan independence. But U.S. opposition to Taiwan independence would be consistent with President Clinton's secret letter reportedly sent in 1995 to PRC leader Jiang Zemin, as the basis for the \"Three Noes.\" U.S. opposition would also conflict with the stance of the government of Taiwan, which, under the DPP, argued that Taiwan is already independent, as evident since the first democratic presidential election in 1996.", "After Chen, during campaigns for Taiwan's presidential election in March 2004, advocated holding referendums and adopting a new constitution by 2008\u2014moves that could have implications for Taiwan's sovereignty and cross-strait stability, the Bush Administration called on Chen to adhere to his pledges (\"Five Noes\") in his inaugural address of 2000 (including not promoting a referendum to change the status quo). On September 28, 2003, Chen started his call for a new constitution for Taiwan (with a draft constitution by September 28, 2006; a referendum on the constitution on December 10, 2006; and enactment of the new constitution on May 20, 2008). National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on October 14, 2003, that \"nobody should try unilaterally to change the status quo.\" A White House official said in an interview on November 26, 2003, that \"Taiwan shouldn't be moving towards independence; and mainland China shouldn't be moving towards the use of force or coercion.\" Then, Chen announced on November 29\u2014two days after the opposition-dominated legislature passed a restrictive law authorizing referendums\u2014that he would still use one provision to hold a \"defensive referendum\" on election day. Chen argued that the referendum would be a way for Taiwan's people to express their opposition to the PLA's missile threat and would have nothing to do with the question of unification or independence.", "Nonetheless, Administration officials had concerns about the volatile course of current and future political actions in Taiwan (with elections, referendums, and a new constitution), reforms geared for governance vs sovereignty, and unnecessary effects on stability, given U.S. commitments to help Taiwan's self-defense. The Administration added a new, clearer stance on December 1, 2003, when the State Department expressed U.S. \"opposition\" to any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move toward independence. On the same day, the Senior Director of Asian Affairs at the NSC, James Moriarty, reportedly was in Taiwan to pass a letter from Bush to Chen with concerns about \"provocations.\" Apparently needing a public, stronger, and clearer U.S. message to Taiwan, Bush appeared next to visiting PRC Premier Wen Jiabao at the White House on December 9, 2003, and stated an opposition to any unilateral decision by China or Taiwan to change the status quo, as well as opposition to efforts by Taiwan's President Chen to change the status quo, in response to a question about whether Chen should cancel the referendum.", "However, Bush did not make public remarks against the PRC's threats toward democratic Taiwan. Bush also did not counter Wen's remarks that Bush reiterated \"opposition\" to Taiwan independence. Bush raised questions about whether he miscalculated the willingness of Chen to back down during his re-election campaign and risked U.S. credibility, since Chen responded defiantly that he would hold the \"anti-missile, anti-war\" referendums as planned and that his intention was to keep Taiwan's current independent status quo from being changed.", "American opinions were divided on the Bush Administration's statements toward Taiwan. Some saw Chen as advancing a provocative agenda of permanent separation from China while trying to win votes, and supported Bush's forceful stance against Chen's plan for referendums. Others criticized President Bush for being one-sided in appeasing a dictatorship at the expense of Taiwan's democracy while failing to warn against and even possibly inviting aggression from Beijing. The co-chairmen of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus in the House wrote a letter to President Bush, criticizing his stance as a victory for the authoritarian regime of the PRC at the expense of Taiwan's democratic reforms. Some critics argued for a new approach, saying that the \"one China\" policy became \"irrelevant\" and that there were national security interests in preventing the \"unification\" of Taiwan with China. In contrast, another opinion advocated the continuation of arms sales to Taiwan with no position on its independence and staying out of any conflict in the Taiwan Strait.", "Still, uncertainty remained about the Bush Administration's implementation of U.S. policy on questions such as options to recalibrate policy in exercising leverage over Taipei or Beijing; capacity to maintain the delicate balance in preventing provocations by either side of the strait rather than swerving to one side or another; perceptions in Taipei and Beijing of mixed messages from Washington; the U.S. stance on referendums and a new constitution in Taiwan; definition of \"status quo\"; deference to democracy in Taiwan; Taiwan's long-standing, de facto independence from China; stronger separate national identity in Taiwan; a proactive U.S. political role (such as urging dialogue, facilitating talks, or mediating negotiations) in addition to proactive pressures on defense; the extent of the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan's self-defense; the increasing PLA threat; and U.S. worries about Taiwan's defense spending, acquisitions, and the will to fight.", "On January 16, 2004, Chen gave the wording for the two questions, saying that the referendums will ask citizens (1) whether the government should acquire more missile defense systems if the Chinese Communists do not withdraw missiles and renounce the use of force against Taiwan, and (2) whether the government should negotiate with the Chinese Communists on a framework for cross-strait peace and stability. Chen also promised that if re-elected, he will maintain \"the status quo of cross-strait peace.\" On the election day of March 20, 2004, the two referendums failed to be considered valid when 45% of eligible voters cast ballots (less than the 50% needed).", "After the election in March 2004, the White House sent the Senior Director for Asian Affairs, Michael Green, to Taiwan to urge President Chen to exclude sovereignty-related issues from constitutional changes.

He said that \"the central question is how cross-strait relations can move from a focus on the military balance toward a focus on ways to begin resolving differences between Taipei and Beijing.\" While calling for a resumption of direct dialogue, economic cooperation, and mutual understanding, Kelly also said that \"the PRC cannot ignore the elected representatives of the people of Taiwan.\" While visiting Taiwan at about the same time that PRC Vice Premier Qian Qichen signaled a new receptive policy toward the ruling DPP in Taiwan, Richard Bush, chairman of AIT, said on January 28, 2002, that \"the United States favors and encourages dialogue but has no intention of serving as a mediator in this dispute or of pressuring Taiwan to negotiate.\" He added that \"it does not seem constructive for one side to set pre-conditions for a resumption of dialogue that the other side even suspects would be tantamount to conceding a fundamental issue before discussion begins.\"", "In March 2002, Assistant Secretary of State Kelly told attendees at a conference that the Bush Administration would continue to uphold the \"Six Assurances,\" meaning no U.S. mediation and no pressure on Taiwan to go to the bargaining table. In testimony at a hearing in April 2004, after Chen Shui-bian's re-election in the March election, Kelly again reaffirmed the \"Six Assurances,\" but explicitly warned that \"a secure and self-confident Taiwan is a Taiwan that is more capable of engaging in political interaction and dialogue with the PRC, and we expect Taiwan will not interpret our support as a blank check to resist such dialogue.\" He urged both Beijing and Taipei to pursue dialogue \"as soon as possible\" and \"without preconditions.\"", "Moreover, the George W. Bush Administration started by emphasizing deterrence and approved Taiwan's requests for major arms in 2001. In 2004, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice did urge Beijing to resume cross-strait talks and offered a vague U.S. role \"to further dialogue if it is helpful.\" Though the Administration repeatedly stated that Beijing should talk to the duly-elected leaders in Taipei, the Administration continued the approach of non-mediation in any talks. In 2005, in answer to Representative Leach about a U.S. role as \"facilitator,\" Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall Schriver vaguely testified that good U.S. relations with Beijing and Taipei allow Washington to \"assist the two sides in getting to the negotiating table on mutually agreeable terms.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Obama Administration and Convergence on \"Peaceful Development\"", "paragraphs": ["In 2005, the KMT and CPC agreed on a party-to-party platform of cross-strait \"peaceful development.\" After the KMT's Ma Ying-jeou became president in Taiwan in 2008, CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao issued a policy toward Taiwan of \"peaceful development.\" A related issue was whether the United States should encourage or play another role in the increasing cross-strait dialogues that would include confidence-building measures (CBMs). In September 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg stated that the Administration \"encouraged\" the PRC and Taiwan to explore CBMs that would lead to closer ties and greater stability across the strait. His encouragement of CBMs raised expectations of an active U.S. role and injected new U.S. pressure in a sensitive domestic debate in Taiwan over whether such CBMs were premature and would serve Taiwan's security interests. President Obama held a summit in Beijing in November 2009 with Hu Jintao, and they issued the first U.S.-PRC Joint Statement in 12 years since the Clinton-Jiang Joint Statement of 1997. In the statement, the United States did not use \"encouragement\" of cross-strait CBMs. In the 2009 Joint Statement, the United States declared that it welcomed the \"peaceful development\" of relations across the Taiwan Strait and looked forward to efforts by both sides to increase dialogues and interactions in economic, political, and other fields, and develop more positive and stable cross-strait relations. AIT Chairman Ray Burghardt clarified at a news conference in Taipei on November 24, 2009, that the Joint Statement should not be interpreted as putting pressure on Taiwan to negotiate with the PRC.

Nonetheless, policy makers have continued to face unresolved issues, while the political and strategic context of the policy has changed dramatically since the early 1970s. Congressional oversight of successive Presidents has watched for any new agreements with Beijing and any shift in the U.S. stance closer to that of Beijing's \"one China\" principle \u2014on questions of sovereignty, arms sales, or dialogue. Since the 1990s, successive Administrations also have shown more explicit opposition\u2014through arms sales, force deployments, deeper U.S.-Taiwan military ties, and public statements\u2014to PRC efforts to use force or coercion to determine Taiwan's future. Not recognizing the PRC's claim over Taiwan or Taiwan as a sovereign state, U.S. policy has considered Taiwan's status as unsettled. U.S. policy leaves the Taiwan question to be resolved by the people on both sides of the strait: a \"peaceful resolution\" with the assent of Taiwan's people and without unilateral changes. In other words, U.S. policy focuses on the process of resolution of the Taiwan question, not any set outcome.", "This approach, however, encounters challenges from Taiwan as it denies being an ambiguous non-entity and asserts a sovereign status, as the ROC under the KMT or Taiwan under the DPP. Even as the United States has opposed a unilateral change from Beijing or Taipei to the status quo, the meaning of \"status quo\" remains a question. Some say that instead of a \"status quo,\" the situation in the Taiwan Strait has changed significantly, including the shifting military balance to favor the PRC and the rapid rapprochement and extensive engagement\u2014beyond d\u00e9tente\u2014between the PRC and Taiwan under the CPC and KMT's dialogues, particularly since 2008. ", "There has been no comprehensive review of U.S. policy since 1994.
