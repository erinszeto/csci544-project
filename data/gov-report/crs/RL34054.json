{"id": "RL34054", "title": "Public-Private Partnership for a Public Safety Network: Governance and Policy", "released_date": "2008-10-16T00:00:00", "summary": ["This report summarizes salient points of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) actions regarding the creation of a public-private partnership to build and manage a national communications network for public safety use. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, empowers the FCC to set rules for auctions and to take steps to ensure the safety of the public. The FCC has used this authority to design a governance structure that would allow a Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL) to share spectrum rights with a commercial enterprise and to collaborate in the construction and management of a shared network. As currently proposed by the FCC, a public-private partnership would build a shared network on spectrum capacity assigned to two separate license-holders. In the FCC plan, the PSBL would hold a national license of 10MHz in the 700 MHz band and a commercial partner would hold an adjacent license for 10 MHz, nationwide, designated as the D Block. The two licensees and the network would operate according to requirements set out by the FCC as part of its rulemaking for the auction of frequencies within the 700 MHz band. These frequencies are being vacated by television broadcasters in their switch to digital technologies.", "In an auction that ended on March 18, 2008, the one bid for the D Block was well below the reserve price set for that license. The FCC therefore did not assign the license but has proceeded to review its rules regarding licensing, structuring a partnership, setting service requirements, and other rules and obligations established prior to the commencement of Auction 73. It has prepared a further notice of proposed rule-making that seeks comments on identified options that might be pursued in disposing of the D Block. The FCC's current proposals for the creation of a nationwide, interoperable public safety broadband network depend on the successful sale of the D Block to a commercial entity willing to invest in a public-private network partnership. The FCC auction requirements do not reference Congress's requirements for the Department of Homeland Security to provide a national communications capability (P.L. 109-295, Title VI, Subtitle D).", "Some of the proposals from the FCC or frequently mentioned by industry experts are reviewed in this report. Some of the possible solutions can be achieved exclusively through the rule-making process but several that address how best to salvage plans for a nationwide, broadband network for public safety would require the assistance of Congress through legislation. A bill that would provide financial assistance to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee through grants made by the FCC has been introduced. The Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055, Harman) would establish conditions for the operations of the PSBL and would provide $1 million in both FY2009 and FY2010 for expenses. An additional $2 million would be authorized for used by the FCC \"to promote the establishment of a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety communications network.\" The Reliable, Effective, and Sustained Procurement of New Devices for Emergency Responders (RESPONDER) Act of 2008 (S. 3465, Wicker) would create a First Responders Interoperable Device Availability Trust Fund to provide grants to purchase interoperable radios for the new public safety network."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This discussion of governance for a public-private partnership is based on preparations undertaken by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band of radio spectrum in conformance with requirements in the Deficit Reduction Act. The FCC issued rules, in a Second Report and Order , concerning the allocation of this spectrum, the auction, the final disposition of spectrum assigned for public safety use, and the creation of a public-private partnership to build and operate a network for public safety users, with agreements for sharing spectrum. Responding to a requirement in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the FCC had previously set aside 24 MHz in the same bandwidth for public safety users. In the Second Report and Order , it proposed to set aside 10 MHz from the public safety frequency bands to be paired with 10 MHz of auctionable spectrum to create a shared network of 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network.", "The decision to create a shared network was centered on two conclusions, endorsed by the FCC and the majority of stakeholders: (1) that a network with national coverage would meet public safety needs for robust communications capabilities, information, and interoperability; and (2) that sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety by providing new sources of funding, economies of scale in building the needed network, and access to additional spectrum in times of large-scale emergencies, among other benefits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public-Private Partnership: The Auction", "paragraphs": ["As structured by the FCC, two adjacent spectrum license-holders would collaborate so that their combined spectrum capacity would be adequate to support a broadband network. In anticipation of obtaining a commercial partner, the FCC assigned a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation formed to represent public safety interests. This public safety license was created from the 24 MHz originally assigned to public safety through regional, state, and local negotiations for spectrum assignments. It is administered by a Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL), chosen by the FCC. From the frequencies intended for commercial use, the FCC designated 10 MHz to be paired with public safety's 10 MHz to create a shared network. This license was to be sold to a commercial enterprise as part of the auction of licenses at 700 MHz, Auction 73. The commercial license, known as the D Block, attracted only one bidder at the auction, which concluded March 18, 2008. Qualcomm, Inc. placed an opening bid of $472 million but there were no other bidders; consequently, the reserve price of $1.3 billion set by the FCC was not met. In an Order adopted and released on March 20, 2008, the FCC directed the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau not to proceed with the re-auction of the D Block because it is \"in the public interest to provide additional time to consider all options ...\"", "The FCC therefore initiated a review of its rules regarding licensing, structuring a partnership, setting service requirements, and other rules and obligations established prior to the commencement of Auction 73. It prepared a further notice of proposed rule-making that sought comments on identified options that might be pursued in disposing of the D Block. From these comments, the FCC prepared a Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that lays out new auction rules for the D Block. For the most part, the new rules represent modifications of the rules prepared for Auction 73. A single, nationwide license has been maintained for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee but the commercial license will be offered as either a national license or in smaller licenses covering 58 regions. A number of public safety associations and officials have asked that the PSBL allow local public safety networks to operate on and manage access to the public safety spectrum.

The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are pursuing separate paths for developing this communications response. According to testimony, neither agency has undertaken to incorporate each other's goals in their specific planning.", "Another major policy consideration for Congress is the identification of funding solutions for various parts of the program. As discussed below, the FCC has proposed to resolve these needs through levies on the commercial partner or requirements for performance. Public sector funding is another possibility that may receive renewed interest in the current economic situation. An economic stimulus program that includes funding for improvements to critical infrastructure could include a component for public safety networks. By temporarily assuming the role of the commercial partner, the federal government could preserve the principle of the shared network, assure the construction of the network, and sell the ongoing business to the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public-Private Partnership: Key Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["It was noted above that there is general agreement that sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users would benefit public safety by providing new sources of funding, economies of scale in building the needed network, and access to additional spectrum in times of large-scale emergencies. These benefits are generally accepted as concrete and desirable and, although there is much discussion about how to achieve the goal of sharing resources between the public and private sectors, the consensus remains that this is the goal. For the purpose of analysis, this report further assumes three needs that must be met for an effective solution. These are", "Sufficient spectrum for a broadband network. The amount of spectrum needed to operate a nationwide broadband network, with the coverage required by public safety, is at least 20 MHz, according to most experts. Source of funds. A source of funds needs to be identified to meet unavoidable costs to public safety associated with the creation of a single, national public safety license. These costs include the costs of rebanding as part of the new allocation plan for 700 MHz set forth by the FCC, and the costs of spectrum license administration and frequency coordination\u2014tasks usually managed through state or local agencies. Management structure. The key elements for a public-private partnership as set forth by the FCC are: 1) a Public Safety Broadband Licensee; 2) a public-private partnership; and 3) a Network Sharing Agreement, required in order to build and manage a network shared by commercial users and emergency personnel.", "There is also a frequently mentioned assumption that is not associated with a particular solution.", "Commercial partner(s) will use the shared network for consumer services and therefore incentives are required to build out a network that meets the higher standards required for public safety.", "This assumption ignores the projections for significant demand from the business sector for mobile access to data and the requirements of many businesses for security and reliability equal to or greater than those of public safety."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public-Private Partnership: The Debate and Options", "paragraphs": ["Since the conclusion of the auction, there has been a vigorous public debate about why the D Block license was not successfully auctioned and what steps might be taken going forward to assign the license. Some of the reasons why the D Block failed to attract a winning bid have been circulated through the media and presented at congressional hearings. Discussion of possible flaws in the structure of the auction, and how some rules may have discouraged potential bidders, is only part of the debate. The debate also encompasses other solutions to meet the goal of proving an interoperable public safety broadband network. Principle points under consideration can be categorized as", "Modify the auction rules to eliminate FCC requirements that might have discouraged potential bidders and keep the structure of the public-private partnership intact. This course assumes that the business case for the public-private partnership is sound and changing auction rules, without changing the structure of the partnership, will be sufficient to attract a bidder. Eliminate the network sharing requirement, while empowering public safety to negotiate independently for public-private partnerships or other sharing agreements, and auction the D Block license without the public safety requirements. This course assumes that there is both a structure and adequate spectrum capacity to enable different entities to collaborate successfully in constructing a nationwide capability for public safety interoperability. Use federal funds to build a public safety network. This course is usually predicated on using proceeds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies and assumes that there are sufficient funds and a management structure to achieve the goal. This course notably requires congressional action to authorize expenditures. Choose a different organizational structure for managing a public safety network that shares resources and infrastructure with commercial and other spectrum-license holders. This course requires congressional action to authorize expenditures and may further require legislation to provide the organizational structure.", "These solutions are not mutually exclusive and several proposals combine different elements.

The rule changes for the auction could be modifications of requirements for the D-Block winning bidder\u2014such as lowering the reserve price or eliminating the financial penalty for failure to negotiate a completed Network Sharing Agreement\u2014or they could include, for example, changes in the network sharing agreement or the terms applicable to the Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alter or Eliminate the Network Sharing Agreement", "paragraphs": ["Another course of action that has been proposed is to re-auction the D Block without encumbrances.

Martin referred to the Public Safety Interoperability Implementation Act ( H.R. 3116 , Representative Stupak), which would use spectrum license auction proceeds to fund public safety communications, as an example of a mechanism to provide funding. FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps testified that they preferred a solution that used federal funds to meet public safety needs for a nationwide, interoperable network. Absent financial support from the federal government for a public safety network, they testified, the FCC has sought to craft a solution that would use private sector funds to build the needed network.

The obligation of the public-private partnership would be to build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz that regional, state, and local networks could connect to in times of large-scale emergencies. This would require a smaller financial commitment from the commercial partner and a greater level of participation by state and local agencies that would build out and control access to their parts of the network Network builders and operators would collaborate on solutions to provide interoperability. Appropriated funds for public safety might be distributed through existing grant programs. The commercial network might be the dominant partner, working with hundreds of public safety collaborators, and would therefore probably take the lead in investment and technology decisions. Cooperative organization: multiple commercial partners. Instead of a single D Block partner, with a national license, licenses could be assigned to a hundred or more commercial partners with licenses for local markets and rural coverage. In this case, the public safety partner would take the lead in designing the network and choosing the technology and standards to which the commercial partners would be required to build. Conceivably, the FCC could fill the role of network designer, setting standards through rule-making. Federal agency. The network sharing agreement would place greater emphasis on the competitive position of the commercial partner. Federal funds, administered primarily through existing programs within the Department of Homeland Security, could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz customers. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized and replaced by greater support and participation through funding. To assure the economic viability of the public safety network, the federal government might identify federal programs that could participate as network customers. Federal corporation. While assuring the same broad-based participation of public safety agencies through a board of directors, a federally chartered corporation, federally chartered not-for-profit corporation, or some quasi-federal organization would be able to hire skilled professionals to operate the network. Funding could come from appropriations for that purpose, through empowerment to raise funds, or a combination of funding tools. The Public Safety Broadband License could remain with the not-for-profit corporation that currently holds the license, the Public Safety Spectrum Trust, or could be re-assigned. Laws governing corporate conduct and congressional oversight would replace the regulatory and oversight roles the FCC crafted through the mechanism of auction rules. New public safety network.
