The President directed NASA to focus its activities on returning humans to the Moon by 2020, and someday sending them to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" Robotic probes would serve as pathfinders for human missions, and also be used to continue studies of the universe (using space-based telescopes, for example). Other countries were invited to participate. The President directed NASA to develop a Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) to take crews to Earth orbit by 2014, but its primary purpose is taking them to and from the Moon. In September 2005, NASA estimated that returning humans to the Moon by 2018 would cost $104 billion, not including approximately $20 billion for using the CEV to take crews to and from the International Space Station, nor the costs of robotic lunar probes. A cost estimate for sending people to Mars was not provided.", "The President did not propose significant increased funding for NASA to accomplish the Vision. Instead, most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other NASA activities. Debate over the Vision initially focused on whether the country could afford such an initiative considering other national funding needs, and the relative importance of funding the Vision versus other NASA activities. The original NASA FY2006 request was crafted by then-NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, who left the agency in February 2005. The original request did not specify how much was for the Vision, although a NASA briefing chart identified $6 billion for \"exploration specific\" activities. Another $6.4 billion was requested for the space shuttle and space station programs\u2014often described as the first steps in the Vision. The remainder of the budget, $4.1 billion, was labeled \"Earth Science, Aero & Others\" (\"Aero\" is for aeronautics).", "In terms of the first issue, supporters of the Vision point to the relatively small percentage of federal budget authority that is allocated to NASA\u20140.7 % in FY2005\u2014as an indication that it is not a significant factor in the nation's overall spending. Skeptics counter that spending more than $16 billion on NASA is a luxury when many domestic discretionary programs are being cut, and federal R&D spending overall is not keeping pace with inflation. Regarding the second issue, Vision proponents argue that NASA should focus on the President's Vision even though it may mean cutting back on NASA's aeronautics, earth science, and certain space science activities. Others disagree, including the new Administrator of NASA, Dr. Griffin. He has repeatedly stated that he will not take money from NASA's space science, earth science, or aeronautics activities in order to fund the Vision (although he is taking funds from physical and life sciences research). Instead, the Vision will be conducted on a \"go as you can afford to pay\" basis. Dr. Griffin's approach apparently has alleviated concerns by many members of the space science, earth science, and aeronautics communities who feared their programs would suffer because of the Vision. Nevertheless, NASA's budget remains constrained because of the funding requirements for the Vision, higher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the 2003 Columbia tragedy, cost growth in other NASA programs (including several space science programs), a shortfall of $3-5 billion for the shuttle program in the five-year budget plan submitted together with the FY2006 budget request, and costs associated with funding congressional directed items.", "NASA's current human space flight programs, the space shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS), are being significantly affected by the Vision. Both will be terminated earlier than planned to make that funding available for the Vision. The President directed that the space shuttle be retired in 2010 after ISS construction is completed. Dr. Griffin has indicated his intent to terminate the shuttle at the end of FY2010 (September 30, 2010) whether or not ISS construction is completed. The President directed that the new CEV be available by 2014, which would leave a multi-year gap when the United States would not be able to launch its own astronauts into space. Dr. Griffin wants to accelerate development of the CEV to reduce the \"gap\" when NASA have to rely on Russia to launch U.S. astronauts. He hopes to have the CEV ready by 2012, and is reprioritizing activities within the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate to provide more funding to the CEV in the next several years.", "Some Members of Congress want to avoid a gap entirely by continuing the shuttle program until the CEV is available. S. 1281 , the Senate version of the NASA authorization bill, as reported from committee, directed NASA not to retire the shuttle until a replacement is available. That was modified in the version that passed the Senate, however. It now states that it is U.S. policy to possess the capability for assured human access to space, and directs the NASA Administrator to act to ensure that capability and to make a number of related reports to Congress in future years. The House bill ( H.R. 3070 ), as passed by the House, is silent on the issue. The House passed the Senate bill on November 18 after striking all after the enacting clause and inserting the text of H.R. 3070 in lieu therefore. The House appointed conferees the same day.", "As for the ISS, the President directed NASA to restructure the broadly-based research program it had planned to conduct aboard ISS to support only research needed to accomplish the Vision. Some want to restore the research program to what was planned prior to the Vision. S. 1281 , the Senate version of the NASA authorization bill, as passed by the Senate, adds funding for ISS research and makes other changes to augment its research role. H.R. 3070 , as passed by the House, directs that 15% of the research funding for the ISS be used for research not related to the Vision. A NASA budget chart released along with the President's speech showed NASA completing its use of the ISS by FY2017. What will happen to it after that time is unclear.", "The initial FY2006 request for the ISS was $2.180 billion: $1.857 billion for construction and operations (including $160 million for ISS Crew/Cargo Services) and $324 million for research. The amended request moved ISS Crew/Cargo Services to another part of the NASA budget and reduced the amount for ISS construction and operations commensurately (although it identified $168 million for that activity instead of $160 million as was indicated in the original request). In the final version of the FY2006 appropriations bill ( P.L. 109-108 ), Congress cut $80 million from the ISS program, including $60 million from ISS Crew/Cargo Services. They also cut $25 million from the account that funds research on ISS, though they did not specify that the cuts be made to the ISS-related portion of that account. The authorization bills do not identify an amount for the ISS.", "The House and Senate appropriations and authorization committees that oversee NASA have all expressed support for the Vision, with the proviso that NASA should continue to have a balanced set of programs in science, exploration, and aeronautics, not focus solely on the Vision.", "The amount of funding that is available for various NASA activities will affect workforce levels. NASA's FY2006 budget request assumes that the number of budgeted civil service full time equivalents (FTEs) will drop by almost 2,500 in the next year and a half\u2014from 19,227 in FY2005 to 16,738 for FY2007. How to \"right size\" NASA, its facilities, and its workforce, and ensure NASA has the necessary skill mix for the Vision, are among the issues facing Congress. H.R. 3070 as passed by the House prohibits Reductions in Force (RIFs) or other involuntary separations (except for cause) at NASA prior to February 16, 2007. The final version of the FY2006 appropriation act ( P.L. 109-108 ) restricts NASA's use of buyouts and Reductions in Force (RIFs) prior to NASA providing certain reports to Congress.", "Another issue is whether or not to send the shuttle to service the Hubble Space Telescope (see CRS Report RS21767, Hubble Space Telescope: NASA's Plans for a Servicing Mission , by [author name scrubbed]). Two days after the President's Vision speech, then-Administrator O'Keefe announced that the shuttle would not be used to conduct further Hubble servicing missions, citing shuttle safety concerns in the wake of the February 1, 2003 Columbia tragedy as the primary reason. Widespread criticism led NASA to explore the possibility of a robotic servicing mission instead, but a December 2004 report from the National Research Council concluded that a robotic servicing mission was not likely to succeed in the time available. In the FY2006 request, NASA requested money only for a deorbit mission (to ensure that Hubble reenters from orbit without posing danger to populated areas). Dr. Griffin has pledged to revisit the possibility of a shuttle servicing mission after the shuttle completes its two \"Return to Flight\" (RTF) missions and its risk factors are better understood following the post- Columbia modifications. (The first RTF mission was launched on July 26, 2005, but problems were encountered. The second RTF flight will not take place before May 2006.) Meanwhile, Dr. Griffin directed NASA engineers to resume planning for a shuttle servicing mission. Conferees on the appropriations bill added $50 million for a Hubble servicing mission.

The legislation provides a total of $5,653.4 million for NSF in FY2006, $48.4 million above the Administration's request and $180.6 million above the FY2005 estimate.

Additional priority areas include those of strengthening core disciplinary research, broadening participation in the science and engineering workforce, and sustaining organizational excellence in NSF management practices. An investment of approximately $509 million in cyberinfrastructure will allow for funding of modeling, simulation, visualization and data storage, and other communications breakthroughs. NSF anticipates that this level of funding will make cyberinfrastructure more powerful, stable, and accessible to researchers and educators through widely shared research facilities. Increasing grant size and duration has been a long-term priority for NSF. The funding rate for research grants has declined from approximately 30% in the late 1990s to an estimated 20% in FY2005. In FY2006, the NSF will increase the rate to 21%, while maintaining current gains in award size and duration. NSF recognizes that international research partnerships are critical to the nation in maintaining a competitive edge, addressing global issues, and capitalizing on global economic opportunities. To address these particular needs, the FY2006 appropriation provides $35 million for the Office of International Science and Engineering.

The recommendations provided in the report are based on the budget levels contained in the authorization.

The FY2006 request for NSF was 34% below what was recommended in the authorizing legislation. The NSB contends that increasing the number and length of research awards should be one of the highest priorities of the agency.

One continuing question focused on the selection process for including major projects in the upcoming budget cycle. In February 2004, the National Academies released the congressionally mandated study of the process for prioritization and oversight of projects in the MREFC account. The report recommended a more open process for project selection, broadened participation from various disciplines, and well-defined criteria for the selection process.", "In September 2005, the NSB released its management report on the new guidelines for the development, review, and approval of major projects\u2014 Setting Priorities for Large Research Facility Projects Supported by the National Science Foundation .

Because of the changing nature of science and technology, NSF deems it essential that it have the flexibility to reconsider facilities at the various stages in their development. Also, the NSF states that it must be able to respond, effectively, to possible changes in interagency participation, international and cooperative agreements, or co-funding for major research facilities. The NSF encourages project planning from disciplines and fields in which scientists and engineers have not traditionally partnered or collaborated.
