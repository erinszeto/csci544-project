Content owners may create the content themselves, or pay producers to create the content for them. Generally, content owners license or sell the copyrights to television programs to television networks or broadcast television stations. Examples of content owners include television studios, movie studios, and sports teams. In addition, television networks and broadcast stations may own the copyrights to programs they produce themselves. Packager s assemble various television series, movies, and sporting events. Generally, packagers license content from content owners and resell it to cable operators, satellite operators, broadcast television stations, and OVDs. They may also sell packages of programs directly to consumers. Examples of packagers include cable networks, broadcast networks, and certain types of online distributors of video programming. Broadcast stations, by assembling programming from broadcast television networks, studios, sports leagues, and their own news departments, also operate as packagers. Distributors deliver television programs to consumers over their own facilities. They purchase from packagers the rights to \"publicly perform\" television programming, as defined in copyright law, and to retransmit that programing to viewers. Congress has defined a class of distributors, multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs), that have certain rights and obligations under copyright and communications laws. These include the right and/or obligation to retransmit the signals of broadcast television stations. MVPDs distribute programs, including the retransmitted signals of broadcast stations, via cables, telephone lines, or satellite dishes on the viewer's premises. Thus, MVPDs comprise cable operators and satellite operators. Because broadcast television stations can deliver programming directly to viewers via over-the-air broadcast signals, they also act as distributors, but are not MVPDs.", "The Big Bang Theory , a popular television series, illustrates these industry interactions. Chuck Lorre Productions hires writers, directors, actors, and staff to produce episodes of the show under a contract with Warner Brothers Television Studio (Warner Brothers), which acquires the copyright to the content. Warner Brothers, in turn, has sold the Columbia Broadcasting System (the CBS broadcast network), a packager, the exclusive right to offer the episodes produced for the current broadcast season. Separately, Warner Brothers licenses the right to show past seasons of The Big Bang Theory to the Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), a cable network with the same corporate parent, and to local broadcast television stations owned and operated by 21 st Century Fox. Thus, TBS and broadcast television stations airing The Big Bang Theory also act as packagers. The CBS network's broadcast station affiliates, the TBS cable network, and the local broadcast stations that have licensed rights to past seasons all rely on MVPDs to distribute their programs to the MVPDs' subscribers. TBS and many of the broadcast stations receive payment from the MVPDs. Viewers who do not subscribe to MVPDs may receive The Big Bang Theory directly from broadcast television stations via over-the-air reception.", " Figure 1 depicts the complex relationships within the television industry in simplified form."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Consumer Behavior and Industry Structure", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 116 million U.S. television households continue to rely on broadcast television stations or MVPDs to receive television programming.

The remaining 3% rely exclusively on an Internet connection to watch television programming.", "Since Congress enacted the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (1992 Cable Act; P.L. 102-385 ) to foster competition in the delivery of video programming services, the number of cable subscribers has declined. In 1993, the FCC reported that 60% of U.S. television households, about 57.4 million, subscribed to cable. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, the Nielsen Company estimated that 45% of U.S. television households, about 52 million, subscribed to cable. Within the last 22 years, the emergence of alternative distributors of television programming, including satellite operators, has increased competition.", "Mergers between MVPDs have nonetheless increased concentration among video programming distributors, enabling some operators to reach large numbers of customers. The reach of these larger MVPDs has increased their bargaining power with respect to negotiating distribution agreements with television stations, television networks, and copyright owners. Consolidation among broadcast stations, television networks, and copyright owners has increased their bargaining power as well. On both sides of these video distribution negotiations, large companies have leverage over smaller companies.", "As described in Table 2 , many leading companies in the television industry are engaged in multiple aspects of television production, packaging, and distribution. Companies are in frequent negotiation with one another for the right to transmit cable network programming or to retransmit broadcast signals. In some cases, these negotiations are governed directly by communications and copyright laws, as when MVPDs negotiate with broadcast television stations for the right to carry broadcast signals. In other instances, negotiations over the right to broadcast or resell programming are based more on market forces and reciprocal relationships, with fewer government-imposed strictures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exclusivity, Carriage, and Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Television programs are distributed to viewers in multiple formats and versions.

Distinct time periods of viewing are called \"windows.\" Distinct geographical zones of exclusivity are called \"local television markets.\" Copyright laws, by giving content owners control over the distribution of their content, enable content owners to enforce window and market exclusivity. However, the copyright laws contain limitations with respect to the geographic exclusivity of broadcast signals retransmitted by MVPDs.", "Geographic exclusivity is reinforced by communications laws and regulations administered by the FCC.

The basic purpose of the allocation plan was to provide as many communities as possible with sufficient spectrum to permit one or more local television stations \"to serve as media for local self-expression.\" The allocations made in 1952 are still in use, and formed the basis of the assignment of digital channels to local communities in 2009.", "Beginning in July 1952, FCC initially processed applications under a priority designed to bring broadcast television quickly to major cities and surrounding areas without television service. Once the FCC felt it met this goal in 1953, it gave priority consideration to cities that had no local television stations of their own.

(which has since exited the business) restricted their measurement of television station viewership to the major metropolitan areas that were the first to receive broadcast television stations. The estimated number of viewers a station attracts is important in determining the prices that television stations can charge advertisers, and thus plays a significant role in a station's ability to generate revenue. After hearings in the House of Representatives produced accusations that stations licensed to large cities were pressuring the rating services not to measure audiences of stations licensed to smaller cities, Arbitron, and subsequently Nielsen, assigned each U.S. county to a unique geographic television market in which they could measure viewing habits. Nielsen's construct, known as Designated Market Areas (DMAs), has been widely used to define local television markets since the late 1960s. ", "Today, Nielsen measures television audiences in 210 DMAs. A single DMA may overlap multiple states. Although the FCC has assigned television frequencies to 825 separate communities, the 210 DMAs generally define the geographic zones of exclusivity for the transmission of broadcast television programming over the air and retransmission via cable and satellite operators. Carriage and copyright laws also use DMAs to define geographic markets. The policy rationale is that protecting broadcast stations' rights to geographic exclusivity enables them to invest in local programming that is responsive to viewers living within the stations' communities of license. In some instances, however, FCC regulations adopted in the 1950s and 1970s (some of which still form the basis of copyright regulations) rely on the stations' communities of license, rather than DMAs, to define geographic exclusivity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Time Exclusivity", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Traditional Linear Programming", "paragraphs": ["The 1934 Communications Act, as amended by the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-549 ), defines \"video programming\" as \"programming provided by, or generally considered comparable to programming provided by, a television broadcast station.\" Both broadcast television stations and MVPDs distribute video programming at prescheduled times. MVPDs transmit prescheduled programming from cable networks and retransmit prescheduled programming from broadcast television stations. The FCC refers to this type of video programming distribution as \"linear.\"", "Broadcast stations' contractual agreements with television networks give them the exclusive rights to the initial linear airing (also known as the \"first run\") of network television broadcasts in their geographic markets. Traditionally, studios have negotiated with cable networks and broadcast television station groups for the right to air broadcast television programs on a linear basis years after their initial air dates. This window of distribution is known as \"syndication.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On-Demand Programming", "paragraphs": ["OVDs became significant in 2005, when ABC and NBC reached agreements with Apple Inc. to permit Apple's iTunes store to sell individual episodes of current season broadcast network programs the day after their initial air date.

The largest OVDs, including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu, allow viewers to watch unlimited content by purchasing a subscription. Another group of OVDs, including Apple's iTunes, Amazon Video, Google Play, and Microsoft Movies and TV, allows customers to pay for specific content, either for a single viewing or for a period of time. A third type of OVDs allows viewers to watch a limited number of programs on request in exchange for watching advertisements. Examples include Sony's Crackle and Disney's ABC Go. ", "The ability of networks to license their programs to these OVDs depends on the agreements they reach with the studios that own the copyrights to the programs. To facilitate the process, broadcast networks are increasingly airing programs created by studios owned by their corporate parents. ", "Licensing from third-party studios may give networks less control over the distribution of programs after their initial broadcast. For example, in March 2016, Warner Brothers and the ABC broadcast network reached an agreement that gives ABC \"in-season stacking rights\"\u2014that is, the exclusive right to distribute the current season's episodes\u2014to television programs produced by the studio, but Warner Brothers retains the ability to sell distribution rights after each season is completed and to license individual programs to online retailers such as iTunes.", "At the same time, networks have expressed a desire to license on-demand availability of their programming to MVPDs rather than OVDs such as Netflix. The networks' ability to sell advertising and retain control over their own brands when their programs are distributed by MVPDs, in combination with the fees MVPDs pay them, makes MVPD distribution more valuable to them in the long term than OVD distribution.", "Not all involved in the creation of television programs agree with this strategy. In 2015 the cast and producers of the television series Bones , which is produced by 20 th Century Fox Television Studios and airs on the FOX television network, sued the parent company of both, 21 st Century Fox, Inc. In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that they received \"tens of millions\" of fewer dollars than they otherwise would have, as a result of the studio making \"sweetheart\" distribution deals with its commonly owned network (FOX), television stations, and OVD (Hulu). For example, the plaintiffs alleged that because 21 st Century Fox sold in-season stacking rights to Hulu, Netflix paid less for older seasons of the program than it would have otherwise.", "Networks' ability to offer MVPDs online and on-demand rights is also a key issue in negotiations between broadcast networks and their affiliates.
