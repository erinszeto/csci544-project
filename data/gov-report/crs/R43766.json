The program, which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), includes three components: (1) the Basic Center program (BCP), which provides outreach, temporary shelter, and counseling for up to 21 days to youth under age 18 who have run away or are homeless; (2) the Transitional Living program (TLP), which supports residential services and services to youth ages 16 through 21 for up to 18 months; and (3) the Street Outreach program (SOP), which provides street-based outreach and education\u2014including treatment and referrals\u2014for runaway and homeless youth who have been subjected to sexual abuse and exploitation or are otherwise unstably housed. Funding authorization for the programs expired on September 30, 2013.", "The federal government, led by an independent agency known as the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), has developed a plan for ending youth homelessness. In 2010, USICH released Opening Doors, which included goals of ending chronic homelessness and homelessness among youth and other specified populations. An amendment to the plan in 2012 specifically introduced the Federal Framework to End Youth Homelessness, which includes improved data collection on these youth and developing and testing effective intervention models. This plan is consistent with the 2008 reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, which directed HHS to estimate the number of youth who have run away or are homeless and to assess the characteristics of these youth. Congress may wish to determine whether actions taken by HHS and its partners are addressing the data requirements in the law. Related to this, little is known about the outcomes of youth who participate in programs funded under the act, though efforts are underway by non-governmental research organizations to further study this population.", "Congress may also be interested in the extent to which the Runaway and Homeless Youth program should more actively engage the families of runaway and homeless youth. Family conflict is a primary reason why youth leave home or are forced to leave home. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act addresses family relationships primarily through the BCP. Some providers have models for helping build stronger connections between youth and their families. Another issue that may be of interest is demand. The programs serve a small fraction of the overall number of youth believed to be runaway or homeless, and the number of youth turned away from the BCP and TLP due to a lack of capacity has ranged from about 9,000 to 11,000 annually. Advocates assert that additional funding is needed to serve more youth, particularly because other federal funding sources for homeless service are believed to be limited. For example, the Continuum of Care (CoC) program directs homeless service providers to coordinate with runaway and homeless youth providers; however, CoC funding may not be available to some Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees that are already not CoC funded.", "Finally, runaway and homeless youth tend to have multiple challenges. Congress may consider the role that the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act could play in meeting the specific needs of youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, or questioning (LGBTQ); youth who are sex trafficked; and youth who are or were engaged in foster care or the juvenile justice system. For example, recent research on LGBTQ youth suggests that some RHY providers have difficulty identifying this population and could benefit from technical assistance for serving them effectively. In addition, runaway and homeless youth appear to be vulnerable to sex trafficking and some have a history of such victimization. The act could be amended to ensure that training and technical assistance is available to RHY providers to assist particular groups of youth."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Runaway and Homeless Youth program is the largest targeted federal program that provides assistance to youth under age 23 who are homeless or have run a way.

Separately, the Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-231), as originally enacted, authorized indefinite funding for states to establish and expand services under the Child Welfare Services program \"for the protection and care of homeless, dependent, and neglected children, and children in danger of becoming delinquent.\" This law and others addressed youth running away from home; however, they did not focus on providing services, or did so on a limited basis.

It explained that there was little information in the research literature about the effectiveness of interventions for homeless youth, and that the few studies on interventions were not based on rigorous experimental or quasi- experimental research designs. For this reason, the report incorporated information about interventions in related fields for high-risk youth, including family interventions to prevent child abuse and neglect, interventions to reduce juvenile violence, and interventions that support successful transitions from juvenile detention and foster care. Based on these approaches, the report described the ways in which providers and others can intervene in the lives of homeless youth.", "The report acknowledged that solutions to prevent and ameliorate youth homelessness will not be easily accomplished, and that no single approach exists to solve its problems; however, the report emphasizes that certain policy options may prevent and end youth homelessness. These options include (1) providing targeted education and support services to high-risk families with youth who may become homeless; (2) providing enhanced services to support youth as they transition from the juvenile justice and foster care systems because these youth are particularly vulnerable to becoming homeless; (3) providing a continuum of services, including \"gateway\" services for youth who are newly homeless to long-term supportive housing programs for youth who may not have the option to live with their families; and (4) helping to coordinate programs and services for youth who are homeless or are at-risk of becoming homeless.

Further, studies on the number and characteristics of runaway and homeless youth are dated.", "Concerns over the lack of data are not new. For instance, testimony in the 110 th Congress suggested that a lack of data impairs policy making and that a comprehensive study is needed on estimates of runaway and homeless youth. Congress subsequently passed the Reconnecting Homeless Youth Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-378 ), which, in part, addressed concerns about data on runaway and homeless youth. It added a new section to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act that requires HHS, in consultation with USICH, to prepare a report to Congress that includes estimates of the incidence and prevalence of the runaway and homeless youth population ages 13 to 26. The act also directed HHS to assess the characteristics of these youth. In addition, HHS is required to conduct a survey of and direct interviews with a representative sample of homeless youth ages 13 to 26 to determine (1) past and current socioeconomic characteristics; (2) barriers to obtaining housing and other services; and (3) other information HHS determines useful, in consultation with states and other entities concerned with youth homelessness. The 2008 act does not specify the methodology for carrying out the studies, except to say that HHS should make the estimate based on the best quantitative and qualitative social science research methods available. The law specifically authorized such sums as may be necessary for the study for FY2009 through FY2013.", "As mentioned, the USICH framework for ending youth homelessness includes a data strategy for collecting information about homeless youth specifically. This strategy has four components: (1) developing better strategies for counting youth in point-in-time (PIT) counts of homelessness; (2) coordinating federal data systems that collect information on youth experiencing homelessness and their receipt of services; (3) launching a national study on the prevalence and characteristics of youth homelessness; and (4) using this national study to make periodic estimates of youth homelessness over time. USICH has articulated that better data on youth homelessness can help social service agencies and other stakeholders advocate for the appropriate resources to support youth experiencing homelessness and allow social agencies to tailor resources to the specific needs of youth. These components are discussed in the following sections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Point-in-Time Estimates", "paragraphs": ["USICH and its federal partners are working with communities to develop better estimates of youth experiencing homelessness through what are known as point-in-time (PIT) counts.

PIT counts differ from HUD's Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), which include data on homeless individuals collected by homeless service providers that receive HUD funding. These providers report the data to their local CoC and these data are used to derive national estimates of homelessness over a one-year period.", "USICH and other federal agencies are increasingly using data from the PIT counts as a source to track trends and progress in eliminating homelessness. HUD requires communities to collect information on unaccompanied youth under age 18. This includes youth on their own, youth who are parents and their children, adolescent siblings, and other groups composed of only youth. Since 2013, HUD has required that PIT counts include unsheltered youth. Youth under age 25 who meet the definition of homeless under the McKinney-Vento Act (the major act that authorizes homelessness programs) are included in the count. This encompasses sheltered youth in runaway and homeless youth programs (including those that may not be funded under the federal program). Also since 2013, CoCs have been required to specifically identify the number of youth ages 18 or 18 to 24. Previously, these youth were included in a larger category of young adults ages 18 to 30. In addition, CoCs are required to count younger youth in a larger category of children under age 18.", "PIT counts can capture information on youth who interact with RHY or other homeless service providers, as well as those who do not (i.e., sheltered and unsheltered youth). These counts do not provide a confident estimate of youth experiencing homelessness across the country. Counting sheltered and unsheltered unaccompanied youth is a challenge because they often do not use homeless residential services or develop relationships with local homeless services providers who can ensure that each youth is counted. Further, unsheltered youth may congregate in different places and at different times than other homeless individuals, and thus may not be brought to the attention of enumerators who conduct the PIT counts.", "In response to these concerns, HUD has provided specific guidance on counting youth who are unsheltered. HUD recommends that CoCs coordinate with multiple entities\u2014RHY service providers, homeless liaisons for local education agencies (i.e., school districts), and selected social service organizations\u2014to assist with a comprehensive count of children and youth. HUD also encourages communities to recruit currently or formerly homeless youth to assist with the count, and to hold \"magnet events\" that include food and other appropriate incentives to draw in youth who typically do not use shelters and services. In addition, CoCs are encouraged to survey locations during multiple times throughout the day of the count and use social media to raise awareness and outreach. This guidance has been informed by an initiative, known as Youth Count!, to improve data collection on youth as part of PIT counts. With philanthropic support, USICH (and its partner agencies) provided technical assistance to nine communities to improve data collection on homeless youth as part of the 2013 PIT. The initiative was intended to aid the nine communities in developing and implementing strategies to reach unaccompanied youth experiencing homelessness and document lessons learned. The CoC agency was the lead entity for the Youth Count! in each of the nine communities. The agency partnered with other stakeholders, including homeless youth service providers, to implement the count.", "The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act directs HHS, as appropriate, to consult with HUD to ensure coordination of programs and services for homeless youth.

These new standards went into effect on October 1, 2014. They are intended to provide guidance for HMIS vendors and administrators to collect HMIS data in a way that meets the data submissions requirements of each applicable federal program, including the Runaway and Homeless Youth program. The HMIS standards include the data collection questions that are in NEO-RHYMIS, along with new data elements. For example, new elements include information on income and sources of income (for TLP and RHY demonstration projects); health insurance status (all RHY programs); whether the youth has specified disabilities (all programs); whether the young person is at risk for or is a victim of commercial sexual exploitation (all RHY programs); whether family reunification was achieved (all RHY programs except SOP); information about the youth's employment status at entry and exit (all RHY programs except SOP); the types of programs to which the youth was referred (all programs); and the extent of transitional, exit, and aftercare plans for youth (all programs except SOP).

They must create an export file through HMIS, and submit the data to HHS twice each fiscal year. According to HHS, the department informed grantees about the initiative through a series of speaking engagements and workshops conducted at national homelessness conferences. HHS also conducted listening sessions in which grantees had the opportunity to provide feedback about the initiative. Also according to HHS, approximately half of Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees that were surveyed by the department's technical assistance provider are HUD grantees, and therefore these grantees enter data on the youth they serve into both information systems.

A literature review of youth experiencing homelessness suggests that a youth's relationship with a step-parent, sexual activity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, school problems, and alcohol and drug use were strong predictors of family discord. Among youth in the Runaway and Homeless Youth program, most cite family dynamics as a major concern when exiting the program. In FY2014, over 27,000 (out of 32,000) youth exiting the BCP and approximately 2,000 (out of approximately 3,000) youth exiting the TLP cited this concern (it was the most frequently cited issue for BCP youth and the second most frequently cited issue for TLP youth). The 2007 HHS report to Congress on strategies to end youth homelessness emphasized the importance of family relationships. It said that \"to address the risk factors that lead to youth leaving and staying away from their homes, intervention approaches must emphasize strategies to strengthen and support families. Families, whether immediate or extended, are resources for homeless youth and should be actively involved in adolescents' transition to independence and adulthood.\"", "The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act specifies that the BCP is intended to provide services as an alternative to involving youth who are runaways and/or homeless in the child welfare system (and other specified systems).

According to the 2007 HHS report to Congress, \"shelters that place a strong emphasis on stabilizing youth and reunification with families or other appropriate long-term placements are critical in preventing prolonged episodes of homelessness among this population. Providers report that younger youth and those experiencing their first episode of homelessness are more likely to reconcile with families, if early intervention is available.\" A 2007 report, developed for a federal symposium on homelessness, emphasized that more attention should be paid to prevention and intervention strategies that focus on youth. The report goes on to say that such strategies could involve improving communication, developing conflict resolution skills, and increasing understanding of adolescent development.", "The National Alliance to End Homelessness, an organization that seeks to prevent and end homelessness, defines family intervention along a spectrum that involves strategies such as family reunification, family connection, family finding, and aftercare services. Examples of these strategies can include support groups for parents and parenting skills classes. Some interventions have been assessed, though not necessarily through rigorous evaluation or specifically for youth who have run away or are homeless. One such approach is multisystemic therapy (MST) in which families are provided with intensive, home-based services facilitated by a therapist who empowers parents to better manage their adolescent's behavior and also coordinates services and supports for the family. Randomized controlled trials have shown that MST can reduce antisocial behavior; however, again, these evaluations have not focused on the RHY population in particular. Another promising model\u2014used by a runaway and homeless youth provider, Project Safe, in Washington\u2014provides phone consultation, support groups or workshops, and a resource library to parents or caretakers. The goal is to prevent teen homelessness and promote healthier family functioning. Outcome data from these interventions showed a significant decrease in the parental perception of the youth needing to leave the home. Further, some intervention models focus on families separated because their teens identify as LGBT. These models draw on findings that seek to strengthen families by informing them of the negative impacts and risks that \"rejecting\" behaviors can have on their child.", "Reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act may provide an opportunity to examine the role of youth connection to their families.

The monitoring team then prepares a written report that identifies the strengths of the program and areas that require corrective action. The protocols used to conduct the onsite review generally follow the BCP Performance Standards, and are adapted for the TLP and SOP. The performance standards relate to how well the needs of youth who have run away and/or are homeless and their families are being met, and not the outcomes of services provided. Nine of these standards address service components (e.g., outreach, individual intake process, and recreational programs, etc.) and six focus on administrative functions or activities (e.g., staffing and staff development, reporting, and individual client files, etc.). On April 14, 2014, HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that seeks to implement new performance standards and other requirements for Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees.

HHS has contracted with Abt Associates, a policy research organization, to conduct an evaluation of the TLP at select grantee sites. The study seeks to describe the outcomes of youth who participate in the program and to isolate and describe promising practices and other factors that may contribute to their successes or challenges. The study is examining delivery approaches, youth demographics, socio-emotional wellness, and life experiences.

It also specifies that intervention strategies should be based on scientific evidence for improving outcomes, provide culturally appropriate supports that account for the specific characteristics and needs of the youth, and emphasize settings and relationships where young people can heal and thrive. The framework envisions using federal and other resources to put the intervention model into practice and evaluate which approaches are most effective. Federal agencies would then disseminate and scale-up screening and assessment tools and effective interventions. ", "Since the model was disseminated, FYSB has modified requirements for Runaway and Homeless Youth grantees to help ensure their efforts align with the model. For example, FYSB has begun to require that grantees use appropriate screening and assessment tools to determine whether young people entering programs have a history of trauma and other issues. In addition, organizations applying for funding under the Runaway and Homeless Youth program have recently been required to ensure that case planning takes into account the youth risk and protective factors and their goals. Further, FYSB has provided training and technical assistance on specific practices that have some effectiveness, and has enhanced efforts to monitor the performance of grantees.", "The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act currently authorizes HHS to make grants to carry out research and evaluation, and requires that in making such grants, HHS gives priority to certain types of projects.

The reauthorization process might also involve examining the goals of the TLP in particular because of the program's outcomes. Notably, approximately one-third (35.3%) of youth completed the TLP in FY2014.

Funds for the CoC program are made available to local communities, which are also called Continuums of Care. Nearly every community in the country has become part of a CoC, with more than 400 CoCs, including those in the territories, covering most of the country. Homeless youth providers, including RHY providers, compete for CoC funding. Local communities establish CoC advisory boards made up of representatives from local government agencies, service providers, community members, and formerly homeless individuals who meet to establish local priorities and strategies to address homelessness in their communities. The CoC plan that results from this process is meant to contain elements that address the continuum of needs of homeless persons: prevention of homelessness, emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent housing, and supportive services provided at all stages of housing. HUD distributes these funds through an annual competition. Funds for a CoC can be awarded based on a preliminary need amount (which is based on a formula) or on the CoC's Annual Renewal Demand (ARD) amount, whichever is higher. Due to lower funding levels in recent years, all CoCs have been limited to the ARD amount even if the preliminary need amount is higher. Project applicants serving individuals who are homeless in a community (e.g., nonprofit organizations, units of government, etc.) submit a project application that is subsequently submitted by the CoC lead entity, otherwise known as the collaborative applicant. HUD issues an annual notice of funding that sets the criteria for the type of projects and priorities that will be funded in a given year.", "CoC program funds may be used to serve youth who are defined as homeless under the HUD definition of homelessness. The funding announcement for FY2015 is the second (after the FY2013-FY2014 announcement) to specify that CoCs may score points in the application process in relation to serving youth. As part of the FY2015 competition, HUD included a priority for addressing youth homelessness as part of the CoC program competition. Specifically, the announcement notes that \"CoCs should understand the unique needs of homeless youth and should be reaching out to youth-serving organizations to help them fully participate in the CoC.... When evaluating the performance of youth programs, CoCs should take into account the specific challenges faced by homeless youth.\" In addition, 15 points are available that can be awarded for addressing youth homelessness, including to CoCs that (1) have strategies for addressing the unique needs of unaccompanied homeless youth and the existence of a proven strategy that addresses homeless youth trafficking and other forms of exploitation; (2) demonstrate an increase in the number of unaccompanied homeless youth (up to age 24) served who were residing on the streets or in places not meant for human habitation prior to ending a project for homeless individuals; (3) demonstrate a plan to increase funding for unaccompanied homeless youth programs; (4) describe how they collaborate with local education authorities and school districts to assist in identifying individuals and families who become or remain homeless and informing them of eligibility of services; and (5) demonstrate the extent to which youth service providers and education providers and CoC representatives have participated in each other's meetings over the past 12 months (including how the CoC collaborates with the McKinney-Vento local education liaisons and state education coordinators under the McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths program). ", "The majority of CoC program funds are used to renew existing grants. However, even if a CoC has very few or planned projects to respond to youth experiencing homelessness, providers may still be able to access funds. The funding process allows CoCs to reallocate funds from an existing project to a new one if they decide that a new project would be more beneficial than an existing one. The FY2015 round of CoC funding allowed CoCs to reallocate funding to Permanent Supportive Housing or Rapid Re-Housing projects for homeless youth, among other specified populations. In addition, CoCs may qualify for additional funds to create new permanent supportive housing projects to serve unaccompanied youth who come directly from the streets, in addition to other populations.", "HUD has otherwise encouraged CoCs to partner with Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees. In guidance to HUD grantees, HUD emphasized the need for such coordination: \"Homeless youth are more multi-jurisdictional than any other homeless population and may interact with adults from educational, child welfare, juvenile justice, and/or homelessness systems. It is therefore critical that CoCs collaborate with schools, child welfare agencies, juvenile justice systems, and, if applicable, projects funded under HHS' Runaway and Homeless Youth Program.\" Some leaders in the runaway and homeless youth community have suggested the ways that RHY providers can play a more active role in the CoC process even if they are not competing for funds, such as by reading and rating the local applications for CoC funding each year. These stakeholders assert that such participation can help providers understand the CoC's priorities and the extent to which youth are served. They posit that RHY providers could work together closely to improve the chances that youth services will be funded in the CoC: \"One or two strong, collaborative or multi-agency endorsed applications to [the] CoC can have a much greater chance at winning a funding award than many competing applications from a variety of youth providers.\"", "Stakeholders have further suggested that RHY providers could collaborate with homeless service providers who work with young adults under age 25 that compete for CoC funding, such as by providing targeted services to this population or contracting to train their staff about the needs of this population. The preamble to the proposed regulations for the program, issued in April 2014, notes that HHS strongly encourages grantees to collaborate with their local CoC, with the goal of ending youth homelessness.

For example, some stakeholders have identified concerns that the act does not require grantees to adopt nondiscrimination policies to protect the well-being of LGBTQ youth, or explicitly require training expressly targeted at these youth. In 2009, the American Bar Association (ABA) and the National Network for Youth (NN4Y) developed a model state statute that seeks to ensure that homeless youth service providers adopt inclusive, nondiscrimination policies for LGBTQ youth. The model provides guidance on adopting nondiscrimination policies, including on the basis of gender identity and expression.", "Recent research has also suggested that HHS could provide more extensive training and technical assistance on meeting the needs of LGBTQ youth. A 2014 study funded by HHS examined the strategies of four grantees receiving BCP, TLP, and/or SOP funding for identifying and serving LGBTQ youth. The study identified that RHY providers would likely benefit from \"specification, dissemination, and evaluation of models for serving LGBTQ youth effectively.\" The report also specified that technical assistance or training on LGBTQ issues would help agencies in areas without access to local LGBTQ resources, or establishing a forum for providers to share information. The ABA/NN4Y model state statute and other publications outline the types of training topics that could be covered by runaway and homeless youth providers in serving LGBTQ youth, such as approaches to working with families of LGBTQ youth and how to communicate sensitively with youth about sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity.", "Legislation introduced in the 114 th Congress ( H.R. 1779 and S.Amdt. 290 to S. 178 ) would amend the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act to include a statement of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression (and other characteristics).

While away from home, an estimated 38,600 (2.2%) of these youth were sexually assaulted, were in the company of someone known to be sexually abusive, or were engaged in sexual activity in exchange for money, drugs, food, or shelter. The Dallas Police Department also found a strong correlation between sex trafficking and runaway status: the more times a child runs away, the greater the likelihood that he or she will be victimized. Other research, including studies examining prostitution in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco, has found that the majority of prostituted women were runaways.", "Shelter and services for trafficked victims who are transitioning from \"the life\" of prostitution appear to be available on a limited basis. As background for a 2012 colloquium on supports for child victims of sex trafficking, a working group surveyed organizations that provide residential and other services to victims. Over 50 organizations responded to the survey, and together they reported having the capacity to provide specialized services for 1,684 child victims and shelter for 226 child victims. Given that the number of child victims is believed to be much higher, the shelter and services that are available may only reach a fraction of children needing supports.", "In 2012, the President's Interagency Task Force on trafficking (established by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act) coordinated a strategic plan on services for victims in the United States. The plan specified that runaway and homeless youth providers are part of a broader response to sex trafficking that involves multiple sectors and organizations. (Some runaway and homeless youth providers have long served youth who are victims of sexual exploitation. Amendments to the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act in 1994 ( P.L. 103-322 ) first specified a role for providers in responding to youth sexual exploitation. These amendments created the Grants for Prevention of Sexual Abuse and Exploitation program, which is now referred to in law as the Sexual Abuse Prevention program and commonly called the Street Outreach program (SOP). As currently enacted, the program seeks to provide street-based services to youth \"who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, sexual abuse, prostitution, or sexual exploitation.\" In addition, BCP and TLP providers can often offer immediate support to youth without some of the same barriers of other residential options. For example, they have the ability to accept youth in the middle of the night and can offer longer-term placements to boys and transgendered youth who might otherwise have difficulty finding places to stay.", "Nonetheless, the capacity for runaway and homeless youth agencies to respond to the needs of sex trafficking victims is believed to be limited. These settings are often not equipped to provide intensive services for victims or recognize the trauma they have experienced. They also often have time restrictions imposed by funding sources on the length of stay, which, given their unique needs, makes serving victims of sex trafficking difficult. RHY providers and other providers may not recognize the signs of sex trafficking. Even if providers do recognize these signs, youth may choose to leave, given that shelter providers are required to report suspected abuse and neglect, including sexual exploitation.", "The federal strategic plan calls for greater supports for RHY and other social service providers in aiding victims of trafficking. The plan articulates that these providers \"need training and support to expand their screening protocols to identify those who are trafficking victims and to provide appropriate services and referrals.\" The plan also lays out action steps that HHS can take to prepare RHY providers in responding. HHS is currently working on such efforts. With support from HHS/ACF, four Runaway and Homeless Youth program grantees have collaborated with the FBI on its Innocence Lost initiative to recover victims of child sex trafficking.

Direct victim assistance involves the development of individualized service plans that are tailored to meet the victims' needs.", "Whether Congress wishes to address sex trafficking in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act may depend on how it envisions the role of providers in responding. For example, if it envisions a broader role, it could specify that BCP and TLP providers can or should provide shelter to sexually trafficked youth, or require the programs to coordinate with other entities in the community to respond. Some stakeholders have suggested that the term \"prostitute\" should be struck from the authorizing language for the SOP, and replaced with a term reflecting that youth are forced or coerced into providing sexual acts. This is consistent with federal trafficking laws that treat children involved in commercial sex acts as victims.", "The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act ( P.L. 114-22 ), enacted in May 2015, expands on the types of research and other projects that HHS should prioritize under staff training on runaway and homeless youth issues.

P.L. 114-22 also specified that in addition to serving runaway and homeless youth, and street youth, the Street Outreach Program is to serve youth who have been subjected to, or are at risk of being subjected to, severe forms of trafficking in persons or sex trafficking.

Some stakeholders have raised concerns that these other systems do not fully address the needs of some young people, who are then served by the runaway and homeless youth system.", "As noted in the 2007 HHS report to Congress, youth transitioning from the juvenile justice and foster care systems are particularly vulnerable to becoming homeless. In recent years, about 7% of youth in the BCP reported having spent some time in foster care and 6% of youth had been in the juvenile justice system at some point in their lives. About 20% of TLP youth have spent time in foster care and nearly 10% have been in the care of the juvenile justice system at some time in their lives. In addition, youth who run away often have a history of involvement in the foster care system. On the last day of FY2012, states reported that almost 5,000 foster children (1% of all foster children) had a current placement of \"runaway.\" A study of youth in Illinois who ran away from foster care between 1993 and 2003 found that the average likelihood of an individual running away from foster care placements increased over this time period. Research on youth who emancipate from foster care suggests a nexus between foster care involvement and later episodes of homelessness. Estimates of homeless youth who are reported as having been in foster care range from 21% to 53%. In an often-cited study of youth who had emancipated from foster care in three states, over one-third had experienced homelessness between the time they left care and age 26. The research literature has similarly documented a connection among juveniles and young adults released from secure detention or correction facilities and becoming homeless, although the data on this population are not as reliable. Some studies have found that homeless adults had high rates of prior incarceration, including while they were juveniles. Further, research has identified a number of challenges that youth are likely to confront when reentering the community, including problems with family and living arrangements. Young people who are homeless also have relatively high levels of involvement with the juvenile justice system.", "The National Network for Youth has articulated that given scarce resources, RHY providers should receive greater financial support on behalf of the youth they serve from these systems. In its April 2014 proposed regulations for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, HHS provides guidance on coordinating services for these other populations. For example, the rule would add provisions that grantees are not required to provide services that substitute for those provided by juvenile justice, child welfare, or other systems that are legally responsible to youth who are under their supervision. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule,", "the purposes of these provisions is to provide a clear demarcation between services that are the legal and financial responsibility of other programs, and services that are the responsibility of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program. Because the availability of federal funds varies among programs, and where Federal funds are available the matching rates usually vary, other State and local agencies have financial incentive to blur these lines. We strongly encourage grantees to take steps [to] prevent other programs from displacing their costs on these programs while also providing continuous service to youth.", "Policymakers might consider the extent to which the act should reflect language that is similar to the regulations, or whether RHY providers should coordinate with child welfare and juvenile justice agencies. Current child welfare policies address youth who have run away and/or are homeless. The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) directs states that receive CAPTA state grant funds to prevent and respond to child abuse to certify that CAPTA-funded programs and training address the unique needs of unaccompanied homeless youth, including access to enrollment and support services. In addition, CAPTA community-based grants allow funds to be used for resources, opportunities, and prevention services for these youth. Separately, HHS is providing child welfare funding for grants to develop and implement interventions for youth who have a history of child welfare involvement and are at-risk of homelessness. Grantees can use these funds to test an intervention model that will help young people in or aging out of care make a successful transition at home, at work, in school, in the community, and in adulthood.
