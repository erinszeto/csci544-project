The array of critical barriers to improving energy efficiency in buildings has been well documented. In particular, the regional nature of building codes (e.g. houses in Minneapolis need more insulation than houses in Los Angeles) and other factors have made it impractical to set a single national building energy code. Instead, Congress has directed DOE to use its analytic capacity to develop model energy codes for residential and commercial buildings that states can adopt and adapt to local circumstances.", "This title would strengthen voluntary model building codes to make new homes and new commercial buildings more energy efficient.
