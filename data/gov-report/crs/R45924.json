According to USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), national net farm income\u00e2\u0080\u0094a key indicator of U.S. farm well-being\u00e2\u0080\u0094is forecast at $88 billion in 2019, up $4 billion (+4.8%) from last year. However, the forecast rise in 2019 net farm income is largely the result of a 42.5% increase in government payments to the agricultural sector valued at $19.5\u00c2 billion (highest since 2005).", "USDA's support outlays forecast for 2019 include nearly $11 billion in direct payments made under trade assistance programs intended to help offset foreign trade retaliation against U.S. agricultural products, as well as payments under traditional farm programs. Without this federal support, net farm income would be lower, primarily due to the outlook for continued weak prices for most major crops. Commodity prices are under pressure from large planted acreage estimates of corn and soybeans in 2019, large carry-in stocks from a record soybean and near-record corn harvest in 2018, and diminished export prospects due to the ongoing trade dispute with China. Should these conditions persist into 2020, they would signal the potential for continued dependence on federal programs to sustain the U.S. agricultural sector in 2020.", "Since 2008, U.S. agricultural exports have accounted for a 20% share of U.S. farm and manufactured or processed agricultural sales. In 2018, total agricultural exports were estimated up 2% at $143.4 billion. However, abundant supplies in international markets, strong competition from major foreign competitors, and the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute are expected to shift trade patterns and lower U.S. agricultural export prospects significantly (-6%) to a projected $134.5 billion in 2019.", "Farm asset value in 2019 is projected up from 2018 to $3.1 trillion (+2%). Farm asset values reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long-term profitability of farm sector investments. U.S. farmland values are projected to rise 1.8% in 2019, similar to the increases of 1.9% in 2018 and 2.3% in 2017. Because they comprise such a large portion of the U.S. farm sector's asset base (83%), change in farmland values is a critical barometer of the farm sector's financial performance. However, another critical measure of the farm sector's well-being is aggregate farm debt, which is projected to be at a record $415.7 billion in 2019\u00e2\u0080\u0094up 3.4% from 2018. Both the debt-to-asset and the debt-to-equity ratios have risen for seven consecutive years, suggesting a weakening of the financial situation for the U.S. farm sector.", "At the farm household level, average farm household incomes have been well above average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. However, this advantage derives primarily from off-farm income as a share of farm household total income. Since 2014, over half of U.S. farm operations have had negative income from their agricultural operations. Furthermore, the farm household income advantage over the average U.S. household has narrowed in recent years. In 2014, the average farm household income (including off-farm income sources) was about 77% higher than the average U.S. household income. In 2017 (the last year with comparable data), that advantage was expected to decline to 30%."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied.

", "As of August 22, 2019, U.S. farmers have reported to USDA that, of the cropland that they intended to plant this past spring, they were unable to plant 19.8 million acres due primarily to prolonged wet conditions that prevented field work. Such acres are referred to as \"prevent plant (PPL)\" acres. The previous record for total PPL acres was set in 2011 at 10.2 million acres.

Traditionally, 96% of the U.S. corn crop is planted by June 2, but in 2019 by that date only 67% of the crop had been planted ( Table 1 ). Similarly, the U.S. soybean crop was planted with substantial delays. By June 16, only 67% of the U.S. soybean crop was planted, whereas an average of 93% of the crop has been planted by that date during the past five years. ", "These planting delays have important implications for crop development as they push both crops' growing cycle into hotter, drier periods of the summer than usual and increase the risk of plant growth being shut off by an early freeze. But planting delays also increase the complexity of producer decisionmaking by pushing the planting date into the crop insurance \"late planting period,\" when insurance coverage starts to decline with each successive day of delay ( Figure 4 ). ", "When the planting occurs after the crop insurance policy's \"final planting date,\" the \"late planting period\" comes into play. Producers must then decide whether to opt for \"prevented planting\" indemnity payments (valued at 35% of their crop insurance guarantee) or try to plant the crop under reduced insurance coverage with a heightened risk of reduced yields. Producer's choices were further complicated in 2019 by the Secretary of Agriculture's announcement on May 23 that only producers with planted acres would be eligible for \"trade damage\" assistance payments in 2019 under the Market Facilitation Program (MFP)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Large Corn and Soybean Stocks Continue to Dominate Commodity Markets", "paragraphs": ["Corn and soybeans are the two largest U.S. commercial crops in terms of both value and acreage. For the past several years, U.S. corn and soybean crops have experienced strong growth in both productivity and output, thus helping to build stockpiles at the end of the marketing year. This has been particularly true for soybean production, which has seen rapid growth in yield, acres planted, and stocks. U.S. soybean production has been expanding rapidly since 1990, largely at the expense of the wheat sector which has been steadily losing acreage over the past several decades ( Figure 5 ). This pattern reached a historic point in 2018 when, for the first time in history, U.S. soybean plantings (at 89.196 million acres) exceeded corn plantings (89.129 million acres).", "The strong soybean plantings in 2018, coupled with the second-highest yields on record (51.6 bushels/acres), produced a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.5 billion bushels and record ending stocks (1 billion bushels or a 27.2% stocks-to-use ratio) that year. However, the record soybean harvest in 2018, combined with the sudden loss of the Chinese soybean market (as discussed in the \" Agricultural Trade Outlook \" section of this report) discouraged many producers from planting soybeans in 2019. This contributed to a drop off (-14%) in soybean planted acres.", "Most market watchers had expected to see a strong switch from soybean to corn acres in 2019 as a result of the record soybean stocks and weak prices related to the U.S.-China trade dispute. However, the wet spring made large corn plantings unlikely as corn yields tend to experience rapid deterioration when planted in June or later. Despite these indications, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) released the results of its June acreage survey for corn planted acres at 91.7 million acres\u00e2\u0080\u0094well above market expectations. However, because the wet spring had caused widespread delayed planting, USDA announced that it would re-survey the 14 major corn-producing states. The updated survey results were released on August 12 and, at 90.0 million acres, confirmed higher-than-expected corn plantings.", "As a result, the outlook for the U.S. corn crop has been pressured by the large planted acreage estimate but filled with uncertainty over the eventual success of the crop considering that it is being grown under unusually delayed conditions. Corn ending stocks are projected to surpass 2 billion bushels for the fourth consecutive year.

A return to market-based farm income growth for the U.S. agricultural sector will likely necessitate improved international trade prospects."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key U.S. Agricultural Trade Highlights", "paragraphs": ["USDA projects U.S. agricultural exports at $134.5 billion in FY2019, down (-6.2%) from $143.4 billion in FY2018. Export data include processed and unprocessed agricultural products. This downturn masks larger country-level changes that have occurred as a result of ongoing trade disputes (as discussed below). In FY2019, U.S. agricultural imports are projected up at $129.3 billion (1.4%), and the resultant agricultural trade surplus of $5.2 billion would be the lowest since 2006.", "A substantial portion of the surge in U.S. agricultural exports that occurred between 2010 and 2014 was due to higher-priced grain and feed shipments, including record oilseed exports to China and growing animal product exports to East Asia. As commodity prices have leveled off, so too have export values (see the commodity price indexes in Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 ). In FY2017, the top three markets for U.S. agricultural exports were China, Canada, and Mexico, in that order. Together, these three countries accounted for 46% of total U.S. agricultural exports during the five-year period FY2014-FY2018 ( Figure 21 ). However, in FY2019 the combined share of U.S. exports taken by China, Canada, and Mexico is projected down to 38% largely due to lower exports to China. The ordering of the top markets in 2019 is projected to be Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), Japan, and China, as China is projected to decline as a destination for U.S. agricultural exports. From FY2014 through FY2017, China imported an average of $26.2 billion of U.S. agricultural products. However, USDA forecasts China's imports of U.S. agricultural products to decline to $20.5 billion in FY2018 and to $10.9 billion in FY2019 as a result of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. export markets have traditionally been the EU and Japan, which accounted for a combined 17% of U.S. agricultural exports during the FY2014-FY2018 period. These two markets have shown limited growth in recent years when compared with the rest of the world. However, their combined share is projected to grow to 19% in FY2019 ( Figure 21 ).

ROW is expected to account for 43% of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019. ROW import growth is being driven in part by both population and GDP growth but also from shifting trade patterns as some U.S. products previously targeting China have been diverted to new markets. Over the past four decades, U.S. agricultural exports have experienced fairly steady growth in shipments of high-value products\u00e2\u0080\u0094including horticultural products, livestock, poultry, and dairy. High-valued exports are forecast at $94.0 billion for a 69.9% share of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 ( Figure 22 ). In contrast, bulk commodity shipments (primarily wheat, rice, feed grains, soybeans, cotton, and unmanufactured tobacco) are forecast at a record low 30.1% share of total U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 at $40.5 billion.
