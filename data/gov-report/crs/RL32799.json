The USDA conducts in-house basic and applied research. TheAgricultural Research Service (ARS) is the lead federal agency for nutrition research, operating fivemajor laboratories in this area, including the world's largest multi-disciplinary agricultural researchcenter located at Beltsville, Maryland. There are approximately 100 research facilities throughoutthe U.S. and abroad. ARS laboratories focus on efficient food and fiber production, preservation ofgenetic resources, development of new products and uses for agricultural commodities, developmentof effective biocontrols for pest management, and support of USDA regulatory and technicalassistance programs. The FY2006 appropriation provides $1,266.2 million for ARS, a 3.1%decrease ($40.1 million) from the FY2005 level. The Administration had proposed reductions of$175 million in all projects earmarked by Congress in order to finance the Department's high priorityprogram increases. However, conference report language continues funding at the FY2005 levelfor all of these projects, including hyperspectral imaging in New Orleans, LA. The ARS reports thatthe majority of its facilities, constructed prior to 1960, have become functionally obsolete. Manyof the facilities are not in total compliance with current health and safety standards.

Priority has been given to the mapping and sequencing projects funded by USDA, such as sequencing genomes of agriculturally imported species. The sequencing projects will be coordinatedwith ongoing genomics initiatives supported by other federal agencies and facilitated by interagencyworking groups. Increases are provided animal genomes and plant genomes research. Also, theFY2006 appropriation provides an increase in support of research on emerging and exotic diseasesas part of the infrastructure to enhance homeland security. USDA states that this research issignificant to protecting the Nation from deliberate or unintentional introduction of an agriculturalhealth threat. The USDA has biocontainment complexes where research and diagnostic work is doneon organisms that pose serious threats to the crop, poultry, and livestock industries. Other researchareas receiving increased support by conferees include bovine spongiform encephalopathy, air andwater quality, food safety, obesity/nutrition, biobased products/bioenergy research, and agriculturalinformation.

In addition, funding requirements for the space shuttle program duringthe \"return to flight\" effort following the 2003 Columbia tragedy remain unsettled, meaning thatfunds might be shifted into the shuttle program from R&D programs. More definitive figures maybecome available when the FY2007 budget request is submitted.", "In January 2004, President Bush directed NASA to focus its efforts on returning humans tothe Moon by 2020, and someday sending them to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" Most of the fundingfor this \"Vision for Space Exploration\" would come from redirecting money from other NASAactivities. For example, the space shuttle program would be terminated in 2010, when space stationconstruction is expected to be completed; U.S. space station research activities would be descopedfrom the broadly-based program that was planned, to only research needed to support extended staysby humans on the Moon and eventual trips to Mars; and NASA would end its involvement in thespace station program by 2016. By terminating the shuttle and space station earlier than expected,and reducing funding for space station research, those funds can be redirected to accomplishing otheraspects of the Vision. NASA is building a new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV), and a launchvehicle for it (the Crew Launch Vehicle or CLV), whose primary purpose is transporting astronautsto and from the Moon. It also could be used to take astronauts to and from the space station. ThePresident directed that the CEV be available by 2014, but NASA Administrator Michael Griffinwants to accelerate that to 2012 in order to minimize the gap between the end of the space shuttleand the availability of the CEV. During that gap, U.S. astronauts would have to rely on Russia totake them to and from space. NASA's support for activities in the fields of aeronautics, and Earthand space science, also could be affected by the need to fund the Vision. In the FY2006 SSJCappropriations act, and the 2005 NASA authorization act, Congress expressed its support for theVision, but stressed that NASA needs to maintain a balanced program that includes aeronautics andscience. Other issues include whether the shuttle should be terminated in 2010, or retained until theCEV is available, and whether U.S. use of the space station should end in 2016 and its researchagenda narrowed, or if NASA should continue using it as originally planned.

On average, the ICs devote over80% of their budgets to supporting peer-reviewed extramural research by awarding research projectgrants (RPGs), research center grants, contracts, training grants, construction grants, and many othertypes of funding to researchers in universities and other institutions around the country. The other15%-20% of the IC budgets supports their intramural research programs and research managementcosts. An alternate way, therefore, to describe the NIH budget is by \"funding mechanism,\" whichreveals the balance between extramural and intramural funding, as well as the relative emphasis onsupport of individual investigator-initiated research versus funding of larger projects, comprehensiveresearch centers, agency-directed research contracts, research career training, facilities construction,and so forth.", "When the final shape of the FY2006 budget became clear, NIH announced the policies itwould apply for funding RPGs and other award mechanisms. All non-competing RPG awards willbe reduced by 2.35% below committed levels. The average cost of competing RPGs (new andrenewal awards) will be maintained at FY2005 levels, with the number of awards at 1% below whatthe conference level would have supported. All other funding mechanisms will be reduced by 1.1%from the conference level, with the exception of Research Management and Support, which will belevel with the conference amount. By undertaking these measures, NIH expects that the \"successrate\" of applicants receiving funding will be about 19.5% compared to 22.3% in FY2005. Theyexpect to fund a total of about 38,300 competing and non-competing RPGs, representing a decreaseof about 570 RPGs, or 1.5%, below FY2005. NIH is quite concerned about the support of newinvestigators, particularly younger scientists making the transition from training to independentresearch. In January 2006, NIH announced a new Pathway to Independence Award program tosupport promising postdoctoral scientists. The five-year awards will have a two-year mentored phaseand a three-year independent phase. NIH expects to support 150-200 awards beginning in Fall 2006,and a similar number in each of the following five years, for a total commitment of almost $400million.", "As shown in Table 5, only two accounts received an increase in the final FY2006appropriation compared to FY2005. Most of the institutes and centers received decreases in the0.3% to 0.7% range. The National Center for Research Resources was decreased by 1.4% becauseof the elimination of the $30 million program for non-biodefense extramural research facilitiesconstruction. The 26.5% decline in NIH's intramural Buildings and Facilities account reflectscompletion of several construction and renovation projects. The National Institute of Allergy andInfectious Diseases (NIAID), home to almost all of NIH's biodefense research, received a 0.3%increase. As in past years, the NIAID budget includes $100 million to be transferred to the GlobalFund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The Office of the NIH Director (OD) receivedthe only large increase, growing 33.5% to $478 million. Of the $120 million increase, $97 millionis biodefense funding previously included in the Office of the HHS Secretary. It targets research oncountermeasures against nuclear and radiological threats ($47 million, same as FY2005) andchemical threats ($50 million, new in FY2006). The remaining increase for OD provides an 8%boost for OD's portion of the initiatives collectively known as the NIH Roadmap for MedicalResearch. The Roadmap addresses scientific gaps in biomedical research that need to be approachedon an NIH-wide basis.
