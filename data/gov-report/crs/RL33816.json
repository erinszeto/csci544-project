Currently in the United States, residential broadband is primarily provided via cable modem (from the local provider of cable television service), fiber-optic cable, mobile wireless (e.g., smartphones), or over the copper telephone line (digital subscriber line or \"DSL\"). Other broadband technologies include fixed wireless and satellite.", "Broadband access enables a number of beneficial applications to individual users and to communities. These include ecommerce, telecommuting, voice service (voice over the internet protocol or \"VOIP\"), distance learning, telemedicine, public safety, and others. It is becoming generally accepted that broadband access in a community can play an important role in economic development. ", "Access to affordable broadband is viewed as particularly important for the economic development of rural areas because it enables individuals and businesses to participate fully in the online economy regardless of geographical location. For example, aside from enabling existing businesses to remain in their rural locations, broadband access could attract new business enterprises drawn by lower costs and a more desirable lifestyle. Essentially, broadband potentially allows businesses and individuals in rural America to live locally while competing globally in an online environment. A 2016 study from the Hudson Institute found that rural broadband providers directly and indirectly added $24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015. The rural broadband industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015, both through its own employment and the employment that its purchases of goods and services generated.", "Given the large potential impact broadband may have on the economic development of rural America, concern has been raised over a \"digital divide\" between rural and urban or suburban areas with respect to broadband deployment. While there are many examples of rural communities with state-of-the-art telecommunications facilities, recent surveys and studies have indicated that, in general, rural areas tend to lag behind urban and suburban areas in broadband deployment. For example", "According to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) Communications Marketplace Report , \"As of year-end 2017, 94% of the overall population had coverage [of fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps], up from 91.9% in 2016. Nonetheless, the gap in rural and Tribal America remains notable: 24% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans in Tribal lands lack coverage from fixed terrestrial 25 Mbps/3 Mbps broadband, as compared to only 1.5% of Americans in urban areas. The data demonstrate, however, that the gap between urban and rural or Tribal areas has narrowed each year over the last five years.\" Also according to the FCC's Communications Market Report , rural areas continue to lag behind urban areas in mobile broadband deployment. Although evaluated urban areas saw an increase of 10 Mbps/3 Mbps mobile LTE from 81.9% in 2014 to 92.6% in 2017, such deployment in evaluated rural areas remained relatively flat at about 70%. According to January 2018 survey data from the Pew Research Center, 58% of adults in rural areas said they have a high-speed broadband connection at home, as opposed to 67% of adults in urban areas and 70% of adults in suburban areas. A November 2017 Census Bureau survey reported by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) Digital Nation Data Explorer showed 72.9% of rural residents reporting using the internet, versus 78.5% of urban residents. According to NTIA, the data \"indicates a fairly constant 6-9 percentage point gap between rural and urban communities' internet use over time.\" ", "The comparatively lower population density of rural areas is likely the major reason why broadband is less deployed than in more highly populated suburban and urban areas. Particularly for wireline broadband technologies\u2014such as cable modem, fiber, and DSL\u2014the greater the geographical distances among customers, the larger the cost to serve those customers. Thus, there is often less incentive for companies to invest in broadband in rural areas than, for example, in an urban area where there is more demand (more customers with perhaps higher incomes) and less cost to wire the market area.", "The terrain of rural areas can also be a hindrance, in that it is more expensive to deploy broadband technologies in a mountainous or heavily forested area. An additional added cost factor for remote areas can be the expense of \"backhaul\" (e.g., the \"middle mile\"), which refers to the installation of a dedicated line that transmits a signal to and from an internet backbone, which is typically located in or near an urban area.", "Another important broadband availability issue is the extent to which there are multiple broadband providers offering competition and consumer choice.

Many applications are rejected because the applicant's business plan is deemed insufficient to support a commercially viable business. The biggest reason for applications being returned has been insufficient credit support, whereby applicants do not have sufficient cash-on-hand (one year's worth is required in most cases). The requirement for cash-on-hand is viewed as particularly onerous for small start-up companies, many of whom lack sufficient capital to qualify for the loan.

One of the challenges in determining whether a proposed project has a reasonable chance of success is validating the market analysis of the proposed service territory and ensuring that sufficient resources are available to cover operating expenses throughout the construction period until such a time that cash flow from operations become sufficient. The loan application process that we have developed ensures that the applicant addresses these areas and that appropriate resources are available for maintaining a viable operation.", "According to RUS, the loan program was initially overwhelmed by applications (particularly during a two-week period in August 2003), and as the program matured, application review times have dropped. On May 11, 2007, RUS released a Proposed Rule which sought to revise regulations for the broadband loan program.
