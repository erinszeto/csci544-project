Mandatory spending often provides such stability, compared to the vagaries of the annual federal budget and appropriations processes. However, mandatory spending also may fluctuate more widely than annual appropriations, if the authority depends on revenue sources that vary with economic conditions, since spending from these accounts is limited by the receipts.", "Opponents of mandatory spending present several arguments against providing and sustaining such authority. Most of the land management agencies' mandatory spending is funded by selling or leasing federal, taxpayer-owned assets. Thus, opponents argue, those receipts should be used for the benefit of taxpayers generally, not just the beneficiaries of the mandatory spending programs. In addition, mandatory spending raises questions about the possible impacts on federal spending levels and the budget deficit. Finally, opponents charge that mandatory spending programs commonly receive less congressional oversight than programs whose funding is debated annually in the appropriations bills. One example of the concerns over the relative lack of oversight is the restrictions imposed on the use of mandatory spending for administrative and overhead costs. In 1998, Congress limited the use of FS funds for \"indirect obligations\" (identified as \"overhead, national commitments, indirect expenses, and any other category of use of funds which are expended at any units, that are not directly related to the accomplishment of specific work on-the-ground\") to not more than 20% of the obligations from six specific FS mandatory spending programs.

The FWS has several such accounts, including two of the largest mandatory spending programs among the federal land management agencies (the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson/ Wallop-Breaux Funds). Controversies typically have been avoided, because the programs mostly provide benefits to the individuals paying the fees or taxes that fund the programs. For example, the Pittman-Robertson account is funded from excise taxes on hunting equipment (guns, ammunition, and bows and arrows) while funding state wildlife management and hunter education programs. The individuals generally support the excise taxes, because they recognize that the taxes provide them direct benefits. Such a direct linkage between the funders and the beneficiaries reduces controversy and increases accountability for mandatory spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Activities", "paragraphs": ["Mandatory spending programs that fund agency activities on federal lands have historically been the most controversial accounts. The level of controversy is typically related to the funding level of the account, the source of the money deposited in the account, and the agency's discretion in using the funds. ", "Before 1990, FS mandatory spending garnered much of the congressional attention devoted to such funds. FS mandatory spending accounted for a larger share of agency activities than was true for other agencies\u2014as much as a third of agency funding for land management activities. In addition, six of the seven largest accounts were largely funded from timber sale receipts, and timber sales can be controversial because of their environmental effects. Finally, some of the accounts, notably the Knutson-Vandenberg (K-V) Fund, provide broad discretion to agency managers over the activities and locations that can be funded. Critics have argued that broad discretion over agency use of receipts can create \"perverse incentives\"\u2014internal rewards for environmentally damaging activities to generate the funds needed to mitigate those environmental damages. With the K-V Fund, for example, FS wildlife managers may receive funding for projects from timber receipts, even though many of those projects are intended to mitigate damages to wildlife habitat from the timber harvesting, and thus wildlife managers may support timber sales they might otherwise oppose.", "The controversies over mandatory spending for agency activities seem to have declined. This is largely due to the substantial decline in FS timber sales since 1990, making the FS accounts smaller in aggregate and a smaller portion of total funding for agency activities. Mandatory spending has become much more significant for the BLM in the past decade, but the sources of funding\u2014selling helium and selling potentially developable land in suburban Las Vegas\u2014have been less controversial than timber sales, and the uses of the funds are more narrowly prescribed, with less agency discretion, at least for administering the helium program. The southern Nevada land sales have generated some controversy, because of the amount of money available and the discretion in using the funds\u2014for acquiring environmentally sensitive lands or agency management and development activities in Nevada. Similarly, the NPS mandatory spending programs seem not to have been controversial, probably because the funds are generated from recreation receipts and are generally used for recreation-related services (i.e., the individuals who pay are the ones benefitting from the funds). The FWS has faced relatively little concern over its accounts, because its largest accounts are grant programs, not discretionary land management activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compensation Programs", "paragraphs": ["The idea of compensating state and local governments for the tax-exempt status of federal lands has generally not been controversial. However, there have been numerous debates over the level of and basis for that compensation. For some lands and/or some resources, there is no compensation at all. For others, the compensation has traditionally been based on a portion of receipts (gross or net), and the proportion that is granted to state and local governments varies widely\u2014from as low as 4% of receipts to as much as 90% of receipts for mineral leasing in Alaska. Many, but not all, of these compensation programs reduce payments under the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program. This implicitly raises questions about consistent and comprehensive compensation for all federal lands.", "One compensation arrangement has been somewhat controversial in recent years. As noted below, the FS 25% Payments and BLM Oregon and California (O&C) grant land payments declined substantially in the 1990s as timber harvests fell substantially. The payments fell to as little as 10% of payments in the 1980s, forcing major cuts in local programs, especially school funding. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS) was enacted in response, to allow counties to receive payments based on historic compensation rather than current receipts. The legislation generated some debate, not about the compensation level, but about the source of funds to pay for the additional compensation. In the end, funds from the General Treasury were to be used after all available receipts had been exhausted. Reauthorization efforts in 2006 and 2007 were more controversial, both in finding a feasible and acceptable funding source and because the allocation was seen as strongly favoring areas of historically high timber sales. Similar debates seem likely when the current authorization for SRS expires at the end of FY2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mandatory Spending10", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution (Article I, \u00a7 9) prohibits withdrawing funds from the Treasury unless they are appropriated by law, but there is no constitutional limit on the duration of an appropriation.

Most of the natural resource trust funds and special funds have been created to use receipts for specified purposes, such as to rehabilitate sites following an extractive use or to otherwise invest in federal land and resource management. Their creation attests to the belief that such use of receipts is warranted, and their persistence attests to the benefits they have produced over the years, but critics have expressed various concerns. (See \" Issues for Congress ,\" above.)", "The discretion over disposition of receipts varies among agencies and programs. Some dedicate 100% of certain receipts to specific purposes (e.g., each agency's Operation and Maintenance of Quarters accounts). Others direct a portion of receipts to be used in specific ways (e.g., 10% of FS receipts for road and trail construction and maintenance). Still others allow the agency to decide the amount deposited into the account (e.g., the BLM's Forest Ecosystems Health and Recovery Fund). Direction on disposing receipts is a distinctive characteristic of each account and may be a significant factor in any controversies over the account.", "Most NPS receipts result from recreation uses, since the agency's mission is to provide recreation while preserving the lands and resources it manages. FY2009 NPS receipts were $352 million. FWS receipts result from a wide array of activities\u2014timber sales, grazing leases, recreation uses, and more\u2014but are relatively modest, because the agency's mission is to administer the lands and resources primarily to benefit fish and wildlife; the FWS does not separately identify receipts in its annual budget justifications (as do the other three agencies), but rather shows receipts in each program that generates them.", "The BLM and FS have similar missions\u2014to produce sustained yields of multiple goods and services (recreation, grazing, timber, water, and wildlife). Timber sales historically accounted for the vast majority of receipts for these two agencies, about 90% of FS receipts and more than half of BLM receipts. Because federal timber sale levels have declined considerably from 1980s levels, FS receipts have declined substantially. FY2009 FS receipts were $581 million (44% from timber sales), down from their FY1989 peak of $1.515 billion (90% from timber sales). In contrast, BLM receipts have risen because of helium sales and land sales in Nevada. In FY2009, BLM receipts were $564 million, with timber accounting for about 5% of the total. ", "Mineral leasing on federal lands also generates receipts, but the four land management agencies do not collect the receipts from mineral leasing. The DOI Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (previously the Minerals Management Service, MMS) handles financial administration of mineral leases on all federal lands.

For the Wildlife Restoration program, taxed items include the sales of guns (including handguns), ammunition, and archery equipment, with the funds used for wildlife programs. Under the Sport Fish Restoration program, the taxed items are sales of sport fishing tackle and equipment, electric trolling motors and fishfinders, with the funds used for programs to benefit sport fishing.

Waterfowl hunters over 16 years old must buy a duck stamp, which must be displayed on their hunting licenses, while nonhunters purchase the stamps for various reasons: to gain admission to fee areas in the National Wildlife Refuge System; to provide support for the FWS land acquisition program, which it funds; and to collect the stamps, which they value."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Import Duties", "paragraphs": ["One account is funded entirely by tariffs, while import duties contribute to two others.

Numerous laws, beginning with the Act of March 6, 1820, and aggregated into a single program by an unnumbered section of the 1952 Interior appropriations act (65 Stat. 252; uncodified), are the basis for this program. States are paid 5% of the net receipts (4% of the gross) from selling public land and products (e.g., timber) as compensation for the tax-exempt status of federal lands. The payments may be used for education and public roads and improvements. Payments to States, Grazing Within Grazing Districts . The Taylor Grazing Act (Act of June 28, 1934; 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 315i) created an account to pay 12\u00bd% of grazing fee receipts from public lands inside grazing districts to the states in which the grazing districts are located. When payment is not feasible on a percentage basis, states are paid specific amounts from grazing fee receipts from miscellaneous lands within grazing districts. These lands are administered under cooperative agreements specifying that the BLM distribute the receipts. Payments may be used by the state for the benefit of the counties containing the grazing lands. Resource Development Protection and Management, Taylor Grazing Act . The Taylor Grazing Act also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept contributions for administering, protecting, and improving grazing lands, and deposits for cooperative work on grazing lands. Receipts may be spent on the specified rangeland activities, with refunds of deposits \"in excess of their [cooperators'] share of the cost\" for cooperative efforts. Payments to States, Grazing Outside Grazing Districts . The Taylor Grazing Act also created an account to pay 50% of grazing fee receipts from public lands outside of grazing districts to the states in which the grazing lands are located. Again, payments may be used by the state for the benefit of the counties containing the grazing lands. Payments to Counties, National Grasslands . This fund is more fully described below, under the Forest Service (\" Payments to Counties, National Grassland Fund \"). The BLM pays 25% of the net receipts from land uses on the national grasslands, such as from grazing and mineral leasing, to the counties in which the lands are located. Funds are available for schools and roads. Public Survey . Land survey laws, beginning with the Act of August 20, 1894 (43 U.S.C. \u00a7 760), authorize payments to the Secretary of the Interior for public surveys of townships, with any excess money refunded to the contributor. NPR-2 Lease Revenue . Section 331 of EPACT05 transferred Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 2 from the Department of Energy to DOI and \u00a7 332 authorized a portion of mineral lease receipts to be deposited into a special fund for the BLM to remove environmental contamination (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7420 note).

This fund is described more fully below, under the \" National Park Service .\" The BLM collects rents and other charges from employees who occupy agency housing. Monies are used to maintain and repair these quarters. Stewardship Contracting, Excess Receipts . The BLM (and the FS, as described below) are authorized to enter into contracts providing for timber removal and requiring land management services. Timber receipts in excess of the cost of the required land management services are retained by the BLM for additional restoration work. Payments to Oklahoma . The Act of June 12, 1926 (ch. 572; uncodified) established an account to pay Oklahoma 37\u00bd% of the oil and gas royalties from the south half of Red River in lieu of state and local taxes on certain Tribal lands (Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache). These biannual payments may be used for schools or roads. Alaska Townsites . Non-Native Alaskans who occupied town lots before 1976 may acquire those lots by depositing funds to cover the cost of surveys and deed transfers, plus $25. White Pine County Land Sales . The White Pine County Conservation, Recreation, and Development Act of 2006 provides a land-sale authority in the county similar to that in SNLPMA and for Lincoln County (both described above), again retaining 85% of receipts for BLM activities in the state.
