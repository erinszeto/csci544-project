In November 2002, the United States joined 14 European Union countries in imposinga visa ban against Lukashenko and other top Belarusian officials due to Belarus's closure of an OSCEhuman rights monitoring mission in the country. The visa ban was lifted in April 2003 after theOSCE office was reopened. Belarus allegedly has ties with rogue regimes.

EffectiveOctober 1, 1995, Congress limited to 25% the U.S. assessed payments to U.N. peacekeepingaccounts, irrespective of the higher percent level assessed by the United Nations (Section 404 (b)(2),P. L. 103-236). Congress took this action as a result of continuing increases in the overall costs ofU.N. peacekeeping operations and of the failure of U.N. member governments to accept increasesin their own assessment levels, a step that would enable U.S. assessments to be lowered. Thisdifference between U.S. peacekeeping contributions and U.N. peacekeeping assessments, createdby the gap between U.N. and U.S.-recognized assessment levels, helped to produce a growingarrearage in U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping accounts. In 2001, in response to a December2000 agreement by the U.N. General Assembly that the U.S. regular budget assessment would bereduced from 25% to 22%, the U.S. peacekeeping assessment level started to fall.

In summary, S. 925 would establish 27.4%as the assessment level cap for the future, unless an initiative were taken to change it. H.R. 1950 would set the cap at 27.1 %, but for only two years.

A primary function of these regional groups is to elect and thus nominate a regionalcandidate for membership in U.N. organs and bodies, including the U.N. Economic and SocialCouncil and the U.N. Security Council. Regional groups were devised for the purpose of ensuringwhat is called \"equitable geographic distribution,\" a principle referred to in the U.N.

If a memberstate is not a member of a regional group, that state has no chance of being elected, for example, tomembership on the Economic and Social Council or the Security Council. Israel would naturallybe eligible for membership in the Asian Group which includes other countries in the Middle East. A consensus has not existed within that Group to admit Israel. Some authorities have maintained thatnot being a member of a regional group violates the Charter principle of \"equality among all memberstates\" (Article 2, paragraph 1).", "The WEOG was seen as an alternative location for Israel, pending resolution of disputes inthe Middle East.

Instead it places the onus on the FTO to petition to ask to be removed.
