In May 2009, the pension plans of Delphi were terminated and responsibility for the payment of benefits to plan participants was turned over to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), which is a government-run corporation that insures private pension benefits for workers in defined benefit (DB) pension plans. Although most workers in pension plans that are terminated by the PBGC receive their promised benefits, some workers may receive less than their full benefit. The PBGC may not pay an individual more than a statutory maximum benefit.", "In 1999, GM and some unions representing Delphi workers negotiated an agreement as part of the spin-off. GM agreed to provide the workers covered by the agreements the difference between the benefits earned under the plan and the maximum that the PBGC would pay if the pension plans were terminated. Some union workers and the non-union-salaried employees of Delphi did not have such a \"top-off\" agreement. Some contend that GM honored the top-off agreement under pressure from the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry and that the Delphi pension plans were terminated to facilitate restructuring in the auto industry. A group of former Delphi salaried employees has filed a lawsuit against the PBGC.", "This report provides background on Delphi Corporation, relevant pension law, the role of the PBGC, a description of major events at Delphi since 1999, and a listing of congressional hearings and legislation introduced related to the Delphi Corporation since the 111th Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The economic downturn that began in December 2007 had a significant impact on U.S. manufacturing in general and automobile manufacturing in particular.

To facilitate the restructuring, the U.S. government provided two U.S. automakers\u2014General Motors (GM) and Chrysler\u2014with financial assistance. In addition, on February 20, 2009, the Obama Administration announced the creation of the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry. The task force was a Cabinet level group, which was led by Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner and the Director of the National Economic Council, in the Office of the President, Larry Summers; it consisted of Cabinet and other executive branch officials. The Task Force was to \"discuss recently submitted restructuring plans from Chrysler LLC and General Motors Corporation\" and \"to conduct additional analysis and form initial recommendations in their [members of the Task Force's] areas of expertise.\"", "U.S. automakers deal with an extensive network of parts suppliers and components makers. These companies faced financial difficulties as a result of the setbacks in the automotive industry.

In 2005, Delphi declared bankruptcy. As part of Delphi's reorganization, GM agreed to assist Delphi by assuming some of the company's pension liabilities. GM declared bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and in July 2009, GM announced that it would not assume any of Delphi's pension liabilities. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) assumed responsibility for Delphi's defined benefit (DB) pension plans.", "Once the PBGC assumed responsibility, some Delphi retirees may have seen their pension benefits reduced if their monthly benefit was larger than the statutory maximum benefit that the PBGC may pay. Some union workers whose pensions have been reduced by the PBGC may be receiving supplemental \"top-off\" benefits provided by GM. GM negotiated agreements with some of the unions who represent some Delphi workers to provide supplemental benefit if the pensions are transferred to the PBGC. GM honored these \"top-off\" agreements when Delphi's pensions were terminated.", "In September 2009, a group of current and future salaried employees filed a lawsuit against the PBGC seeking restoration of their pension benefits and claiming that the Delphi pensions were wrongly terminated.

In general, the hourly workers were union members whereas the salaried workers were not. The groups of workers had separate benefit plans. To win their approval for the spin-off, GM made agreements with the unions to protect certain post-retirement health and pension benefits.

The accounts are then used as a source of retirement income. In DC plans, individual employees usually direct the investment decisions in their own accounts and bear the risk for investment losses. These DC plans are known as 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plans, based on the appropriate sections of the tax code. Employees are responsible for most of the decisions affecting their individual accounts.", "DB pensions are employer-funded pension plans through which employees accrue monthly benefits using a formula based on a combination of the number of years of service and salary. For example, a plan might offer a benefit of 1.5% multiplied by the number of years of an employee's service multiplied by the average of the employee's highest five years of salary. So a worker who was employed for 30 years and averaged $50,000 for the final five years of employment would receive a benefit of $22,500 per year or $1,875 per month.

Among other provisions, ERISA protects workers' pensions by establishing vesting requirements (how long a person has to work to be entitled to benefits); funding requirements (how much the employer must set aside to pay for current and future benefit obligations); and pension insurance (which will pay participant benefits in case of the plan sponsor's bankruptcy).

The benefits to retirees paid by PBGC do not come from taxpayer funding, and the benefit obligations of the PBGC are not obligations of the United States.
