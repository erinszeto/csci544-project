The agency also administers the $1.8 billion Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) block grant and the $420 million Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) block grant, both of which are authorized in PHSA Title XIX. SAMHSA's funding totaled almost $3.6 billion in FY2010. The agency's budget increased by 34% from FY2000 to FY2010. In real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) dollars, however, the funding increase over that period was only 6%. Funding for SAMHSA's two block grants, which together account for 62% of the agency's budget, has grown at a much slower pace than funding for its competitive grant programs.", "SAMHSA was reauthorized in 2000, as part of the Children's Health Act (P.L. 106-310). The act amended SAMHSA's existing authorities to give the agency more flexibility to direct mental health and substance abuse funding; increased state flexibility to direct the use of block grant funds, creating several new competitive grant programs to expand mental health and substance abuse services for children and adolescents; and authorized appropriations through FY2003. It also added charitable choice provisions that allow faith-based organizations to compete for SAMHSA substance abuse funding without impairing their religious character. P.L. 106-310 required SAMHSA to submit two reports to Congress, one on providing coordinated care to individuals with co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse, and the other on efforts to improve the flexibility and accountability of the block grants.", "Comprehensive reauthorization has not occurred since 2000. However, several laws have further expanded the agency's programs and activities in suicide prevention, underage drinking, and prescription drug abuse.

The SAPT block grant provides approximately 40% of the expenses of state agencies responsible for substance abuse prevention and treatment services. By comparison, the CMHS block grant funds on average 2% of the expenses of state mental health agencies. The difference reflects the historical role federal and state governments have played in funding services in these two areas, with states providing a much larger portion of mental health funding than substance abuse funding.", "SAMHSA also collects data on mental health and substance abuse at the national and state level. These data provide information on the incidence and prevalence of mental illness and substance abuse, the availability and utilization of treatment services, and the outcomes of mental health and substance abuse prevention and treatment services.

In addition, performance and outcome data are used to measure the impact of programs and interventions.", "This report provides an overview of SAMHSA's organization and programs and includes some analysis of the agency's funding over the past decade. It also highlights some of the issues that may be addressed by Congress when it next considers legislation to reauthorize SAMHSA and its programs. SAMHSA was last reauthorized in 2000. Authorizations of appropriations for most of SAMHSA's grant programs expired at the end of FY2003, though many of them continue to receive funding. Comprehensive reauthorization of SAMHSA was discussed during the 110 th Congress, and reauthorizing legislation was introduced in the 111 th Congress.

Appropriations for the agency were reauthorized in 2000, as part of the Children's Health Act. The act amended SAMHSA's existing authorities under Title V, added several new authorities, and authorized appropriations through FY2003.

These activities are centrally coordinated in the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.", "SAMHSA funds competitive and formula grant programs. While the majority of SAMHSA programs provide funding through a competitive grant process, together these programs account for only one-third of the agency's budget. The five formula grants\u2014primarily the two block grants\u2014account for the other two-thirds of SAMHSA's budget. This mix of funding provides flexibility at both the federal and state levels. The formula block grants allow states the flexibility to allocate funding to address specific issues and populations within their jurisdictions, but they do not allow funding levels to be easily adjusted based on changing levels of need due to fixed statutory funding formulas (see \" Block Grant Formula \" below). By comparison, competitive grant programs are generally issue-specific. These grants allow SAMHSA to allocate funding for a particular issue, such as suicide prevention, to areas and populations with the greatest need.", "Title V authorizes numerous competitive grant programs, some, but not all, of which receive funding through the annual appropriations process. For instance, Early Intervention Services for Children and Adolescents and Grants for Emergency Mental Health Centers have never received funds. In addition to the grant programs with specific statutory authority, which are often referred to as categorical grants, each center also has general authority, called Programs of Regional and National Significance (PRNS), to fund states and communities to address priority substance abuse and mental health needs. PRNS authorizes the center to fund projects that (1) translate promising new research findings to community-based prevention and treatment services; (2) provide training and technical assistance; and (3) target resources to increase service capacity where it is most needed. Each center funds several grant programs that were created under its general (i.e., PRNS) authority. Examples of such PRNS programs include the Access to Recovery program and the Strategic Prevention Framework, described below.", "Most SAMHSA programs are administered by one of the three centers and focus on mental health, substance abuse prevention, or substance abuse treatment. This structure encourages the development of programs that fit within a center, and can make it more difficult to implement programs that focus on both mental health and substance abuse. Several cross-cutting programs receive support separately from all three centers, including the National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices, the SAMHSA Health Information Network, the Minority AIDS Program, and the Minority Fellowship Program. To better address cross-cutting issues, SAMHSA has also created connections between centers for programs with both mental health and substance abuse components. For instance, the co-occurring state incentive grant, which supports improvements to infrastructure and capacity for treating individuals with both mental health and substance abuse conditions, is administered by both CMHS and CSAT.", "A brief description of each center follows, including a list of significant programs.

This last section of the report briefly describes several issues that could be considered during congressional debate on SAMHSA reauthorization.", "Issues that may be of interest during reauthorization of SAMHSA include increased performance measurement and accountability for SAMHSA grants and programs, granting specific authority for the Access To Recovery program that provides vouchers for individuals to seek treatment services and that was created under SAMHSA's general authority, improving the ability of communities to provide behavioral health services during disaster response, requiring collaboration between SAMHSA and other federal agencies, increasing SAMHSA's level of emphasis on primary prevention, increasing SAMHSA's role in expanding the number and diversity of the behavioral health provider workforce, and ensuring fairness of the formula used to distribute SAMHSA's block grants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance Measurement and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["The National Outcome Measures (NOMs) were developed by SAMHSA in order to create a standard set of measures and definitions by which to track the progress of states and programs in improving mental health and reducing substance abuse. The NOMs are organized across 10 domains and apply to the agency's mental health, substance abuse prevention, and substance abuse treatment activities. For instance, substance abuse prevention NOMs under the reduced mortality domain measure alcohol use in the past 30 days, perceived risk of harm from alcohol use, disapproval of peer alcohol use, and age of first alcohol use. See Appendix B for the complete matrix of NOMs, by domain.", "In FY2008, SAMHSA began requiring states to report state-level NOMs data as a condition of receiving block grant funding. SAMHSA also uses the NOMs, as well as other performance measures, to track and manage each of its programs. Currently, SAMHSA, as well as the states themselves, use the NOMs to monitor progress on improving mental health and substance abuse services, and to identify areas in need of additional attention. ", "SAMHSA currently does not tie state funding to the mental health and substance abuse outcomes reported in the NOMs data. Holding states accountable for the mental health and substance abuse services by linking NOMs performance to funding could improve program performance and state outcomes. Options for applying an accountability system include establishing national goals for some or all of the NOMs and setting state-specific goals for the NOMs. However, given the variability in data collection among the states, as well as variability in the types and severity of substance abuse problems within each state, requiring states to meet a national goal may not be realistic. Each state could instead be required to show improvement on performance measures over time. That would allow SAMHSA to take into account the baseline performance and the different mental health and substance abuse landscape in each state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to Recovery", "paragraphs": ["The Access to Recovery (ATR) program is an initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush in FY2003 that awards grants to states and tribes for providing vouchers to clients for the purchase of substance abuse clinical treatment services and recovery support services. Recovery support services are those services that support individuals as they obtain treatment for substance abuse. They include care coordination, child care, transportation, and work preparation. The ATR program is not directly authorized in statute, instead it is carried out under CSAT's general PRNS authority. Funding for the program has remained flat at just under $100 million each year since it began in FY2004. However, SAMHSA has requested an increase of almost $10 million for FY2011 to fund up to four new ATR grants.", "In FY2004, SAMHSA awarded three-year ATR grants to an initial cohort of 15 grantees. Another round of three-year grants were awarded to 24 grantees in FY2007. SAMHSA recently announced that it was awarding 30 new ATR grants, each one for up to four years. The annual amount of each grant ranges from $2 million to $4 million. In FY2007, SAMHSA began an assessment to determine the effectiveness of the ATR program. SAMHSA anticipates releasing the results of the assessment in late 2010.", "A centerpiece of the ATR program is the use of vouchers to fund substance abuse treatment and support services, which is different from other SAMHSA programs that provide states or other entities with direct grant funding for services and programs. Under the ATR program, states use program funds to evaluate patients and provide vouchers for the patient to obtain treatment services from an approved provider of his or her choice. Because ATR's vouchers represent an indirect source of federal funding for service providers, faith-based providers may participate in the program without restrictions on the incorporation of religious activities. For more information on the conditions under which faith-based providers may receive SAMHSA funding, see the text box on the agency's charitable choice provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disaster Response", "paragraphs": ["SAMHSA played a significant role in providing mental health and substance abuse services after hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast states in 2005. During 2010, the Haiti earthquake and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico again highlighted the mental health impact of disasters and the resulting need for services. In the wake of these recent incidents, some experts believe that effective disaster assistance must build upon the existing behavioral health resources in affected communities. However, many communities may not have the necessary infrastructure to support the surge in need after a disaster.", "SAMHSA currently has authority to provide emergency behavioral health assistance through three mechanisms: the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP), SAMHSA Emergency Response Grants (SERG), and supplemental appropriations. The CCP provides short-term federal assistance to state and local governments to address mental health needs when there is a presidentially declared disaster. States apply for funds by preparing a formula-based needs assessment within 10 days of the date of the disaster declaration. There is no matching requirement, and requested CCP funds must supplement, not supplant, existing local or state resources. While CCP provides funds for up to nine months after a disaster, the regulations permit extensions in certain cases.", "SAMHSA may also redirect some of its funding through the SERG authority to make non-competitive grants to address emergency substance abuse or mental health needs in communities without a presidentially declared disaster. In order to receive funding, a state must certify that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, and the emergency must be the direct consequence of a clear precipitating event, such as a natural disaster. Like CCP funding, states may receive SERG grants only if no other resources are available to adequately address the need. Apart from CCP and SERG, if Congress provides SAMHSA with supplemental funds for disaster response, these funds could be used under SAMHSA's existing authorities to support behavioral health treatment services.", "In addition to the disaster-specific authorities described above, SAMHSA has multiple programs that focus on building local mental health and substance abuse infrastructure and capacity. For instance, the Mental Health System Transformation Grant supports transformative changes in how communities manage and deliver mental health services, and the Targeted Capacity Expansion program provides funding for communities to build capacity to address gaps in substance abuse treatment services. These programs do not have specific authorizations, but are instead administered under SAMHSA's general authorities (i.e., PRNS). By improving the availability and delivery of behavioral health services in states and communities, these programs also build a stronger base for providing services after a disaster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration with Other Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Numerous federal agencies play a role in the provision of mental health and substance abuse services. While SAMHSA focuses on community-based prevention and treatment services for individuals with mental health and substance abuse conditions, other federal agencies, such as the Department of Education (ED) and the Indian Health Service (IHS), also support and/or provide these services to specific populations or provide related services, such as housing and education. There are few statutory requirements by which these federal agencies are required to work with SAMHSA. However, some experts believe that due to the wide range of socioeconomic risk factors for mental health and substance abuse disorders, as well as the negative socioeconomic effects of these disorders, there needs to be more collaboration between SAMHSA and other federal agencies.", "Collaboration between SAMHSA and other federal agencies has been used to prevent duplication of efforts and provide a platform for sharing expertise. For example, SAMHSA and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) work together to provide a 24-hour suicide prevention hotline for veterans. The VA built upon the existing national suicide hotline administered by SAMHSA in order to create veteran-specific suicide prevention services. The veteran suicide hotline utilizes the national hotline number and training resources, but routes veterans to counselors with additional training in working with veterans. In addition, SAMHSA works with the ED to administer the Safe Schools/Healthy Students program, which provides grants to schools for violence and substance abuse prevention activities.", "Additional collaboration with federal agencies, including those described below, may improve SAMHSA's ability to reach at-risk populations and provide support services to those with mental health and substance abuse conditions. The Department of Justice and ED serve youth with substance abuse and mental health problems who are also the focus of many SAMHSA programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Injury Prevention and Control Program works on prevention and surveillance in the fields of violence, suicide, and mental health. IHS also serves a population that has significant substance abuse problems, along with issues of access to mental health care. VA provides health care to veterans many of whom suffer from mental illness and substance abuse. In addition, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development provides housing services, a support service also provided through some SAMHSA programs for individuals with mental health and substance abuse conditions, including homeless individuals (see Table A -1 ). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Focus on Prevention and Early Intervention", "paragraphs": ["The 1999 Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health and the 2003 President's New Freedom Commission Report framed mental health as a public health issue. The reports advised applying a public health approach that would emphasize prevention and early intervention, rather than focusing on individuals who have become severely ill and expensive to treat. The reports also recommended a wholesale transformation of the nation's approach to mental health care involving consumers and providers, policymakers at all levels of government, and both the public and private sectors.", "These recommendations are echoed in a 2009 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on preventing mental, emotional, and behavioral health problems among young people. Several years after the Surgeon General's Report and the President's New Freedom Commission, the IOM report stated: \"No concerted federal presence or clear national leadership currently exists to advance the use of prevention and promotion approaches to benefit the mental health of the nation's young people.\"", "In response to these and other reports, SAMHSA has implemented a number of new prevention initiatives for mental health and substance abuse. For instance, the agency has funded states to develop plans that would transform the individual-focused behavioral health care system into a more public health oriented system. SAMHSA also created the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF) in 2004, which includes a five-step process for preventing substance abuse in communities. This framework has been applied through the SPF State Incentive Grants, the prevention set-aside in the SAPT block grant, and the HIV prevention program in CSAP. In 2008, SAMHSA launched the Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health (LAUNCH) Initiative, which provides grants to states and tribal organizations to promote and enhance the wellness of young children by increasing capacity to develop infrastructure and implement prevention/promotion strategies necessary to promote wellness for young children aged zero to eight. This program currently focuses on mental health; however, SAMHSA has proposed expanding the focus to include substance abuse prevention in FY2011. ", "SAMHSA also supports some early intervention efforts. In order to identify and treat mental illness and substance abuse early, SAMHSA encourages states to reduce system fragmentation and increase services available to people living with mental illness. SAMHSA also funds treatment programs that function as a safety net for at-risk populations such as pregnant and postpartum women, vulnerable youth, and homeless individuals. ", "Notwithstanding recent efforts to increase prevention and early intervention activities, SAMHSA's budget still reflects a greater emphasis on substance abuse treatment over prevention, with more overall funding and larger increases over the past ten years for treatment services. As shown in Figure 2 , funding for substance abuse prevention PRNS has grown 37% in the past decade, a relatively flat funding trend after accounting for inflation, while funding for substance abuse treatment PRNS has more than doubled. In FY2010, funding for substance abuse treatment PRNS was more than twice the level of funding for substance abuse prevention PRNS (see Table A -2 ). SAMHSA's budget does not similarly break out treatment and prevention for mental health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Issues", "paragraphs": ["A 2006 IOM report identified the inadequacy of the training and number of mental health and substance abuse treatment providers and recommended building, maintaining, and ensuring a competent and qualified behavioral health workforce. While SAMHSA has the authority to collect and analyze workforce data as well as support training programs for providers, historically, the agency has provided limited support for workforce training through the relatively small Minority Fellowship Program (MFP), which provides fellowships for minority mental health care providers. This program falls under SAMHSA's general authority (i.e., PRNS), and its funding level is subject to annual congressional appropriations.", "As discussed above, PPACA contained several provisions aimed at increasing and improving the health workforce, including the behavioral health workforce. While not located within SAMHSA, these newly authorized programs could mitigate some of the issues identified in the 2005 IOM report regarding the shortage of mental health and substance abuse providers.

This block grant consolidated several existing categorical grant programs for substance abuse and community mental health services in order to provide state and local governments with more flexibility and control over funding, to enhance their ability to meet localized needs, to end duplication of effort in delivering services, and to enable more coordination. OBRA authorized ADMHS block grant funds for FY1982 through FY1984 in proportion to the historical funding patterns of the original categorical grants. To better match block grant funding with the need in each state, OBRA also directed HHS to conduct a study that would produce a funding allocation formula, considering population and state fiscal capacity.", "The 1984 ADAMHA Amendments included an allocation formula and reauthorized funding for the block grants for three years with a \"minor equity adjustment\" to hold harmless states that would have otherwise received decreased funding under the new calculation. Funds above the hold-harmless level (i.e., the amount states received in FY1984) were to be allocated using a formula based equally on state population and relative per capita income. The law also required a non-governmental entity to provide recommendations on the formula proposed by HHS. The resulting recommendations, from the Institute for Health and Aging (IHA), included phasing out the hold-harmless provisions, allocating funds based on populations at risk, and incorporating a state fiscal capacity measure.", "The 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act revised the block grant formula, based on the IHA recommendations, to phase out the hold-harmless provision, use total taxable resources as the measure of state fiscal capacity, and incorporate weighted age cohorts as a measure of population at risk. The high-risk age cohorts, determined using an IHA study, were 25-64 years for alcohol abuse, 18-24 years for other drug abuse, and 25-44 for selected mental disorders. Later studies indicated that the inequalities in matching block grant funding to need persisted even after the IHA recommendations were implemented.", "The 1992 ADAMHA Reorganization Act split the ADMHS block grant into two separate block grants, one for community mental health services (CMHS block grant) and another for substance abuse prevention and treatment services (SAPT block grant). The population-at-risk component of the formula was further adjusted to reflect the differences in the population in need of mental health and substance abuse services.", "The 2000 Children's Health Act again revised the block grant formulas by reintroducing hold-harmless provisions for both block grants. For the SAPT block grant, the new provisions specify that a state must receive no less than the previous year's allocation plus a defined portion of any funding increase for the program. If there is a decrease in appropriations for the SAPT block grant, each state gets a proportionate decrease in their block grant allocation.

For the SAPT block grant, this factor is an average of two ratios equally weighted. The first ratio is the number of individuals age 18-24 plus the number of individuals of the same age group who reside in urban areas in a state, divided by the sum of the same populations for all the states. The second ratio is the number of individuals ages 25-64 in a state divided by the sum of the same populations of all the states. For the CMHS block grant, this factor is calculated based on the state population of individuals ages 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and over 65, with a different weight applied to each age group. The second factor, cost of services, is derived from the 1990 report of Health and Economics Research, Inc., and ranges from 0.9 to 1.1.

Second, experts recommend using data from national surveys that measure the level of mental illness and substance abuse in a state (rather than population age distribution) to determine the population in need of services. These surveys include the National Comorbidity Survey-Replication for mental health needs, and NSDUH for substance abuse needs, both of which are administered by SAMHSA.
