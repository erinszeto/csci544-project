Enacted into law as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA, P.L. 96-510), the program became known as Superfund because Congress established a large trust fund\u2014originally supported by taxes levied on specific petroleum products and chemicals\u2014to provide the majority of the program's funding needs. Although the 26-year-old program has seen less attention compared with earlier years, Superfund issues continue to generate debate. This report provides a background and overview of the Superfund program and examines four topics that received interest in recent years.", "The first issue concerns Superfund program funding: who should pay for the program, general taxpayers or a dedicated tax on industry? The program was originally funded by a tax on industry that expired at the end of 1995. Without dedicated taxes, and with a relatively small balance in the trust fund, Congress has been using general revenues for a larger percentage of cleanup funds. Members introduced bills to reinstate the taxes in the current and past three Congresses, but so far these efforts have lacked the necessary support.", "The second issue regards Superfund program appropriations. Recent evidence indicates that appropriations from the past several years have fallen short of program needs. The Administration's FY2007 budget proposal for Superfund also fell below levels that, according to some estimates, are needed to meet program obligations. Without reinstating the Superfund taxes, any increased appropriation would be funded through General Treasury revenues.", "The third issue involves Superfund interaction with abandoned and contaminated hardrock mines. The number of hardrock mining sites requiring cleanup in future years, particularly those without identifiable responsible parties, could play an important role in the Superfund funding debate. There is also a concern that the threat of CERCLA liability may act as a cleanup disincentive for \"good samaritans\" who might offer cleanup assistance at abandoned hardrock mines.", "The fourth issue concerns Superfund's role at animal feeding operations.

CERCLA also enables the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to compel the persons responsible to clean up their contaminated sites.

Although General Treasury revenues have provided some support for the program since its inception, the trust fund traditionally provided most of the funding for the Superfund program. Congress raised trust fund revenues primarily through excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries, and a corporate environmental income tax. These dedicated taxes sustained the trust fund until the taxing authority expired December 31, 1995. Since 1995, efforts to reinstate the taxes have not succeeded.", "At the end of FY1996, the trust fund reached a peak balance of $3.8 billion (see Figure 2 ). Without a consistent source of funding, the balance dwindled essentially to zero by the end of FY2003. The annual budgets have compensated for the lack of dedicated tax revenue by increasing the contribution from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. In fiscal years 2004-2007, virtually the entire Superfund program was funded through General Treasury revenues appropriated by Congress. The FY2008 budget request followed this course, proposing to fund the vast majority of the $1.24 billion requested appropriation from General Treasury revenues.", "In a majority of cases, Superfund cleanups are paid for by potentially responsible parties (PRPs)\u2014usually current or previous owners and/or operators of the site. According to EPA, PRPs conduct cleanup at more than 70% of the sites on the NPL. At approximately 30% of the NPL sites, either EPA cannot locate PRPs for these properties or the PRPs located do not have the necessary financial resources to assist with cleanup. It is primarily for this group of NPL sites (often called \"orphan\" sites) that EPA uses funds from the trust fund to conduct cleanup activities. In general, the current Superfund funding debate (i.e., whether a dedicated tax or General Treasury revenues should support the trust fund) applies to this subset of NPL sites.", "Proponents of reinstating the Superfund taxes argue that the cleanup of orphan sites should rely on taxes paid by the chemical and petroleum industries and companies that use CERCLA hazardous substances, not ordinary taxpayers. They refer to this as the \"polluter pays\" principle. When Bush Administration spokespersons indicate support for the \"polluter pays\" concept, they generally mean that cleanup should be funded by the parties directly involved (i.e., PRPs) rather than by industrial sectors or corporations that did not directly contribute to a specific site's contamination. Opponents of reinstating the tax argue, for example, that the tax is overreaching and unfair, as it applies to all industry sectors and to both compliant and noncompliant companies. Superfund tax proponents contend that in the context of federal budget deficits, it may be difficult to maintain spending at needed levels without dedicated taxes.", "Amendments to CERCLA have addressed some of the claims of unfairness. The Asset Conservation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-208 ) limited banks' and other lenders' exposure to Superfund liability at a contaminated site to the amount of their loans. Businesses engaged in recycling were absolved of liability if they met certain criteria showing that their activities were genuine recycling, and not shams to disguise illegal disposal of hazardous substances (Superfund Recycling Equity Act, P.L. 106-113 ). Additional limits on CERCLA liability were provided in the Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act ( P.L. 107-118 ), which made contributors of small amounts of hazardous substances at an NPL site exempt from liability if the wastes were disposed prior to April 1, 2001. Also exempted were residential property owners, small businesses, and small nonprofit organizations that sent only municipal solid waste to NPL sites, as well as property owners whose land abuts a Superfund site, prospective purchasers of contaminated property, and innocent landowners.", "Since the 107 th Congress, legislation has been introduced that would reinstate the Superfund taxes, but these efforts have failed. In the 110 th Congress, several members, including Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Barbara Boxer and Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health Chair Hillary Clinton, have spoken in favor of restoring the taxes. Representative Maurice Hinchey ( H.R. 1887 ) and Senator Robert Casey ( S. 1179 ) introduced companion bills that would reinstate the taxes, and for the first five years would increase them by 50% to fund a response at \"megasites\" (where cleanup costs exceed $50 million) and at sites that present high health risks. Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Frank Pallone introduced H.R. 3636 , which would reimpose the taxes beginning with the date of enactment until January 1, 2018.

Recent evidence indicates that appropriations from the past several years have fallen short of program needs. If Congress decides to increase annual appropriations without reinstating the Superfund taxes, General Treasury revenues contribution to the program will increase, possibly conflicting with deficit reduction goals.", "As noted above, in July 2001, Resources for the Future (RFF) released a comprehensive study, mandated by Congress, that estimated future program needs for fiscal years 2000-2009. RFF calculated that the base case program needs for FY2008 would be $1.7 billion. The report also estimated a high and low case: $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion per year, respectively. RFF concluded that funding needs would remain above $1.6 billion annually through FY2009 (using RFF's base case). As Figure 3 indicates, annual Superfund appropriations in recent years have consistently been several hundred million dollars less than the funding needs projected by RFF.", "Several factors contributed to RFF's projections for increased funding needs. First, RFF anticipated that numerous \"mega sites\" would move beyond the analysis and design phases and into the actual construction and cleanup phases. In the RFF analysis, the cost of remedial action at mega sites was projected to remain above historic levels through FY2007, and the cost of the Superfund program as a whole was projected to remain above FY2001 levels through at least FY2009 (the final year in the analysis).", "Second, EPA's Office of Inspector General (IG) highlighted the concern that hardrock mining sites may have a significant financial impact on the trust fund. The IG identified \"156 hardrock mining sites nationwide that have the potential to cost between $7 billion and $24 billion to clean up.\" Although the IG points out uncertainty regarding the risks to human health and the environment at these sites, there is also uncertainty concerning PRPs and their ability to pay for cleanup.", "There is evidence that funding shortfalls have occurred in recent years. According to an EPA IG report, in FY2002, the EPA regional offices received no funds for seven of the sites at which the regions requested construction funding. At five different sites, the Regions received less than half of the total funds requested. In FY2003, the IG identified an additional 11 sites that could not begin construction because of a funding shortfall, and at least 5 other sites that did not receive their full funding request in that year. Although the IG did not report on the subject in FY2004, a survey of EPA staff by the House Energy and Commerce Committee Democratic staff found a reported shortfall of $263.1 million. EPA challenged some of the committee data but confirmed in letters to House and Senate Democrats that, due to lack of funding, it did not start construction at 19 sites that were ready for construction in FY2004.", "Congress could increase appropriation levels to meet the increased funding needs. The Administration notes that it requested increases in funding in both its FY2004 request for $1.39 billion and its FY2005 request for $1.38 billion, which Congress did not provide. Congress cut the FY2004 and FY2005 requests by $132 million and $134 million, respectively. Although the Administration's request in FY2006 ($1.28 billion) was lower compared with previous years, Congress cut the proposal by $40 million, enacting $1.24 billion. The Administration requested $1.26 billion for FY2007, a $20 million decrease from its previous request, but $20 million above the amount enacted by Congress in FY2006 (See Figure 4 ). The 109 th Congress adjourned without finalizing FY2007 appropriations for EPA, but it enacted a continuing resolution ( P.L. 109-383 , H.J.Res. 102 ) to provide funding through February 15, 2007. Pursuant to the formula provided in the continuing resolution, the Superfund program will continue to receive funding consistent with the FY2006 enacted appropriation. For FY2008 the Administration has requested $1.24 billion.", "Given RFF's projected funding needs for the Superfund program and the relatively minimal amounts available to the fund from sources other than general revenues, Congress will face competing interests if it attempts to appropriate all of Superfund's needs. RFF estimates that General Treasury revenue contributions as high as $1.5 billion per year would be needed to finance Superfund through the rest of the decade in the continued absence of Superfund taxes.

In its 1997 report, EPA found that only a small percentage of AMLs \"contribute significantly\" to threats to human health or the environment, but the aggregate impact is substantial, with many localized areas suffering serious environmental impacts.

At least 17 of these mines are considered mega sites, with cleanup costs over $50 million at each site.", "Considering the large universe of AMLs, one might question why such a small percentage of the sites are listed on the NPL. There are several factors, particular to the mining industry, that may explain this. First, AML ownership often goes back more than 100 years and involves numerous private and public entities. Thus, the identification of PRPs is especially complex at mining sites. Second, the average cleanup cost\u2014about $22 million\u2014at a non-mega mining site is more than double the average cost of non-mega sites in other industries. Cleanup activities at mega mining sites can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Third, states may provide some resistance to Fund-led (i.e., sites without PRPs) cleanup at mining sites, because the Superfund statute requires the state to pay 10% of the remedial costs and 100% of operation and maintenance costs. At mining sites, these costs could be significant and last for an indefinite period of time.", "On the other hand, several factors may lead EPA and the states to increase the number of AMLs on the NPL. For instance, growing populations in the West, due either to business development or purchases of second homes, may bolster the pressure to remove contamination from local water sources. Moreover, CWA requirements may provide further pressure to address the pollution from AMLs.

In most cases, these parties have a vested interest in cleaning up the contaminated mines and are not acting purely for altruistic reasons, as the term \"good samaritan\" might imply. Some stakeholders believe that the threat of CERCLA liability serves as a disincentive to good samaritan groups who might offer cleanup assistance. Under CERCLA's joint and several liability, EPA can hold one PRP responsible for the entire site cleanup. Under the statute's broad liability structure, good samaritans could potentially become liable as site owners, operators, or as persons who arrange for the disposal of a hazardous substance. For example, good samaritans who conduct remediation activities, such as the treatment of acid mine drainage, might be considered a site operator. Many groups argue that the threat of CERCLA liability creates a chilling effect, discouraging volunteer cleanup at abandoned mining sites. These parties have called for federal legislation that would provide good samaritans with protection from Superfund's liability scheme.", "In general, most parties support the concept of encouraging good samaritan assistance at AMLs. However, some environmental groups are concerned about providing exemptions from CERCLA's liability, pointing out that the strong liability provisions often drive cleanup at mining sites. Furthermore, some argue that the Superfund statute already provides liability protection for good samaritans. CERCLA \u00a7 107(d) (often referred to as the \"good samaritan provision\") might allow good samaritans to provide cleanup assistance at the direction of EPA, without the threat of liability.", "The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-118 ), which amended portions of Superfund, added the \"bona fide prospective purchaser\" (BFPP) exemption. This provision allows parties to purchase contaminated property without accepting the liability for historical contamination, notwithstanding that they knew of the contamination when they purchased. The BFPP exemption is conditional. For example, BFPPs must take \"reasonable steps\" to (1) stop continuing releases, (2) prevent threatened future releases, and (3) prevent or limit human, environmental, or natural resource exposure to earlier hazardous substance releases. Thus, BFPPs may need to address the releases related to the actions of former owner/operators. Regarding this issue, EPA stated:", "Congress did not intend to create, as a general matter, the same types of response obligations that exist for a CERCLA liable party (e.g., removal of contaminated soil, extraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater).... Nevertheless, it seems clear that Congress also did not intend to allow a landowner to ignore the potential dangers associated with hazardous substances on its property. [Emphasis in original.]", "Regardless of the opportunities for avoiding liability, interested parties argue that the threat of Superfund liability remains. In a general sense, good samaritans may be uncertain how EPA would apply the BFPP provisions at a particular mining site. This uncertainty is perhaps amplified due to the possibility of citizen suits, which may occur if environmental or community groups disagree with an agency's interpretation or application of the law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Four good samaritan bills were introduced in the 109 th Congress.

Animal waste from these operations generates several chemicals (e.g., ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and phosphorous) that are listed as CERCLA hazardous substances. CERCLA requires facilities to report hazardous substance releases into the environment, including ambient air, that are above reportable quantities (RQ). The RQ for hydrogen sulfide and ammonia is 100 pounds per day; the RQ for phosphorous is 1 pound per day.", "In recent years, there have been questions as to how CERCLA applies to animal feeding operations. For example, are AFOs required to report ammonia air emissions as releases under CERCLA, and if so, how should the releases be counted in regards to the RQ? Several federal courts have addressed this particular issue by examining the CERCLA definition of \"facility.\" Instead of counting each barn, lagoon, or land application area as separate facilities, these courts have ruled that the entire site should be considered a facility for purposes of CERCLA. Under this interpretation, large AFOs (referred to as concentrated animal feeding operations , or CAFOs) will be more likely to breach the reportable quantity levels because multiple release locations at a given site will be aggregated.", "At a hearing before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies on February 28, 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson testified that the Agency was developing a regulation to exempt CAFOs from Superfund mandates to report air emissions. He said this would be a \"very narrow regulation.\"", "Another question concerns CERCLA liability for manure that reaches water bodies (via erosion or leaching into groundwater). Manure is often applied to the land as fertilizer, but CERCLA excludes the \"normal application of fertilizer\" from the definition of release. Interested parties have argued that some AFOs are taking advantage of this exclusion by applying more manure to the land than is necessary. In the past three years, two federal district courts have looked into this matter, but both cases were settled. The terms of the settlements were not made public, and the settlements effectively ended the court proceedings without a formal ruling on the CERCLA applicability issues. However, a third case involving this issue is currently in the federal system.", "This court activity has increased concern in the agricultural community that other legal actions will follow, and that the courts will continue to apply CERCLA to AFOs. This concern has led to recent congressional interest. Members in the 109 th Congress made several attempts to exempt manure from the requirements of CERCLA. Although one of these legislative proposals ( H.R. 4341 ) gained considerable support (191 co-sponsors), the proposals also generated opposition from environmental groups and state and local governments. None of the bills were enacted. In the 110 th Congress, H.R. 1398 and S. 807 follow a similar approach. There has been no action on either bill. Senator Blanche Lincoln submitted Senate Amendment 1556 to the energy bill, H.R. 6 , on June 13, 2007; it would have added an exemption for manure from the definitions of \"hazardous substance\" and \"pollutant or contaminant,\" and would have provided exceptions from other provisions of CERCLA. However, during debate the amendment was not offered. H.R. 6 passed the Senate on June 21, 2007."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Superfund issues, such as the four described above, continue to generate debate and interest. The selected topics discussed in this report are not mutually exclusive; activity in one of the issues may influence policy in another. For example, if more abandoned hardrock mining sites are added to the NPL, Congress may consider increasing annual appropriations to the Superfund program. This action could affect the argument concerning who should pay for the program. Similarly, CERCLA's level of application to animal feeding operations could affect the use of agency resources in the future. If more sites fall under the CERCLA umbrella, finite agency resources may be strained, thus further fueling a debate over Superfund taxes and funding levels."], "subsections": []}]}}
