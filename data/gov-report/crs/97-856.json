Before a motion to discharge may be made, 218 Members must sign a petition for that purpose.", "Since the present form of discharge rule was adopted in 1931, 563 discharge petitions have been filed, of which 47 obtained the required signatures. The House voted for discharge 26 times, and passed 19 of the measures involved, but only two became law (and two others changed House Rules). Discharge attempts, however, may also lead indirectly to legislative success. The House considered 10 of the measures on which petitions were completed, under other procedures, and eight of these became law. It also took up, under other procedures, 32 measures on which petitions were still pending. Of these, all but three passed the House, and 17 received final approval. Overall, either the petition was completed, or the measure received floor action by some means, in about 16% of discharge attempts.", "During the past 35 years (1967-2002), discharge petitions on 12 measures obtained the required signatures. The House voted for discharge six times, and considered the other six measures under other procedures. Six of the 12 measures were rejected, all of them proposed constitutional amendments, which require a two-thirds majority for passage. The House adopted one amendment to the discharge rule itself, one proposed constitutional amendment (which failed in the Senate), and four measures that became law. During this period, it also used other procedures (such as a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules) to consider 10 additional measures on which discharge was attempted, of which six became law.", "Increasingly often in recent years, the Committee on Rules has responded to discharge efforts by reporting its own special rules for considering the measures involved. It often does so even when the petition is not completed, especially for petitions filed on special rules, rather than on the measures themselves. Since 1967, measures on which this form of petition was filed have had over twice as much chance of reaching the floor, especially under alternative procedures, as when the petition was filed on the measure itself. Perhaps as a result, this form of discharge has become more popular, amounting to almost 70% of petitions filed during the past decade (1993-2002).", "Only since the 103rd Congress has the number of Members signing each discharge petition been public information. During that period, four petitions were signed by more Members than the number belonging to the minority party. Thirty-six were signed by fewer than this number of Members, but more than 90.

From then through 2002, discharge petitions were filed on 563 measures. Most of these never led to any floor action. During these years, the House adopted only 26 discharge motions. However, an additional 42 of the measures involved (or alternatives on the same subject) reached the floor through other procedures available under House Rules, such as pursuant to a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules.

After the present form of the rule was established in 1931, its use remained relatively common throughout the New Deal and World War II periods. Prior to 1950 (i.e., from the 72 nd through 82 nd Congresses), more than 20 petitions were typically filed in each Congress, and sometimes more than 30. Thereafter, however, numbers declined swiftly, no more than seven petitions being filed in any Congress from the 84 th through 90 th (1955-1968). This period of fewer discharge petitions began toward the end of the epoch in which the Committee on Rules did not always act as an arm of the leadership, but continued into the early part of the subsequent era, in which the committee has operated as a leadership organ.", "Since about 1970, the number of discharge petitions has stabilized at intermediate levels. In 11 of the 17 Congresses included in this period (91 st -107 th Congresses), 10 to 15 petitions were filed. This level was exceeded only in the 97 th and 103 rd Congresses (1981-1982 and 1993-1994), and was not attained only in the 100 th through 102 nd (1987-1992) and 105 th (1997-1998) Congresses. This period of stability has continued through the heavy Democratic majorities of the 1970s, the increasingly assertive Republican minorities that began in the 1980s, and the Republican majorities that began in the mid-1990s.", "The high use in the 97 th Congress appears associated with attempts by the minority to develop new means of agenda access. The steep declines in the 100 th through 102 nd Congresses may reflect a developing sense that discharge offered no promising avenue of agenda access. Because a successful discharge effort requires support from a majority of the House, Members may have found the procedure ill-adapted to measures favored chiefly in the minority party. The high levels of the 103 rd Congress suggest that the rule change making petition signatures public rekindled hopes of using the procedure as a floor access tool. The subsequent return to (and temporary decline below) more usual levels may reflect not only the continued scarcity of successful results, but also the 1995 change in party control of the House (104 th Congress)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of the Three Forms of Discharge", "paragraphs": ["One of the most significant innovations of the 1931 rule was the establishment of three alternate forms for initiating discharge action.

The second method has two advantages. First, it permits proponents to draft a special rule that sets terms they consider appropriate for considering and amending the measure. Second, if a discharge petition is filed directly on a measure in committee, the committee can render the petition moot by reporting the measure. If the petition is filed on a special rule for considering the measure, however, then even if the committee reports the measure, it remains in order to discharge the Committee on Rules from the special rule.", "The rule was drafted with the idea that the second method would become its normal use. As Table 1 shows, however, in most Congresses since 1931, most Members attempting to use the discharge procedure to bring an unreported measure to the floor appear to have been either unaware of this method of discharge, or unattracted by its potential advantages. In earlier times, the number of discharge petitions on special rules for unreported measures did not even approach those directly on unreported measures, except in 1937-1940 (75 th -76 th Congresses) and 1959-1968 (86 th -90 th Congresses). Discharge of special rules for unreported measures re-emerged as a common form, however, in the 98 th Congress (1985-1986), and has continued to be so. From the 104 th Congress (1994-1995) onward, in fact, this form of discharge attempt has usually been the most common one.", "The third method of discharge, by contrast, offers the possibility of bringing to the floor a measure that the committee has reported, but which the leadership and Committee on Rules do not schedule for floor action. Discharge attempts of this kind, on special rules for the consideration of reported measures, were most common during the period of \"conservative coalition\" control of the Committee on Rules (roughly 1937-1960). During this period, the Committee on Rules recurrently declined to respond to committee and leadership requests to report special rules for considering measures reported by committees. Supporters of such measures sometimes sought to overcome this obstacle by attempting to discharge the Committee on Rules from a special rule for considering the reported measure.", "The data in Table 1 suggest that, because this situation made Members focus on the possibility of discharge on special rules for reported measures, it may have led them to overlook that the discharge procedure could also be used on special rules for unreported measures. This form of discharge attempt has become uncommon in recent years, but it was used in the 107 th Congress after the House rejected a proposed special rule for considering a campaign finance reform bill, and the leadership declined to make another attempt to call it up."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Number of Signers", "paragraphs": ["Before the House amended the discharge rule in the 103 rd Congress (1993-1994), the names of Members signing a discharge petition were treated as confidential unless the full required number of Members signed, in which case the names were printed in the Congressional Record .

Three of these attained the full 218 signatures; the fourth fell short of this level after an active counter-campaign by the leadership. Petitions that reach this level of support evidently must draw at least some support from the majority party, and therefore presumably will appear on legislation supported either by a bipartisan coalition or by the rank and file of the majority party in opposition to its own leadership.", "A second grouping of 36 petitions was signed by fewer Members than the strength of the minority party, but more than half this number (usually, by more than 100). In some Congresses, petitions with this level of support have been the predominant form; in the 106 th and 107 th Congresses (1999-2002), especially, almost all petitions have fallen into this grouping.

Thirteen, by contrast, received between 30 and 60 signatures. Whether or not the signers drew principally from a single party in the House, petitions in this third grouping cannot be associated with a party in the same sense as can those in the previous one, inasmuch as their level of support could not constitute a majority of either party. This level of support nevertheless represents a potentially significant segment of the House, so that it may often be appropriate to view these petitions as representing factional discharge efforts.", "A fourth grouping includes the nine petitions that obtained three signatures or fewer.

Before and after that period, on the other hand, entry of a petition did not guarantee that a discharge motion would ever actually be offered on the floor, much less adopted.", "Instead, the committees of referral, the leadership, and the Committee on Rules commonly used a variety of devices to preempt further proceedings under the discharge rule. From the 1980s onward, these have often involved bringing up the measure, or an alternative proposal, under terms of an alternative special rule reported from the Committee on Rules.

Action of this kind presumably represents an attempt by the committee of jurisdiction, the leadership, or the Committee on Rules to recover control of the floor by taking action to preempt the opportunity that the discharge rule affords.

Throughout, the table provides the numbers of any related measures and the dates of key actions. The following paragraphs detail the significance and use of each of these items."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Form of Discharge Action", "paragraphs": [" Table 8 indicates whether a discharge petition was filed (1) directly on an unreported measure, (2) on a special rule for considering an unreported measure, or (3) on a special rule for considering a reported measure. It also gives the date the petition was filed, and, where applicable, the resolution number of the special rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Signatures", "paragraphs": [" Table 8 notes which petitions obtained the full 218 signatures required before a motion to discharge may be offered on the House floor. Also, from the 103 rd Congress forward, it notes the number of signatures obtained by each other petition. Before the House amended the rule in that Congress to make signatures to pending discharge petitions publicly available, they were treated as confidential except when the full 218 were obtained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Action on Discharge Motion", "paragraphs": ["Once the 218 signatures are obtained, a motion to discharge is entered on a special discharge calendar. Beginning seven legislative days thereafter, the motion may be offered on the second or fourth Monday of each month, except during the last six days of a session. Table 8 notes whether and when this motion was offered. On several occasions during the period examined, after a discharge motion was entered, the House instead accepted a unanimous consent request that the committee be discharged and the measure be considered at a specific time. Table 8 treats the acceptance of such a request as equivalent to the adoption of a discharge motion. When a petition does not obtain 218 signatures, of course, no discharge motion can be offered on the floor, and no discharge vote can occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Floor Action", "paragraphs": [" Table 8 reports action pursuant to the discharge rule itself in one column, and that pursuant to other procedures in a separate column. In either case, the pertinent column notes whether the measure was (1) reported from committee after the petition was filed, (2) taken up on the floor, and (3) passed or rejected. If the measure was considered under the terms of a special rule, the table also records floor action on the rule. For measures not considered in Committee of the Whole, the table identifies the procedure under which consideration took place.", "Sometimes, although floor action does not take place on the measure that is the subject of the discharge procedure, it does occur on some other measure on the same subject. This action may occur because the committee of referral reports the other measure; the leadership schedules it for floor consideration; or the Committee on Rules reports a special rule for considering it. If discharge is sought on a special rule, another possibility is that the Committee on Rules may report a different special rule, providing for consideration of the same measure or an alternative measure. Actions of these kinds may represent attempts to forestall or preempt consideration of the measure on which the petition was filed, or at least to forestall its consideration under the terms of the original special rule. Table 8 identifies cases in which such actions occurred, noting the numbers of the alternative measures and special rules.", "Occasionally, a discharge petition is filed on a special rule for considering a measure after it has already received some floor consideration. (The campaign finance legislation of the 107 th Congress is an example, as already mentioned.) In the column on alternative floor action, Table 8 notes any floor consideration that occurred on a measure before a discharge petition was filed, but distinguishes this action with an asterisk (*).

Table 8 notes whether each measure listed became law or (for concurrent or simple resolutions, and for joint resolutions proposing constitutional amendments) otherwise attained final congressional approval.

The interval between referral and filing may suggest how urgent the measure's supporters felt the matter to be, or how much confidence they had in the committee of referral. Similarly, the interval from filing to obtaining 218 signatures, as well as the number of signatures obtained, may indicate the breadth and intensity of support for a measure.", "Finally, the interval between the filing or entering of the discharge petition and floor action on the measure may suggest whether the committee of jurisdiction, the House leadership, or the Committee on Rules was attempting to supersede or forestall action pursuant to the discharge procedure. This information accordingly helps to suggest the effectiveness of the discharge procedure in eliciting responsive action by these organs. Such an effect might be inferred, for example, if, after a discharge petition is entered but before the discharge motion can be offered on the floor, the committee reports the measure or the Committee on Rules reports a special rule."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
