By virtue of the IANA functions contract, the NTIA exerts a legacy authority and stewardship over ICANN, and arguably has more influence over ICANN and the domain name system (DNS) than other national governments. Currently the IANA functions contract with NTIA expires on September 30, 2016. However, NTIA has the flexibility to extend the contract for any period through September 2019.", "On March 14, 2014, NTIA announced the intention to transition its stewardship role and procedural authority over key Internet domain name functions to the global Internet multistakeholder community. To accomplish this transition, NTIA asked ICANN to convene interested global Internet stakeholders to develop a transition proposal. NTIA stated that it would not accept any transition proposal that would replace the NTIA role with a government-led or an intergovernmental organization solution.", "For two years, Internet stakeholders were engaged in a process to develop a transition proposal that will meet NTIA's criteria. On March 10, 2016, the ICANN Board formally accepted the multistakeholder community's transition plan and transmitted that plan to NTIA for approval. On June 9, 2016, NTIA announced its determination that the transition plan meets NTIA's criteria, that the plan is approved, and that the transition process can proceed. Having received notification from ICANN that it had completed implementation tasks associated with the transition plan, NTIA notified ICANN on August 16, 2016, that barring any significant impediment, NTIA intends to allow the IANA functions contract to expire as of October 1, 2016.", "Since NTIA's announcement of its intention to relinquish its authority over IANA, concerns have risen in Congress over the proposed transition. Critics worry that relinquishing U.S. authority over Internet domain names may offer opportunities for either hostile foreign governments or intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations, to gain undue influence over the Internet. On the other hand, supporters argue that this transition completes the necessary evolution of Internet domain name governance toward the private sector, and will ultimately support and strengthen the multistakeholder model of Internet governance.", "Meanwhile, legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congresses which seeks to prevent, delay, or impose conditions or additional scrutiny on the transition. Of particular note, Section 534 of H.R. 5393, the FY2017 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Act, would continue to prohibit NTIA from using funds to relinquish its authority over IANA in FY2017.", "The proposed transition could have a significant impact on the future of Internet governance. National governments are recognizing an increasing stake in ICANN and DNS policy decisions, especially in cases where Internet DNS policy intersects with national laws and interests related to issues such as intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, and Internet freedom. How ICANN and the Internet domain name system are ultimately governed may set an important precedent in future policy debates\u2014both domestically and internationally\u2014over how the Internet should be governed, and what role governments and intergovernmental organizations should play."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background: The Domain Name System and the Role of the U.S. Government", "paragraphs": ["The Internet is often described as a \"network of networks\" because it is not a single physical entity, but hundreds of thousands of interconnected networks linking hundreds of millions of computers around the world. As such, the Internet is international, decentralized, and comprised of networks and infrastructure largely owned and operated by private sector entities. ", "Computers connected to the Internet are identified by a unique Internet Protocol (IP) number that designates their specific location, thereby making it possible to send and receive messages and to access information from computers anywhere on the Internet. Domain names were created to provide users with a simple location name, rather than requiring them to use a long list of numbers. The domain name system (DNS) is the distributed set of databases residing in computers around the world that contain the address numbers, mapped to corresponding domain names. Those computers, called root servers, must be coordinated to ensure connectivity across the Internet.", "The U.S. government has no statutory authority over the DNS. However, because the Internet evolved from a network infrastructure created by the Department of Defense, the U.S. government originally funded and operated (primarily through private contractors) many of the key components of the network architecture that enabled the domain name system to function. In 1998, with the Internet expanding beyond the academic and governmental spheres, the U.S. government transitioned the management of the DNS to a newly created not-for-profit international organization based in California called the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). ICANN employed (and continues to employ) a multistakeholder system of governance whereby policy decisions are made by a Board of Directors with input from the various stakeholder groups that comprise the Internet and the domain name system. These stakeholders include owners and operators of servers and networks around the world, domain name registrars and registries, regional IP address allocation organizations, standards organizations, Internet service providers, local and national governments, noncommercial stakeholders, business users, intellectual property interests, and others. ", "After the 1998 transition, the U.S. government, through the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration or NTIA, retained a degree of authority over ICANN's management of the DNS and other unique Internet identifiers such as Internet address numbers and protocols. With respect to ICANN, the U.S. government first exercised its legacy authority through a Memorandum of Understanding (1998-2006), followed by a Joint Project Agreement (2006-2009). Currently, NTIA and ICANN are joint participants in an Affirmation of Commitments (AoC) agreement, in which both parties agree to scrutiny and evaluation by review boards. The AoC is voluntary, and either ICANN or NTIA can withdraw from the agreement at any time. ", "Concurrently, a separate contract between the ICANN and NTIA\u2014specifically referred to as the \"IANA functions contract\"\u2014authorizes ICANN to manage the technical underpinnings of the domain name system (DNS). The IANA functions can be broadly grouped into three categories:", "1. Number resources\u2014the coordination and allocation of the global pool of IP numbers; 2. Protocol Assignments\u2014the management of IP numbering systems in conjunction with Internet standards bodies; and 3. Domain names\u2014management of the DNS authoritative root zone file.", "Additionally, and intertwined with the IANA functions contract, a cooperative agreement between NTIA and Verisign (the company that operates the .com and .net registries) authorizes Verisign to manage and maintain the official root zone file that is contained in the Internet's root servers which underlie the functioning of the DNS. ", "The IANA functions contract gives the U.S. government, through NTIA, the authority to approve various technical functions such as modifying the root zone file (which would include, for example, adding additional generic top level domains [gTLDs] to the root zone). In this narrow sense, NTIA's role is strictly clerical and administrative. Policymaking\u2014such as decisions to make changes in the root zone file\u2014is made by ICANN through its internal policy development process. Although it has the authority to do so under the IANA functions contract, NTIA has never refused to approve any IANA related actions as directed by ICANN. ", "However, the IANA functions contract, while primarily administrative in nature, carries broader significance because it has conferred upon the U.S. government a \"stewardship\" role over ICANN and the domain name system. This stewardship role does not mean that the NTIA controls ICANN or has the authority to approve or disapprove ICANN policy decisions. Rather, the U.S. government's authority over the IANA functions has been viewed by the Internet community as a \"backstop\" that serves to reassure Internet users that the U.S. government is prepared and positioned to constitute a check on ICANN under extreme circumstances (such as, for example, fiscal insolvency, failure to meet operational obligations, or capture or undue influence by a single stakeholder or by outside interests).", "Meanwhile, the U.S. government continues to participate in the ICANN policy development process through membership in the Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), which provides advice to ICANN on issues of public policy, especially where there may be an interaction between ICANN's activities or policies and national laws or international agreements. However, while all governments have access to membership in the GAC, the U.S. government arguably has had more influence over ICANN and the DNS than other governments by virtue of the IANA functions contract with ICANN.

With NTIA having the option of extending the contract for up to two two-year periods through September 30, 2019, NTIA announced on August 17, 2015, that it will extend the IANA functions contract through September 30, 2016. ", "As a first step, NTIA asked ICANN to convene interested global Internet stakeholders to develop a proposal to achieve the transition. Specifically, NTIA expects ICANN to work collaboratively with parties directly affected by the IANA contract, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), top level domain name operators, Verisign, and other interested global stakeholders. In October 2013, many of these groups\u2014specifically, the Internet technical organizations responsible for coordination of the Internet infrastructure\u2014had called for \"accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions, towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing.\" ", "NTIA has stated that it will not accept any transition proposal that would replace the NTIA role with a government-led or an intergovernmental organization solution. In addition, NTIA told ICANN that the transition proposal must have broad community support and address the following four principles:", "support and enhance the multistakeholder model; maintain the security, stability, and resilience of the Internet DNS; meet the needs and expectation of the global customers and partners of the IANA services; and maintain the openness of the Internet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multistakeholder Process to Develop a Transition Proposal", "paragraphs": ["ICANN convened a process through which the multistakeholder community attempted to come to consensus on a transition proposal.

NTIA has stated that it views these two processes as \"directly linked\" and that \"both issues must be addressed before any transition takes place.\" On March 10, 2016, the ICANN Board formally accepted the IANA Stewardship Transition proposal and the Enhancing ICANN Accountability report.

Under the draft proposal, a steering group was formed \"to steward the process in an open, transparent, inclusive, and accountable manner.\" The steering group was composed of representatives of each ICANN constituency and of parties directly affected by the transition of IANA functions (for example, Internet standards groups and Internet number resource organizations).", "On June 6, 2014, after receiving public comments on the steering group draft proposal, ICANN announced the formation of a Coordination Group which was responsible for preparing a transition proposal. The IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group (ICG) was composed of 30 individuals representing 13 Internet stakeholder communities. On August 27, 2014, the ICG released its charter, which stated that its mission is \"to coordinate the development of a proposal among the communities affected by the IANA functions.\" ", "The ICG requested a proposal for each of the three primary IANA functions (domain name-related functions, numbering, and protocol parameters) to be developed by the three operational communities associated with each of those primary functions.

Domain Names\u2014developed by the Cross Community Working Group to Develop an IANA Stewardship Transition Proposal on Naming Related Functions (CWG-Stewardship).", "While the Number Resources and the Protocol Parameter proposals were completed in January 2015, consensus on a domain name function proposal proved more difficult to reach, with the CWG-Stewardship group unable to meet an initial January 2015 deadline. This is perhaps due to the fact that both numbering and protocols are currently operated by external groups which already perform these activities under contract with ICANN. The domain name IANA function is performed by ICANN itself (under contract to NTIA), and the question of how to transition away from the NTIA contract with respect to the domain naming function is inherently more complex and controversial. ", "The CWG-Stewardship group was composed of 19 members appointed by chartering organizations and 115 participants who contributed to mailing list conversations and meetings. The key question the group grappled with was whether a new organization or entity should be created to oversee the IANA functions contract (an external model), or whether ICANN itself\u2014subject to enhanced accountability measures\u2014should be given authority over the IANA function (an internal model).

ICANN would assume the role currently fulfilled by NTIA (overseeing the IANA function), while PTI would assume the role currently played by ICANN (the IANA functions operator).

The purpose of this process was to ensure that ICANN will remain accountable to Internet stakeholders if and when ICANN is no longer subject to the IANA contract with the U.S. government. Specifically, the process examined how ICANN's broader accountability mechanisms should be strengthened to address the potential absence of its historical contractual relationship with the DOC, including looking at strengthening existing accountability mechanisms (e.g., the ICANN bylaws and the Affirmation of Commitments).", "To implement the accountability process, ICANN formed a Cross Community Working Group (CCWG) to develop proposals to enhance ICANN's accountability toward all stakeholders.
