Medical devices are a wide range of products that are used to diagnose, treat, monitor, or prevent a disease or condition in a patient. A medical device company must obtain FDA's prior approval or clearance before marketing many medical devices in the United States. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) within FDA is primarily responsible for medical device review and regulation. CDRH activities are funded through a combination of annual discretionary appropriations from Congress and user fees collected from device manufacturers.", "Congress first gave FDA the authority to collect user fees from medical device companies in the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-250). Congress last reauthorized medical device user fees for a five-year period (FY2013-FY2017) via the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 (MDUFA III, Title II of Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, FDASIA, P.L. 112-144). The primary purpose of the user fee program is to reduce the time necessary to review and make decisions on medical product marketing applications. Lengthy review times affect the industry, which waits to market its products, and patients, who wait to use these products. Under MDUFA III, FDA was authorized to collect $595 million from industry from FY2013 through FY2017. In exchange for the fees, FDA and industry negotiated performance goals for the premarket review of medical devices.", "The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) requires premarket review for moderate- and high-risk devices. There are two main paths that manufacturers can use to bring such devices to market. One path consists of conducting clinical studies and submitting a premarket approval (PMA) application that includes evidence providing reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective. The other path involves submitting a 510(k) notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market (a predicate device) that does not require a PMA. The 510(k) process results in FDA clearance and tends to be less costly and less time-consuming than the PMA path. Substantial equivalence is determined by comparing the performance characteristics of a new device with those of a predicate device. Demonstrating substantial equivalence does not usually require submitting clinical data demonstrating safety and effectiveness. In FY2015, FDA approved 95% of PMAs accepted for review and 85% of 510(k)s accepted for review were determined to be substantially equivalent.", "In September 2015, the agency began a series of negotiation sessions with industry on the MDUFA IV reauthorization agreement. On August 22, 2016, FDA announced it had reached an agreement in principle with industry on proposed recommendations for the reauthorization. Under the draft agreement, FDA would be authorized to collect $999.5 million in user fees plus inflation adjustments over the five-year period starting in October 2017. The MDUFA IV draft and final commitment letters and proposed statutory changes are posted on the FDA website. A public meeting to discuss the proposed recommendations for reauthorization of MDUFA was held on November 2, 2016, and the final agreement between agency and industry has been submitted to Congress.", "Since medical device user fees were first collected in FY2003, they have comprised an increasing proportion of the MDUFA program. In FY2006, medical device user fees accounted for 16% of the MDUFA program total costs, compared with 35% in FY2015. All user fees (as enacted) accounted for 42% of FDA's total FY2016 program level. Over the years, concerns raised about user fees have prompted Congress to consider issues such as which agency activities could use the fees, how user fees can be kept from supplanting federal funding, and which companies should qualify as small businesses and pay a reduced fee."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA, also called MDUFA I) gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to collect fees from the medical device industry.

Medical devices are a wide range of products that are used to diagnose, treat, monitor, or prevent a disease or condition in a patient. FDA describes medical devices as ranging \"from simple tongue depressors and bedpans to complex programmable pacemakers with micro-chip technology and laser surgical devices.\" Medical devices also include in vitro diagnostic products, reagents, test kits, and certain electronic radiation-emitting products with medical applications, such as diagnostic ultrasound products, x-ray machines, and medical lasers.", "Manufacturers of moderate and high risk medical devices must obtain FDA approval or clearance before marketing their device in the United States. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has primary responsibility within FDA for medical device premarket review. The primary purpose of user fees is to support the FDA's medical device premarket review program and to help reduce the time it takes the agency to review and make decisions on marketing applications. Between 1983 and 2002, multiple government reports indicated that FDA had insufficient resources for its medical devices premarket review program. Lengthy review times affect the industry, which waits to market its products, and patients, who wait to use these products. The user fee law provides revenue for FDA. In exchange for the fees, FDA and industry negotiate performance goals for the premarket review of medical devices. The medical device user fee program was modeled after the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).", "Like the prescription drug and animal drug user fee programs, the medical device user fee program has been authorized in five-year increments. FDA's medical device user fee authorities were last reauthorized through September 30, 2017, by the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 (MDUFA III). MDUFA III was enacted as Title II of Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA, P.L. 112-144 ), which became law on July 9, 2012. ", "FDASIA also reauthorized PDUFA, created new user fee programs for generic and biosimilar drug approvals, and modified FDA authority to regulate medical products. Because of the importance of user fees to FDA's budget, PDUFA and MDUFA are considered to be \"must pass\" legislation, and Congress has in the past included language to address a range of other concerns. For example, MDUFA III included provisions about the extent to which FDA can delegate activities to third parties (inspections and the review of premarket notifications); the establishment of registration requirements (timing and electronic submission); a unique device identification system; and reporting requirements for devices linked to serious injuries or deaths.", "This report describes current law regarding medical device user fees and the impact of MDUFA on FDA review time of various medical device applications and the agency's medical device program budget.

For prescription drugs, the manufacturer must pay a fee for each new drug application (NDA) that is submitted to FDA for premarket review. In contrast, most medical devices listed with FDA are exempt from premarket review and do not pay a user fee (see Figure 1 ). Of the unique devices that are listed by manufacturers with FDA in FY2016, about 63% were exempt from premarket review; the remainder entered the market via the 510(k) process (35%), the premarket approval (PMA) process (1%), or via other means, such as the humanitarian device exemption (see \" FDA Premarket Review of Medical Devices \" and \" Exemptions and Discounted Fees \").

Fees collected under MDUFA III in FY2015 funded 35% of the MDUFA program total costs in FY2015.", "In addition to premarket review fees, there are also fees for when a manufacturer requests approval of a significant change in the design or performance of a device approved via the PMA pathway; these are called PMA supplements. Examples of PMA supplements include a Panel-Track Supplement , when it is necessary for FDA to evaluate significant clinical data in order to make a decision on approval, and a 180-Day PMA Supplement , if a manufacturer requests approval of a change in an approved device that does not require FDA to evaluate new clinical data or requires limited clinical data. ", "The original 2002 user fee law had only authorized FDA to collect fees for premarket review, such as for PMA applications, PMA supplements, or 510(k) notifications. The 2007 reauthorization\u2014MDUFA II\u2014added two types of annual fees in order to generate a more stable revenue stream for the agency. According to FDA, there were fluctuations in the number of applications submitted from year to year, and fee revenues repeatedly fell short of expectations. MDUFA II added establishment registration fees , paid annually by most device establishments registered with FDA, and product fees , paid annually for high-risk (Class III) devices for which periodic reporting is required. MDUFA II also added two application fees\u2014the 30-Day Notice and 513(g) application\u2014and substantially lowered all existing application fee amounts (see Table A -1 ). A 30-Day Notice is used by a manufacturer to request modifications in manufacturing procedures and a 513(g) application is used by a manufacturer to request information on the classification of a device. Other than the establishment fee, the amount of each type of user fee is set as a percentage of the PMA fee, also called the base fee .

The total fees authorized to be collected over the five-year period FY2013 through FY2017 is $595 million.", "MDUFA III adjusts the total revenue amounts by a specified inflation adjustment, similar to the adjustment made under PDUFA, and the base fee amount is adjusted as needed on a uniform proportional basis to generate the inflation-adjusted total revenue amount. After the base fee amounts are adjusted for inflation, the establishment fee amount is further adjusted as necessary so that the total fee collections for the fiscal year generates the total adjusted revenue amount.
