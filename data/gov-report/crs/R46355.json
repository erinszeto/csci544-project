Strategic petroleum stock holdings are one policy included in the agency's International Energy Program (IEP) agreement. As an IEA member and IEP signatory, the United States must meet certain stock holding thresholds and be prepared for a coordinated response during an emergency.

Both public and privately held oil stocks have important roles to play in providing security in times of oil market disruptions. Similarly, both public and private oil stocks have some role in oil price determination and movements. However, there may be benefits to maintaining SPR oil stockpiles, as the oil market can often be unpredictable, as demonstrated by dramatic demand/supply shifts and subsequent low oil prices experienced in early 2020.

Due to changes to the oil market over the past several years, the role of the SPR may be of congressional interest. ", "From the mid-1970s through the present day, the United States has absorbed a number of significant spikes in the price of crude oil and petroleum products from supply disruptions. Whether driven by disruptions in the physical supply of petroleum, unexpected demand growth, or by uncertainties owing to international conflicts and instabilities, oil price volatility has had consequences for the U.S. economy. The price of crude oil historically rises or falls with the world economy. However, supply generally does not smoothly follow demand, and numerous factors can impact crude oil prices (e.g., supply, demand, available supply, value of the dollar, geopolitical risks). Thus, oil prices can be volatile. Volatility in crude oil prices can disrupt or enable oil industry investments and production\u00e2\u0080\u0094factors that can have a ripple effect on the global economy. The oil market also responds to geopolitical events. Crude oil and petroleum products are globally traded commodities and as such, global price fluctuations affect U.S. prices and the economy. ", "Several signs suggest an oil market that may be better equipped to respond to supply disruptions: a trend in lower crude oil prices beginning in 2014, the role of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), new U.S. capacity in the market, and evolving consumption patterns. Technological advancements employed in the United States have added significantly to U.S. crude oil production. In December 2015, Congress lifted restrictions on U.S. crude oil exports. The United States is exporting crude oil at record levels, causing U.S. crude oil and petroleum product net imports to decline. According to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data, the United States was a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products from September 2019 through January 2020, the most recent data. ", "However, oil markets remain volatile. An oversupplied oil market, as experienced in early 2020, can contribute to lower crude oil prices. While low crude oil prices can often mean lower gasoline prices for consumers, it also can create economic challenges for oil producers and others along the supply chain, some of which may lead to long-term impacts. During a time of oversupply and low prices, some policymakers have discussed the possibility of having the Department of Energy (DOE) purchase crude oil to increase oil stockpiles in the SPR.

However, the availability of strategic stocks can help mitigate the magnitude of the market's reaction to a crisis or guarantee supply to certain consumers (e.g., the military, strategic industries). Congress's motivation in creating the SPR focused on a deliberate and dramatic physical supply disruption and on mitigating the economic effects of a shortage stemming from international events. In the event of a supply interruption, proponents reasoned that introducing petroleum into the U.S. market from the SPR could offset the lost supply and in doing so help calm markets, mitigate sharp price spikes, and reduce economic disruptions. Congress did not necessarily design the SPR to provide price support in the event of an oversupplied market.

In the United States, commercial stocks do not necessarily provide a level of security proportional to that of the SPR, as they are inherently market driven, not government operated. Companies may have an economic rationale to lower commercial stocks in spite of a security context.

The findings suggested that then, as now, the United States had sufficient domestic refining capacity to meet domestic demand. The SPR could also buy time for the crisis to resolve or for diplomacy to seek some resolution before a potentially severe oil shortage escalated the crisis. Additionally, according to DOE, petroleum products are less flexible and degrade more quickly as compared to crude oil. Further, U.S. import dependency recently has largely been on crude oil, not petroleum products\u00e2\u0080\u0094the United States has been a net exporter of petroleum products since late 2010. As a result, potential supply disruptions would most likely affect the United States through the disruption of crude oil, and not necessarily petroleum products. ", "Generally, two key characteristics, density (i.e., specific gravity) and sulfur content, are the metrics used to classify crude oil types. The density is measured using API gravity, a scale developed by the American Petroleum Institute, that expresses the \"lightness\" or \"heaviness\" of crude oils on an inverted scale (i.e., the lower the API gravity, the heavier or denser the crude oil).

The EIA reports that in September 2019, the United States exported 89,000 million barrels per day more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. The EIA further projected that, in most forecasts, the United States will be a net petroleum exporter on an annual basis around 2020.

Commercial oil companies are more likely to store oil for the short-term, rather than as a long-term security stock. Some experts contend that commercial stocks cannot provide a level of security proportional to that of the SPR.", "The role of sales from the SPR into the commercial market during a supply disruption is linked to the size of commercial stocks and the availability of additional production capacity. Generally, the level of private oil stocks closely follows the level of oil production and changes in the price of oil. If global supply is greater or less than current demand, commercial stocks of oil may rise or fall accordingly. In a market where there is no physical shortage, oil companies may have limited interest in purchasing SPR oil unless they want to build crude oil stocks or have spare refining capacity to turn the crude into useful products. Conversely, during a supply disruption, commercial stocks would likely move to market before the SPR, as DOE must solicit buyers through a Notice of Sale. Further, the SPR takes approximately 13 days from an initial decision to hold a sale to ultimate delivery of that oil. For instance, in response to the attack against Saudi Arabia's oil production in September 2019, President Trump authorized the release of oil from the SPR, as needed. In response to prior events, presidents have ordered a release in coordination with other IEA member countries. In this case, the IEA did not announce a coordinated release, but monitored the situation closely.

As market conditions continue to change, Congress may consider options for utilizing the SPR in an oversupplied low oil price environment. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Low Price Environment", "paragraphs": ["Global oil prices declined nearly 60% between January and mid-April 2020, as a result of a number of factors. These factors included reduced demand and economic impacts related to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, and the failure of OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries (OPEC+), including Russia, to come to an agreement regarding oil production during their March 2020 meeting. While low oil prices are generally positive for consumers (translating into lower gasoline prices) and oil refiners (translating into lower costs), sustained low prices could result in financial stress for companies operating in the U.S. oil exploration and production (E&P) sector.

Acquiring crude oil\u00e2\u0080\u0094direct purchases or royalty-in-kind\u00e2\u0080\u0094for SPR storage could absorb a limited amount of market oversupply. Physical SPR capacity is approximately 713.5 million barrels, while actual inventories are 635 million barrels. At the direction of President Trump, DOE issued a solicitation to purchase an initial 30 million barrels of crude oil as part of a plan to acquire 77 million barrels. However, on March 25, 2020, DOE cancelled this solicitation, noting, \"Given the current uncertainty related to adequate Congressional Appropriations for crude oil purchases associated with the March 19, 2020 solicitation, the Department is withdrawing the solicitation. Should funding become secure for the planned purchases, the Department will reissue the solicitation.\"", "Whether increasing SPR inventories might contribute to oil market rebalancing is uncertain. Even if Congress appropriated funding to purchase crude oil, the SPR's available capacity is limited (currently around 77 million barrels) and the impact could be marginal depending on a number of factors (i.e., duration and volume of crude oil oversupply). However, Congress authorized the SPR to store up to 1 billion barrels. While not an immediate solution, Congress could consider appropriating funds to expand the SPR's physical capacity to the authorized 1 billion barrels.", "On April 2, 2020, DOE (under exchange authority 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a76239(f)(5)) announced a solicitation for the storage of 30 million barrels in exchange for a fixed premium of barrels, returning the difference by March 31, 2021. This would allow crude oil to be temporarily stored in the SPR sites, potentially providing some financial relief to some U.S. producers. Several petroleum associations applauded the effort, stating, for example, \"The oil producers of Louisiana praise the President, his administration, and Louisiana's federal delegation for taking swift, decisive action to help support the nation's energy producers with the SPR's exchange for storage.\"", "However, challenges remain, as spare storage capacity at Cushing, OK (the designated delivery point for NYMEX crude oil futures contracts) is limited or unavailable. The futures price is a contract, usually monthly, for delivery of a certain amount of crude oil, on a specified date in the future, and at a particular location (Cushing, OK, for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil). As available storage becomes more limited, futures prices may continue to fall as owners of crude oil discount their price in order to entice buyers. This apparently was the case with WTI where some traders grew concerned over storage availability in Cushing, forcing some to sell their futures contracts. Despite federal efforts to make capacity available at the SPR and other measures, Cushing storage capacity is a key factor for WTI prices.", "When acquiring petroleum for the SPR, the Secretary is to consider, to the extent possible, four objectives under 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a76240. Among these, the Secretary is to minimize market impacts from purchases. Acquiring SPR crude oil to reduce oversupply and increase prices could conflict with that objective. However, the degree of impact on the market may be hard to determine, and a threshold level is not explicitly defined.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Price Environment", "paragraphs": ["Crude oil price increases generally result from actual or anticipated market tightening; that is, an increase in demand, a reduction in supply, or both. There is a general recognition that a release from the SPR would likely only provide temporary relief from rising prices; however, high prices alone are not an authorized circumstance to trigger a release from the SPR. High prices are generally a consequence of a severe supply interruption. For instance, in 2011, the price increases were thought to be largely attributable to the loss of Libyan production during the revolution in that country. ", "The judgment that a release of crude oil from the SPR provides some temporary relief from rising prices seems well founded. The U.S. government bases its notice of sale on the previous five-day average of the price of the grade of crude oil it intends to sell, and accepts bids it considers responsive. If the notice itself does not prompt, or contribute to, a softening of prices, there may be limited interest on the part of the oil industry in bidding on SPR supply. Although the possibility exists that prices might decline if additional refined product is released into the market, it is impossible to predict what long-term quantitative effect an SPR crude drawdown would have. For example, in response to prolonged oil supply disruption from the Libyan Civil War, the IEA coordinated a petroleum release on June 23, 2011. Following the announcement of a 30 million barrel release of oil from the SPR, the price of crude oil declined by about 5% that day. About one week later, prices began to exceed pre-announcement levels. ", "The announcement of the SPR release stated that the oil would be delivered to market by the end of August 2011. Oil prices began to decline in that month and generally declined through September 2011. However, several other factors may have contributed to the price of crude oil. For instance, the prices of crude oil declined in May 2011 following the death of Osama bin Laden and a rise in the U.S. dollar. ", "Some observers do not support use of the SPR to mitigate high crude oil prices. These observers prefer allowing the market to resolve itself and for government not to intervene. Further, observers may contend that market conditions and current and anticipated geopolitical events are affecting prices more than short-term physical supply concerns or that speculative bidding in the oil commodity futures market has driven price volatility more than the current supply-demand balance. In this context, use of the SPR would have limited impact on market conditions.", "Congress could reduce the size of the SPR and sell off excess petroleum for the benefit of other programs while still maintaining the 90-day net import requirement. However, determining the optimal level of oil holdings in the SPR is likely to remain controversial. Analytical tools common in public policy analysis, such as cost-benefit analysis, dynamic programming, or other optimization techniques, depend on determining the value of variables that are highly uncertain in this case. The responsiveness of the adjustment of oil quantities on both the demand and the supply sides of the market, the price volatility of oil, and the probabilities of different degrees of political/military disruption in the oil market are all uncertain. In addition the 90-day net import requirement is a dynamic calculation based on a combination of market factors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
