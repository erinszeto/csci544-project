Beyond those three components, a number of procedural options are available both to the House and Senate in what subpoena authority the chambers grant their committees and to committees in writing rules on the exercise of that authority. To analyze a committee's authority to authorize subpoenas, the following questions are useful:", "Has the House for a House committee (or subcommittee) or the Senate for a Senate committee (or subcommittee) granted subpoena authority? For standing committees and their subcommittees, the answer is currently in the affirmative; for ad hoc committees and subcommittees, the parent chamber may have withheld subpoena authority. Has the House or Senate granted subpoena authority but conditioned it in some way? For example, on occasion in the past, subpoena authority granted a committee could be exercised only by the committee's action, not by action of or delegation to the chair.", "In a committee's rules \u2014", "Does a committee require the authorization of an investigation by the committee (or a subcommittee) before subpoenas may be authorized? Do a committee's rules distinguish between hearings and investigations? If so, may subpoenas be authorized for hearings? Are the committee's rules silent on authorizing subpoenas or are there one or more rules on authorizing subpoenas? If a committee's rules are silent, how has the committee authorized subpoenas in the past? Has the committee authorized each subpoena or delegated authority to the chair or exercised its authority in another way? Is this past practice instructive or precedential? If there are one or more rules, who may authorize a subpoena: the committee, the chair, or the chair and ranking minority member together? What is the role of the ranking minority member? Must the ranking minority member be notified or consulted, or does the ranking minority member have authority to disapprove the authorization of a subpoena? Are there backup procedures available to a committee chair? For example, if the committee's rules give disapproval authority to the ranking minority member, may the chair proceed in the absence of a response from the ranking minority member or may the committee nonetheless authorize a subpoena if the ranking minority member disapproves? What constraints are placed on a chair's exercise of subpoena authority delegated to the chair? For example, some House committees allow the chair to authorize a subpoena only after the House has adjourned for three days. May a chair authorize a subpoena that the committee has considered or has rejected? What time limits appear in a committee's rules? For example, a ranking minority member may have 48 hours to respond to a chair proposing to authorize or to issue a subpoena, or a chair may be required to notify committee members within one week of the issuance of a subpoena. What is the quorum for the committee to authorize a subpoena? Must minority members be present? Must a minority member support the authorization? What are the committee's rules to suspend or change its rules? For example, is advance notification to all committee members required? Who may issue a subpoena: the chair, a member designated by the chair, a member designated by the committee, or a member or members designated by committee rule? Who may serve a subpoena?", "In committee rules applicable to a committee's subcommittees \u2014", "Has the committee granted subpoena authority to its subcommittees or withheld this authority from them?
