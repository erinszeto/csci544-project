During a period of economic and budget crises in the United States, Obama Administration officials and some senior Members of Congress have voiced concerns about the efficacy of continuing the flow of billions of U.S. aid dollars into Pakistan, with some in Congress urging more stringent conditions on, or even curtailment of, such aid. At issue is whether Pakistan's civilian government and security services are using the aid as intended domestically while actively supporting U.S. efforts to stabilize Afghanistan and combat regional insurgent and terrorist elements. Existing aid restrictions and the certification process required for greater accountability on the part of Pakistan continue to be under scrutiny.", "A number of current laws restrict or place conditions on certain aid to Pakistan. Others require the President, the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of State to certify that Pakistan meets specific criteria to receive U.S. aid. Criteria include that the implementing agency is qualified to manage the funds; that the Pakistani government has agreed to clear, achievable goals; that it is meeting human rights goals; and that the country is making progress in achieving U.S. aid objectives and is cooperating with the United States in combating terrorist networks and securing its nuclear weapons. Reporting requirements often are included. Current law includes authority for the President to waive certification requirements in the interest of U.S. national security.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2013 (H.R. 4310), which became P.L. 112-239 in January 2013, limits FY2013 Coalition Support Fund reimbursements to Pakistan to $1.2 billion and prohibits reimbursements for the period (November 2011-July 2012) when Pakistan barred NATO from transiting along its Ground Lines of Communication linking Afghanistan with the Arabian Sea. The act also includes a measure to extend the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) through FY2013. Disbursement of PCF requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to certify that Pakistan is demonstrating efforts to counter improvised explosive devices, is cooperating on counterterrorism efforts, and is not detaining Pakistani citizens, including Dr. Shakil Afridi, as a result of their cooperation with the U.S. government on counterterrorism efforts. The Secretary of Defense may waive this certification requirement in the interest of U.S. national security.", "Pending bills include measures that would preclude or limit CSF reimbursements and require certification by the Secretary of Defense for disbursement of these funds; another would limit assistance to $50 million in agricultural or medical supplies to five countries that might seek to do harm to Americans or its allies, Pakistan among them.", "This report provides a list of existing laws and pending legislation containing conditions, limitations, and reporting requirements for U.S. foreign assistance to Pakistan. It will track the debate on this topic and resulting changes. For broader discussion of U.S.-Pakistan relations, see CRS Report R41832, Pakistan-U.S. Relations, by K. A. Kronstadt.

In May 2013, Pakistan conducted scheduled national elections to seat new National and Provincial Assemblies. The exercise was itself historic as an unprecedented transfer of power from one elected government to another. The right-leaning, conservative Pakistan Muslim League faction led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (PML-N) won an unexpectedly strong victory that includes a simple majority in the National Assembly as well as continued control of Punjab, where the bulk of Pakistan's citizens reside. The incumbent Pakistan People's Party suffered a major defeat and is relegated to opposition status at the federal level, although it retained control of the Sindh government.\u00a0The newly formidable Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) part\u2014led by Imran Khan, a strident critic of Pakistan's cooperation with the United States\u2014now heads a coalition government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In June, Sharif began his third non-consecutive term as Prime Minister. Although the elections were marked by violence and some reports of rigging, their conduct was welcomed by the U.S. and other international governments as an important step in Pakistan's democratization process. Analysts do not anticipate any major adjustments in the U.S.-Pakistan relationship in the near- or middle-term and Sharif's priorities\u2014resolving Pakistan's energy crisis and reversing its economic decline\u2014track well with the central goals of the U.S. assistance program.", "Following the May 2011 U.S. commando raid in Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden, already troubled U.S.-Pakistani relations soured, prompting the 112 th Congress to consider new restrictions on, or even elimination of, the billions of annual assistance dollars currently being provided. Since the raid, U.S.-Pakistani military cooperation has been disrupted and clouded by increased mutual distrust; Islamabad has significantly reduced the number of U.S. military trainers allowed in the country, and the Obama Administration indicated that deliveries of certain security-related financial transfers and other aid are under suspension. A November 2011 incident near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border left two dozen Pakistani soldiers dead after their posts came under fire from NATO forces; the event further disrupted relations.", "A significant shift in the Obama Administration's public statements on U.S. relations with Pakistan was suggested in September 2011 when Admiral Mike Mullen, the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In that hearing, both explicitly accused Pakistan's main intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), of supporting Haqqani Network insurgents who engage in attacks on U.S. targets in Afghanistan. When asked by a committee member whether he supported a move in Congress to further condition U.S. aid to Pakistan, Secretary Panetta replied, \"Anything that makes clear to them that we cannot tolerate their providing this kind of safe haven to the Haqqanis, and that they have to take action\u2014any signal that we can send to them\u2014I think would be important to do.\" ", "Weeks later, however, President Barack Obama stated in a press conference, \"We could not have been as successful as we have been without the cooperation of the Pakistan government. And so on a whole range of issues, they have been an effective partner with us,\" adding, \"[W]e will constantly evaluate our relationship with Pakistan\" in the context of U.S. interests. The Administration's scrutiny of the relationship has continued since, especially in light of increased congressional attention following the tumultuous events of 2011. Yet its fundamental support for a continued large-scale assistance program is unchanged. During an April 2013 House hearing on the Administration's FY2014 foreign affairs budget proposal, newly seated Secretary of State John Kerry was asked about ending all foreign assistance to Pakistan. His reply: \"Cutting off aid to Pakistan would\u2014would not be a good move, certainly at this point in time, for a lot of different reasons. We are working with Pakistan with respect to nuclear safety and nonproliferation. We are working with Pakistan to get our supplies both in and out of Afghanistan.\"", "At the same time that the Administration expressed serious displeasure with Pakistan, the United States responded in FY2011 and FY2012 with more than $110 million in humanitarian aid to a September 2011 disaster due to flooding there. Previously, the United States had provided about $600 million in disaster and refugee assistance for the widespread summer 2010 Pakistan floods. More recently, in September 2012 and February 2013, the Administration waived certification requirements to allow for continued transfers of major defense equipment. The latter waiver was taken as a signal that the bilateral security relationship was being substantively renewed after a nearly two-year-long period of estrangement.", "While numerous concerns exist about whether Pakistan can be accountable in how it uses U.S. aid and whether it is capable of being a reliable U.S. partner in combating terrorism, many experts believe that key U.S. strategic interests are inextricably linked with a stable Pakistan and region. They emphasize the importance of maintaining close bilateral engagement with Pakistan, including providing assistance, to promote stability and contribute to U.S. national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Law", "paragraphs": ["Over past decades Congress has expressed concern with the U.S.-Pakistan relationship and has placed limitations and reporting requirements on U.S. aid to Pakistan in both authorization and appropriation laws.
