Such declarations open the way for a wide range of federal resources to be madeavailable to assist in dealing with the emergency or major disaster involved. The Stafford Actstructure for the declaration process reflects the fact that federal resources under this act supplementstate and local resources for disaster relief and recovery. Except in the case of an emergencyinvolving a subject area that is exclusively or preeminently in the federal purview, the Governor ofan affected state, or Acting Governor if the Governor is not available, must request such adeclaration by the President.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended, 42U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5121 et seq. , is designed to provide a means by which the federal government maysupplement state and local resources in major disasters or emergencies where those state and localresources have been or will be overwhelmed. The Act provides separate but similar mechanisms fordeclaration of a major disaster and for declaration of an emergency. Except to the extent that anemergency involves primarily federal interests, both declarations of major disaster and declarationsof emergency must be triggered by a request to the President from the Governor of the affected state. The pertinent provisions with respect to such declarations are set forth in Section 401 of the StaffordAct, 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5170, with respect to major disasters declarations and in Section 501 of the StaffordAct, 42 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 5191, with respect to emergency declarations: ", "\u00c2\u00a7 5170. Procedure fordeclaration", "All requests for a declaration by the President that amajor disaster exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State. Such a request shall bebased on a finding that the disaster is of such severity and magnitude that effective response isbeyond the capabilities of the State and the affected local governments and that Federal assistanceis necessary. As part of such request, and as a prerequisite to major disaster assistance under thischapter, the Governor shall take appropriate response action under State law and direct executionof the State's emergency plan. The Governor shall furnish information on the nature and amount ofState and local resources which have been or will be committed to alleviating the results of thedisaster, and shall certify that, for the current disaster, State and local government obligations andexpenditures (of which State commitments must be a significant proportion) will comply with allapplicable cost-sharing requirements of this chapter. Based on the request of a Governor under thissection, the President may declare under this chapter that a major disaster or emergency exists. (1)", "\u00c2\u00a7 5191. Procedure fordeclaration", "(a) Request anddeclaration", "All requests for a declaration by the President that anemergency exists shall be made by the Governor of the affected State. Such a request shall be basedon a finding that the situation is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond thecapabilities of the State and the affected local governments and that Federal assistance is necessary.As a part of such request, and as a prerequisite to emergency assistance under this chapter, theGovernor shall take appropriate action under State law and direct execution of the State's emergencyplan. The Governor shall furnish information describing the State and local efforts and resourceswhich have been or will be used to alleviate the emergency, and will define the type and extent ofFederal aid required. Based upon such Governor's request, the President may declare that anemergency exists.", "(b) Certain emergencies involving Federal primaryresponsibility", "The President mayexercise any authority vested in him by section 5192 of this title or section 5193 of this title withrespect to an emergency when he determines that an emergency exists for which the primaryresponsibility for response rests with the United States because the emergency involves a subject areafor which, under the Constitution or laws of the United States, the United States exercises exclusiveor preeminent responsibility and authority. In determining whether or not such an emergency exists,the President shall consult the Governor of any affected State, if practicable. The President'sdetermination may be made without regard to subsection (a) of this section. (2)", "When an incident occurs or is imminent which the state official responsible for disasteroperations determines may exceed state and local response capabilities, the state will request theFEMA Regional Director to perform a joint FEMA-state preliminary damage assessment (PDA). This provides a means to determine the impact and magnitude of damage and resulting unmet needsof individuals, businesses, the public sector, and the affected community as a whole. Informationcollected in this way is used by the state as a basis for the Governor's request for a presidentialproclamation and by FEMA to document its recommendation to the President in response to theGovernor's request. The requirement for a joint PDA may be waived for those incidents of unusualseverity and magnitude that do not require field damage assessments to determine that supplementalfederal assistance will be needed, or in other situations determined by the Regional Director inconsultation with the State. An assessment may still be needed to determine unmet needs formanagerial response purposes. (3) ", "Once a request from the Governor of an affected state is received by the FEMA RegionalDirector whose region covers that state, the Regional Director provides a written acknowledgmentof receipt of the request. Based on the joint PDA(s) and consultation with appropriate state andfederal officials and other interested parties, the Regional Director then promptly prepares asummary of the PDA findings. An analysis of this information, including an examination of stateand local resources and capabilities and other assistance available to meet the needs associated withthe emergency or major disaster, is submitted with a recommendation to the Director of the RecoveryDivision of FEMA. (4) Based on available information, the Director of FEMA makes a recommendation on the Governor'srequest to the President. A major disaster recommendation is based upon a finding that the situationis or is not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and localgovernments. It also contains a determination of whether or not supplemental federal Stafford Actassistance is necessary and appropriate. (5) An emergency recommendation is based on a report indicatingwhether or not federal emergency assistance is necessary to supplement state and local efforts to savelives, protect property and public health and safety, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe. FEMA will only recommend an emergency declaration if it has been determined that all otherresources and authorities to meet the crisis are inadequate and that Stafford Act emergency assistancewould be appropriate. A modified federal emergency recommendation would be made based on areport as to whether an emergency does or does not exist for which Stafford Act emergencyassistance would be appropriate. Such a recommendation would not be forthcoming in situationswhere the authority to respond or coordinate is within the jurisdiction of one or more federalagencies without a Presidential declaration. A modified federal emergency recommendation byFEMA for an emergency declaration by the President would not be foreclosed by other federalagency involvement if there are significant unmet needs of sufficient severity and magnitude, notaddressed by other assistance, which could appropriately be addressed under the Stafford Act. (6) ", "The President may respond to a Governor's request for a declaration of a major disaster bya declaration of an emergency, a declaration of a major disaster, or a denial of the request. Inresponse to a Governor's request for a declaration of emergency, the President's options are limitedto declaration of an emergency or denial of the request. (7) A denial of a declaration request may be appealed within 30 daysof the date of the denial letter, submitted with additional information to the President through theRegional Director. (8) Anextension of the time limit may be sought within the 30 day time frame from the Director of theRecovery Division upon written request citing the reasons for the delay. (9) ", "Once the decision is made, the FEMA Director or his or her designee must promptly notifythe Governor. If the President has declared a major disaster or an emergency, FEMA must alsonotify other federal agencies and interested parties. Following either type of declaration, theRegional Director or Director of the Recovery Division (10) is to promptly notify the Governor of the designations ofassistance and of the areas eligible for such assistance. (11) The determinations of the types of assistance to be madeavailable and the areas eligible to receive such assistance are made by the Director of the RecoveryDivision of FEMA.

(16) ", "If the Governor so requests, the Director of the Recovery Division of FEMA (17) may lend or advance to thestate, either for its own use or for the use of public or private nonprofit applicants for disasterassistance under the Stafford Act, the portion of assistance for which the state or other eligibledisaster assistance applicant is responsible under the cost-sharing provisions (18) in any case in which:", "(1) The State or other eligible disaster assistanceapplicant is unable to assume their financial responsibility under such cost sharing provisions:", "(i) As a resultof concurrent,multiple majordisasters in ajurisdiction, or", "(ii) Afterincurringextraordinarycosts as aresult of aparticulardisaster;", "(2) The damagescaused by such disasters or disaster are so overwhelming and severe that it is not possible for theState or other eligible disaster assistance applicant to immediately assume their financialresponsibility under the Act; and", "(3) The State and theother eligible disaster applicants are not delinquent in payment of any debts to FEMA incurred asa result of Presidentially declared major disasters or emergencies.", "Such loans must be repaid to the United States with interest, and the Governor must include arepayment schedule as part of the request for the advance.
