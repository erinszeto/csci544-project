In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) declared that evidence of global warming was \"unequivocal.\" It concluded that \"[m]ost of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic [human-related] greenhouse gas [GHG] concentrations.\"", "The IPCC concluded that human activities have markedly increased atmospheric concentrations of \"greenhouse gases\" (GHG), including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and gases (such as chlorofluorocarbons, CFC) that are controlled under the Montreal Protocol to protect the stratospheric ozone layer. From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, CO2 has risen from about 280 parts per million (ppm) to about 386 ppm today (up 38%). The concentration of CO2 is higher now than in at least 800,000 years before present.", "Additional human influences on the climate that are not easily compared to GHG emissions could, nonetheless, be managed to moderate regional and global climate change. These include tropospheric ozone pollution (i.e., smog), particulate and aerosol emissions, and land cover change. New chemicals, such as nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), also may play a small role.", "Without radical changes globally from current policies and economic trajectories, experts uniformly expect that GHG emissions will continue to grow and lead to continued warming of the Earth's climate. Experts disagree, however, on the timing, magnitude and patterns of future climate changes. In the absence of concerted climate change mitigation policies, for a wide range of plausible GHG scenarios to 2100, the IPCC projected \"best guess\" increases in global average temperatures from 1.8oC to 4.0oC (3.2oF to 7.2oF). Although these temperature changes may seem small, they compare to the current global, annual average temperature of around 14oC (57oF). While precipitation overall is expected to increase, its distribution may become more uneven: regions that now are dry are likely to get drier, while regions that now are wet, are likely to get wetter. Extreme precipitation and droughts are expected to become more frequent. Experts project that warming ocean waters will expand, and melting glaciers and ice sheets will further add to sea level rise. The Arctic Ocean could become ice free in summers within a few decades. Ocean salinity is expected to fall, and the Meridional Overturning Circulation in the Atlantic Ocean could slow, reducing ocean productivity and altering regional climates in both North America and Europe. The climate would continue changing for hundreds of years after GHG concentrations were stabilized, according to most models. There are also possibilities of abrupt changes in the state of the climate system, with unpredictable and potentially catastrophic consequences. Much concern is focused now, among scientists and economists, about the likelihoods and implications of exceeding such thresholds of abrupt change, sometimes called \"tipping points.\"", "This report summarizes highlights of scientific research and assessments related to human-induced climate change.

Precipitation has increased over the past century, although some regions have become wetter and some have become drier, consistent with scientists' understanding of how heightened greenhouse gas concentrations affect climate regionally. Observed increases in ocean temperatures, altered wind patterns, extreme weather events, melting glaciers and sea ice, and timing of seasons are also attributed in part to greenhouse gas forcing.

Some influences are natural and some are very likely human-related. At regional and local scales, climate is generally even more variable. This illustrates the caution that should be exercised in trying to detect changes in trends in the context of variability. One or a series of hot or cool years, or a few extreme weather events, do not necessarily represent more than normal climate variability. For example, better scientific understanding of natural phenomena like La Nina, and solar variability have helped scientists to understand their cooling influence on global average temperatures since the year 2000, or the impact of El Nino on the extreme high temperature of 1998.

Some scientists have expressed concern that recently observed sea ice loss may have passed a \"threshold\" or a spiral of warming feedbacks. Melting ice in the Arctic would contribute very little to global sea level rise because it already floats, with its volume already displacing sea water; however, it contributes to concern because of the impact loss of Arctic sea ice would have in warming Arctic waters and atmosphere, and consequent effects on warming and melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet", "paragraphs": ["Between 1979 and 2005, the area of Greenland that melted on at least one day per year grew by 42%, while the mean temperature rose by 2.4 o C.

Beginning in the late 1990s, ice flows from two of Greenland's biggest glaciers that flow into the ocean accelerated rapidly, surprising scientists at the speed of change. The lack of prediction of the phenomenon contributed to the IPCC's decision not to include the contribution of ice sheet melting in its projections of sea level rise due to global warming in the 21 st Century. The high melting rates in 2005 startled many scientists and raised major concerns about the potential impacts on sea level rise. Some scientists have argued that policy goals to address climate change should avoid passing certain \"tipping points\" of the climate system that could have potentially catastrophic impacts, naming melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet on one of these thresholds.

In another 2007 study, the British Antarctic survey found that 300 glaciers studied increased their average flow rate by 12% from 1993 to 2003. This was attributed to thinning of the lower glaciers at the edge of the sea, allowing the glaciers above them to flow faster, similar to phenomena observed in Greenland.

Risks of abrupt, perhaps unidentified climate changes in aspects of the environment, with accompanying dislocations, are expected to increase as global average temperature increases, and could push natural and socio-economic systems past key thresholds. An example that recently occurred is the rapid and widespread infestation of beetles in western North America. Such changes could precipitate major reorganization of ecosystems, and under some circumstances, stresses on nearby or dependent human systems. ", "Impacts on water resources are expected to be among the most serious due to climate change, combined with rising demand and management issues in many regions. Earlier melting of snowpack and ice in some regions (e.g., the Andes, the U.S. West) and loss of ice and snow would reduce water supply to settlements that now depend on the snowmelt, and change the seasonality of water supply. Snowfall in some regions is expected to increase, however, with greater atmospheric moisture.", "One CCSP assessment examined the implications of projected sea level rise, with emphasis on the U.S. mid-Atlantic region. It concluded:", "Today, rising sea levels are submerging low-lying lands, eroding beaches, converting wetlands to open water, exacerbating coastal flooding, and increasing the salinity of estuaries and freshwater aquifers. Other impacts of climate change, coastal development, and natural coastal processes also contribute to these impacts. In undeveloped or less developed coastal areas where human influence is minimal, ecosystems and geological systems can sometimes shift upward and landward with the rising water levels. Coastal development, including buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, are less mobile and more vulnerable. Vulnerability to an accelerating rate of sea-level rise is compounded by the high population density along the coast, the possibility of other effects of climate change, and the susceptibility of coastal regions to storms and environmental stressors, such as drought or invasive species.", "Agriculture in many regions, especially in the tropics, may experience losses of productivity, especially where higher temperatures coincide with increased dryness and limits on irrigation. The general shift upward in growing season temperatures could raise typical temperatures to or above those considered extreme today. Agriculture may also confront challenges from invasive species, including pests. One 2008 study examined four key pests of maize in the United States with climate change. It projected increased winter survival and expanded ranges of all four pests, especially of the corn earworm, which may be resistant to insecticides. The authors concluded that even with pest management adaptations, the effects of climate change could increase seed and insecticide costs, decrease yields and alter crop yield variability. ", "In 2008, a number of studies highlighted risks to human health with climate change, and at least one study found potential benefits of reduced cold weather mortality. Raised risks and adaptation costs could be associated with increased diarrhoeal disease, renal disease, heat stress, malaria, cholera, malnutrition, and respiratory and other health effects associated with elevated ozone and particulate air pollution due to higher temperatures, among other concerns.", "Effects on, and concerns about, mental health have been raised by several studies, especially associated with projected increases in extreme weather events.", "One 2008 study found potential for higher temperatures to result in lower ratios of male to female births and reduced male longevity in humans, at least in Nordic countries. ", "As the degree and distribution of climate changes continue, ranges of species are likely to change. Climate change is highly likely to create substantial changes in ecological systems and services in some locations, and may lead to ecological surprises. The disappearance of some types of climate also raises risks of extinctions of species, especially those with narrow geographic or climatic distributions, and where existing communities disintegrate. One study projected that, under the highest IPCC emissions scenario, 12% to 39% of the Earth's land areas may experience novel climates (i.e., climate conditions not existing now) while 10% to 48% of land areas' climates may disappear by 2100 AD. In the lowest IPCC climate change scenarios, 4% to 20% of land areas gain novel climates and 4% to 20% see existing climates disappear.", "Because climate change will occur with different magnitudes and characteristics in different regions, resulting dislocations and disparities across locations are expected to increase pressure on international aid and migration, with possible implications for political stability and security. Impacts may be alleviated with investments in adaptation. Adaptation as a strategy, however, is thought to be more challenging and potentially less effective the more widespread, uncertain and severe the climate changes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

Afterwards, temperature projections increasingly depend on specific emission scenarios.\" (p.\u00a06)", "\"Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change.\" (p. 13)", "\"The uptake of anthropogenic carbon since 1750 has led to the ocean becoming more acidic....

Modelling studies show global carbon prices rising to 20-80 US$/tCO2-eq by 2030 are consistent with stabilisation at around 550 ppm CO 2 -eq by 2100. For the same stabilisation level, induced technological change may lower these price ranges to 5-65 US$/tCO2-eq in 2030.\" (p. 18)", "\"All assessed stabilisation scenarios indicate that 60-80% of the reductions would come from energy supply and use, and industrial processes, with energy efficiency playing a key role in many scenarios. Including non- CO 2 and CO 2 land-use and forestry mitigation options provides greater flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Low stabilisation levels require early investments and substantially more rapid diffusion and commercialisation of advanced low emissions technologies. Without substantial investment flows and effective technology transfer, it may be difficult to achieve emission reduction at a significant scale.

Peer-reviewed estimates of the social cost of carbon in 2005 average US$12 per tonne of CO 2 , but the range from 100 estimates is large (-$3 to $95/t CO 2 ). This is due in large part to differences in assumptions regarding climate sensitivity, response lags, the treatment of risk and equity, economic and non-economic impacts, the inclusion of potentially catastrophic losses, and discount rates. Aggregate estimates of costs mask significant differences in impacts across sectors, regions and populations and very likely underestimate damage costs because they cannot include many non-quantifiable impacts.\" (p. 23)", "\"Choices about the scale and timing of GHG mitigation involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emission reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term climate risks of delay.\" (p. 23)"], "subsections": []}]}]}}
