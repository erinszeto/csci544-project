Section 4205 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended) amended the FDA's nutrition labeling authorities under the FFDCA to require nutrition labeling of foods sold in some chain restaurants and vending machines, both of which were previously exempt from the FDA's nutrition labeling regulations. While the ACA provided general requirements for restaurant menu nutrition labeling, it required the FDA to promulgate regulations specifying the scope of entities affected by the law, the scope of food covered by the law, and certain details regarding how the required calorie and nutrition information is conveyed to consumers.", "The FDA's proposed rule on nutrition labeling in restaurants and similar retail food establishments (SRFE), published in April 2011, proposed definitions for a number of terms that are not defined in law. It proposed two options for determining the entities affected by the rule, set requirements for covered restaurants and SRFE to implement the rule, provided details for voluntary registration of establishments that are not covered by the rule but that elect to be subject to the requirements of the rule, proposed an effective date, and outlined enforcement mechanisms for establishments that fail to comply. The comment period on the proposed rule ended on July 5, 2011. The FDA is currently finalizing the rule, and the agency has indicated that it expects to issue the final rule in November 2012.", "Several potential concerns for Congress have been emphasized regarding implementation of the proposed rule. First is the scope of the entities affected by the rule. The second is the food that will require calorie and nutrient information under the rule. Other related concerns include the presentation of calorie and nutrient information and the amount of time businesses will have to implement the rule. Some Members of Congress are concerned that the FDA's proposed rule reaches beyond congressional intent and the agency's authority, and have introduced legislation that would limit the scope of the FDA's proposed rule.", "This report provides a brief overview of the FDA's authority to regulate nutrition labeling, modifications to these authorities under the ACA, and a discussion of selected aspects of the proposed rule.

Although many factors contribute to an individual's weight, the basic cause of weight gain is an excess of energy intake over energy expenditure. At the population level, this has been reflected in indicators of decreased physical activity and increased calorie consumption. In adults, obesity is associated with a number of other health problems, including diabetes and high blood pressure. These health issues disproportionately affect low-income individuals and certain minorities. ", "The federal government has sought to address these health concerns using a variety of approaches, including programs (e.g., the \"Let's Move\" campaign) and legislation (e.g., the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act) that promote nutrition, healthy weight, and physical activity. At the state and local level, lawmakers have also proposed a variety of approaches, including taxation and prohibition of high-calorie items, and requiring calorie labeling of restaurant food. ", "Studies have shown that the number of calories consumed by individuals in the United States has risen concurrent with rising rates of obesity. The number of overall calories consumed has increased from a daily average of 1,875 calories during 1977-1978 to 2,067 calories during 2005-2008. Increasingly, these calories are consumed outside the home. Recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) show that 32% of Americans' calorie intake from 2005-2008 came from foods consumed outside the home, including foods consumed in restaurants and school cafeterias. ", "Consumers tend to underestimate the number of calories in restaurant meals. In one study, lunchtime customers at a fast food restaurant underestimated the calorie content of their lunch by 23%. Calorie labeling on menus has been adopted as one approach to making consumers aware of the amount of calories they are consuming. Calorie labeling on menus has been shown to change consumer behavior\u2014for example, in one study, consumers were less likely to choose higher-calorie items when provided with calorie information on the restaurant menu. ", "Restaurant menu labeling as a policy option for obesity prevention has garnered broad support from the public health community. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have deemed menu labeling a \"winnable battle,\" and the approach is supported by the American Heart Association, the American Medical Association, and others. Additionally, this approach has gained popularity with policymakers at the state and local level. Menu labeling laws have been enacted in New York City, California, and several other jurisdictions. ", "For the restaurant industry, state and local regulations have resulted in variable and sometimes conflicting requirements. For example, the California menu labeling law, enacted in 2008, requires restaurants with 20 or more locations in the state to post caloric content, carbohydrates, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium content. The New Jersey menu labeling law, enacted in 2010, requires chain restaurants with 20 or more locations nationally to display calorie content for all items sold on all drive-thru and indoor menu boards. New York City, perhaps the most widely publicized example, enacted legislation in 2008 to require restaurants that are part of a chain with 15 or more locations nationally to post calorie content. While these differences may seem subtle to policy makers, the restaurant industry has made it clear that complying with varying local laws and regulations is more burdensome than complying with uniform national standards would be. ", "New research on nutrition labeling of menus and menu boards suggests this approach may be successful in helping consumers lower their overall calorie intake. In one study in New York City, one in six fast food consumers reported using the posted calorie information, and those customers also purchased 106 fewer calories of food than those who did not use the posted calorie information. In King County, Washington, researchers found that the nutrition labeling law affected restaurants' behavior as well. They found that calorie content, saturated fat, and sodium were lower in entrees at chain restaurants within 18 months of implementation of a county-wide nutrition labeling regulation. However, because these laws and regulations are fairly recent, the long-term impact of state and local menu labeling regulations on population level obesity rates has not been widely studied. ", "One indirect consequence of variable state and local regulations regarding restaurant menu labeling is the advent of restaurant industry support for a national menu labeling policy. Major industry groups such as the National Restaurant Association supported inclusion of a restaurant menu labeling provision in the ACA. ", "In advance of the FDA's final rule on the national menu labeling law, some establishments have moved forward with menu nutrition labeling. McDonald's, the largest fast food company in the United States, announced in September 2012 that it would list calorie information on all restaurant and drive-thru menu boards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA's Authority to Regulate Nutrition Labeling", "paragraphs": ["Federal responsibility for food safety and food labeling rests primarily with the FDA and the Department of Agriculture (USDA).

", "The 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) granted FDA the authority to regulate food products and their ingredients. FDA's authority over nutrition labeling of those products was created by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA), which amended Section 403 of the FFDCA (to provide the FDA with the authority to require and regulate nutrition labeling), and added a new Section 403A (to preempt state and local nutrition labeling regulations). The ACA further amended these sections to provide FDA the authority to regulate nutrition labeling of restaurants, similar retail food establishments (SRFE), and vending machine operators that are part of a chain of 20 or more. This section provides an overview of the statutory authorities of the FDA that are relevant to this issue, and how those authorities were amended by the ACA. ", "The FDA is authorized to create nutrition labeling requirements for most foods, and to regulate nutrient content claims and health claims on food labels. Under the FFDCA, FDA may deem foods misbranded unless health and nutrition claims are made according to FDA regulations. Introduction of misbranded food into commerce, misbranding of food that is in commerce, or receipt and delivery of misbranded food in commerce are prohibited. There are a number of conditions under which a food would be deemed misbranded, including if its label is \"false or misleading.\" ", "Generally, the FDA relies on food companies to voluntarily recall misbranded products, either on their own initiative or upon regulators' request. However, the agency does have the authority to pursue other enforcement actions against regulated firms, individuals, and products that fail to comply with the FFDCA. These actions include warning letters, seizures, injunctions, civil monetary penalties, and prosecution. ", "The FFDCA requires all food regulated by the FDA to bear labeling with the serving size, total calories per serving, total calories per serving derived from fat, and the amount of various nutrients. It also provides the Secretary the authority to remove or otherwise change nutrient information requirements by regulation. The FDA has the authority to further specify requirements for the layout and design of the label to assist consumers. The FFDCA has provisions regarding its preemption of state and local nutrition labeling laws. ", "The FFDCA provides several exemptions from nutrition labeling requirements. Infant formula and medical foods, which are subject to other labeling requirements, are exempt from the nutrition labeling requirements. Foods in packaging that is too small to comply with the required information, food that contains insignificant amounts of all the nutrients required to be listed, and foods offered by an individual who has grossed less than $500,000 from food sales (or who grosses less than $50,000 annually in food sales) unless the individual makes a health or nutrition claim for that food are also exempt. Foods with insignificant amounts of more than one-half the required nutrients may use a simplified labeling format. ", "Prior to passage of the ACA, two other categories of food were also exempt from nutrition labeling requirements. These categories were (1) food \"which is served in restaurants or other establishments in which food is served for immediate human consumption or which is sold for sale or used in such establishments,\" and (2) food \"which is processed and prepared primarily in a retail establishment, which is ready for human consumption, which is the type described\" in (1) and \"which is offered for sale to consumers but not for immediate consumption in such establishment and which is not offered for sale outside such establishment.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nutrition Labeling of Restaurant Menus", "paragraphs": ["As noted, prior to passage of the ACA, restaurant-type food and food from vending machines were exempt from nutrition labeling authorities in the FFDCA.

Current law also allows restaurants, SRFE, and vending machine operators who are not subject to the requirements of the law to voluntarily register to be subject to these requirements. ", "Section 4205 of the ACA amended Section 403(q) of the FFDCA, regarding nutrition labeling requirements, and Section 403A of the FFDCA, regarding federal preemption of state and local food labeling requirements. It amended the FFDCA to newly require nutrition labeling for standard menu items offered for sale in chain restaurants or SRFE with 20 or more locations, doing business under the same name regardless of the type of ownership of the locations, and that offer substantially the same menu items. Under the amended law, restaurants and SRFE are required to disclose the number of calories in each item \"as usually prepared and offered for sale,\" and provide a statement on suggested total daily caloric intake \"in a clear and conspicuous manner\" on menus and menu boards. Additionally, the law requires restaurants and SRFE to make other specified nutrition information available to consumers in writing upon request, and to provide a prominent, clear, and conspicuous statement on the menu or menu board regarding the availability of this information. The law also requires restaurants and SRFE to provide calorie information adjacent to self-service food (i.e., salad bars, buffet lines, and cafeteria lines).", "Section 4205 required that nutrient content disclosures have a \"reasonable basis,\" such as nutrient databases, cookbooks, or laboratory analyses. The law requires HHS to establish standards for determining and disclosing the nutrient content for standard menu items that come in different flavors, varieties, or combinations, but are listed as a single menu item (i.e., \"combo meals\").

They have argued for the narrower definition of the term that does not include supermarkets as SRFE, which the FDA has acknowledged as less burdensome.

Some have argued that congressional intent in drafting the provision that was eventually enacted as part of the ACA was not to broaden the scope of those laws. The original sponsors of the bill disagree. However, as many grocers and other business owners have increased their share of the market in sales of restaurant-type food, one question for policymakers is whether the inclusion of supermarkets and convenience stores is instrumental to the effectiveness of the menu labeling law.

Increases in weight are linked to increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and several forms of cancer. Additionally, it has been documented that obesity leads to decreased productivity, in terms of increased absenteeism as well as what researchers deem \"presenteeism\" (decreased outputs while at work). ", "The estimated societal cost of obesity has been estimated in multiple studies; however, these estimates are not precise. Obesity burdens the health care system, and many of those costs fall to government. Obesity accounts for approximately 1% to 10% of a country's total health care costs, and obese individuals have medical costs that are 30% higher than individuals of normal weight. A recent study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), estimated that the annual medical cost of obesity was as high as $78.5 billion in 1998, or about 10% of medical spending. Of that amount, roughly half of the cost was financed by Medicare and Medicaid. The authors estimated that cost may have risen to as much as $147 billion in 2008. ", "The true cost and savings from any obesity prevention policy is challenging to determine\u2014just as the factors that contribute to obesity are complex, researchers cannot isolate the effect of one specific policy relative to other interventions. In order to determine the effectiveness of an intervention such as menu labeling, researchers and policy makers may review the impact of these policies on individuals' behavior and monitor changes in the obesity rate over time, while taking into account other factors that may also account for those changes, including the time needed for weight loss and obesity prevention programs to yield an effect, particularly on chronic disease costs."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
