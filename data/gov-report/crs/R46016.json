Key regional findings and country reports are available in English (BTI publishes the full regional report in German). BTI 2018 evaluates the quality of democracy, a market economy, and political management in 129 developing and transition countries. For political transformation specifically, BTI ranks countries using 18 indicators grouped into five criteria: (1) stateness, (2) political participation, (3) rule of law, (4) stability of democratic institutions, and (5) political and social integration. Based on the criteria, BTI assigns a category: democracy in consolidation, defective democracy, highly defective democracy, moderate autocracy , and hardline autocracy . In its regional report, BTI notes that since 2008, it \"has recorded a decline in the quality of democracy in Latin America\u00e2\u0080\u0094not dramatic, but continual.\" BTI evaluates all Central and South American nations.

Since 2006, EIU has produced a democracy index that provides an annual snapshot of the state of democracy for 165 independent states and two territories. The EIU classifies countries as full democracies , flawed democracies , hybrid regimes , or authoritarian regimes based on an aggregate score of 60 indicators in five categories: (1) electoral process and pluralism, (2) civil liberties, (3) the functioning of government, (4) political participation, and (5) political culture. According to the EIU's Democracy Index 2018 , the Latin America and Caribbean region's overall score went down from 6.26 in 2017 to 6.24 in 2018 (on a 0 to 10 scale). The two countries in the region classified in 2018 as full democracies are Uruguay and, new to the group, Costa Rica. EIU's Democracy Index 2018 identified three countries in the region as authoritarian regimes: Nicaragua moved to join Venezuela and Cuba. EIU evaluates all Central and South American nations. With the exceptions of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, EIU does not evaluate Caribbean nations.", "Freedom House is a U.S.-based NGO that conducts research on democracy, political freedom, and human rights worldwide. It has published Freedom in the World since 1978, and the current report covers 195 countries and 14 territories. Freedom House assigns each country 0 to 4 points on 25 indicators (10 political rights indicators and 15 civil liberties indicators) for a total of up to 100 points. The scores determine numerical ratings for political rights and civil liberties freedoms on a scale of 1 (most free) to 7 (least free). The political rights and civil liberties ratings are averaged to produce an overall status of free, partly free , or not free. Freedom House's report covering 2018 found that Nicaragua was the country with the greatest decline in the world regarding conditions for political rights and civil liberties as compared to 2017. Venezuela had the third-greatest decline; Brazil, El Salvador, and Guatemala also made the top 20 for steepest declines. The report's analysis is based on data that are detailed in full on the Freedom House web page on \"Countries,\" which ranks the state of democracy for 197 countries and 15 territories. This web page lists the top three aggregate scores in Latin America and the Caribbean: Uruguay, Barbados, and Chile; the region's lowest aggregate scores are those for Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Cuba.

V-Dem groups 179 countries into four categories: liberal democracy , electoral democracy , electoral autocracy , and closed autocracy .
