No such entitlement or \"right\" is provided to retirees or their dependents. Instead, retirees and their dependents may be given medical and dental care, subject to the same space-available limitations. This language gives active duty personnel and their dependents priority in receiving medical and dental care at any facility of the uniformed services over military members entitled to receive retired pay and their dependents. The policy of providing active duty dependents priority over retirees in the receipt of medical and dental care in any facility of the uniformed services has existed in law since at least September 2, 1958 (P.L. 85-861).", "Since the establishment of TRICARE and pursuant to the Defense Authorization Act of FY1996 ( P.L. 104-106 ), DOD has established the following basic priorities (with certain special provisions):", "Priority 1: Active-duty servicemembers;", "Priority 2: Active-duty family members who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;", "Priority 3: Retirees, their family members and survivors who are enrolled in TRICARE Prime;", "Priority 4: Active-duty family members who are not enrolled in TRICARE Prime;", "Priority 5: All other eligible persons.", "The priority is given to active duty dependents to help them obtain care easily, and thus make it possible for active duty members to perform their military service without worrying about health care for their dependents. This is particularly important for active duty personnel who may be assigned overseas or aboard ship and separated from their dependents. As retirees are not subject to such imposed separations, they are considered to be in a better position to see that their dependents receive care, if care cannot be provided in a military facility. Thus, the role of health care delivery recognizes the unique needs of the military mission. The role of health care in the military is qualitatively different, and, therefore, not necessarily comparable to the civilian sector.", "The benefits available to servicemembers or retirees, which require comparatively little or no contributions from the beneficiaries themselves, are considered by some to be a more generous benefit package than is available to civil servants or to most people in the private sector.

DOD estimates that care provided to retirees and their dependents will make up over 65% of DOD health care costs by 2015, up from 43% in 1999. A recent CBO analysis concludes that this increasing proportion of retirees participating in TRICARE is driven by \"low out-of-pocket expenses for TRICARE beneficiaries (many of whose copayments, deductibles, and maximum annual out-of-pocket payments have remained unchanged or have decreased since the mid-1990s), combined with increased costs of alternative sources of health insurance coverage.\" In addition, CBO found that TRICARE beneficiaries use both inpatient and outpatient care at rates significantly higher than people with other insurance, due to low out-of-pocket costs and other factors.", "DOD proposed new fees and cost-sharing increases for retiree TRICARE plans in their FY2013 budget submission.
