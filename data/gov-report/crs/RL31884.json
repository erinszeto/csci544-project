The Secretary of Defense or the Secretary's designee within the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was authorized to request posthumous citizenship with permission from the next-of-kin. The law also expanded immigration benefits available to the immediate relatives (spouses, children, and parents) of citizens, including posthumous citizens, who die from injuries or illnesses resulting from or aggravated by serving in combat.

Most recently, P.L. 110-382, the Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act, expedited certain military service-related applications by establishing a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) liaison office in USCIS to monitor the completion of FBI background checks and by setting a deadline for processing such naturalization applications. P.L. 110-251, the Kendell Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act, streamlined background checks, particularly regarding biometric data. Sections 673 and 674 of P.L. 110-181, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (January 28, 2008), ensured reentry into the United States by lawful permanent residents (LPRs) who are spouses and children accompanying a military service member abroad (whose presence abroad might otherwise be deemed as abandonment of LPR status) and also provided for overseas naturalization for such LPRs.

Between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2008, about 45,000 service members were naturalized; 6,196 service members were naturalized in ceremonies held abroad and on Navy ships at sea; and posthumous citizenship was granted to 118 service members.

Applicants pay fees totaling $675 when they file their materials and have the option of taking a standardized civics (i.e., government and history of the United States) test or of having the examiner quiz them on civics as part of their interview. Naturalization duties are now handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).", "The INA also provides for expedited naturalization for noncitizens serving in the U.S. military. During peacetime, noncitizens serving honorably in the military may petition to naturalize after a period(s) of military service aggregating one year rather than the requisite five years of lawful permanent residence. During periods of military hostilities designated by executive order, noncitizens serving honorably in the Armed Forces can naturalize immediately. Certain requirements for naturalization are waived for those who are serving in the U.S. military, notably the requirement to reside continuously in the United States. The INA also provides that noncitizens who die during active duty may become citizens posthumously, and also provides that surviving immediate family members may derive nationality benefits from the granting of posthumous citizenship.", "The total number of approved naturalization (N-400) petitions rose in the mid-1990s, dropped in FY1997, and rose again in FY1999 ( Figure 1 ). From FY2003 to FY2006, total naturalization approvals rose but dropped slightly in FY2007. Interestingly, USCIS reported that more petitions were approved (604,280) than were filed (602,972) in FY2005, due in part to backlog reduction efforts.", "The trend line of approved naturalization petitions among the military differs from the overall trends, as Figure 1 illustrates.

The justification offered for this order was the war conducted through Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Noble Eagle in response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack.

The specific conditions for naturalization under the various statutes that were enacted before the INA vary. For example, the original Civil War statute affected only persons serving in the armies of the United States and did not include the Navy or Marine Corps, which were included in 1894.", "Among other standards under various statutes, the Civil War statute required residency of one year. Later statutes governing naturalization through service in the Navy or Marine Corps required service of 5 consecutive years in the Navy (the length of one tour of duty in the Navy at that time) or service for one tour of duty in the Marine Corps. Subsequent statutes have similar requirements with variations in the length of service required and the degree to which residency is waived.", "The early statutes required the alien to be 21 years old and waived the now-obsolete requirement to declare one's intent to become a citizen a certain period of time prior to filing a naturalization application. The requirement of an honorable discharge dates from the Civil War statute. Statutes during World War I and the Korean War permitted naturalization proceedings to take place abroad. The World War I statute for the first time waived the fee during wartime; permitted reenlistment only upon the condition that the alien was in the process of becoming a citizen (i.e., had filed a declaration of intent to naturalize); and required that a naturalization application based on peacetime service have been filed while in regular service after reenlistment or within six months of honorable discharge or separation from such service (which is currently the deadline for filing) or while in reserve service after regular service. Thus, at least one term of enlistment had to have been completed before an alien could file for naturalization during peacetime. For Filipinos, that statute required three years of service for naturalization based on peacetime service (which is the currently required period).", "Until the Vietnam War, special provisions for wartime service were generally enacted during a particular war and only covered service during that war, not for either past or prospective periods of conflict. Although \u00a7329 of the INA as enacted in 1952 included World Wars I and II, it made no provision for future periods. As a consequence, Congress enacted laws to include the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In 1968, Congress amended \u00a7329 of the INA to provide that the President is to designate by executive order such periods when the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged in armed conflict with a hostile foreign force.", "Not every deployment of U.S. forces to an area where armed conflict occurred has been designated as a period of hostilities. Since the executive order designating the termination of the Vietnam War for naturalization purposes, only two additional periods of hostilities have been designated for such purposes. President Clinton designated the Persian Gulf Conflict as a period of hostilities, and in 2002 President Bush designated the War on Terrorism beginning on September 11, 2001, as a period of hostilities. Although President Reagan designated the Grenada campaign as a period of hostilities, a federal court invalidated it entirely because, in contravention of statutory guidelines for such designations, the executive order attempted to limit the expedited naturalization benefit to persons who served in certain geographic areas and the record showed that the President would not have designated the campaign as a period of hostilities without the geographic limitations. As a result of the decision, President Clinton revoked the earlier Grenada designation.", "Military actions in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Haiti, and Panama have not been designated as a period of hostilities, although U.S. forces faced hostile conditions.", "Special issues arose with regard to Filipinos who fought the Japanese in the Philippines (then a U.S. territory) during World War II. Many of these veterans served in irregular units or in the Philippine Army, had never had LPR status although they were U.S. nationals until Philippine independence in 1946, and/or failed, because of bureaucratic policies of the time, to comply with certain filing deadlines. After extended litigation and debate, Congress amended \u00a7329 in 1990 to address Filipino veterans of World War II. Such veterans were exempted from the requirement of having been admitted to lawful permanent residence to the United States or having enlisted or reenlisted in the United States. Subsequent amendments enabled naturalization processing to be conducted in the Philippines. However, such special considerations only applied to applications filed by February 2, 1995.", "Special consideration was also extended to members of Hmong guerilla units that aided the U.S. military during the Vietnam War era. The Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000 provided an exemption from the English language requirement and special consideration for civics testing for Laotian refugees who supported the U.S. Armed Forces as members of guerrilla or irregular forces in Laos during the Vietnam War period of hostilities. These special provisions also covered widows and spouses of such guerrilla veterans who were also admitted as Laotian refugees. The spouses of living veterans must have been married to the veteran at the time such veteran sought admission into the United States as a refugee. The number of beneficiaries under this statute was limited to 45,000. The special provisions only applied to naturalization applications filed by a veteran or spouse within three years after May 26, 2000, or by a veteran's widow within three years after November 1, 2000.", "During the 1950s, there was a special statute authorizing naturalization for those aliens who had enlisted outside the United States and had not been admitted to the United States as LPRs. Popularly known as the Lodge Act, it was originally enacted in 1950 and was periodically extended during the 1950s, finally expiring on July 1, 1959. Notwithstanding that service was not during a specified period of hostilities, the act authorized naturalization under \u00a7329 of an alien who enlisted or reenlisted overseas under the terms of the act; subsequently entered the United States, American Samoa, Swains Island, or the Canal Zone pursuant to military orders; completed five years of service; and was honorably discharged. Such an alien was deemed lawfully admitted for permanent residence for the purposes of naturalization under \u00a7329.", "Prior to the current statute concerning posthumous citizenship for persons who die as a result of active-duty service during periods of hostilities, there was no public law for posthumous conferral. Posthumous grants of citizenship were accomplished through private laws for specific individuals. These private laws usually specified that no immigration benefit accrued to the surviving immediate relatives as a result of the posthumous grant.
