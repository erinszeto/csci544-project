Section 301(a)(3) of HAVA requires that each polling place have at least one fully accessible voting system, beginning in 2006. Some observers believe that this requirement is excessive and exceptions should be made for jurisdictions with low population, such as rural areas and small towns, where voters are well-known to election officials. Proponents counter that the high and increasing mobility of the U.S. population, and the problem of the \"hidden\" disabled, make accessibility essential for full enfranchisement. No bills were introduced in the 109 th Congress that addressed this issue.", "That is not the case with the other major controversy relating to accessibility. Sec. 301(a)(3) promotes the use of direct recording electronic (DRE) voting machines. They are widely recognized as the most accessible kind of voting system. However, they have been criticized as being insufficiently secure in comparison to paper-based systems, and several bills would have required that they produce paper ballots.", "Provisional voting. Sec. 302(a) requires that any person be permitted to fill out and submit a provisional ballot at a polling place, if the person claims to be a registered, eligible voter in the jurisdiction but is not so considered by election officials at the polling place. It went into effect in 2004. While some concerns have been raised about difficulty of implementation, the major controversy with respect to this provision has been with respect to the criteria for counting provisional ballots\u2014in particular, whether a ballot should be counted if cast in a polling place other than that at which the voter is registered. Several bills were introduced that would have addressed this controversy.", "Among other issues that arose in conjunction with recent federal elections and which were addressed by proposed legislation were", "concerns about political activity and conflict of interest among voting system vendors and among election officials, the use of deceptive practices relating to voting by political operatives or others, enforcement of HAVA requirements, access to polling places by observers, the provisioning of voting machines to polling places, the level of training given to pollworkers, voting rights of convicted persons, various aspects of voting-system security, voter identification, and voter-registration requirements.", "Other issues addressed by one or more bills included absentee and early voting, alternative language requirements, authorization of and budget submission by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), election crimes, the date on which elections are held and whether or not election day should be a holiday, the gathering and reporting of statistics relating to elections, the workings of the Electoral College, extension of voting rights to residents in areas other than the 50 states, extension of HAVA deadlines, HAVA payments to states, proportional representation and instant-runoff voting, redistricting procedures, state laws on election administration, voter error, voter information, and voting leave for employees on election day.

It is rapidly becoming the standard form of voting on the west coast. Oregon now conducts its elections by mail, and in Washington state, most ballots are now cast absentee. In California, the percentage of ballots cast absentee has steadily increased for many years, climbing to about one-third of all ballots in 2004. In addition to California, Oregon, and Washington, an additional 25 states permit \"no-excuse\" absentee voting, which means that any voter can request an absentee ballot without needing to provide a reason for the request. Several states permit registering as a permanent absentee voter.", "Under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA, P.L. 99-410 ), all persons serving in the military, their spouses and dependents, and U.S. citizens living abroad are eligible to vote absentee in federal elections. Versions of the law date to World War II. The various state laws and UOCAVA illustrate the trend toward making absentee voting available to larger numbers of voters, either for reasons of convenience or to secure the franchise for eligible voters whose circumstances preclude voting in person. Critics of this trend cite concerns about the possibility of fraud, as none of the safeguards of the polling place exist. In the polling place, each vote is cast in private, it cannot be connected with the person who cast it, and the voter cannot be easily bribed or coerced. Those safeguards cannot be guaranteed for absentee balloting or some other types of remote voting, and many election officials resist the trend toward no-excuse absentee voting for this reason.", "Despite those trends and concerns, there is little in HAVA that relates to absentee voting. Sec. 246 requires the EAC to conduct a study on postage-free absentee voting, and \u00a7303(b) requires first time registrants who vote by mail to include a specified form of identification with their ballots, but most HAVA absentee-voting provisions pertain to military and overseas voters.", "Seven bills would have solidified the trend toward increasing absentee voting by eliminating restrictions on it, requiring states to permit any eligible voter to vote absentee ( H.R. 533 , H.R. 939 , H.R. 1835 , H.R. 3557 , H.R. 4141 , S. 17 , and S. 450 ). Three of those ( H.R. 533 , H.R. 4141 , and S. 17 ) would have permitted the use of a national federal write-in absentee ballot to be developed by the EAC.", "Other bills had more limited provisions on absentee voting (see also the section on hurricane response below). H.R. 2104 required jurisdictions to accept absentee ballots sent by mail with insufficient postage. H.R. 2250 required the EAC to establish mandatory standards for prevention of fraud and abuse in the handling of absentee ballots. H.R. 3094 required the EAC to establish best practice guidelines for treatment of absentee ballots of military and overseas voters. S. 414 required that voter rolls at polling places indicate which voters have requested or submitted an absentee ballot. It also required that, except as provided for in UOCAVA, absentee ballots can be counted only if received by the close of business on election day. H.R. 533 , H.R. 939 , H.R. 4141 , S. 17 , and S. 450 , in contrast, would have permitted all absentee ballots to be accepted for at least 10 days following the election.

It requires that there be at least one accessible system in each polling place starting in 2006, and that any voting systems purchased with HAVA title II funds starting in 2007 be fully accessible. It further states that properly equipped DREs will meet the accessibility requirement.", "DREs can provide improved accessibility in several ways. They include magnified ballots for the vision-impaired; audio ballots for blind voters and, potentially, voters whose primary language is unwritten, or English speakers with substantial reading difficulty; and special interfaces for physically challenged voters. However, DREs have also been controversial because of concerns about security and reliability in recording and counting votes. As a result, some observers have proposed that alternatives to DREs be used to address accessibility needs. Some argue that paper-based systems can be made sufficiently accessible, either electronically or mechanically. Others believe that making those systems accessible is not currently feasible and that any risks associated with the use of DREs can be addressed through administrative measures (see also the sections on security of voting systems and on voter verification below).", "Three bills required that HAVA accessibility requirements be met through use of modular voting architecture, in which different voting functions, such as generating and casting votes, are performed by separate devices. H.R. 550 required that voting systems used for disability access separate the functions of vote generation, vote verification, and vote casting if the system is strictly electronic; and allowed the voter to verify and cast the ballot on paper or another medium privately and independently in an accessible manner. H.R. 939 and S. 450 required that at least one voting system per polling place provide opportunity for inspection and verification of the ballot for disabled voters and language minorities by separating the vote generation and vote-casting functions, and produce a paper record available for visual, audio, and pictorial verification. Both bills required states to instruct election officials on the right of persons with disabilities to receive assistance, and both required the EAC to develop best practices for voter-verification for persons with disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Language Requirements", "paragraphs": ["HAVA requires that voting systems provide alternative-language accessibility, pursuant to the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA, 42 U.S.C. 1973aa-1a). Despite the reauthorization of the VRA (see CRS Report 95-896, The Voting Rights Act of 1965, As Amended: Its History and Current Issues , by [author name scrubbed]), the alternative-language requirements may be an issue. Those requirements provide that jurisdictions with sufficiently large populations of non-English-proficient citizens be provided voting materials in their native language(s) (42 U.S.C. 1973aa-1a). H.R. 9 (now P.L 109-246) reauthorized this provision until 2032, and S. 2703 contained a similar provision. H.R. 550 would have required the EAC to develop best practices for voter-verification for persons with languages other than English. H.R. 997 required that official government functions be conducted in English. H.R. 4408 and S. 3828 would have eliminated the Voting Rights Act requirements to provide ballots and other voting materials and information in languages other than English."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["One controversy preceding the 2004 federal election followed a statement by the then-chairman and CEO of Diebold Corporation, one of the major manufacturers of DREs and optical scan systems. Walden O'Dell, in a 2003 fund-raising letter, reportedly stated his commitment to delivering Ohio for President Bush in the 2004 election. This led some Democratic activists to publicly voice concerns about a partisan conflict of interest on the part of Diebold. Concerns about such conflicts have been voiced by some election-reform advocates for years. The concerns have not been limited to potential partisan bias, but have also included business relationships among vendors, election officials, and testing laboratories. Some advocates have argued for standards and other controls over such potential conflicts of interest, while others have proposed use of government or nonprofit laboratories for certification, with some even proposing federalization of voting-system design and manufacturing, as occurs in some other countries. However, others believe that such concerns are unwarranted and that no additional measures are needed to control conflict of interest.", "Several bills would have addressed potential conflicts by manufacturers and laboratories. H.R. 470 would have modified \u00a7231(b) of HAVA to require the EAC to establish standards regarding conflicts of interest by laboratories that certify voting systems. H.R. 550 and H.R. 3094 required both certification laboratories and manufacturers to meet EAC conflict-of-interest standards, with the latter specifically including software manufacturers and prohibiting partisan political activities by manufacturers. H.R. 470 and H.R. 3094 prohibited accreditation of laboratories not meeting those standards. H.R. 533 prohibited conflict of interest more broadly\u2014including any entities involved with voting machines\u2014under EAC standards. It also required the EAC to study the feasibility and desirability of conducting elections through nonpartisan election boards. H.R. 939 and S. 450 more narrowly prohibited officers of voting system companies from taking part in prohibited political activities, as defined in the bill, in any election for which a voting system produced by the manufacturer is used.", "See also the section on political activities of election officials below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Voting", "paragraphs": ["Early voting usually refers to the practice in which election jurisdictions permit voting in a polling place before election day. While absentee voting is a form of early voting, the former involves ballots cast via mail, rather than in person, and the two are usually treated separately (see the section on absentee and mail voting above). Texas first implemented a limited version of early voting in 1963. There are many approaches to early voting, and the number of states using it is growing. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 23 states had some form of early voting in 2004, whereas only 13 states offered it in 2000. In some states, a voter can cast a ballot at any of several locations in the jurisdiction before election day, while in other states, the voter must visit the election official's office to do so. The days and hours for voting vary as well.", "Some observers have criticized early voting as distorting to the electoral process and being open to certain kinds of fraud and abuse. One disadvantage concerns developments or issues in a campaign occurring after early voters have cast their ballots. Also, as with other forms of remote voting, a greater risk of fraud arguably exists. Proponents state in contrast that early voting can increase turnout and lessen the risk of certain kinds of distortions, such as undue impact from late-occurring events. In Maryland, for example, the legislature approved early voting for 2006 over the Governor's veto, but the law was rejected by a Court of Appeals ruling on August 25. Objections raised in court included the assertion that it would require amending the Constitution, which guarantees voting in one's ward or election district on election day. Maryland's version of early voting would have made balloting available before the election at a limited number of places in each county. Despite such controversies, the recent increase in the number of states offering early voting suggests that the trend will continue.", "H.R. 533 , H.R. 939 , H.R. 3557 , S. 17 , S. 450 would have required states to implement early voting and for the EAC to establish standards for it.

The likelihood that such an approach will detect any irregularities depends on several factors, especially the size and structure of the recount. Usually, a partial recount would involve selecting a sample of precincts, recounting all the ballots in each, and comparing the results with the original count. In general, the probability that any problems with the original count would be detected will increase as the percentage of precincts recounted increases and as the number of precincts with errors increases. A nationwide, partial manual recount could pose significant logistical challenges. For example, a recount of 2% of precincts after the 2004 federal election would have involved hand counting 2.4 million ballots. Also, states are free to adopt different standards for what constitutes a vote on a given system. Therefore, if the EAC, rather than states, performed the recounts, it would need to vary the standards it used from state to state.", "Whether hand counts or machine counts are more accurate can also vary. In general, humans are not as accurate as machines in performing simple, highly repetitive tasks such as counting ballots. That is one reason why repeated manual recounts may yield different results. Machine accuracy is especially likely to be higher if the ballot choices made by the voter are printed rather than marked by hand. In contrast, machines are not as good at judging voter intent if markings are ambiguous or not within machine parameters, as may be the case if the ballots are marked directly by voters, as in most optical scan systems.

Although non-landowners and women may have voted in some places, eligibility was mostly limited to landed freemen of 21 years or older. Because the U.S. Constitution addressed neither eligibility nor how elections should be conducted, practices varied from state to state. Over time, uniform requirements for eligibility concerning race, sex, economic status, and age were adopted (the 15 th , 19 th , 24 th , and 26 th Amendments). Eventually, a pattern of registration practices had developed to maintain control of the franchise and serve the interests of the political parties. Citizenship and lengthy residency requirements were adopted, in part, as a reaction to waves of immigration and the rise of machine politics. And by requiring a voter to declare their party affiliation at the time of registration, voting in primaries would be limited to party members only. In the South, the dominant Democratic Party adopted the white primary, which excluded African Americans from party membership and, consequently, from any kind of effective participation.

Some computer security experts believe that open-source code is more secure than proprietary or closed-source code, while others believe that closed-source code can be at least as secure. Voting systems currently in use rely on closed-source code. Also, some current voting systems in widespread use employ proprietary commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software, such as Microsoft Windows. It is doubtful that a company providing closed-source COTS software would be willing to disclose the code. In addition, HAVA defines voting system to include components other than those in the voting machine per se, such as the computer code used to define ballots and to make materials available to the voter. Such components are part of all voting systems and probably use proprietary software (operating systems, word processors, database software, and so forth) in all cases.

If the signatures differ, the jurisdiction's software has been modified. Several major vendors have voluntarily deposited software with the library for use in this kind of comparison. This procedure permits testing of software integrity without revealing proprietary code, but it cannot test for problems that might exist in the reference copy itself.

However, any mode of electronic communication\u2014by modem, Internet, or memory card, as well as wireless\u2014provides potential points of attack for a voting system; but some means of communication is required. Many computer experts would argue that proper use of cryptographic methods would provide more security than prohibition of any one mode of communication, but that if wireless communication were to be prohibited, then Internet and possibly even modem communications should be as well.

Such voters must present one of the following forms of identification: \"a current and valid photo identification [or a copy if voting by mail]; or a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter.\" HAVA also requires that mail-in voter registration forms contain a check box for the registrant to certify that he or she is a U.S. citizen. The act does not prevent states from establishing more stringent identification requirements.", "Following the passage of HAVA, states enacted laws to implement the HAVA identification requirements, and in some cases, more stringent requirements. Some states have no additional requirements for voters to present a form of identification beyond those in HAVA. Other states also require voters to present a form of identification from the list in HAVA, or from a more extended list. Still others require all voters to present photo identification.

The absence of a clear national standard for the HAVA-required statewide systems has led to uncertainties about how states should develop them and even whether states will be able to meet the requirements. Given the problems some states have had, and the unusually large number of new voters who registered in 2004, issues associated with voter registration systems have become more prominent. Among them are questions about the integrity and accuracy of the new statewide systems, the validity of new registrations, concerns about various kinds of fraud and abuse, and the impacts of attempts to challenge the validity of voters' registrations at polling places.", "Election-day registration.

All other states have registration deadlines ranging from 8 to 31 days prior to an election. Some observers have proposed wide adoption of election-day registration, arguing that deadlines may pose a significant barrier to new voters or those who have recently moved. However, others argue that election-day registration may increase costs and the risk of fraudulent registrations. H.R. 496 , H.R. 533 , H.R. 939 , H.R. 3557 , S. 17 , and S. 450 would have required states to permit election-day registration at the polling place.

The use of third parties to distribute and collect voter-registration forms, a common practice in some states, has been contentious in some instances. H.R. 2250 would have prohibited, with certain exceptions, distribution of voter registration application forms by persons who had been convicted of a felony, did not provide identifying information to recipients, or failed to meet other state requirements; it required states to establish relevant standards.

NVRA requires states to make \"reasonable efforts\" to remove names of ineligible persons from voter rolls and sets specific requirements for removal (\u00a78). It specifically excludes failure to vote as sufficient cause for removal. Many registration lists appear to have substantial numbers of voters who are no longer eligible because they have moved or died, or for other reasons, and NVRA has been criticized as exacerbating those problems. However, some observers have also expressed concern that despite NVRA protections, significant numbers of eligible voters have been removed from rolls during some purges.

There is no independent record of the voter's choices that the machine totals can be checked against. Document ballots, on the other hand, permit a voter to check the actual ballot before casting it, although the voter cannot verify that the votes on the ballot were counted as the voter intended.", "Many computer security experts view the lack of transparency of DREs as a significant security vulnerability, and some advocate addressing this vulnerability by requiring a paper record of the voter's choices that the voter can verify before casting the ballot.

H.R. 533 prohibited the use of cryptography in the record.", "Although HAVA does not prohibit or require any particular voting system, its accessibility requirements effectively encourage the use of DREs, given the state of current technology. Therefore, if VVPAT is deemed essential to ensure the security and integrity of DRE voting, an argument can be made that HAVA should be revised to require it. However, to the extent that the need for VVPAT is not settled, and that requiring it might stifle innovation, and given the focus of HAVA on leaving specifics of implementation to the states, it could be argued that the decision of whether to implement VVPAT is best left to the states.
