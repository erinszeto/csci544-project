They are obscenity and child pornography. Because these are not protected by the First Amendment, they may be, and have been, made illegal.

Illinois , the Supreme Court clarified that \"the first and second prongs of the Miller test\u2014appeal to prurient interest and patent offensiveness\u2014are issues of fact for the jury to determine applying contemporary community standards.\" However, as for the third prong, \"[t]he proper inquiry is not whether an ordinary member of any given community would find serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value in allegedly obscene material, but whether a reasonable person would find such value in the material, taken as a whole.\" In Brockett v.

Indeed, there is no serious contention that the legislature was unjustified in believing that it is difficult, if not impossible, to halt the exploitation of children by pursuing only those who produce the photographs and movies.\"", "Federal law bans interstate commerce (including by computer) in child pornography (18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252, 2252A), defines \"child pornography\" as \"any visual depiction\" of \"sexually explicit conduct\" involving a minor, and defines \"sexually explicit conduct\" to include not only various sex acts but also the \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Child Pornography: Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, Congress amended the child pornography statute to provide that \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person\" \"is not limited to nude exhibitions or exhibitions in which the outlines of those areas were discernible through clothing.\" 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252 note.

Free Speech Coalition , the Supreme Court declared the CPPA unconstitutional to the extent that it prohibited pictures that were not produced with actual minors. Child pornography, to be unprotected by the First Amendment, must either be obscene or depict actual children engaged in sexual activity (including \"lascivious\" poses), or actual children whose images have been \"morphed\" to make it appear that the children are engaged in sexual activity. The Court observed in Ashcroft that statutes that prohibit child pornography that use real children are constitutional because they target \"[t]he production of the work, not the content.\" The CPPA, by contrast, targeted the content, not the means of production. The government's rationales for the CPPA included that \"[p]edophiles might use the materials to encourage children to participate in sexual activity\" and might \"whet their own sexual appetites\" with it, \"thereby increasing ... the sexual abuse and exploitation of actual children.\" The Court found these rationales inadequate because the government \"cannot constitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of controlling a person's private thoughts\" and \"may not prohibit speech because it increases the chance an unlawful act will be committed 'at some indefinite future time.'\"", "The government also argued that the existence of \"virtual\" child pornography \"can make it harder to prosecute pornographers who do use real minors,\" because, \"[a]s imaging technology improves ... it becomes more difficult to prove that a particular picture was produced using actual children.\" This rationale, the Court found, \"turns the First Amendment upside down. The Government may not suppress lawful speech as a means to suppress unlawful speech.\" In response to Ashcroft , Congress enacted Title V of the PROTECT Act, P.L. 108 - 21 (2003), which prohibits any \"digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image that is, or is indistinguishable from, that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" It also prohibits \"a visual depiction of any kind, including a drawing, cartoon, sculpture, or painting, that ... depicts a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\" and is obscene or lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

In 2006, the FCC took action against four other television broadcasts that contained fleeting expletives, but on June 4, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found \"that the FCC's new policy regarding 'fleeting expletives' is arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.\" The Supreme Court, however, reversed, finding that the FCC's explanation of its decision was adequate; it left open the question whether censorship of fleeting expletives violates the First Amendment.", "In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned the FCC's fine against CBS broadcasting station affiliates for broadcasting Janet Jackson's exposure of her breast for nine-sixteenths of a second during a SuperBowl halftime show.
