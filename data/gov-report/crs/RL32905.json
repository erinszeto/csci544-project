These amounts reflected a rescission of 0.83% that was included in the measure funding Treasury operations in FY2005. Of the funds appropriated for processing, assistance, and management, Congress specified that $4 million be used to operate the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program and that $7.5 million be used as grants for low-income taxpayer clinics. None of the funds appropriated for the BSM program could be spent without the consent of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. In addition, the IRS Commissioner was required to submit quarterly reports to both committees in FY2005 assessing the results of the agency's initiatives to improve taxpayer compliance.", "The Bush Administration requested that IRS operations be funded at $10.679 billion in FY2006\u2014or 4.3% more than the amount enacted for FY2005. To more closely align its budget request with IRS's major programs and current strategic plan, the Administration proposed that the agency's budget be restructured beginning in FY2006. Under the proposal, the number of accounts in the IRS budget would be reduced from six to three: tax administration and operations (TAO), BSM, and administration of the health insurance tax credit. TAO would replace the existing accounts for tax law enforcement; processing, assistance, and management; and information systems. For FY2006, the Administration sought $10.460 billion in appropriated funds for TAO\u2014or about 5% more than the amount set aside for this purpose in FY2005; $199 million for BSM\u2014or 2% less than the amount enacted for FY2005; and $20 million for administration of the health insurance tax credit\u2014or 41.5% less than the amount enacted in FY2005. Compared to the FY2005 budget, the Administration was seeking $500 million more for enforcement but $38 million less for taxpayer service and $4 million less for the BSM program. Some feared that a reduction in funding for taxpayer service would lead to higher rates of non-compliance among taxpayers who rely heavily on taxpayer assistance centers (TACs) and IRS toll-free phone assistance centers to fulfill their obligations under the federal tax code. The Administration estimated that its budget request would boost total full-time employment at the IRS from 97,440 in FY2005 to 97,679 in FY2006.", "According to budget documents issued by the IRS, the FY2006 budget request was intended to support three key objectives in its current five-year strategic plan: (1) continued improvement of taxpayer service; (2) strengthened enforcement of the tax laws; and (3) continued modernization of IRS's information systems.", "Under a measure ( H.R. 3058 ) providing appropriations for Treasury and a handful of other federal agencies approved by the House on June 30, 2005, the IRS would have received $10.556 billion in funds in FY2006. This amount was $319 million more than the agency received in FY2005 but $123 million less than the amount requested by the Bush Administration. The House also rejected the Administration's proposed revision of the IRS budget. As a result, it is difficult to compare the Administration's budget request for the IRS and the funding for IRS operations recommended in H.R. 3058 . Nonetheless, it is possible to compare the funding level approved by the House with the comparable amounts enacted for FY2005. Of the funding level for the IRS approved by the House, $4.182 billion\u2014or $125 million above the level for FY2005\u2014would go to processing, assistance, and management; $4.580 billion\u2014or $216 million above the level for FY2005\u2014would be set aside for tax law enforcement; $1.575 billion\u2014or $3 million below the level for FY2005\u2014for information systems; $199 million\u2014or $4 million below the level for FY2005\u2014for BSM; and $20 million\u2014or $14 million below the level for FY2005\u2014for administering the health insurance tax credit. The measure also specified that of the funds recommended for processing, assistance, and management, $4 million be set aside for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program, $8 million for grants for low-income taxpayer clinics, and $1.5 million for the IRS Oversight Board. Furthermore, H.R. 3058 included a provision barring the IRS from closing or consolidating any Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TACs) until TIGTA completed a \"thorough study\" of the likely impact of such an initiative on taxpayer compliance. In late May 2005, the IRS announced that it planned to close 68 of 400 TACs by the end of FY2005; two months later the IRS announced that it was suspending the plan until Congress had approved a budget for the agency in FY2006. Earlier in 2005, the IRS also revealed that it was planning to reduce the weekly hours of operation for toll-free telephone assistance for individual taxpayers.", "The Senate approved an amended version of H.R. 3058 by a vote of 93 to 1 on October 20.

Like the House, the Senate rejected the Administration's proposed restructuring of the IRS budget on the grounds that it was \"overly simplistic\" and would have hindered the ability of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to hold the IRS accountable for its use of appropriated funds. Under the Senate-passed version of H.R. 3058 , the IRS would have received $4.137 billion for processing, assistance, and management\u2014or $80 million than the amount enacted for FY2005 but $45 million less than the amount approved by the House; $4.726 billion for tax law enforcement\u2014or $362 million more than the amount enacted for FY2005 and $145 million more than the amount approved by the House; $1.598 billion for information systems\u2014or $20 million more than the amount enacted for FY2005 and $23 million more than the amount approved by the House; $199 million for BSM\u2014or $4 million less than the amount enacted for FY2005 but the same amount requested by the Bush Administration and recommended by the House; and $20 million for administering the health insurance tax credit\u2014or $14 million less than the amount enacted for FY2005 but the same amount requested by the Administration and approved by the House.

The Senate also agreed with the House in setting aside $4 million for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program and $8 million for grants to low-income taxpayer clinics. But unlike the House-passed bill, the version of H.R. 3058 passed by the Senate would have removed the cap imposed by the FY1995 Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act on the amount of user fees collected by the IRS in a fiscal year that it is allowed to retain, and it would have prevented the IRS from competing with the private sector in developing tax return preparation software by requiring the agency to continue an agreement reached with the Free File Alliance in 2002.", "The significant differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 3058 meant that a conference committee needed to be formed in order to resolve them.

The Administration offered a general outline of the new programs, but it did not submit a detailed realignment proposal for congressional consideration. It stated that the proposed new program would emphasize flexibility, would be results oriented, and would be targeted to communities based on need. The Administration sought this realignment, in part, because many of the 18 programs recommended for elimination have been judged by the Administration to be ineffective, unable to demonstrate results, or duplicative of the efforts of other federal programs.", "The agency that would have been most affected by the proposal is HUD; programs administered by HUD account for nearly 81% of the $5.6 billion in FY2005 funding.

This differs from the practice of being paid before the actual delivery of the goods, a practice that had been utilized by most U.S. agricultural exporters to Cuba since such sales were legalized in late 2001. U.S. agricultural exporters and some Members of Congress strongly objected that the action constituted a new sanction that violated the intent of TSRA, and could jeopardize millions of dollars in U.S. agricultural sales to Cuba. OFAC Director Robert Werner maintains that the clarification \"conforms to the common understanding of the term in international trade.\" On July 29, 2005, OFAC clarified that, for \"payment of cash in advance\" for the commercial sale of U.S. agricultural exports to Cuba, vessels can leave U.S. ports as soon as a foreign bank confirms receipt of payment from Cuba. OFAC's action would reportedly ensure that the goods would not be vulnerable to seizure for unrelated claims while still at the U.S. port. Supporters of overturning OFAC's February 22, 2005 amendment, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, were pleased by the clarification but indicated that they would still work to overturn the February rule.", "Since late 2001, Cuba has purchased over $1 billion in agricultural products from the United States. Overall U.S. exports to Cuba amounted to about $7 million in 2001, $146 million in 2002, $259 million in 2003, $400 million in 2004, and $245 million in the first eight months of 2005, the majority in agricultural products. U.S. exports to Cuba for January to August 2005 declined about 22% from the same time period in 2004.", "For additional information, see CRS Report RL32730, Cuba: Issues for the 109 th Congress , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Issue Brief IB10061, Exempting Food and Agriculture Products from U.S. Economic Sanctions: Status and Implementation , by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report RL31139, Cuba: U.S. Restrictions on Travel and Remittances , by [author name scrubbed].", "Key Policy Staff", "ALD = American Law Division DSP = Domestic Social Policy Division FDT = Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division G&F = Government & Finance Division RSI = Resources, Science, and Industry Division"], "subsections": []}]}]}}
