", "In pointing out the provisions in the reconciliation bill with larger long-term fiscal impacts, the CBO said the following:", "Relative to H.R. 3590 , the reconciliation proposal would make a number of changes that would affect its longer-term impact on the budget. In particular, it would increase the subsidies offered in the new insurance exchanges and would reduce the impact of an excise tax on health insurance plans with premiums above certain thresholds. An important component of the longer-term analysis is that, beginning in 2019, the reconciliation proposal would change the annual indexing provisions so that the premium subsidies offered through the exchanges would grow more slowly; over time, the spending on exchange subsidies would therefore fall back toward the level under H.R. 3590 by itself.

Lifetime and annual limits refer to the establishment of a cap on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary. This prohibition would not extend to covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of H.R. 3590 to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted by federal and state law. The restriction on annual limits would be further defined by the Secretary, who would ensure that there is access to needed services available with minimal impact on premiums. Generally prohibit rescissions for a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage. A rescission generally refers to the practice of cancelling a health insurance policy after a plan member or policyholder has submitted medical claims. Rescissions would still be permitted in cases where the covered individual committed fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact as prohibited by the terms of the plan or coverage. Any cancellation of coverage in this case would require prior notice to the enrollee. Require a group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering coverage in the group or individual markets that provides dependent coverage of children to extend that coverage to unmarried adult children until the individual is 26 years old. A health plan or a health insurance issuer would not be required to make coverage available for a child of a child receiving dependent coverage.", "Under the reconciliation bill, the prohibition of lifetime limits, prohibition on rescissions, and the requirement to provide coverage for dependent children up to age 26 would also apply to the grandfathered plans starting six months after enactment.
