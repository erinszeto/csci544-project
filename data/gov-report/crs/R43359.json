Of particular interest to courts in recent cases against Aereo and FilmOn was the meaning of the Copyright Act's \"transmit clause\" that determines whether a performance is private or public and within the scope of the public performance right. Specifically, the courts have been divided as to what constitutes a \"performance to members of the public\" for the purposes of the transmit clause.", "During the past several years, groups of broadcasters have filed lawsuits against Aereo and FilmOn alleging that the retransmissions of their programs by these companies have violated their right of public performance. While both FilmOn and Aereo use similar technology, the courts have disagreed about whether this technology infringes upon the copyright holder's right of public performance. District courts in the District of Columbia (Fox Television Stations v. FilmOn X) and California (Fox Television Stations v. BarryDriller Content Systems) held that FilmOn's retransmissions did violate the right of public performance. In 2013, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in WNET v. Aereo affirmed the lower court decision ruling that the transmissions by Aereo did not infringe the plaintiffs' public performance right. However, the U.S. Supreme Court in its 2014 decision in ABC v. Aereo overturned the Second Circuit's ruling and held that Aereo's transmissions served as a public performance of the plaintiffs' works within the meaning of the transmit clause, violating the plaintiffs' exclusive rights to control such performances.

The plaintiffs argued that Aereo's service of transmitting copyrighted television programs contemporaneously with over-the-air broadcasts violated their right of public performance. The defendant, Aereo, in turn argued that the performances were not public but private because each user could access only his/her specially made copy of the program. The district court agreed with Aereo's argument. That same year, the plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in WNET v. Aereo.

In the 2012 case Fox Television Stations v. BarryDriller Content Systems , the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California found that FilmOn's retransmission of certain television programs violated the copyrights of several broadcasters. In 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found, in Fox Television Stations v.

Both companies allowed subscribers to view and/or record live broadcast programming. Unlike most other digital video recorders (DVR) that require a television, Aereo and FilmOn allowed users to view programming on their computers or mobile devices, similar to services offered by Hulu and Netflix. However, Aereo, unlike Hulu and Netflix, did not negotiate any licensing agreements with the content providers. Content providers even accused Aereo of \"stealing content\" while Aereo defended its service as a new player in the media market. ", "In order to watch a program, the Aereo subscriber would first log into an account on the website. The subscriber then either would select to watch a program as it is aired or would choose to record a program that would be aired later. When a subscriber would select to watch a currently airing program, Aereo would transmit to the subscriber a webpage from which he/she could watch the television program at roughly the same time as the current broadcast. While viewing this program, the subscriber could pause, rewind, and record the program with the system retaining a copy until the subscriber watched it later. These features would allow the subscriber to watch a program even after the over-the-air broadcast has ended. The Aereo system, therefore, provided the functionality of both a television antenna and a DVR.", "When a subscriber selected to watch or record a program, the web browser would send a request to the Aereo application server. The application server then sent information about the subscriber and the selected program to the antenna server. The antenna server allocated a specific antenna to that subscriber. These antennas received the broadcast television channels, from which the subscriber selected the programming. Depending on the type of subscription, most of the subscribers were assigned a different antenna each time they selected a program. However, no two subscribers were using a single antenna at the same time. ", "The selected antenna then received the incoming broadcast signal. The antenna server received the data from the antenna and then sent it to another server where a copy of the program was saved to a large hard drive in a directory reserved for that particular subscriber. Regardless of whether the subscriber had selected to watch or to record a program, the system streamed the program from the hard drive copy of the program in the user's directory on the server. The difference between the two viewing modes was when the streaming occured: after six-seven seconds of programming has been saved on the hard drive for the \"watch\" option or when the subscriber chooses to view the program. ", "The courts have highlighted three technical details of significance. First, Aereo assigned individual antennas to each subscriber even if two or more subscribers were watching or recording the same program. Second, the system created a separate copy of the program, stored in the subscriber's personal directory. Third, each subscriber could only access and watch the copy specifically made for his/her account. No other subscriber could view that particular copy.

Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. , held that to transmit a public performance \"at least involves sending out some sort of signal via a device or process to be received by the public at a place beyond the place from which it is sent.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance of the Work", "paragraphs": ["The second element requires the transmission to involve a performance of the work. The Copyright Act defines \"to perform\" as \"to recite, render, play, dance, or act it, either directly or by means of any device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show its images in any sequences or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\" ", "For certain mediums, such as literary works, courts distinguish between the transmission of the work itself and the transmission of a performance or recitation of the work. However, such a distinction does not reasonably apply to audiovisual works. For example, television broadcasts may be characterized as performances transmitted by the studio of another performance of an underlying work (that particular television show). In this context, courts may need to consider whether the broadcast or a retransmission of that broadcast is a separate performance itself compared to the performance of the underlying work. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Members of the Public Capable of Receiving the Performance", "paragraphs": ["The third element addresses the basic nature of the public performance right. While the Copyright Act does not explicitly define \"public,\" the definition of a \"public performance\" indicates that \"public\" includes spaces accessible to the public or places outside of the normal gatherings of the family. However, courts have interpreted \"public\" to include a broader range of people in places that traditionally are considered nonpublic. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California held in On Command Video Corp. v. Columbia Picture s Industries that transmitting a video rental to a guest in his hotel room constituted a transmission of a public performance because of the commercial nature of the rental even though the viewing itself occurred in a \"non-public\" place. ", "Courts have relied upon the phrase \"capable of receiving the performance\" as the primary qualifier for determining whether a potential recipient is public or private. Interpretation of this phrase has been the primary issue in the cases leading up to the Aereo and FilmOn decisions. In Cartoon Network LP v. CSC Holdings, Inc. (\"Cablevision\"), the Second Circuit stated that \"capable of receiving the performance\" means \"capable of receiving a particular transmission of a performance\" because the transmission is itself a performance. This case involved a remote storage digital video recorder (RS-DVR) service that streamed a unique playback copy of a television program stored on a subscriber's individual hard drive. The Second Circuit held that because the \"RS-DVR playback transmission is made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber\" the playback transmissions were not public performances and, therefore, did not infringe upon the plaintiffs' exclusive right of public performance. According to the court, this element of the \"transmit clause\" requires consideration of the potential audience of a particular transmission and not of the underlying work, as the potential audience for any copyrighted work is the general public. Cablevision's RS-DVR system enabled each subscriber to access that particular playback copy available only to that particular subscriber.

Because of greater accessibility generated by developing technologies, a performance no longer needs to occur in a single place such as a theater but can often occur in a more private place such as a home or a car. ", "However, receiving a transmission at different times and/or different places does not diminish the public nature of the performance. In Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc. v. Redd Horne, Inc., a video store transmitted at different times the same copy of a film to multiple customers, who each viewed the film in a private room in the store. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that these transmissions were public performances. Even though the customers viewed the film in traditionally private rooms at different times, the transmission of the single copy of the film still served as a public performance.

In American Broadcasting Companies v. Aereo, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction barring Aereo from transmitting television programs. In WNET v. Aereo, the plaintiffs appealed the district court's denial to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On April 1, 2013, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling that refused to grant the injunction against Aereo. The court held that Aereo's transmissions of broadcast television programs were not public performances under the Copyright Act because the transmissions are of unique copies created at the user's request. The following discussion will examine the Second Circuit's interpretation of the transmit clause in reaching this decision. The courts focused on two out of the four elements of the transmit clause discussed above: \"performance of the work\" and \"members of the public capable of receiving the performance.\" These factors contribute to the alleged \"loophole\" used by Aereo's one-antenna-per-subscriber service to avoid infringing the public performance right."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance of the Work", "paragraphs": ["The Copyright Act defines \"performance\" as specific actions such as reciting, rendering, playing, or showing of images.

", "The specific issue before the Second Circuit in Aereo was what performance triggers the analysis in the Copyright Act's transmit clause: the broadcast of the program or the specific transmission created by Aereo. The plaintiffs in Aereo argued that the court should consider each of Aereo's transmissions in the aggregate in order to determine whether they are public performances because the transmissions are of the same underlying program watched by many members of the public. ", "The Second Circuit dismissed this interpretation, stating that the plaintiffs' argument misreads the transmit clause. For the Second Circuit, the performance at issue was the particular transmission created by the Aereo system for that specific user. Each of Aereo's transmissions was an independent performance because each transmission is a unique copy by Aereo's system. These transmissions were not equal to the original broadcast performance. Equating them as such, according to the court, would disregard the transmit clause's specific inquiry regarding a particular transmission. In reaching this conclusion, the Second Circuit relied upon its previous decision in Cablevision , which held that individual copies made by an RS-DVR system were the performances at issue. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Members of the Public Capable of Receiving the Performance", "paragraphs": ["This analysis led to the Second Circuit's next point concerning the transmit clause and the composition of the audience to trigger a public performance. Similar to their argument concerning performance, the plaintiffs argued that \"members of the public\" includes the potential audience for the broadcast and not the individual transmission. According to the court, however, the relevant inquiry under the transmit clause concerning the definition of \"public\" is \"the potential audience of a particular transmission, not the potential audience for the underlying work or the particular performance of that work being transmitted.\" The Second Circuit supported this interpretation of the transmit clause by stating that the potential audience for the underlying work could include anyone, making the differentiation between public and nonpublic performances irrelevant. ", "Reiterating a similar argument in Cablevision , the court referred to the presence of \"to the public\" in the transmit clause to support the supposition that not all transmissions are automatically public performances. The court further acknowledged that Aereo has designed its retransmission system to accommodate this distinction in the Copyright Act. Each user has a specific antenna transmitting a specific copy of the program only to that user. When an Aereo subscriber selects to watch or record a program, Aereo's system creates a unique copy of that program that is accessible on the hard drive only by that subscriber. Therefore, the Second Circuit concluded that the potential audience of that particular transmission is only one subscriber who is capable of receiving that particular transmission/performance.

", "The dissent also referred to the legislative history of the transmit clause to show that Congress anticipated developing technology such as Aereo's system. For the dissent, the addition of the \"different times/places\" phrasing to the transmit clause demonstrated congressional intent that the public performance right encompass a broad scope. Specifically, for the dissent, the House report's explanation that \"if the transmission reaches the public in [any] form\" the transmission comes within the scope of the public performance right verified his interpretation. ", "The dissent also found Aereo's system distinct from the RS-DVR technology at issue in Cablevision . Cablevision's RS-DVR system produced copies of material that Cablevision already had a license to retransmit while Aereo's system enables it to transmit material to subscribers without a license.

The Court in Aereo pointed out that Congress's 1976 Copyright Act amendments deliberately overruled these decisions, by defining performance as \"to show ... images in any sequence\" and enacting the transmit clause to capture specifically cable television companies as performers. According to the Court, Aereo's technology is similar to that of the cable television providers in Fortnightly and Teleprompter in that Aereo receives programs and then offers all the programming it has received to subscribers. Specifically, through the use of its technology, including antennas, transcoders, and servers, Aereo, like a cable television provider, received programs and then offered all the programming it has received to subscribers.

Aereo , anticipated that \"Congress will take a fresh look at this new technology.\" The Second Circuit in its analysis discussed differences in technology in 1976 and 2013 and the resulting difficulty in distinguishing between private and public transmissions. In deciding that Aereo's service is a private transmission, the court concluded that \"unanticipated technological developments have created tension between Congress's view that retransmissions of network programs by cable television systems should be deemed public performances and its intent that some transmissions be classified as private.\" By emphasizing this conflict between the law and developing technology, the court has highlighted an opportunity for congressional action and clarification of the Copyright Act. ", "Several bills introduced during the 113 th Congress would have implicated the various parties in the Aereo and FilmOn cases. The Television Consumer Freedom Act of 2013, introduced by Senator John McCain, would have impacted the market in which companies such as Aereo, FilmOn, and the broadcasters are competing. The act would have allowed cable providers to offer to subscribers \"a la carte\" programming: programming on a per-channel basis rather than as part of a package. The bill would have also denied broadcasters their spectrum licenses if they moved big event programming from broadcast television to cable. Many of the Aereo plaintiffs threatened this action in response to Aereo's success in the courts.", "The Consumer Choice in Online Video Act, introduced by Senator Jay Rockefeller, sought to increase consumer choice and competition in the online video programming marketplace. The bill would have prohibited content distributors fr om engaging in unfair or deceptive practices. The bill also contained provisions that would address antenna rental services, such as Aereo, specifically. These provisions would have exempted these services from paying certain retransmission fees. However, these provisions assumed that the online video provider is legally operating and obtaining content, stressing the need for further clarification from the courts concerning the legal status of companies such as Aereo and FilmOn X. As of the date of this report, it remains to be seen whether these or similar bills will be introduced in the 114 th Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
