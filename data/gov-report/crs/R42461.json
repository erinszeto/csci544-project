In contrast, a few states allow withholding only if parties provide alternative information about chemical ingredients to regulators or the public for disclosure, such as the chemical family for the ingredients. For example, Montana asks that, for withheld trade secret chemicals, parties provide the \"trade name, inventory name, chemical family name, or other unique name and the quantity of such constituent(s) used.\" In Montana, as well as in Colorado and Louisiana, when parties withhold information and provide a less detailed description of chemical additives, it does not appear that regulators have the authority to compel further disclosure in ordinary circumstances. However, as described below, some states make an exception and require disclosure in special circumstances like spills or medical emergencies.", "Some disclosure laws give the state attorney general or a state agency the authority to approve or deny an exemption for trade secrets. These laws vary as to whether parties may withhold the information prior to the decision or must first submit it to the state. For example, the Texas rule, which allows parties to withhold information initially, allows landowners and others to challenge a claim of trade secret protection and lists procedures to be used by the state attorney general to decide whether to exempt the information from disclosure. Arkansas's rule states that parties may withhold the information and submit a claim for a trade secret exemption to the state agency. The agency decides whether information qualifies for protection under the criteria provided in the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. In Wyoming, the state oil and gas commission decides whether information that has been submitted to it is exempt from public disclosure under the Wyoming Public Records Act.", "At least seven disclosure laws make an exception to trade secret protections for situations in which a health care professional needs the information in order to provide medical care. Typically, the professional must execute a confidentiality agreement before or after disclosure occurs. For example, Colorado's rule states the following:", "Vendors, service companies, and operators shall identify the specific identity and amount of any chemicals claimed to be a trade secret to any health professional who requests such information in writing if the health professional provides a written statement of need for the information and executes a confidentiality agreement, Form 35. The written statement of need shall be a statement that the health professional has a reasonable basis to believe that (1) the information is needed for purposes of diagnosis or treatment of an individual, (2) the individual being diagnosed or treated may have been exposed to the chemical concerned, and (3) knowledge of the information will assist in such diagnosis or treatment.", "In addition, Colorado's rule provides that in immediate medical emergencies, trade secret information must be provided to the health professional \"upon a verbal acknowledgement by the health professional that such information shall not be used for purposes other than the health needs asserted and that the health professional shall otherwise maintain the information as confidential.\" A written confidentiality agreement may be requested \"as soon as circumstances permit.\" Other states with some form of medical emergency exception include Arkansas (confidentiality agreement not required in rule), Idaho (confidentiality agreement not required in rule), Louisiana (confidentiality agreement not required in rule), Montana (confidentiality agreement may be required in non-emergencies; may be requested in emergencies), Pennsylvania (written confidentiality agreement required in non-emergencies; may be requested in emergencies when circumstances permit), and Texas (information must be held confidential). Colorado's rule provides a similar kind of exception for disclosures provided to state agency employees responding to a spill or release, with provisions for confidentiality, as do similar provisions in states such as Montana and Pennsylvania."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "When Disclosures Must Be Made", "paragraphs": ["A few states mandate disclosures both before and after each fracturing treatment. For example, prior to fracturing in Wyoming, a party must disclose \"for each stage of the well stimulation program, the chemical additives, compounds and concentrations or rates proposed to be mixed and injected.\" After the procedure, at least one of the applicable parties must disclose information about the actual chemicals used. Similar rules exist in states such as Arkansas, Idaho, and Montana, which require that disclosures made after fracturing contain a different level of detail than those made before fracturing.", "Disclosures made prior to fracturing that specifically identify the chemicals that will be used potentially give parties with access to the data the opportunity to perform baseline testing on water sources near the drilling site for those particular chemicals. Baseline testing results can then be compared with results from post-well stimulation testing to see if any groundwater contamination has occurred and, if it has, to possibly locate its source. Proponents of pre-fracturing disclosure have argued that, among other things, it would (1) provide landowners with the identities of the chemicals they should test for when they collect baseline water samples prior to drilling; and (2) assist emergency personnel and health professionals in responding to a spill or release by providing them with information about the identities of the chemicals that were used in the fluid.", "However, some in the industry have argued that requiring an operator to disclose chemical information prior to hydraulic fracturing is of questionable value and does not comport with realities in the field. Arguments to this effect include (1) the chemical composition of the fracturing fluid is often continually adjusted prior to treatment of the well, and so disclosures made prior to fracturing may not accurately reflect the actual chemicals that will be used; and (2) requiring the operator to gather chemical information from its contractors and report the information to regulators may slow down production.", "Other state disclosure laws require parties to submit information about the chemicals used to fracture a well at a single time following the drilling, fracturing, or completion of the well. States with laws that require disclosure after completion of a well that has been fractured include Louisiana (within 20 days), New Mexico (within 45 days), and Texas (timeframe varies). Ohio law mandates disclosures within 60 days after completion of the drilling of the well to the \"proposed total depth\" or \"after a determination that a well is a dry or lost hole.\" Colorado, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania require disclosure within 60 days after a fracturing treatment ends."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Many federal and state legislators and regulatory authorities have adopted or proposed measures that would create new disclosure requirements applicable to the practice of hydraulic fracturing, a natural resource recovery technique that is widely used in the recovery of natural gas from shale formations. The Shale Gas Production Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board has recommended the public disclosure, on a well-by-well basis, of all of the chemical ingredients added to fracturing fluids\u2014even those ingredients that do not meet OSHA's standards for hazardous chemicals requiring MSDSs. The subcommittee recommended that some protection for trade secrets be provided.", "At the federal level, a few existing laws require some disclosure of information about the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. However, none of these laws requires disclosure of detailed information about the chemical composition of a hydraulic fracturing fluid. BLM has proposed disclosure requirements that would be applicable for hydraulic fracturing on all lands managed by the agency. Legislation was introduced in the 112 th Congress that would have created disclosure requirements for all hydraulic fracturing operations nationally. ", "Chemical disclosure laws at the state level vary widely. Of the 15 laws examined in this report, fewer than half require direct public disclosure of chemical information by mandating that parties post the information on the FracFocus chemical disclosure website. The level of detail required to be disclosed often depends on how states protect trade secrets, as these protections may allow submitting parties to withhold information from disclosure at their discretion or to submit fewer details about proprietary chemicals, except, perhaps, in emergencies. Even if a disclosure law does not protect information from public disclosure, other state laws, such as an exemption in an open records law, may do so. A few states require the submission of MSDS for certain chemicals. MSDS may offer a relatively low level of disclosure, as the most specific details that parties currently must include on the data sheets under OSHA regulations are the chemical or common names of certain hazardous ingredients. With regard to the timing of disclosure, a few state laws require at least some disclosure of information about fracturing fluid chemical composition before fracturing is performed, but these states typically require less detailed information to be provided before fracturing than afterward.", "Appendix A.
