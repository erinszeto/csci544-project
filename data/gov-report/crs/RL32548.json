TheAdministration proposed to assess an annual user fee of $250 for all enrolled Priority Group 7 and8 veterans.

The Administration proposed to eliminate the pharmacy copayment burden for nonservice-connectedconditions of Priority Group 2-Priority Group 5 veterans by raising the income threshold from $9,894 (if single) to $16,509 (if single).

With the passage of thislegislation, former POWs do not have to pay copayments for hospital and medical services (includingcopayments for medications). This applies to treatment of both service-connected andnonservice-connected conditions. However, former POWs do have to pay copayments for long-termcare services.

Veterans who have health insurance coverage for emergencycare, or are entitled to other federal benefits care (i.e., under Medicare or Medicaid), or have othercontractual or legal recourse are not eligible for reimbursement.

Undercurrent law, veterans receiving hospice care for a terminal illness may be subject to copaymentobligations depending upon the type of VA facility in which they receive care. Hospice care receivedin a nursing home is exempt from extended-care copayments. Those veterans who seek hospice careat a hospital (not in a nursing home) are subject to an inpatient copayment.
