In the 110 th Congress, multiple hearings were held which addressed the proposed security agreement. In late 2007, Congress passed the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, 2008, which contained a provision limiting the funds it made available from being used by U.S. authorities to enter into an agreement with Iraq that subjected members of the U.S. Armed Forces to the criminal jurisdiction of Iraq. In October 2008, Congress passed the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, which requires a report from the President to the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services Committees, and the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, on any completed U.S.-Iraq agreement addressing specified subjects, including security assurances or commitments by the United States, basing rights, and the status of U.S. forces in Iraq. Several legislative proposals were introduced which would have required any such agreement to either be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent as a treaty or authorized by a statutory enactment.", "On November 17, 2008, after months of negotiations, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker and Iraq Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari signed two documents: (1) the Strategic Framework Agreement for a Relationship of Friendship and Cooperation between the United States and the Republic of Iraq (Strategic Framework Agreement), and (2) the Agreement Between the United States of America and Republic of Iraq On the Withdrawal of United States Forces from Iraq and the Organization of Their Activities during Their Temporary Presence in Iraq (Security Agreement). In some ways, the concluded agreements differ from the long-term security arrangement originally contemplated by the Declaration of Principles. Perhaps most significantly, the concluded agreements require the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq by December 31, 2011.", "The concluded agreements cover different issues and are intended by the parties to have different legal significance. The Strategic Framework Agreement is a nonlegal, political agreement under which the parties pledge to work cooperatively in a number of fields, including on diplomatic, security, economic, cultural, and law enforcement matters. In the area of security, the Agreement provides that the United States and Iraq shall \"continue to foster close cooperation concerning defense and security arrangements,\" which are to be undertaken pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement. The Strategic Framework Agreement also states that \"the temporary presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is at the request and invitation of the sovereign government of Iraq,\" and that the United States may not \"use Iraqi land, sea, or air as a launching or transit point for attacks against other countries[,] nor seek or request permanent bases or a permanent military presence in Iraq.\"", "The Security Agreement is a legally binding agreement that terminates within three years, unless terminated at an earlier date by either Party. The Security Agreement contains provisions addressing a variety of military matters. As previously mentioned, it establishes a deadline for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Iraq by December 31, 2011. The Agreement also contains numerous provisions resembling those regularly contained in SOFAs concluded by the United States. Specifically, the Agreement contains provisions concerning the parties' right to assert civil and criminal jurisdiction over U.S. forces, as well as provisions which establish rules and procedures applicable to U.S. forces relating to the carrying of weapons, the wearing of uniforms, entry and exit into Iraq, taxes, customs, and claims.", "The Security Agreement contains other rules and requirements which have traditionally not been found in SOFAs concluded by the United States, including provisions addressing combat operations by U.S. forces. Operations by U.S. forces pursuant to the Agreement must be approved by the Iraqi government and coordinated with Iraqi authorities through a Joint Military Operations Coordination Committee. U.S. forces are also permitted to arrest or detain persons in the course of operations under the Agreement. More broadly, the Security Agreement provides for \"strategic deliberations\" between the parties in the event of external or internal threat or aggression against Iraq, and provides that, as mutually agreed by the parties, the United States \"shall take appropriate measures, including diplomatic, economic, or military measures\" to deter the threat.", "The Security and Strategic Framework Agreements entered into force on January 1, 2009, following an exchange of diplomatic notes between the United States and Iraq. Although the agreements required approval on multiple levels by the Iraqi government, the Bush Administration did not submit the agreements to the Senate for its advice and consent as a treaty or request statutory authorization for the agreements by Congress.", "There has been some controversy regarding whether these agreements could properly be entered on behalf of the United States by the Executive without the participation of Congress. Security agreements authorizing the United States to take military action in defense of another country have typically been ratified as treaties. It could be argued that the Security Agreement, which contemplates the United States engaging in military operations in Iraq and potentially defending the Iraqi government from external or internal security threats, requires congressional authorization for it to be legally binding under U.S. law. On the other hand, because Congress has authorized the President to engage in military operations in Iraq, both pursuant to the 2002 Authorization to Use Military Force Against Iraq and subsequent appropriations measures, it has impliedly authorized the President to enter short-term agreements with Iraq which facilitate these operations.", "As of August 31, 2010, the United States withdrew the last major combat unit, the U.S. Army's 4 th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2 nd Infantry Division, allowing Iraq to officially take over combat operations within the country. The post-combat phase of operations, Operation New Dawn, included the presence of approximately 50,000 U.S. troops conducting stability operations, focusing on advising, assisting, and training Iraqi Security Forces in how to handle their own security. As of December 18, 2011, the United States completed the withdrawal of U.S. forces, transitioning responsibility for security within Iraq to the Iraqi government."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Survey of Current Status of Forces Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The charts below provide a list of current agreements according to the underlying source of authority, if any, for each of the SOFAs.

The United States entered into a SOFA with the Philippines in 1993 after concluding a mutual defense treaty with the country in 1952.
