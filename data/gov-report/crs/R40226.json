In addition, states using CHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums were required to ensure that CHIP minimum benefits were provided and CHIP cost-sharing ceilings were met. Under Medicaid, including a Medicaid expansion CHIP program, states may implement a premium assistance program if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective for the state. Under Medicaid, an individual's enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if paying the premiums, deductible, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations of the employer plan is less expensive than the state's expected cost of directly providing Medicaid-covered services. To meet the comprehensiveness test under Medicaid, states are required to provide coverage for those Medicaid-covered services that are not included in the private plans. In other words, they must provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage. It has proved prohibitive for many employer plans and states to meet all of these requirements. To circumvent these restrictions, most states operating CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs do so under waivers. ", "CHIPRA creates a new state plan option for providing premium assistance. States have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents of Medicaid and/or CHIP-eligible children where the family has access to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) coverage, if the employer pays at least 40% of the total premium (and meets certain other requirements). Under CHIPRA, a state offering premium assistance may not require CHIP-eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan; individuals eligible for CHIP and for employment-based coverage may choose to enroll in regular CHIP rather than the premium assistance program. The premium assistance subsidy will generally be the difference between the worker's out-of-pocket premium that included the child(ren) versus only covering the employee. For employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements, a wrap-around is required. ", "For the child's coverage using premium assistance, no cost-effectiveness test is required regarding the cost of the private coverage (plus any necessary wrap-around) relative to regular CHIP coverage. CHIPRA establishes a separate test for family coverage. If the CHIP cost of covering the entire family in the employer-sponsored plan is less than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone, then the premium assistance subsidy may be used to pay the entire family's share of the premium. In states that offered premium assistance, CHIPRA requires states and participating employers to do outreach. Finally, states are permitted to establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have at least one employee who is a CHIP-eligible pregnant woman or at least one member of the family is a CHIP-eligible child.

BEA revises its most recent estimates of state per capita personal income on an annual basis to incorporate revised and newly available source data on population and income. It also undertakes a comprehensive data revision every few years that may result in upward and downward revisions to each of the component parts of personal income, one of which is employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds.

For the purposes of computing Medicaid FMAPs beginning with FY2006, any significantly disproportionate employer pension or insurance fund contribution will be disregarded in computing state per capita income, but not U.S. per capita income. A significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contribution is defined as any identifiable employer contribution towards pension or other employee insurance funds that is estimated to accrue to residents of such state for a calendar year (beginning with calendar year 2003) if the increase in the amount so estimated exceeds 25% of the total increase in personal income in that state for the year involved. For estimating and adjusting an FMAP already calculated as of the date of enactment for a state with a significantly disproportionate employer pension and insurance fund contribution, the Secretary must use the personal income data set originally used in calculating such FMAP. If in any calendar year the total personal income growth in a state is negative, an employer pension and insurance fund contribution for the purposes of calculating the state's FMAP for a calendar year shall not exceed 125% of the amount of such contribution for the previous calendar year for the state. No state would have its FMAP for a fiscal year reduced as a result of the application of this provision. Not later than May 15, 2009, the Secretary must submit to Congress a report on the problems presented by the current treatment of pension and insurance fund contributions in the use of Bureau of Economic Affairs calculations for the FMAP and for Medicaid and on possible alternative methodologies to mitigate such problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 615.
