[Section 804(b)] The Secretary,after consultation with the United States Trade Representative and the Commissioner of Customs,must promulgate regulations permitting pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugsfrom Canada into the United States.", "Limitation. [Section 804(c)] The regulationsmust ensure that all imported prescription drugs meet the same safety and efficacy standards as drugsapproved in the United States and that the importer comply with all information and reportingrequirements. The Secretary is permitted to adopt such rules as necessary to safeguard public healthor as a means to facilitate the importation of prescription drugs.", "Information and Records. [Section 804(d)] Drugimporters must provide information that includes the name and amount of the active ingredient ofthe drug, the dosage form of the drug, the date the drug is shipped, the quantity shipped, andinformation about its origin and destination. The importer must also supply the price paid by theimporter; the importer's name, address, and license number; the original source of the drug and theamount of each lot received from that source; and the manufacturer's lot or control number. Also,the importer or manufacturer must certify that the drug is FDA-approved, properly labeled, notadulterated, and not misbranded; and provide laboratory records of authenticity testing, includingdata, and evidence that testing was conducted in an approved U.S. laboratory. The importer isrequired to provide any other information that the Secretary determines is necessary to ensure thepublic health.

For a prescription drug not imported directly from the firstrecipient in the foreign country, there must be documentation demonstrating that each batch of thedrug has been statistically sampled and tested for authenticity and degradation prior to importation.", "Testing. [Section 804(e)] The importer or themanufacturer must conduct the required authenticity testing at a qualified U.S. laboratory.

[Section 804(j)] Congress declares that the Secretary should use discretion when enforcing thecurrent legal prohibition against persons importing drugs or devices. The Secretary should focusenforcement on cases where the importing may pose a significant threat to public health. When theimportation is clearly for personal use and the prescription drug or device does not appear to presentan unreasonable risk to the individual, the Secretary should exercise discretion to permit theimportation by the individual. The new law specifies two waiver procedures to allow individuals-- other than pharmacists and wholesalers -- to bring prescription drugs into the United States fortheir personal use.", "The first deals with drugs from Canada. The Secretary is required to publish regulations thatgrant waivers for an individual to import for personal up to a 90-day supply of a drug from a licensedCanadian pharmacy.

[Section 804(l)] Oncean importation program is implemented, the Secretary can move to terminate it under specifiedconditions. If the Secretary certifies to Congress, between 12 and 18 months after the regulationsare implemented, that, based on substantial evidence, in the opinion of the Secretary, the benefits ofthe implementation of the import program do not outweigh any detriment, drug imports under thesection would cease 30 days after the certification is submitted. (9) However, the Secretary'scertification may not be submitted unless, after a public hearing, the Secretary finds it is more likelythan not that implementation will result in an increased risk to the public health; identifies, inqualitative and quantitative terms, the nature and causes of the increased risk; considers whethermeasures can be taken to avoid, reduce, or mitigate the increased risk and, if those measures wouldrequire additional statutory authority, to report to Congress describing needed legislation; identifies,in qualitative and quantitative terms, the benefits that would result from the program, includingreductions in the cost of drugs to U.S. consumers, which would allow them to obtain neededmedications without foregoing other necessities of life; and, in specific terms, compares thedetriment with those benefits and determines that the benefits do not outweigh the detriment.", "Authorization of Appropriations.

It is doubtful whether theSecretary will implement these import provisions given the Act contains the provision that led bothSecretaries Shalala and Thompson to decline. That provision requires that the Secretary certify thatimported drugs would be safe and at reduced cost before implementing import regulations.
