Oil sand is sold in two forms: (1) as a raw bitumen that must be blended with a diluent for transport and (2) as a synthetic crude oil (SCO) after being upgraded to constitute a light crude. Bitumen is a thick tar-like substance that must be upgraded by adding hydrogen or removing some of the carbon.", "Exploitation of oil sands in Canada began in 1967, after decades of research and development that began in the early 1900s.

Demonstration projects continued through the 1940s and 1950s.

However, a number of obstacles, including the remote and difficult topography, scattered deposits, and lack of water, have resulted in an uneconomic oil resource base. Only modest amounts are being produced in Utah and California. U.S. oil sands would likely require significant R&D and capital investment over many years to be commercially viable. An issue for Congress might be the level of R&D investment in oil sands over the long term.", "As oil sands production in Canada is predicted to increase to 2.8 million barrels per day by 2015, environmental issues are a cause for concern. Air quality, land use, and water availability are all impacted. Socio-economic issues such as housing, skilled labor, traffic, and aboriginal concerns may also become a constraint on growth.

However, infrastructure expansions and skilled labor are necessary to significantly increase the flow of oil from Canada. For example, many refineries are optimized to refine only specific types of crude oil and may not process bitumen from oil sands. One issue likely to be contentious is the regulatory permitting of any new refinery capacity because of environmental concerns such as water pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases.", "Challenges such as higher energy costs, infrastructure requirements, and the environment, may slow the growth of the industry. For example, high capital and energy input costs have made some projects less economically viable despite recent high oil prices.

By 1919, the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta (SIRCA), predecessor to the Alberta Research Council (ARC), became interested in oil sands development. One of its newly recruited scientists, Dr. Karl Clark, began his pioneering work on a hot-water flotation process for separating the bitumen from the sand. In this separation process, the mined oil sand is mixed with water and a sodium hydroxide base and rotated in a horizontal drum at 80 degrees centigrade.

Eventually, in 1978, the Energy Resources Conservation Board of Alberta approved Syncrude's proposal to build a $1 billion plant that would produce up to 129,000 barrels per day. However, ARCO, which represented 30% of the project, pulled out of the consortium as costs of the plant climbed toward $2 billion. At that point (1978) the federal and provincial governments joined in. The federal government purchased a 15% share, Alberta a 10% share, and Ontario 5%, making up the 30% deficit. At the time, the Canadian government was promoting the goal of energy self-sufficiency, and the Alberta government agreed to a 50/50 profit-sharing arrangement instead of normal royalties for Syncrude.", "The Alberta Energy Company purchased 20% of Syncrude and then sold 10% of its share to Petrofina Canada, Ltd., and Hudson Bay Oil and Gas, Ltd.

In 1984, the government of Alberta agreed to a new royalty structure for oil sands producers coinciding with Syncrude's capital expansion plans. In 1985, the Alberta government announced that existing oil sands operations and new plants would not be taxed on revenues, and the petroleum gas revenue tax would be phased out.

In this process, steam is added to the oil sands via vertical wells, and the liquefied bitumen is pumped to the surface using the same well.", "But a relatively new technology\u2014steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD)\u2014has demonstrated that its operations can recover as much as 70% of the bitumen in-place. Using SAGD, steam is added to the oil sands using a horizontal well, then the liquefied bitumen is pumped simultaneously using another horizontal well located below the steam injection well (see Figure 4 ). The SAGD process has a recovery advantage over the CSS process, which only recovers 25%-30% of the natural bitumen. Also, the lower steam to oil ratio (the measurement of the volume of steam required to extract the bitumen) of SAGD results in a more efficient process that uses less natural gas. SAGD operations are limited to thick, clean sand reservoirs, but it is reported by the industry that most of the new in-situ projects will use SAGD technology. A number of enhanced SAGD methods are being tested by the Alberta Research Council. They could lead to increased recovery rates, greater efficiency, and reduced water requirements.", "The emerging Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) technology operates similarly to SAGD. But instead of steam, ethane, butane, or propane is injected into the reservoir to mobilize the hydrocarbons towards the production well. This process eliminates the cost of steam generators and natural gas. This method requires no water and processing or recycling and is 25% lower in capital costs than the SAGD process. Operating costs are half that of the SAGD process.", "A fourth technique is cold production, suitable for oil sands lighter than those recovered using thermal assisted methods or mining. This process involves the co-production of sand with the bitumen and allows the oil sands to flow to the well bore without heat. Imperial Oil uses this process at its Cold Lake site. Oil sand produced using in-situ techniques is sold as natural bitumen blended with a diluent for pipeline transport.", "The overall result of technology R&D has been to reduce operating costs from over $20/barrel in the early 1970s to $8-12/barrel in 2000.

The coking process is highly aromatic and produces a low quality product. The product must be converted in a refinery to a lighter gas and distillate. Hydrocracking also cracks the oil into light oils but produces no coke byproduct. Hydrocracking requires natural gas for conversion to hydrogen.

Recovery rates are lower than with mining, at 40%-70%, and the price of energy needed for production is a much larger factor. The SAGD operations are typically phased-in over time, thus are less risky, make less of a \"footprint\" on the landscape than a mining operation, and require a smaller workforce.

Natural gas accounts for 15% of the operating costs in mining operations compared to 60% of operating costs in SAGD in-situ production.

For example, royalties from oil sands were less than $100 million in 1999, then rose to $700 million in 2000/2001, but fell in 2002/2003 to about $200 million as production continued to rise. Royalties from oil sands rose dramatically in 2005/2006 to $1 billion, and the Government of Alberta forecasts royalties of $2.5 billion in 2006/2007 and $1.8 billion in 2007/2008. Oil price fluctuations are the primary cause for such swings in royalty revenues.", "The Albertan provincial government established a Royalty Review Panel in February 2007 to examine whether Alberta was receiving its fair share of royalty revenues from the energy sector and to make recommendations if changes are needed. In its September 2007 report, the panel concluded that \"Albertans do not receive their fair share from energy development.\" When the oil sands industry was ranked against other heavy oil and offshore producers such as Norway, Venezuela, Angola, United Kingdom, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Alberta received the smallest government share. This is, however, a difficult comparison to make because it is not among oil sand producers only and the fiscal regimes of the various producing countries is dynamic. However, based on a general analysis by T.D. Securities, typically, on average, world royalty rates could add as much as 45% to operating costs while the 1% rate may add only 3% to operating costs.", "The Panel recommended keeping the \"pre-payout, post-payout\" framework intact (see footnote 52 ), which would retain the 1% pre-payout royalty rate, but in the post-payout phase, firms would be required to pay a higher net revenue royalty rate of 33% plus continue to pay the 1% base royalty.", "On October 25, 2007, the Alberta Government announced and published its response to the Royalty Review Panel's report. It retained the \"pre-payout,\" \"post-payout\" royalty framework but concluded that a sliding-scale rate structure would best achieve increasing the government's share of revenues from oil sands production. The pre-payout base rate would start at 1%, then increase for every dollar above US$55 per barrel (using the West Texas Intermediate or WTI price) reaching a maximum increase of 9% when prices are at or above $120 per barrel. In the post-payout phase, the net revenue rate will start at 25%, then rise for every dollar oil in priced above US$55 per barrel, reaching a maximum of 40% of net revenues when oil is $120 per barrel or higher. The new rate structure will take effect in 2009. The Government of Alberta has initiated negotiations with Suncor and Syncrude in an attempt to include them under the new oil sands royalty framework by 2009.", "Oil sand firms pay federal and provincial income taxes and some differences exist in the tax treatment of the oil sands and conventional oil industries. Since the Provincial 1996 Income Tax Act, both mineable and in-situ oil sand deposits are classified as a mineral resource for Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) purposes which means mineral deposits receive higher cost deductions than conventional oil and gas operations (i.e. acquisition costs and intangible drilling costs). The provincial government of Alberta has agreed to the 2007 federal budget proposal to eliminate the CCA deduction for oil sands. The Royalty Review Panel also supported this change in its report. The federal government of Canada, however, provided some balance by reducing the general federal corporate income tax rate from 22.1% to 15% beginning in 2012."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Markets", "paragraphs": ["Oil sand producers continue to look to the United States for the majority of their exports. Seventy-five percent of Canadian nonconventional oil exported to the United States is delivered to the Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) II in the Midwest. This region is well positioned to receive larger volumes of nonconventional oil from Canada because of its refinery capabilities. Several U.S.-based refinery expansions have been announced that would come online between 2007-2015. If Canada were to reach its optimistic forecasted oil sands output level of 5 mbd in 2030, and maintained its export level to the United States at around 90%, it would be exporting about 4.5 mbd to the United States. This would mean that imports from Canada would reach nearly 30% of all U.S. crude oil imports. U.S. refinery capacity is forecast to increase from 16.9 mbd in 2004 to nearly 19.3 mbd in 2030, a 2.4 mbd increase\u2014significant but perhaps not enough to accommodate larger volumes of oil from Canada, even if refinery expansions would have the technology to process heavier oil blends.

The Athabasca pipeline has capacity of 570,000 barrels per day (b/d) while the Corridor has capacity of less than 200,000 b/d. Current pipeline capacity has nearly reached its limit. However, there are plans to increase Corridor's capacity to 610,000 b/d by 2010.", "A number of new pipeline projects have been proposed or initiated that would increase the flow of oil from Canada to the United State's PADDs II, III, and V. Most of the new projects are scheduled to come online between 2008 and 2012. In addition, a couple of U.S. pipelines reversed their flow of crude oil (from south to north) to now carry Canadian heavy crude, originating from oil sands, to Cushing Oklahoma and Southeast Texas.

The oil sands industry has reduced its \"emission intensity\" by 29% between 1995-2004 while production was rising. CO 2 emissions have declined from 0.14 tons/bbl to about 0.08 tons/bbl or about 88 megatons since 1990. Alberta's GHG goals of 238 megatons of CO 2 in 2010, and 218 megatons CO 2 in 2020 are not expected to be met. Reducing air emissions is one of the most serious challenges facing the oil sands industry. However, according to the Pembina Institute, a sustainable energy advocate, greenhouse gas emissions intensity (CO 2 /barrel) from oil sands is three times as high as that from conventional oil production. The industry believes if it can reduce energy use it can reduce its emissions. As emissions per barrel of oil from oil sands decline overall, the Canadian government projects that total GHG emissions will continue to rise through 2020, attributing much of the increase to increased oil sands production.", "Water supply and waste water disposal are among the most serious concerns because of heavy use of water to extract bitumen from the sands. For an oil sands mining operation, about 2-3 barrels of water are used from the Athabasca river for each barrel of bitumen produced; but when recycled produced water is included, 0.5 barrels of \"make-up\" water is required, according to the Alberta Department of Energy. Oil sands projects currently divert 150 million cubic meters of water annually from the Athabasca River but are approved to use up to 350 million cubic meters. Concerns, however, arise over the inadequate flow of the river to maintain a healthy ecosystem and meet future needs of the oil sands industry. Additionally, mining operations impact freshwater aquifers by drawing down water to prevent pit flooding.", "The freshwater used for in-situ operations is needed to generate steam, separate bitumen from the sand, hydrotransport the bitumen slurry, and upgrade the bitumen to a light crude. For SAGD operations, 90-95% of all the water used is recycled. Since some water is lost in the treatment process, additional freshwater is needed. To minimize the use of new freshwater supplies, SAGD operators use saline water from deeper underground aquifers. The use of saline water, however, generates huge volumes of solid waste which has posed serious disposal problems.", "Wastewater tailings (a bitumen, sand, silt, and fine clay particles slurry) also known as \"fluid fine tailings\" are disposed in large ponds until the residue is used to fill mined-out pits. Seepage from the disposal ponds can result from erosion, breaching, and foundation creep. The principal environmental threat is the migration of tails to a groundwater system and leaks that might contaminate the soil and surface water. The tailings are expected to reach 1 billion cubic meters by 2020. Impounding the tailings will continue to be an issue even after efforts are made to use alternative extraction technology that minimizes the amount of tails. Tailings management criteria were established by the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board/Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency in June 2005. Ongoing extensive research by the Canadian Oil Sands Network for Research and Development (CONRAD) is focused on the consolidation of wastewater tailings, detoxifying tailings water ponds, and reprocessing tailings. Some R&D progress is being made in the areas of the cleanup and reclamation of tailings using bioremediation and electrocoagulation.", "The National Research Council of Canada (NRC) is conducting research to treat wastewater tailings and recover their byproduct residual bitumen, heavy metals, and amorphous solids (fertilizers).

The oil sands industry practice leaves land in its disturbed state and left to revegetate naturally. Operators, however, are responsible over the long term to restore the land to its previous potential.

Given U.S. oil sands' strategic importance, but limited commercial success as discussed above, what level of federal investment is appropriate to reach U.S. energy policy goals? While an estimated 11 billion barrels of U.S. oil sands may be significant if it were economic, it represents a small share of the potentially recoverable resource base of unconventional fuels (e.g., 800 billion barrels of potentially recoverable oil from oil shale and another 20 billion barrels of recoverable heavy oil). Where is the best return on the R&D dollar invested for increased domestic energy supply and what are the long-term prospects for commercial application of unconventional fuels technology?
