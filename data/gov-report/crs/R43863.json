Key findings include the following:", "No single label best describes all programs with a low-income focus, and no single trait characterizes those who benefit. Programs are highly diverse in their purpose, design, and target population. Readers should use caution in making generalizations about the programs described in this report. Total federal spending on low-income programs rose sharply between FY2008 and FY2009 as the Great Recession took hold. Spending ultimately peaked in FY2011, dropped in FY2012, and edged up again in FY2013. Total low-income spending in FY2013 totaled $744 billion, significantly higher than the FY2008 level of $561 billion but below the FY2010 level of $750 billion. Peak spending over the six years was $764 billion in FY2011. Health care is the single largest category of low-income spending, accounting for nearly half of the total, and drives overall trends. The single largest program within the health category is Medicaid. Cash aid and food assistance are the next largest categories, with food assistance seeing the largest growth over the six-year period. Other categories (in descending size) are education, housing and development, social services, employment and training, and energy assistance. Most low-income spending (82% in FY2013) is classified in budgetary terms as \"mandatory\" (or \"direct\"), which means the amount spent is a function of eligibility and payment rules established by Congress in authorizing laws. Congress determines the amount spent for the remaining \"discretionary\" programs through the annual appropriations process. Four programs accounted for 65% of low-income spending in FY2013, and 10 programs made up 82%. Medicaid alone contributed 39% of the total. In addition to Medicaid, the top four include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The disabled receive the single largest share of federal low-income spending, based on an analysis of spending for the top 10 programs in FY2011. The disabled received almost a third of such spending, primarily for health care and secondarily for cash aid. Working families with children received the next largest share of spending (including from the EITC and Additional Child Tax Credit), followed by the elderly. The bulk of spending for low-income elderly was in the health category. Less than 12% of total low-income spending in FY2011 went to families with nonelderly nondisabled adults who were not working."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The size and composition of federal spending directed toward low-income people is a focus of public policy.

", "Programs included in this report are distinct from social insurance programs such as Social Security, Medicare, or Unemployment Insurance. Those programs are financed largely by contributions from workers and employers and benefits are earned on the basis of an individual's work history. Social insurance plays a major antipoverty role in the United States, but participation is generally meant to be universal (providing insurance to the population at large against becoming poor) and not specifically targeted toward low-income people. ", "In contrast to social insurance, programs examined in this report are funded through general revenues and provide benefits and services to people with limited income either by tying eligibility to a specific measure of income, or by targeting assistance through funding allocation formulas or other need-related mechanisms. Some programs are highly targeted with detailed eligibility rules for individuals or households, while others encourage or prioritize services to low-income people within a broader target population group, such as the elderly.", "These programs attempt to ameliorate or mitigate the effects of low income by providing cash or noncash benefits to help people meet basic needs, such as food, housing, and health care. They also seek to address root causes of economic disadvantage by providing education, training, and other services to improve people's employability and earnings capacity. Some programs target assistance to communities with high concentrations of low-income people to compensate for their low tax capacities, and to help finance benefits and services for residents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Important Caveats", "paragraphs": ["While they share the common feature of an explicit low-income focus, programs discussed in this report are highly diverse in their purpose, design, and target population. They were established at different times, in response to different policy challenges, and not necessarily in coordination with one another. Readers should exercise caution in any attempt to generalize about these programs or draw conclusions from the information presented in this report.", "No single label accurately describes all programs in the report. Terms such as \"social welfare\" and \"social safety net\" are often understood to include social insurance programs, and are thus broader than the programs included here. \"Public welfare\" and \"public assistance\" are typically understood as a more narrow set of programs that primarily provide cash or near-cash benefits to low-income people. While such programs are included, programs that provide in-kind benefits and services also are discussed. \"Income-tested\" or \"means-tested\" might be used to describe these programs, but some target assistance toward low-income communities and do not apply a specific income or means test to individual participants or beneficiaries.", "The report examines programs by category, but the categories themselves are diverse. For example, the health category includes primary care for poor children and their families along with nursing home care for the elderly and disabled whose health costs may have depleted other income and assets. Cash aid includes traditional \"welfare\" in the form of cash assistance to needy families, but also includes pensions for needy veterans and two refundable tax credits for households with earnings, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). Food assistance includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), as well as subsidized meals for low-income schoolchildren and home-delivered meals for the elderly.", "Similarly, no single trait characterizes the people served by these programs. They include elderly and disabled individuals, children and their families, single adults and couples without children, workers and nonworkers, veterans, homeless people, refugees, students, and others. While some popular perceptions of \"welfare\" assume that beneficiaries are unemployed able-bodied adults of working age, the report demonstrates that people with disabilities actually account for the single largest share of spending under the 10 largest low-income programs. Families with children where an adult is working account for the next largest share of spending, followed by the elderly. Households where no able-bodied adult is working account for a relatively small share of spending under these programs. Readers should also note that most of the programs included in this report are relatively small, and serve a fraction of their potentially eligible target population.", "The report refers to the collective target population of the programs as persons with \"low\" or \"limited\" income, rather than \"poor\" people.

Following sections discuss spending trends by category and by budgetary classification (\"mandatory\" or \"discretionary\"). The next section looks specifically at spending and trends over the six-year period for the 10 largest programs included in the report, which together accounted for 82% of all low-income spending in FY2013. Key features of the 10 programs are summarized. Still focusing on the 10 largest programs, the next section presents an analysis of spending by the population groups served, including the elderly and disabled, families with children, and childless adults and couples.

Medicaid is intended to help specified categories of people who lack the income and resources to afford necessary medical care. Low-income parents, dependent children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities have been the primary target populations served by Medicaid, although the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ) expanded Medicaid eligibility to include most nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income below a specified level.

The refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) accounted for another 38% of cash aid spending, and more than 14% came from the refundable Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC). The EITC subsidizes the wages of low-income workers, with most benefits going to those with children.

As AFDC's successor, TANF is still sometimes viewed as traditional welfare for poor families; however, the majority of TANF expenditures are for activities other than cash aid. TANF aims to increase the flexibility of states in meeting several statutory goals, including assisting needy families so that children can remain in their homes; ending dependence of needy parents through job preparation, work, and marriage; preventing and reducing incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. In this report, TANF spending has been allocated among three categories\u2014cash aid, social services, and employment and training\u2014based on states' reporting of their actual expenditures.

The next largest area of food assistance spending is for programs that subsidize the costs of breakfast and lunch served to low-income schoolchildren; these programs aim to support learning readiness, promote healthy eating, and protect the health and well-being of low-income children. Related programs subsidize the costs of meals and snacks for children in child care and other out-of-school settings (and some low-income elderly and disabled adults in adult care settings) and for children during the summer when they lack access to school-based meal programs.

Methodology Used to Create Low-Income Program Database", "Selection of Low-Income Programs", "Programs were selected for inclusion in this report if they (1) have provisions that base an individual's eligibility or priority for service on a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income; (2) target resources in some way (e.g., through allocation formulas, variable matching rates) using a measure (or proxy) of low or limited income; or (3) prioritize services to low-income segments of a larger target population. ", "A few programs without an explicit low-income provision were included because either their target population is disproportionately poor or their purpose clearly indicates a presumption that participants will be low income. Such programs that serve disproportionately low-income people include the Indian Health Service, Homeless Assistance Grants, Indian Education programs, Title I Migrant Education, and Indian Human Services. Programs with purposes that presume a low-income target population include Adult Basic Education and Social Services Block Grants.", "Federal student loan programs were considered for inclusion because they determine benefit levels through the same need-analysis system that is used for Pell Grants and several smaller postsecondary education programs. However, this system results in students from relatively well-off families receiving assistance, as there is no absolute income ceiling on eligibility. Pell Grants are structured in such a way that the majority of recipients are low-income and the lowest-income students receive the largest benefits. Student loan programs are not as strongly targeted and therefore are not included in the report. ", "On the other hand, deliberations about whether to include the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) reached a different conclusion. The regular Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a nonrefundable credit and phases out at relatively high income levels. The ACTC is a refundable credit that allows families with no or insufficient tax liability to get all or part of the benefit they would otherwise receive from the CTC. Because of the refundable nature and other design features of the ACTC, it serves predominantly lower-income families . For example, for tax year 2012, 90% of returns that claimed the ACTC were filed by families with adjusted gross income (AGI) below $40,000 and 89% of the credit went to such families. Thus, the ACTC is included in the report.", "Because the report includes only programs with direct spending, it does not include tax provisions, with the exception of direct spending for the refundable portion of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the refundable ACTC.", "Finally, one program\u2014Developmental Disabilities Support and Advocacy Grants\u2014was included in the 2011 version of this report (CRS Report R41625, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income: Programs, Policy, and Spending, FY2008-FY2009 ) but dropped in the current version. Only one component of that program had a low-income targeting provision, and that component was below the $100 million threshold for inclusion in this analysis (see below).", "Categorization of Programs", "Most programs are easily assigned to broad categories, such as health, cash aid, food assistance, or education. A few, however, have multiple purposes or allowable activities. For some of these programs, spending can be disaggregated into the relevant categories. For example, using state reporting of actual expenditures, it is possible to estimate the amount of TANF obligations attributable to cash aid, social services, and employment and training. Other programs cannot be disaggregated and must be assigned to a single category. For example, Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees was categorized as health care, and Indian Human Services was categorized as social services although it also provides cash and housing assistance. ", "The social services category, in general, is not well-defined and some analysts might assign some programs\u2014and therefore dollars\u2014differently. Head Start, for example, could be considered an education program, since its purpose is to promote school readiness; however, it supports a very broad range of activities (including activities for children ages 0-3 in its Early Head Start component) that can best be characterized collectively as social services. Foster Care and Adoption Assistance both give cash to families or other care providers, but income support is not these programs' purpose or sole use of funding. Foster Care subsidizes maintenance payments and administrative activities (including case planning) on behalf of children who cannot remain safely at home, and Adoption Assistance helps facilitate the adoption of children who would otherwise lack permanent homes. Thus, these programs were categorized as social services and not cash assistance. Likewise, Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting is included in social services, rather than health care, because of the broad range of its intended purposes.", "Selection of Spending Measure", "New obligations incurred in the indicated fiscal year were chosen as the measure of spending for this report, although for many programs readers may be more accustomed to seeing appropriations (budget authority) or outlays. These spending concepts are related. Congress and the President enact budget authority through appropriations measures or other authorizing laws. Budget authority in turn allows federal agencies to incur obligations , through actions such as entering into contracts, employing personnel, and submitting purchase orders. Outlays represent the actual payment of these obligations, usually in the form of electronic transfers or checks issued by the Treasury Department. Obligations are used in this report because they are the most consistent measure available at the necessary level of detail for the majority of programs. The source of obligations data is the U.S. Budget Appendix for the second fiscal year (e.g., FY2015 budget appendix for final FY2013 obligations, FY2014 budget appendix for final FY2012 obligations, etc.).", "Obligations were either not available or not appropriate for a small number of programs. Because obligations were not available at the necessary program level, appropriations were used for the following: Transitional Cash and Medical Services for Refugees, Breast/Cervical Cancer Early Detection, the Title I Migrant Education Program, Social Services and Targeted Assistance for Refugees, and Foster Grandparents.", "For veterans' medical care, the Budget Appendix shows obligations for the entire program, not solely the income-tested component. Thus, estimated obligations for Priority Group 5 veterans (needy veterans without service-connected disabilities) were calculated from Department of Veterans Affairs data on obligations for Priority Groups 1-6 and 7-8 and the number of patients receiving care by individual priority group. ", "The Budget Appendix also does not show obligations solely for the low-income subsidy portion of the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Therefore, the report uses aggregate reimbursements for the low-income subsidy for the calendar year (instead of fiscal year), available from the annual report of the Medicare trustees.", "As noted above, TANF obligations provided in the Budget Appendix were disaggregated into the categories of cash aid, social services, and employment and training, based on states' reporting to the Department of Health and Human Services of their actual expenditures. ", "The Budget Appendix includes obligations for the Section 502 single-family rural housing loan program in combination with other programs in an aggregate amount for the Rural Housing Insurance Fund Account. Thus, loan subsidy budget authority (also found in the Budget Appendix) was used for the Section 502 program in this version of the report. In the 2011 version, loan subsidy outlays were used, adjusted for re-estimates provided in the Federal Credit Supplement to the U.S. Budget for the relevant years; however, budget authority has now been chosen as a better measure.", "Finally, the report uses obligations from the Budget Appendix for the ACTC in FY2009-FY2013. However, for FY2008, ACTC obligations shown in the Budget Appendix also include an unspecified amount for a one-time $300 per child tax rebate, authorized by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-185 ), which was not targeted on low-income families. That figure, which overstates the amount spent for the ACTC alone, was used in the 2011 version of this report with appropriate caveats. For the current version, however, data from the Internal Revenue Service Statistics of Income for tax year 2007 are used to provide a more accurate picture of the ACTC in FY2008.", "Spending Threshold", "Programs are included in this report if they had obligations in any year from FY2008 through FY2013 of at least $100 million. To simplify the analysis without significantly changing the overall picture, smaller programs were excluded, even if they met the low-income criteria. A few programs had spending above the threshold in some years but not in others. Spending totals cited throughout this report include these programs only for the years in which their obligations equaled or exceeded $100 million. In other words, each year's spending total is a snapshot of spending in that year for low-income programs that\u2014 in that year \u2014had obligations totaling at least $100 million. (See Table C-1 for all spending amounts for all programs in each year.)", "Comparison with Predecessor CRS Report Series", "From 1979 to 2006, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) issued a series of reports, typically every other year, called Cash and Noncash Benefits for Persons with Limited Income . The series was conceived and produced (except for the last edition in 2006) by [author name scrubbed], Specialist in Social Policy, who retired from CRS in 2004. In 2011, CRS published CRS Report R41625, Federal Benefits and Services for People with Low Income: Programs, Policy, and Spending, FY2008-FY2009 , as a replacement for the Cash and Noncash series. The current report is an update to the 2011 version. ", "The new report series uses different methodologies to select and categorize programs and measure spending; therefore, it cannot be considered an update of Cash and Noncash for various reasons. For example, the older series did not include certain programs that are now included, such as the low-income subsidy under Medicare Part D, Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and Community Development Block Grants. The older series also had no minimum spending threshold, so it included smaller programs that are not included here. In addition, the older series included student loans, which are no longer included for reasons explained above. Several programs were also categorized differently in the previous series (e.g., Head Start was categorized as education, Foster Care and Adoption Assistance as cash aid, and Homeless Assistance Grants as social services). The older series used different measures of spending for different programs, while the new series uses obligations wherever possible. The older series also provided estimates of state-local spending, which are not included here. ", "Finally, the older series traced spending back to 1968, which is beyond the scope of the current series. Changes in programs and appropriations accounts over time make it virtually impossible to trace obligations backward with precision. However, an analysis of long-term spending trends for 10 major needs-tested programs, using outlays, is available in CRS Report R41823, Low-Income Assistance Programs: Trends in Federal Spending , by [author name scrubbed].", "Appendix B. Methodology Used for Analysis of Spending by Population", "The allocations of federal spending in FY2011 under the 10 largest low-income programs by population groups (see \" Spending for the 10 Largest Programs by Population \") are estimates based on a specific methodology and available data. These estimates also rely upon certain simplifying assumptions and hence, represent an approximate division of spending among the population groups.", "Note that for most programs, data collected in conjunction with the administration of a program (administrative data) were used as the basis of making the allocations among population groups. However, programs use different definitions of \"elderly\" and \"disabled\" to determine eligibility and program requirements, so the population groupings are not consistent among all programs. For example, Medicaid uses age 65 to determine who is elderly, while a person is considered elderly for purposes of the SNAP program at age 60.", "Medicaid", "As noted earlier, the analysis uses FY2011 because it is the latest year for which data to divide spending among population groups are available for Medicaid. The allocation of Medicaid spending is based on a combination of administrative data and data from the Census Bureau's March 2011 Current Population Survey (CPS). FY2011 Medicaid administrative data report that, of total Medicaid expenditures in that year, 23% was received by the elderly and 43% by disabled recipients. These percentages were directly used to allocate federal Medicaid spending among those two population categories. ", "However, Medicaid administrative data are not sufficient for allocating spending to the population groups representing nonelderly and nondisabled beneficiaries. (For example, they do not include information on whether a family had earnings.) An analysis of March 2011 CPS data was used to determine the allocation of federal spending among those population groups. The CPS identifies individuals covered by Medicaid, and the Census Bureau provides an estimate of the \"market value\" of Medicaid for those covered. The CPS also provides background demographic and economic characteristics of the population, including age, disability, whether the individual is in a family with children, and whether the individual was working or not. These background characteristics were used to identify Medicaid beneficiaries in families with children, as well as childless adult recipients (not aged or disabled) and whether any adult (aged 18 or older) in the family was employed in March 2011. Total Medicaid \"market values\" were computed for each population category, which determined each population category's share of total Medicaid market values for the nonelderly, nondisabled population. These shares were then applied to the 34% of Medicaid spending that remained, after spending was allocated to the elderly and disabled, to determine how much federal Medicaid spending was allocated to the population categories of families with children and childless adults and couples.", "Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program", "The allocation of federal SNAP spending is based on an analysis of the FY2011 SNAP Quality Control Data files, administrative data that include information on the demographic and economic characteristics of SNAP participants and households. The information is for the full fiscal year, but the data are collected monthly and tabulations of them represent a monthly average. ", "SNAP households were placed into six categories that were totally inclusive and mutually exclusive in the following order: households with an aged member, households with a disabled member, households with children and earnings, households with children without earnings, childless adults or couples with earnings, childless adults or couples without earnings. If a household could be classified in multiple categories, it was placed in the first category for which it met criteria for inclusion. For example, if the household had an aged member but also had children, it was placed in the \"aged\" category. ", "Supplemental Security Income", "The allocation of federal SSI spending to the elderly and disabled is based on administrative data collected and published by the Social Security Administration. The share of spending for the aged and disabled in this report is from Table 2, SSI Annual Statistical Report, 2013 .", "Earned Income Tax Credit ", "For the purpose of this report, EITC spending reflects obligations for the refundable portion of the tax credit. The Internal Revenue Service collects and publishes information on the refundable portion of the EITC in its Statistics of Income (SOI) data, derived from information on filed tax forms. The information in this report is based on the division of the refundable portion of the EITC for tax year 2010 (which would be paid in FY2011) between those filers who claimed the credit based on the presence of children versus those who claimed the credit based on having no children. ", "Medicare Part D Low-Income Subsidy", "The allocation of the Medicare Part D prescription drug Low-Income Subsidy between the elderly and disabled is based on unpublished information obtained by CRS from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). They estimated that the elderly account for 55% of the total low-income subsidy, with the disabled accounting for the remaining 45% of the subsidy. ", "Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers", "The allocation of Section 8 spending among the population groups is based on an analysis of administrative data collected by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. FY2011 data were not available for Section 8; thus FY2010 data were used for these estimates. As with the SNAP information, households were categorized into population groups in the following order: households with an elderly member; households with a disabled head or child; households with children with earnings; households with children without earnings; households without children (or aged or disabled members) with earnings; and households without children (or aged or disabled members) without earnings. ", "The Section 8 administrative data use an annual accounting period, representing the characteristics of a household over a year rather than in a month. Thus, families with earnings represent those who had any earnings over a year, rather than earnings in a month. Additionally, the disability information available for Section 8 households was more limited than that for SNAP, with the data only permitting identification of households with a disabled head or disabled child. Rent subsidies were tallied for each of these population shares, with federal Section 8 spending allocated based on each population's share of total subsidies. ", "Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ", "This report divides TANF spending among three categories: cash assistance, social services, and employment and training. For the analysis of spending by population group, social services and employment and training expenditures were placed in the \"Education/Services\" category.", "TANF cash assistance was allocated among the population groups based on TANF administrative data, which include information on demographic and other characteristics of families receiving TANF cash assistance. The information is for the full fiscal year, but the data are collected monthly and tabulations of them represent a monthly average. Using these data, TANF families were classified into three population groups: ", "Disabled, representing families with a parent receiving SSI (not TANF cash), and a cash supplement paid on behalf of the children in the family from TANF; Families with children with earnings, representing those families with adult TANF recipients who had earnings; Families with children without earnings, representing families with adult TANF recipients who had no earnings and families without adult recipients (other than those with parents receiving SSI).", "TANF benefit amounts for these three categories were totaled, and federal TANF cash assistance spending was then allocated among the three population categories based on their shares of total cash assistance benefits from the administrative data files.", "Appendix C.

The table indicates the general concept used but not the specific application. For example, the table might indicate that federal poverty guidelines (FPG) are used as a concept in determining income eligibility for a particular program, but it does not indicate the specific percent of FPG that is used. Likewise, the table might show that a program uses formula allocation factors to direct federal resources toward areas with the greatest need, but it does not identify the specific factors or their weighting. Readers are referred to the fact sheets in Appendix D , relevant CRS reports, or the statutes themselves for these details.", " Table C-3 shows the type of federal assistance provided (typically formula grants, competitive or discretionary grants, or direct benefits) and the immediate recipients of this assistance. As noted in the table, \"immediate\" recipient refers to the level of government or the organization that directly receives the federal grant or award. Many programs require that funds be further distributed (by formula or other criteria) to other units of government or organizations. For example, federal grants may be awarded by formula to states, but states are then required to subaward these funds to local governments or other entities. This table only shows the \"immediate\" grantee. The table also indicates whether a program has provisions for participation by U.S. territories or residents or organizations located within the territories. The specific details of these provisions are not provided in the table; readers are referred to statutory language or the federal agency that administers the program for this information.", "Appendix D. Program Fact Sheets", "The following fact sheets provide brief information about each program included in this report's analysis.

States that use the CHIP Medicaid expansion option must provide the full range of mandatory Medicaid benefits as well as all optional services specified in their state Medicaid plans. Alternatively, states may enroll CHIP Medicaid expansion children in Alternative Benefit Plans, which must include the same \"essential health benefits\" provided in plans available through the health insurance exchanges established under the ACA. All CHIP Medicaid expansion children are entitled to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) coverage, which effectively eliminates any state-defined limits on the amount, duration, and scope of any benefit listed in Medicaid statute. CHIP Medicaid expansion programs must follow Medicaid's cost-sharing rules which generally exempt children from program participation fees and service-related cost-sharing. In general, for separate CHIP programs under which the majority of children are enrolled, states may offer one of three benefit options. As one option, states may elect to provide one of the following \"benchmark\" benefit packages: (1) the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield preferred provider plan offered under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), (2) the health coverage that is offered and generally available to state employees, and (3) the health coverage that is offered by a health maintenance organization (HMO) with the largest commercial (non-Medicaid) enrollment in the state. As a second option, states may elect to offer \"benchmark-equivalent\" coverage with the same actuarial value as one of the benchmark packages listed above. As a third option, states may elect to offer \"Secretary-approved\" coverage for which benefits are appropriate for the target population. States with separate CHIP programs may vary cost-sharing requirements by family income, but the total annual aggregate cost-sharing (including premiums, copayments, and similar charges) for a family may not exceed 5% of total income in a year, and certain services such as preventive care are exempt from cost-sharing. Under certain conditions, states may also provide premium assistance for health insurance offered through private insurance arrangements for Medicaid children (including CHIP children) and their parents. States may seek CMS approval to waive many of the basic benefit rules described above to conduct demonstration projects under the Section 1115 authority that test alternative methods of meeting the overall purpose of CHIP. ", "Individual eligibility criteria: Target populations are defined by states within federal parameters. Children must be under age 19, lack health insurance, and not be qualified for regular Medicaid. States may set the upper income limit for targeted children at up to 200% of federal poverty guidelines or 50 percentage points above the applicable pre-CHIP (1997) Medicaid income level. States may seek federal approval to serve higher-income children. States also may cover pregnant women who lack health insurance and meet specified income thresholds. The ACA requires states to maintain CHIP child eligibility standards (as of March 23, 2010) through September 30, 2019, as a condition for receiving payments under Medicaid. Beginning January 1, 2014, in determining CHIP eligibility, states must use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) income counting rules, which include a standard 5% income disregard. Also beginning January 1, 2014, states are required to transition CHIP children ages 6 through 18 in families with MAGI income less than 133% of federal poverty guidelines to Medicaid.", "Form and recipient of federal assistance: Formula grants to states.

Annual allotments are available for two years, with unspent funds available for redistribution to shortfall states. ", "Matching or related requirements: State expenditures are matched at an \"enhanced\" federal medical assistance percentage (E-FMAP). The E-FMAP for CHIP lowers the state's share of CHIP expenditures by 30% compared to the regular Medicaid FMAP. The CHIP E-FMAP rate is subject to a ceiling of 85% and a floor of 65%. From FY2016 through FY2019, the ACA increases the E-FMAP rate by 23 percentage points (not to exceed 100%) for most CHIP expenditures.

In addition, states can use waiver authority (for example, under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act) to tailor benefit packages to specified Medicaid enrollee groups. Under the traditional Medicaid benefits package, federal law requires states to cover certain services; other services may be offered at state option. Examples of mandatory services for most eligibility groups include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, services provided by qualified federal health centers and free-standing birth clinics, laboratory and x-ray services, physician services, pregnancy-related services, tobacco cessation services for pregnant women, family planning, non-emergency transportation, nursing facility services for individuals 21 and older, and home health care for those entitled to nursing home care. Examples of optional services provided for most eligibility groups in many states include prescription drugs, physician-directed clinic services, other licensed practitioners (e.g., optometrists, podiatrists, psychologists), inpatient psychiatric care for the elderly and individuals under age 21, nursing facility services for individuals under age 21, physical therapy, and prosthetic devices. As an alternative to traditional benefits, states have the option to provide alternative benefit plans (ABPs) to state-specified groups. ABPs may cover fewer benefits than traditional Medicaid, but must cover at least the 10 \"essential health benefits\" required of plans in the health insurance exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Under both traditional benefits and ABPs, most Medicaid children under age 21 are entitled to Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) services, which include well-child visits, immunizations, screening services at regular intervals, and medical care that is necessary to correct or ameliorate identified conditions. Beginning January 1, 2014, states that implement the ACA Medicaid expansion must provide ABPs to the newly eligible enrollees (with exceptions for special-needs subgroups).", "Individual eligibility criteria: Individuals must meet financial (i.e., income and sometimes resource) and nonfinancial (i.e., categorical) requirements. Federal law defines more than 50 potentially eligible population groups; some groups are mandatory (all states must cover them) and others are optional (states may cover them at their discretion). In some cases, income eligibility standards are tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines. For example, Medicaid mandatory coverage groups include pregnant women and children under age 6 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty; children ages 6-18 with family incomes at or below 133% of poverty; certain parents and children in working families who are entitled to Medicaid for at least 6 months and up to 12 months if their income does not exceed 185% of poverty (i.e., Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA)); individuals who qualify for Medicare Part A whose incomes do not exceed 100% of poverty (Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs)); and individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A with incomes between 100% and 120% of poverty (Specified Low-Income Beneficiaries (SLMs)). Mandatory groups also include families who qualify via rules applicable to the former Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program; also, families who lose Medicaid as a result of increased spousal support or earned income may receive TMA for four months. Medicaid optional groups with income eligibility standards tied directly to specified percentages of the federal poverty guidelines include pregnant women and infants with incomes between 133% and 185% of poverty; CHIP-financed targeted low-income children; disabled and elderly (age 65+) individuals with incomes up to 100% of poverty; disabled working individuals whose family income does not exceed 250% of poverty; and individuals who would be QMBs except that their incomes are between 120% and 135% of poverty (i.e., Qualifying Individuals (QI-1s)). Beginning January 1, 2014, the ACA required states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include most nonelderly, nonpregnant individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty guidelines (effectively 138% with the 5% income disregard). However, in the June 28, 2012, decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , the Supreme Court held that the federal government cannot terminate current Medicaid program federal matching funds if a state does not expand its Medicaid program. The U.S. Supreme Court decision effectively made the ACA Medicaid expansion optional. The ACA also required states to transition to a new income counting rule based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) for most non-aged eligibility groups beginning January 1, 2014.", "Form and recipient of federal assistance: Partial reimbursement to states of eligible expenditures, with no cap on federal spending.

The FMAP ranges from a statutory low of 50% to a statutory high of 83%. Medicaid administrative expenditures are generally matched at a 50% rate, with certain exceptions.
