Proponents of a needle exchange program contend that such programs reduce the spread of HIV among illegal drug users by reducing the incidence of shared needles. Opponents of these efforts contend that such programs amount to the government sanctioning illegal drugs by supplying drug-addicted persons with the tools to use them. In addition, they contend that public health concerns raised about the spread of AIDS and HIV through shared contaminated needles should be addressed through drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.

To prevent the implementation of the initiative, Congress had 30 days to pass a resolution of disapproval from the date the medical marijuana ballot initiative (Initiative 59) was certified by the Board of Elections and Ethics.

Students who are District of Columbia residents and who are from families with incomes not exceeding 185% of the poverty level are eligible to apply for scholarships valued at up to $7,500 to cover the costs of tuition, fees, and transportation expenses associated with attending a participating private elementary or secondary school located in the District of Columbia. Students are selected to receive scholarships through a lottery. Scholarship recipients remain eligible to continue to participate in the program in subsequent years, so long as their family income does not exceed 200% of the poverty level. Students enrolled in public schools identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act are given priority in receiving scholarships (through weighting procedures in the lottery); however, all students meeting program eligibility criteria are eligible for scholarships regardless of whether they were previously enrolled in public or private schools.", "The demonstration project includes an evaluation component. Among the issues required to be evaluated as part of the program are the academic achievement of scholarship recipients compared with non-recipients, the success of the program in expanding school choice options, and the impact of the program on students and public schools in the District of Columbia. As of the 2005-2006 school year, 68 of the 109 private schools located in the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the program. By Fall 2005, a total of 4,047 eligible students had applied for scholarships under the program, and 1,716 scholarship recipients had been enrolled in 60 participating private schools. Approximately 10% of the estimated 40,500 students eligible to participate in the program have applied for scholarships.", "H.R. 5576 would appropriate $14.8 million for the program, of which up to $1.8 million may be used to fund assessments.

The increased income eligibility thresholds proposed in S. 3660 were incorporated into the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 ( H.R. 6111 ), as passed by the House and Senate.

Under this schedule, the fiscal year for public schools begins more than a month after the start of the academic year.

He further stated that this would result in the District of Columbia government's audit report for FY2007 containing a qualification based on a departure from GAAP and Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) requirements. He also noted that it may cost up to $15 million to complete the transition from one fiscal year calendar to another.", "Changing the fiscal year from the period of October 1 through September 30 to the period of July 1 though June 30 also would require a \"transition\" fiscal year. Presumably, the transition fiscal year would be a nine month fiscal year the last year before commencing to operate on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year.
