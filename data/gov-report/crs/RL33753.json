Until April 2007, the Coast Guard pursued these programs as a single, integrated acquisition program that was known as the Integrated Deepwater System (IDS) program or Deepwater program for short. Since April 2007, the Coast Guard has pursued them as separate acquisition programs. These acquisition programs include plans for, among other things, 91 new cutters, 124 new small boats, and 247 new or modernized airplanes, helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).", "The Coast Guard's proposed FY2012 budget submission proposed to eliminate the use of \"Deepwater\" as a term for grouping or referring collectively to these acquisition programs.

The management and execution of what was then the single, integrated Deepwater program was strongly criticized by various observers. House and Senate committees held several oversight hearings on the program. Bills were introduced to restructure or reform the program in various ways. Coast Guard and industry officials acknowledged certain problems in the program's management and execution and defended the program's management and execution in other respects. The Coast Guard announced a number of reform actions that significantly altered the service's approach to Deepwater acquisition (and to Coast Guard acquisition in general). Among these was the change from a single, integrated Deepwater acquisition program to a collection of separate acquisition programs.", "The Coast Guard's management of these acquisition programs, including implementation of recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), has been a topic of continuing congressional oversight.

Rather than replacing its deepwater-capable legacy assets through a series of individual acquisition programs, the Coast Guard initially decided to pursue the Deepwater acquisition effort as an integrated, system-of-systems acquisition, under which a combination of new and modernized cutters, patrol boats, and aircraft, along with associated C4ISR systems and logistics support, would be procured as a single, integrated package (i.e., a system of systems). The Coast Guard believed that a system-of-systems approach would permit Deepwater acquisition to be optimized (i.e., made most cost effective) at the overall Deepwater system-of-systems level, rather than suboptimized at the level of individual Deepwater platforms and systems. Private-Sector Lead Systems Integrator (LSI). To execute this system-of-systems acquisition approach, the Coast Guard initially decided to use a private-sector lead system integrator (LSI)\u2014an industry entity responsible for designing, building, and integrating the various elements of the package so that it met the Coast Guard's projected deepwater operational requirements at the lowest possible cost. The Coast Guard decided to use a private-sector LSI in part because the size and complexity of the Deepwater program was thought to be beyond the system-integration capabilities of the Coast Guard's then-relatively small in-house acquisition work force. Performance-Based Acquisition. The Coast Guard initially pursued the Deepwater program as a performance-based acquisition, meaning that the Coast Guard set performance requirements for the program and permitted the private-sector LSI some latitude in determining how the various elements of the Deepwater system would meet those requirements.", "The Coast Guard conducted a competition to select the private-sector LSI for the Deepwater program. Three industry teams competed, and on June 25, 2002, the Coast Guard awarded the role to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS)\u2014an industry team led by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman Ship Systems (NGSS). ICGS was awarded an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the Deepwater program that included a five-year baseline term that ended in June 2007, and five potential additional award terms of up to five years (60 months) each. On May 19, 2006, the Coast Guard announced that it was awarding ICGS a 43-month first additional award term, reflecting good but not excellent performance by ICGS.

Although Deepwater acquisition programs continued (until the FY2012 budget submission) to appear in the budget under the common heading IDS, the Coast Guard since April 2007 has been pursuing Deepwater acquisition programs as individual programs, rather than as elements of a single, integrated program. The Coast Guard states that it is still using a systems approach to optimizing its acquisition programs, including the Deepwater acquisition programs, but that the system being optimized is now the Coast Guard as a whole, as opposed to the Deepwater subset of programs. Coast Guard as System Integrator. The Coast Guard announced in April 2007 that, among other things, it would assume the lead role as systems integrator for all Coast Guard Deepwater assets (as well as other major Coast Guard acquisitions as appropriate). The Coast Guard is phasing out its reliance on ICGS as a private-sector LSI for Deepwater acquisition, and shifting system-integration responsibilities to itself. To support this shift, the Coast Guard is increasing its in-house system-integration capabilities. Defined-Based Acquisition. The Coast Guard decided to shift from performance-based acquisition to the use of more-detailed specifications of the capabilities that various Deepwater assets are to have. The Coast Guard states that although this new approach involves setting more-detailed performance specifications, it does not represent a return to minutely detailed specifications such as the Military Specification (MilSpec) system once used in Department of Defense (DOD) acquisition programs.

For example, the Coast Guard is planning to buy a \"reprocurement data licensing package\" from Bollinger Shipyards. This information package, according to project officials, is expected to provide the Coast Guard with the specifications to allow full and open competition of future FRCs. Our previous work has shown that when the government owns technical specifications, its does not need to rely on one contractor to meet requirements. As part of its acquisition strategy for the OPC, the Coast Guard plans to award multiple preliminary design contracts and then select the best value contract design for a detailed design and production contract. This planned acquisition strategy will also include an option for a data and licensing package, similar to the FRC.

Resource directorate officials told us they do not include risks in the QARC if those risks contradict the Coast Guard's current budget request. For example, the resource directorate did not include the risk related to spare parts for the MPA in the fiscal year 2010 reports to Congress because the Coast Guard did not request funding for spare parts. DHS officials told us that they do not remove medium and high risks from the report. Office of Management and Budget officials stated that they will discuss several items with the Coast Guard, including factors that the agency may want to consider with regard to the medium and high risks identified in their draft submissions, but that the Office of Management and Budget does not direct the Coast Guard to remove medium or high risks from the reports before they are transmitted.

The Coast Guard has developed baselines for some assets, most of which have been approved by DHS, that indicate the estimated total acquisition cost could be as much as $29.3 billion, or about $5 billion over the $24.2 billion baseline. But additional cost growth is looming because the Coast Guard has yet to develop revised baselines for all the Deepwater assets, including the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC)\u2014the largest cost driver in the Deepwater Program. In addition, the Coast Guard's most recent 5-year budget plan, included in DHS's fiscal year 2012 budget request, indicates further cost and schedule changes not yet reflected in the asset baselines. The reliability of the cost estimates and schedules for selected assets is also undermined because the Coast Guard did not follow key best practices for developing these estimates. Coast Guard and DHS officials agree that the annual funding needed to support all approved Deepwater baselines exceeds current and expected funding levels in this fiscal climate. This contributes to churn in program baselines when programs are not able to execute schedules as planned. The Coast Guard's acquisition directorate has developed several action items to help address this mismatch by prioritizing acquisition program needs, but these action items have not been adopted across the Coast Guard.", "The estimated total acquisition cost of the Deepwater Program, based on approved program baselines as of May 2011, could be as much as approximately $29.3 billion, or about $5 billion more than the $24.2 baseline approved by DHS in 2007. This represents an increase of approximately 21 percent. As of May 2011, DHS had approved eight revised baselines from the 2007 program and the Coast Guard had approved two based on a delegation of approval authority from DHS. The increase in acquisition cost for these programs alone is about 43 percent. Table 2 compares each Deepwater asset's acquisition cost estimate from the 2007 program baseline with revised baselines, if available.", "As we reported last year, these revised baselines reflect the Coast Guard's and DHS's efforts to understand acquisition costs of individual Deepwater assets, as well as insight into the drivers of the cost growth. We previously reported on some of the factors contributing to increased costs for the NSC, MPA, and FRC. For example, the Coast Guard has attributed the more than $1 billion rise in FRC's cost to a reflection of actual contract costs from the September 2008 contract award and costs for shore facilities and initial spare parts not included in the original baseline. More recently, DHS approved the revised baseline for the C4ISR program in February 2011, 2 years after the Coast Guard submitted it to the department. The revised baseline includes more than $1 billion in additional acquisition costs to account for factors such as post-September 11 requirements and the need to maintain a common core system design beyond the previously established fiscal year 2014 end date.", "Additional cost growth is looming because the Coast Guard has yet to develop revised baselines for all of the Deepwater assets and even the approved baselines do not reflect all known costs. The Coast Guard has not submitted to DHS revised baselines for the OPC or the UAS because these two projects are pre-ADE-2. These two assets combined accounted for over 35 percent of the original baseline. The uncertainty regarding the OPC's cost estimate presents a key difficulty in determining what the Deepwater program may end up costing. The original 2007 estimate for one OPC was approximately $320 million. However, the Coast Guard's fiscal years 2012-2016 capital investment plan cites a planned $640 million in fiscal year 2015 for the lead cutter. Coast Guard resource and acquisition directorate officials stated that this $640 million is a point estimate for the lead cutter, some design work, and project management, but the estimate was not based on an approved life-cycle cost estimate and the Coast Guard has identified affordability as this program", "Coast Guard officials stated that some of the approved acquisition program baselines fall short of the true funding needs. This not only exacerbates the uncertainty surrounding the total cost of the Deepwater acquisition, but also contributes to the approved Deepwater Program no longer being achievable. For example, the NSC program's approved baseline reflects a total acquisition cost of approximately $4.7 billion. However, Congress has already appropriated approximately $3.1 billion for the program and the Coast Guard's fiscal years 2012-2016 capital investment plan indicates an additional $2.5 billion is needed through fiscal year 2016 for a total of $5.6 billion to complete the acquisition. This would represent an increase of approximately 19 percent over the approved acquisition cost estimate for eight NSCs. According to section 575 of Title 14 of the U.S. Code, the Commandant must submit a report to Congress no later than 30 days after the Chief Acquisition Officer of the Coast Guard becomes aware of a likely cost overrun for any level I or level II acquisition program that will exceed 15 percent. If the likely cost overrun is greater than 20 percent, the Commandant must include a certification to Congress providing an explanation for continuing the project. Senior Coast Guard acquisition officials stated that they cannot corroborate a total cost of $5.6 billion for the NSC program, or a cost increase of 19 percent, because the Coast Guard has not yet completed a life-cycle cost analysis for the program. However, these officials stated that a certification to Congress for the NSC program is pending as well as one for the MPA program.", "We previously reported several schedule delays for assets based on the revised baselines and noted that as the Coast Guard reevaluates its baselines, it gains improved insight into the final delivery dates for all of the assets. While the Coast Guard's revised baselines identify schedule delays for almost all of the programs, these baselines do not reflect the extent of some of these delays as detailed in the Coast Guard's fiscal years 2012-2016 capital investment plan. For example, the MPA's revised baseline has final asset delivery in 2020\u2014a delay of 4 years from the 2007 baseline\u2014but the capital investment plan indicates final asset delivery in 2025\u2014an additional 5-year delay not reflected in the baseline. Coast Guard resource officials responsible for preparing this plan acknowledged that the final asset delivery dates in most of the revised baselines are not current. The forthcoming delays identified in the fiscal years 2012-2016 capital investment plan indicate that the final asset delivery dates approved in the 2007 Deepwater baseline are no longer achievable for most assets.", "The report also stated:", "Coast Guard and DHS officials agreed that the annual funding needed to support all approved Deepwater acquisition program baselines exceeds current and expected funding levels, particularly in this constrained fiscal climate. For example, Coast Guard acquisition officials stated that up to $1.9 billion per year would be needed to support the approved Deepwater baselines, but they expect Deepwater funding levels to be closer to $1.2 billion annually over the next several years. Therefore the Coast Guard is managing a portfolio\u2014which includes many revised baselines approved by DHS\u2014that is expected to cost more than what its annual budget will likely support. Our previous work on Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions shows that when agencies commit to more programs than resources can support, unhealthy competition for funding is created among programs. This situation can lead to inefficient funding adjustments, such as moving money from one program to another or deferring costs to the future.", "When a program's projected funding levels are lower than what the program was previously projected to receive, the program is more likely to have schedule breaches and other problems, as the program can no longer remain on the planned schedule. From September-October 2010, the Coast Guard reported potential baseline breaches to DHS for the C4ISR, HC-130H, and HH-60 programs that were caused, at least in part, by reduced funding profiles in the fiscal years 2011-2015 capital investment plan.22 For example, in the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 capital investment plans, the Coast Guard had anticipated allocating 20-27 percent of its planned $1.1 billion fiscal year 2011 Deepwater budget to its aviation projects. In its actual fiscal year 2011 budget request, however, the Coast Guard only allocated about 9 percent of the $1.1 billion to aviation projects.

This acknowledgment that program baselines must be revised to fit fiscal constraints, however, is not reflected in the Coast Guard's most recent capital investment plan.... With the exception of fiscal year 2012, the Coast Guard is planning for funding levels well above the expected funding level of $1.2 billion.", "This outyear funding plan seems unrealistic, especially in light of the rapidly building fiscal pressures facing our national government and DHS's direction for future budget planning. To illustrate, in fiscal year 2015, the Coast Guard plans to request funding for construction of three major Deepwater surface assets: NSC, OPC, and FRC, but the Coast Guard has never requested funding for construction of three major Deepwater surface assets in the same year before. In a recent testimony, the Commandant of the Coast Guard stated that the plan for fiscal year 2015 reflects the Coast Guard's actual need for funding in that year. If program costs and schedules are tied to this funding plan and it is not executable, these programs will likely have schedule and cost breaches.

We previously reported that the Coast Guard expected this analysis to serve as one tool, among many, in making future capability requirements determinations, including future fleet mix decisions. The analysis, which began in October 2008 and concluded in December 2009, is termed fleet mix analysis phase 1. Officials from the Coast Guard's capabilities directorate comprised the majority of the project team for the analysis, which also included contractor support to assist with the analysis. As of May 2011, DHS had not yet released phase 1 to Congress. We received the results of the analysis in December 2010.", "To conduct the fleet mix analysis, the Coast Guard assessed asset capabilities and mission demands in an unconstrained fiscal environment to identify a fleet mix\u2014referred to as the \"objective fleet mix\"\u2014that would meet long-term strategic goals. The objective fleet mix resulted in a fleet that would double the quantity of assets in the program of record, the $24.2 billion baseline. For example, the objective fleet mix included 66 cutters beyond the program of record. Given the significant increase in the number of assets needed for this objective fleet mix, the Coast Guard developed, based on risk metrics, incremental fleet mixes to bridge the objective fleet mix and the program of record. Table 5 shows the quantities of assets for each incremental mix, according to the Coast Guard's analysis.", "While the analysis provided insight on the performance of fleets larger than the program of record, the analysis was not cost-constrained. The Coast Guard estimated the total acquisition costs associated with the objective fleet mix could be as much as $65 billion\u2014about $40 billion higher than the approved $24.2 billion baseline. As a result, as we reported last year, Coast Guard officials stated that they do not consider the results to be feasible due to cost and do not plan to use it to provide recommendations on a baseline for fleet mix decisions. Since we last reported, Coast Guard officials stated that phase 1 supports continuing to pursue the program of record.", "Because the first phase of the fleet mix analysis was not cost constrained, it does not address our July 2010 recommendation that the Coast Guard present to Congress a comprehensive review of the Deepwater Program that clarifies the overall cost, schedule, quantities, and mix of assets required to meet mission needs, including trade-offs in light of fiscal constraints given that the currently approved Deepwater Program is no longer feasible. The Coast Guard has undertaken what it refers to as a cost-constrained analysis, termed fleet mix analysis phase 2; however, according to the capabilities directorate officials responsible for the analysis, the study primarily assesses the rate at which the Coast Guard could acquire the Deepwater program of record within a high ($1.7 billion) and low ($1.2 billion) bound of annual acquisition cost constraints. These officials stated that this analysis will not reassess whether the current program of record is the appropriate mix of assets to pursue and will not assess any mixes smaller than the current program. Alternative fleet mixes are being assessed, but only to purchase additional assets after the program of record is acquired, if funding remains within the yearly cost constraints. The Coast Guard expects to complete its phase 2 analysis in the summer of 2011. As we reported in April 2011, because phase 2 will not assess options lower than the program of record, it will not prepare the Coast Guard to make the trade-offs that will likely be needed in the current fiscal climate.", "Further, despite Coast Guard statements that phase 2 was cost constrained, there is no documented methodology for establishing the constraints that were used in the analysis, and we found confusion about their genesis. The acquisition directorate, according to the study's charter, was to provide annual funding amounts, but Coast Guard officials responsible for phase 2 told us that DHS's Program Analysis & Evaluation office provided the lower bound and the acquisitions directorate provided the upper bound. An official from the Program Analysis & Evaluation office stated that DHS informally suggested using historical funding levels of $1.2 billion to establish an average annual rate but was unaware that the Coast Guard was using this number as the lower bound for the study. A senior Coast Guard acquisition directorate official stated that the directorate agreed with using the $1.2 billion as the lower constraint and had verbally suggested the upper bound of $1.7 billion. Based on our review of historical budget data, $1.7 billion for Deepwater is more than Congress has appropriated for the entire Coast Guard's acquisition portfolio since 2007 and as such, is not likely a realistic constraint. Coast Guard officials stated that the upper bound was not necessarily a realistic level, rather an absolute upper bound to establish the range of possible acquisition levels. In addition, the Coast Guard does not have documentation of the cost constraints; according to a Coast Guard official, these cost constraints were verbally communicated to the contractor.", "In addition to the Coast Guard's analysis, DHS's Program Analysis & Evaluation office is conducting a study, at the request of the Office of Management and Budget, to gain insight into alternatives to the Deepwater surface program of record. Office of Management and Budget officials told us that they recommended DHS conduct this study because DHS was in a position to provide an objective evaluation of the program and could ensure that the analysis of the trade-offs of requirements in a cost constrained environment would align with the Department's investment priorities. A DHS official involved in the study stated that the analysis will examine performance trade-offs between the NSC, OPC, a modernized 270' cutter, and the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship.44 The official also explained that the analysis is based on a current estimate of surface asset acquisition costs, which serves as a cap to guide surface asset trade-offs. This cutter study is expected to be completed in the summer of 2011. This official also stated that the cutter study is not expected to contain recommendations, but Office of Management and Budget officials told us they plan to use the results to inform decisions about the fiscal year 2013 budget. A DHS official responsible for this study stated that this analysis and the Coast Guard's fleet mix analysis will provide multiple data points for considering potential changes to the program of record, including reductions in the quantities planned for some of the surface assets.

According to Coast Guard officials, the study conducted by the Center for Naval Analysis found that the three key performance parameters were reasonable, accurate, and adequately documented. By approving the operational requirements document before these factors were resolved, DHS did not ensure that the cutter was affordable, feasible, and unambiguous and required no additional trade-off decisions, as outlined in the Major Systems Acquisition Manual.

Unfortunately, minimal work has been put into this effort with less than $500,000 of this funding being obligated since October 2009. Given the additional delays in delivering the final NSC, as noted in the fiscal year 2012 budget request (final NSC delivery in 2018 versus 2016), the Coast Guard is urged to accelerate its work in this area. As part of its periodic acquisitions briefings to the Committee, the Coast Guard is to provide an update on the progress made on this effort. The Coast Guard's update shall include a discussion of the potential need for a future sustainment project to bridge operational gaps between full operating condition of the NSC fleet and the decommissioning sequence for remaining HECs. (Page 89)", "The committee's report also states:", "REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WITHOLDING", "In an effort to encourage timely submissions to the Committees of materials necessary for robust and informed oversight, the Committee withholds $75,000,000 from obligation from the Coast Guard's \"Headquarters Directorates\" until the Quarterly Acquisition Report for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and a comprehensive 5-year Capital Investment Plan for fiscal years 2013\u20132017 have been submitted to the Committee. (Page 91)", "The report also states:", "NATIONAL SECURITY CUTTER", "The Coast Guard operates a fleet of 378-foot high endurance cutters [HECs] that are over 43 years old on average, and are increasingly unreliable and expensive to maintain. By comparison, the average Navy ship is 14 years old. The Coast Guard's current plan is to acquire eight National Security Cutters [NSCs] to replace 12 HECs (of which two have been decommissioned with the arrival of the first two NSCs). To date, over $3,100,000,000 has been appropriated for five NSCs, of which two have been delivered to the Coast Guard and the third will be delivered by the end of fiscal year 2011. NSC\u20134 is under contract and is expected to be delivered in 2014.", "The request in fiscal year 2012 of $77,000,000 for NSC\u20135 has been superseded by the fact that full funding was appropriated for the cutter in fiscal year 2011. Therefore, the Committee redirects these funds to acquire long lead time materials necessary for production of NSC\u20136. According to the Department, this will accelerate the production schedule for the cutter and result in direct savings of $45,000,000 to $60,000,000 compared to delaying the request for long lead acquisition to the fiscal year 2013 budget.", "As noted in prior years, the Committee strongly supports the procurement of one National Security Cutter per year until all eight planned ships are procured. The continuation of production without a break will ensure that these ships, which are vital to the Coast Guard's mission, are procured at the lowest cost, and that they enter the Coast Guard fleet as soon as possible. The Committee is concerned that the administration's current acquisition policy requires the Coast Guard to attain total acquisition cost for a vessel, including long lead time materials, production costs, and post production costs, before a production contract can be awarded. This has the potential to create shipbuilding inefficiencies, forces delayed obligation of production funds, and requires post production funds far in advance of when they will be used. As the Secretary noted in her testimony before the Committee, \"we fully expect to build out the eight cutters.\" The Department should therefore be in a position to acquire NSCs in the most efficient manner within the guidelines of strict governance measures. Therefore, the Committee includes language in the bill specifying that funds made available by this act shall be available to contract for long lead time materials for Coast Guard vessels, notwithstanding the availability of funds for production costs or post-production costs.", "FAST RESPONSE CUTTER", "The Committee recommends $358,000,000 for the Coast Guard's Fast Response Cutter [FRC], as requested. This funding will allow the Coast Guard to acquire six FRC hulls (13\u201318). Procuring six Fast Response Cutters in fiscal year 2012 will maximize the production line and generate cost savings of $5,000,000 per hull for a total savings to the taxpayers of $30,000,000. Funding six boats instead of four will also allow the Coast Guard to decommission two additional aging 110-foot Island Class Patrol Boats already beyond the end of their projected service life and expensive to maintain. Each FRC will provide 2,500 annual operating hours and an improved sea keeping ability, resulting in better habitability and full mission capability in higher sea states.", "The Committee commends the Coast Guard's due diligence in working with the Naval Engineering Technical Authority to improve the structural design for the FRC hull to prevent the potential need for any structural repairs prior to the end of the cutter's 20-year service life. Based on the continued involvement of the Coast Guard's technical authorities and consultation with third party independent classification societies, the identification and improvement of the structural design prior to launching the first FRC prevented required changes that would have been far more costly and impactful to operations than if they were identified later in the lifecycle of the cutter class.", "The recommendation also includes funding for Re-procurement Package and Data Rights, as requested, which is necessary to support the planned re-competition of the next Fast Response Cutter procurement. Not funding this effort in fiscal year 2012 would result in an FRC production gap, driving up procurement costs and out-year operating and maintenance costs of legacy assets well beyond their service life.", "MEDIUM ENDURANCE CUTTER SUSTAINMENT", "The recommendation includes $47,000,000 for the Medium Endurance Cutter Sustainment Project, as requested. Funding will complete sustainment work on five 270-foot cutters. This funding is intended to improve mission effectiveness of these vessels to allow them to meet their goals for program availability through the remainder of their service lives. This program has been successful in significantly reducing the number of major equipment failures on these vessels resulting in a much higher percentage of time they are fully mission capable.", "OFFSHORE PATROL CUTTER", "The recommendation includes $25,000,000 for the Offshore Patrol Cutter, as requested. Funding is provided for pre-acquisition activities. The Committee expects the Coast Guard to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on the status of this procurement, including critical decision points and dates.", "ROTARY WING REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT", "Since September 2008, the Coast Guard has lost four helicopters in accidents. To date, funding has been appropriated to replace only one of those assets. The recommendation includes $36,600,000, $18,300,000 above the request to replace two additional helicopters. Funds for the second aircraft are provided in title V of the bill. The Coast Guard is to brief the Committee no later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this act on its plans for replacing lost rotary wing operational assets.", "MARITIME PATROL AIRCRAFT", "The Committee recommends $104,500,00 for the Maritime Patrol Aircraft [MPA], $25,000,000 below the budget request. Funds are recommended for the acquisition of two aircraft (MPAs\u201316 & 17), which will provide an additional 2,400 hours to address the Coast Guard's MPA flight-hour gap. The Committee recognizes the importance of the mission system pallet, which is the electronic equipment to collect, compile, interpret, and disseminate data from the MPA's sensors. However, the Coast Guard is no longer purchasing these pallets from the original systems integrator and has not identified a new acquisition strategy to purchase them, making it unlikely that any funding for pallets would be obligated in fiscal year 2012. Therefore, the recommendation does not include funding for this purpose.", "UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS", "The Committee is aware of efforts by the Coast Guard to evaluate both ship-based and land-based Unmanned Aircraft Systems [UAS] for mission requirements. Both platforms have the potential to enhance the Coast Guard's capability to execute statutory requirements in the maritime domain. A recent Coast Guard report concluded that upgraded sensors and greater persistence could effectively extend a cutter's immediate surveillance horizon by as much as 35 percent. This is why the Committee is concerned with the absence of funding in the budget request and the long-term Capital Investment Plan for the acquisition of UAS. Prior to the establishment of a UAS acquisition program, additional testing is necessary to determine the viability of ship-based UAS systems on major Coast Guard cutters. Therefore, the Committee includes $8,000,000 under \"Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation\" for the shipboard ground control equipment necessary for ship-aircraft interface activities. The Committee is also aware of $3,200,000 that remains available from Coast Guard prior year appropriations for this purpose. (Pages 95-97)", "The committee's report also states:", "FLEET MIX ANALYSIS", "In July 2010, the Government Accountability Office [GAO] recommended that the Coast Guard review the cost and mix of its assets and identify trade-offs given fiscal constraints. According to GAO testimony in April 2011, \"The Department of Homeland Security agreed with the recommendation; however, the Coast Guard has not yet implemented it.\" Since 2008, the Coast Guard has been conducting a study called the \"Fleet Mix Analysis\" to analyze asset requirements and to validate and recommend fleet mix options to best execute operational missions. Phase 1 of the analysis has been completed, but it was unconstrained by cost considerations and led to unrealistic conclusions considering the current fiscal environment. Phase 2 of the Fleet Mix Analysis is underway, which is examining performance of alternative fleet mixes while applying fiscal constraints. The Coast Guard expects to complete this study in fiscal year 2011. The Committee is also aware of a separate Departmental study that is in the final stages of Departmental review called the \"Cutter Fleet Mix Analysis\". The Coast Guard shall submit both the \"Fleet Mix Analysis\" (Phases 1 and 2) and the \"Cutter Fleet Mix Analysis\" to the Committee and GAO once they are completed, but no later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this act. GAO shall provide an assessment of the results no later than 120 days following the submission of the report to the Committee.

The NSC was to operate more efficiently and effectively through the use of new communications systems and other technologies which would have significantly increased its range and capability. In several ways, the NSCs delivered to date have not provided the full array of anticipated increased capability.", "\u2022 Vertical take-off Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\u2014The NSC was designed and built to carry as many as four vertical take-off unmanned aerial vehicles (VUAV). The VUAV's were expected to extend the range and effectiveness of the cutter. Two NSC's have been delivered to date without VUAVs. The Service continues to work with the Navy to develop a VUAV, but cannot provide an estimate of when the first NSC will be outfitted with a VUAV. No funds are included in the CIP to acquire VUAVs over the next five years.", "\u2022 Cutter Boats\u2014The NSC was built to carry two classes of stern launched small boats each with a different size and capability to improve the cutter's range and effectiveness. The larger of the two boats did not perform as required and the smaller boat had to be modified to perform correctly. The Service recently solicited industry for a solution to replace both classes of small boats. Meanwhile, the NSC cannot operate at its full capability without these boats.", "\u2022 Multi-Crewing\u2014The Coast Guard's plan for meeting mission hour baselines for the NSC requires operating the asset at least 225 days a year. In order to do so, it proposed a multi-crewing strategy whereby four crews would rotate among three ships. Although the Coast Guard has taken delivery of two NSCs, it still has no plan to begin multi-crewing or otherwise achieve the 225 day goal.", "The decision to move forward with the NSC was based on the vastly larger area that could be patrolled by the vessel using the VUAVs, cutter boats, and additional days at sea. As the DHS Inspector General recently found (OIG\u201309\u201382), without these planned capabilities the NSCs cover little more range than the 40 year old cutters they replace. The Coast Guard has spent over $3 billion on the NSC to date. Given the large percentage of the total cost of recapitalization devoted to the NSC and the need to increase the Service's mission capabilities, the Committee believes it is imperative the NSC meet the stated operational parameters.

Reports and testimony in 2007 and prior years from the DHS IG and GAO, as well as a February 2007 DAU \"quick look study\" requested by the Coast Guard expressed serious concerns about the Coast Guard's overall management of the Deepwater program.", "Some observers expressed the view that using a private-sector LSI to implement the Deepwater program made a complex program more complex, and set the stage for waste, fraud, and abuse by effectively outsourcing oversight of the program to the private sector and by creating a conflict of interest for the private sector in executing the program. Other observers, including GAO and the DAU, expressed the view that using a private-sector LSI is a basically valid approach, but that the contract the Coast Guard used to implement the approach for the Deepwater program was flawed in various ways, undermining the Coast Guard's ability to assess contractor performance, control costs, ensure accountability, and conduct general oversight of the program.", "Observers raised various issues about the Deepwater contract. Among other things, they expressed concern that the contract was an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contract, which, they said, can be an inappropriate kind of contract for a program like the Deepwater program. Observers also expressed concern that the contract", "transferred too much authority to the private-sector LSI for defining performance specifications, for subsequently modifying them, and for making technical judgements; permitted the private-sector LSI to certify that certain performance goals had been met\u2014so-called self-certification, which, critics argue, can equate to no meaningful certification; provided the Coast Guard with insufficient authority over the private-sector LSI for resolving technical disputes between the Coast Guard and the private-sector LSI; was vaguely worded with regard to certain operational requirements and technical specifications, reducing the Coast Guard's ability to assess performance and ensure that the program would achieve Coast Guard goals; permitted the firms making up the private-sector LSI to make little use of competition between suppliers in selecting products to be used in the Deepwater program, to tailor requirements to fit their own products, and consequently to rely too much on their own products, as opposed to products available from other manufacturers; permitted the private-sector LSI's performance during the first five-year period to be scored in a way that did not sufficiently take into account recent problems in the cutter acquisition efforts; permitted award fees and incentive fees (i.e., bonuses) to be paid to the private-sector LSI on the basis of \"attitude and effort\" rather than successful outcomes; and lacked sufficient penalties and exit clauses.", "Observers also expressed concern that the Coast Guard did not have enough in-house staff and in-house expertise in areas such as program management, financial management, and system integration to properly oversee and manage an acquisition effort as large and complex as the Deepwater program, and that the Coast Guard did not make sufficient use of the Navy or other third-party, independent sources of technical expertise, advice, and assessments. They also expressed concern that the Coast Guard, in implementing the Deepwater program, placed a higher priority on meeting a schedule as opposed to ensuring performance.", "In response to criticisms of the management and execution of the Deepwater program, Coast Guard and industry officials acknowledged certain problems in the program's management and execution and defended the program's management execution in other respects.", "National Security Cutter (NSC)", "A DHS IG report released in January 2007 strongly criticized the NSC program, citing design flaws in the ship and the Coast Guard's decision to start construction of NSCs in spite of early internal notifications about these flaws. The design flaws involved, among other things, areas in the hull with insufficient fatigue life\u2014that is, with insufficient strength to withstand the stresses of at-sea operations for a full 30-year service life. The DHS IG report also noted considerable growth in the cost to build the first two NSCs, and other issues.", "Observers in 2007 stated that the Coast Guard failed to report problems about the NSC effort to Congress on a timely basis, resisted efforts by the DHS IG to investigate the NSC effort, and appeared to have altered briefing slides on the NSC effort so as to downplay the design flaws to certain audiences. On May 17, 2007, the DHS IG testified that the Coast Guard's cooperation with the DHS IG had substantially improved (though some issues remained), but that Deepwater contractors had establishing unacceptable conditions for DHS IG to interview contractor personnel about the program.", "110/123-Foot Patrol Boat Modernization", "The Coast Guard originally planned to modernize and lengthen its 49 existing Island-class 110-foot patrol boats so as to improve their capabilities and extend their lives until their planned eventual replacement with FRCs starting in 2018. The work lengthened the boats to 123 feet. The program consequently is referred to as the 110-foot or 123-foot or 110/123 modernization program.", "Eight of the boats were modernized at a total cost of about $96 million. The first of the eight modernized boats was delivered in March 2004. Structural problems were soon discovered in them. In June 2005, the Coast Guard stopped the modernization effort at eight boats after determining that they lacked capabilities needed for meeting post-9/11 Coast Guard operational requirements.", "In August 2006, a former Lockheed engineer posted on the Internet a video alleging four other problems with the 110-foot patrol boat modernization effort. The engineer had previously presented these problems to the DHS IG, and a February 2007 report from the DHS IG confirmed two of the four problems.", "On November 30, 2006, the Coast Guard announced that it was suspending operations of the eight modernized boats (which were assigned to Coast Guard Sector Key West, FL) because of the discovery of additional structural damage to their hulls. The suspension prompted expressions of concern that the action could reduce the Coast Guard's border-enforcement capabilities in the Caribbean. The Coast Guard said it was exploring options for addressing operational gaps resulting from the decision.", "On April 17, 2007, the Coast Guard announced that it would permanently decommission the eight converted boats and strip them of equipment and components that might be reused on other Coast Guard platforms. The Coast Guard acknowledged in 2007 that the program was a failure.", "Fast Response Cutter (FRC)", "As a result of the problems in the 110-foot patrol boat modernization project, the Coast Guard accelerated the FRC design and construction effort by 10 years. Problems, however, were discovered in the FRC design. The Coast Guard suspended work on the design in February 2006, and then divided the FRC effort into two classes\u2014the FRC-Bs, which are to be procured in the near term, using an existing patrol boat design (which the Coast Guard calls a \"parent craft\" design), and the subsequent FRC-As, which are to be based on a fixed version of the new FRC design.", "As mentioned earlier, although the November 2006 Deepwater APB calls for 12 FRCs and 46 FRC-Bs, the Coast Guard's Request for Proposals (RFP) for the FRC-B program includes options for building up to 34 FRC-Bs (which, if exercised, would reduce the number of FRC-As to as few as 24). The Coast Guard has also stated that if the FRC-Bs fully meet the requirements for the FRC, all 58 of the FRCs might be built to the FRC-B design.", "Appendix B. Coast Guard Reform Actions in 2007", "Actions Announced in April 2007", "On April 17, 2007, the Coast Guard announced six changes intended to reform management of the Deepwater program. In announcing the actions, Admiral Thad Allen, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, stated in part:", "Working together with industry, the Coast Guard will make the following six [6] fundamental changes in the management of our Deepwater program:", "[1] The Coast Guard will assume the lead role as systems integrator for all Coast Guard Deepwater assets, as well as other major acquisitions as appropriate....", "[2] The Coast Guard will take full responsibility for leading the management of all life cycle logistics functions within the Deepwater program under a an improved logistics architecture established with the new mission support organization.", "[3] The Coast Guard will expand the role of the American Bureau of Shipping, or other third-parties as appropriate, for Deepwater vessels to increase assurances that Deepwater assets are properly designed and constructed in accordance with established standards.", "[4] The Coast Guard will work collaboratively with Integrated Coast Guard Systems to identify and implement an expeditious resolution to all outstanding issues regarding the national security cutters.", "[5] The Coast Guard will consider placing contract responsibilities for continued production of an asset class on a case-by-case basis directly with the prime vendor consistent with competition requirements if: (1) deemed to be in the best interest of the government and (2) only after we verify lead asset performance with established mission requirements.", "[6] Finally, I will meet no less than quarterly with my counterparts from industry until any and all Deepwater program issues are fully adjudicated and resolved. Our next meeting is to be scheduled within a month.", "These improvements in program management and oversight going forward will change the course of Deepwater.", "By redefining our roles and responsibilities, redefining our relationships with our industry partners, and redefining how we assess the success of government and industry management and performance, the Deepwater program of tomorrow will be fundamentally better than the Deepwater program of today....", "As many of you know, I have directed a number of significant organizational changes [to the Coast Guard], embedded within direction and orders, to better prepare the Coast Guard to meet and sustain mission performance long into the future as we confront a broad range of converging threats and challenges to the safety, security and stewardship of America's vital maritime interests.", "What's important to understand here is that these proposed changes in organizational structure, alignment and business processes, intended to make the Coast Guard more adaptive, responsive and accountable, are not separate and distinct from what we have been doing over the past year to improve Deepwater.", "In fact, many of these initiatives can be traced directly to challenges we've faced, in part, in our Deepwater program. Consequently, we will be better organized, better trained, and better equipped to manage large, complex acquisitions like Deepwater in the coming days, weeks, months and years as we complete these service-wide enhancements to our mission support systems, specifically our acquisition, financial and logistics functions. That is the future of the Coast Guard, and that is the future of Deepwater.", "To be frank, I am tired of looking in the rearview mirror - conducting what has been the equivalent of an archaeological dig into Deepwater. We already understand all too well what has been ailing us within Deepwater in the past five years:", "We've relied too much on contractors to do the work of government as a result of tightening AC&I budgets, a dearth of contracting personnel in the federal government, and a loss of focus on critical governmental roles and responsibilities in the management and oversight of the program.", "We struggle with balancing the benefits of innovation and technology offered through the private sector against the government's fundamental reliance on robust competition.", "Both industry and government have failed to fully understand each other's needs and requirements, all too often resulting in both organizations operating at counter-odds to one another that have benefited neither industry nor government.", "And both industry and government have failed to accurately predict and control costs.", "While we can\u2014and are\u2014certainly learning from the past, we ought to be about the business of looking forward\u2014with binoculars even\u2014as we seek to see what is out over the horizon so we can better prepare to anticipate challenges and develop solutions with full transparency and accountability. That is the business of government. And it's the same principle that needs to govern business as well.", "And it's precisely what I intend to do: with the changes in management and oversight I outlined for you here today, with the changes we are making in the terms and conditions of the Deepwater contract, and with the changes we will make in our acquisition and logistics support systems throughout the Coast Guard. If we do, I have no doubt in my mind that we will exceed all expectations for Deepwater....", "The Deepwater program of tomorrow will be fundamentally better than the Deepwater program of today.", "The Coast Guard has a long history of demonstrating exceptional stewardship and care of the ships, aircraft and resources provided it by the public, routinely extending the life of our assets far beyond original design specifications to meet the vital maritime safety, security and stewardship needs of the nation....", "Knowing that to be the case, I am personally committed to ensuring that our newest ships, aircraft and systems acquired through the Coast Guard's Integrated Deepwater System are capable of meeting our mission requirements from the moment they enter service until they are taken out of service many, many years into the future....", "As I've said many times in the past, the safety and security of all Americans depends on a ready and capable Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard depends on our Deepwater program to keep us ready long into the future.", "The changes to Deepwater management and oversight I outlined here for you today reflect a significant change in the course of Deepwater. I will vigorously implement these and other changes that may be necessary to ensure that our Coast Guard men and women have the most capable fleet of ships, aircraft and systems they need to do the job I ask them to do each and every day on behalf of the American people.", "Other Actions Announced in 2007", "The Coast Guard in 2007 also did the following:", "announced a reorganization of certain Coast Guard commands\u2014including the creation of a unified Coast Guard acquisition office\u2014that is intended in part to strengthen the Coast Guard's ability to manage acquisition projects, including the Deepwater program; stated that would alter the terms of the Deepwater contract for the 43-month award term that commenced in June 2007 so as to address concerns raised about the current Deepwater contract; announced that it intended to procure the 12 FRC-B cutters directly from the manufacturer, rather than through ICGS; stated that it was hiring additional people with acquisition experience, so as to strengthen its in-house capability for managing the Deepwater program and other Coast Guard acquisition efforts; stated that it concurred with many of the recommendations made in the DHS IG reports, and was moving to implement them; stated that it was weighing the recommendations of the DAU quick look study; and stated that it had also implemented many recommendations regarding Deepwater program management that have been made by GAO.", "Appendix C. 110/123-Foot Patrol Boat Modernization", "As an earlier part of the Deepwater program, the Coast Guard initiated an effort to modernize its existing 110-foot Island class patrol boats, so that they could remain in service pending the delivery of replacement Deepwater craft. Among other things, the modernization increased the length of the boats to 123 feet. The effort is thus referred to variously as the 110-foot modernization program, the 123-foot modernization program, or the 110/123-foot modernization program.", "The initial eight boats in the program began to develop significant structural problems soon after completing their modernizations. The Coast Guard removed the boats from service and canceled the program, having spent close to $100 million on it.", "On April 18, 2007, it was reported that the Justice Department was conducting an investigation of the Deepwater program. Press reports at the time stated that investigation centered on the 110/123-foot modernization program, Deepwater communications systems, and the National Security Cutter (NSC). The Justice Department reportedly notified Lockheed, Northrop, and certain other firms involved in the Deepwater program of the investigation on December 13, 2006, and directed the firms to preserve all documents relating to the program.", "On May 17, 2007, the Coast Guard issued a letter to ICGS revoking its previous acceptance of the eight modernized boats\u2014an action intended to facilitate Coast Guard attempts to recover from ICGS funds that were spent on the eight converted boats. On January 7 and 8, 2008, it was reported that the Coast Guard was seeking a repayment of $96.1 million from ICGS for the patrol boats and had sent a letter to ICGS on December 28, 2007, inviting ICGS to a negotiation for a settlement of the issue. Some observers questioned the strength of the government's legal case, and thus its prospects for recovering the $96.1 million or some figure close to that.", "The Coast Guard testified in April 2009 that:", "With regard to the 123-foot patrol boats, the Department of Justice and the DHS-OIG [the DHS Office of the Inspector General] continue their investigation into the project. The qui tam [legal] action involving the patrol boats is still on-going. The Department of Justice has not yet made yet made a determination whether it will intervene in that action. The Coast Guard continues its support of the DOJ and DHS-OIG investigation.", "Simultaneous to our support of the DOJ investigation, we have also undertaken an independent engineering analysis through the Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command, which we expect to be completed sometime this summer. Additionally, we are working with the Department of Justice to release five of the eight patrol boats to salvage systems, equipment and parts still of value to the Coast Guard. The remaining three cutters would remain untouched for evidence purposes in support of the ongoing investigations.", "On August 17, 2011, the Department of Justice announced that it had filed suit against Bollinger Shipyards for allegedly making material false statements to the Coast Guard regarding the 110/123-foot modernization program. The Department of Justice's announcement stated:", "The United States has filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., against Bollinger Shipyards Inc., Bollinger Shipyards Lockport LLC and Halter Bollinger Joint Venture LLC, the Justice Department announced. The suit alleges that Bollinger, which is headquartered in Lockport, La., made material false statements to the Coast Guard under the Deepwater Program.", "The government's complaint alleges that Bollinger proposed to convert existing 110-Ft Patrol Boats (WPBs) into 123-Ft WPBs by extending the hulls 13 feet and making additional improvements. As a result of Bollinger's misrepresentations about the hull strength of the converted vessels, the Coast Guard awarded a contract to convert eight Coast Guard 110 foot cutters to 123 foot cutters. The first converted cutter, the Matagorda, suffered hull failure when put into service. An investigation by the Coast Guard and the prime contractor, Integrated Coast Guard Systems, concluded that the calculation of hull strength reported by Bollinger to the Coast Guard prior to the conversion was false. Efforts to repair the Matagorda and the other converted vessels were unsuccessful. The cutters are unseaworthy and have been taken out of service.", "\"Companies which make false statements to win Coast Guard contracts do a disservice to the men and women securing our borders,\" said Tony West, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the Department of Justice. \"We will take action against those who undermine the integrity of the public contracting process by providing substandard equipment to our armed services personnel.\"", "The government's suit seeks damages from Bollinger under the False Claims Act for the loss of the eight now unseaworthy vessels. The investigation of the case was conducted by the Department of Justice Civil Division, the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General and the Coast Guard.", "An August 18, 2011, press report presented what it said was a statement from Bollinger Shipyards Lockport LLC in response to the filing of the suit. According to the press report, the text of the statement is as follows:", "Since its founding, Bollinger Shipyards has operated on the principle that \"quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.\" Three generations of the Bollinger family have earned a spotless record for honest and fair dealing with every customer, including the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard, our largest client. Since 1984, Bollinger has built every patrol boat the Coast Guard has purchased; to date some 122 have been delivered.", "We are disappointed with the Department of Justice's decision to file a complaint related to work completed in 2006. Throughout this process, Bollinger has been open and cooperative with the government, and we remain committed to providing the government all necessary information and assistance to bring this matter to a close. Bollinger has tried to find a way to resolve this matter short of litigation, but we are fully prepared to defend our good name aggressively in a court of law.", "As we have for the last 65 years, Bollinger will continue to deliver the highest quality and contract-compliant products to the United States Coast Guard and to each and every customer.", "Appendix D.

A March 25, 2007, news article stated in part:", "Four of the seven top U.S. Coast Guard officers who retired since 1998 took positions with private firms involved in the Coast Guard's troubled $24 billion fleet replacement program, an effort that government investigators have criticized for putting contractors' interests ahead of taxpayers'.", "They weren't the only officials to oversee one of the federal government's most complex experiments at privatization, known as Deepwater, who had past or subsequent business ties to the contract consortium led by industry giants Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin.", "The secretary of transportation, Norman Y. Mineta, whose department included the Coast Guard when the contract was awarded in 2002, was a former Lockheed executive. Two deputy secretaries of the Department of Homeland Security, which the Coast Guard became part of in 2003, were former Lockheed executives, and a third later served on its board.", "Washington's revolving-door laws have long allowed officials from industry giants such as Lockheed, the nation's largest defense contractor, to spend parts of their careers working for U.S. security agencies that make huge purchases from those companies, though there are limits.", "But Deepwater dramatizes a new concern, current and former U.S. officials said: how dwindling competition in the private sector, mushrooming federal defense spending and the government's diminished contract management skills raise the stakes for potential conflicts of interest.", "Deepwater also illustrates how federal ethics rules carve out loopholes for senior policymakers to oversee decisions that may benefit former or prospective employers. These include outsourcing strategies under which taxpayers bear most of the risks for failure, analysts said.", "There is no sign that any of the retired admirals or former Lockheed officials did anything illegal.", "But the connections between the agencies and the contractors have drawn the attention of the DHS inspector general, Richard L.
