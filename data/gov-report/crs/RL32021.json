Of this amount, $731 million was designated as International Narcotics Control andLaw Enforcement (INCLE) assistance in a line item in the budget request known as the AndeanCounterdrug Initiative (ACI). A central element of the program was the training and equipping ofcounternarcotics battalions in Colombia.", "According to the Administration, the distinctive features of the program, compared to PlanColombia assistance approved in 2000, (3) were that a larger portion of the assistance was directed at economicand social programs, and that more than half of the assistance was directed at regional countriesexperiencing the spill-over effects of illicit drug and insurgency activities. ", "In a mid-May 2001 briefing on the Andean Regional Initiative, Administration spokesmenset out three overarching goals for the region that could be called the three D's -- democracy,development, and drugs. The first goal was to promote democracy and democratic institutions bysupporting judicial reform, anti-corruption measures, human rights improvement, and the peaceprocess in Colombia. The second was to foster sustainable economic development and tradeliberalization through alternative economic development, environmental protection, and renewal ofthe Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA). The third was to significantly reduce the supply ofillegal drugs to the United States from the source through eradication, interdiction and otherefforts. (4) Underconsideration by the Congress in 2001, critics of the initiative argued that it overemphasized militaryand counter-drug assistance, and provided inadequate support for human rights and the peace processin Colombia.

Following the pattern of the FY2002 supplemental,Congress provided authority for a unified campaign against narcotics trafficking, terroristorganizations and to take actions to protect health and human welfare. This was done, theConference Report notes, in recognition that \"the narcotics industry is linked to the terrorist groups,including the paramilitary organizations in Colombia.\" However, the Conference Report alsowarned that this authority \"is not a signal...for the United States to become more deeply involved inassisting the Colombian Armed Forces in fighting the terrorist groups, especially not at the expenseof the counternarcotics program, but to provide the means for more effective intelligence gatheringand fusion, and to provide the flexibility to the Department of State when the distinction betweencounternarcotics and counterterrorism is not clear cut.\" Expanded authorities would end if theSecretary of State has credible evidence that the Colombian military is not \"conducting vigorousoperations to restore government authority and human rights in areas under the effective control ofparamilitary and guerrilla organizations.\" The Report also calls for the Secretary of State to report,within 90 days of enactment, the changes in policy, including new procedures and operations, as aresult of implementing expanded authorities.

This cap applies to U.S. personnel in Colombia \"insupport of Plan Colombia,\" but does not include U.S. personnel assigned as part of their regularduties to the U.S. Embassy. As of late November, there were 278 temporary and permanent U.S.military personnel and 373 U.S. citizen civilian contractors in Colombia in support of PlanColombia. These numbers vary as programs are begun, expanded, or completed. During 2003, theyhave varied between 208 and 396 military personnel and 247 to 400 civilian contractors. The U.S.civilian contractor number was 400 on November 18 but was reduced to 373 the following day dueto departures. During November, there were about 600 foreign national contractors present inColombia who are not covered by the personnel caps, most of whom were Colombiannationals.", "Human Rights.

Such a certification by the Secretary would release 12.5% ofassistance to the Colombian military. The remaining 12.5% would be available after July 31, 2003,if the Secretary certifies that the Colombian military is continuing to meet its obligations requiredin the first certification and trying to gain authority and protect human rights in areas under controlof paramilitary and guerrilla organizations. On July 8, 2003, the Secretary issued the firstcertification which released approximately $30 million. As of November, the second certificationwas reported to be near completion. Congress also maintained a prohibition on the issuance of visasto any alien who the Secretary of State determines has willfully provided support to the FARC, ELN,or AUC, or has participated or ordered the commission of gross violations of humanrights.", "Aerial Fumigation. The Secretary of State is required to certify that aerialfumigation of drug crops is occurring within a series of guidelines for health, environment,compensation for those unjustly sprayed, and availability of alternative development programs \"where security permits.\" Until such a report is issued, 80% of funding for herbicides is withheld.The conference report ( H.Rept. 108-10 ) states that Congress expects that \"every reasonableprecaution will be taken in the aerial fumigation program to ensure that the exposure to humans andthe environment in Colombia meets Environmental Protection Agency standards for comparable usein the United States.\" According to the State Department, this report will be issuedsoon.", "Helicopters.

Following the shooting down of an airplane inPeru on April 20, 2001, which was found not to be associated with drug trafficking and whichresulted in the deaths of several individuals, including two American missionaries, Congressmaintained language prohibiting the resumption of U.S. support for a Peruvian air interdictionprogram. In order to resume U.S. support, the Secretary of State and the Director of CentralIntelligence must certify to Congress, 30 days prior to any resumption of U.S. involvement, that theability of the Peruvian Air Force to shoot down aircraft will include enhanced safeguards andprocedures to prevent similar accidents.

The ARI expanded assistance to help counter possible spill-over effects in six nearby countries: Peruand Bolivia, where past successes in reducing cocaine production could be threatened by expectedprogress in eradicating crops in Colombia; Ecuador, the most exposed neighbor because of its borderwith Colombia's Putumayo province; and Brazil, Venezuela and Panama, where the threat isprimarily confined to common border areas with Colombia.", "The region is important to the United States because it includes the three major drugproducing countries (Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru) where virtually all the world's cocaine and 60%of the heroin seized in the United States are produced.

Itis known for a long tradition of democracy, but also for continuing violence, including a guerrillainsurgency dating back to the 1960s, and persistent drug trafficking activity. Recent", "administrations have had to deal with a complicated mix of leftist guerrillas, rightist paramilitary (or\"self-defense\" forces), both associated with many groups of independent drug traffickers. The twomain leftist guerrilla groups are the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and theNational Liberation Army (ELN) both of whom regularly kidnap individuals for ransoms, and reapprofit from their participation in the drug trade. The rightist paramilitaries are coordinated by theUnited Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) which has been accused of gross human rightsabuses and collusion with the Colombian Armed Forces in fighting the FARC and ELN. The AUChas also been accused of participating in narcotics trafficking. There are additional paramilitariesnot under the AUC umbrella, such as Metro Block, a former AUC faction that withdrew from peacenegotiations with the government in late 2002. ", "Pastrana Administration. During the presidencyof Andres Pastrana (August 1998-2002), U.S. involvement in Colombia deepened. Pastrana waselected largely on the basis of pledges to bring peace to the country by negotiating with the guerrillas,strengthening the Colombian military and counternarcotics forces, and seeking international supportfor these efforts and other reforms to address the country's unusually serious economic difficulties. Months after Pastrana's inauguration, he initiated peace talks with the country's largest guerrillagroup, the FARC, and later with representatives from the smaller ELN. In 1999, in cooperation withthe United States, Pastrana developed a $7.5 billion plan called \"Plan Colombia,\" with $4 billion tocome from Colombia and $3.5 billion from international donors, although funding from Colombiaand the international community has fallen far short of these goals.", "To support Plan Colombia (10) , the Clinton Administration developed, and the U.S. Congressapproved, a $1.3 billion package of assistance in 2000. Most of the funding was to support programsin Colombia, with $416.9 million for helicopters, training, and other assistance to three ColombianArmy counternarcotics battalions. The focus of most of the funding, while incorporating alternativedevelopment and governance programs, was to support counternarcotics objectives.", "Pastrana's efforts were largely frustrated by a variety of factors, including, according to avariety of analysts, the lack of a consistent negotiation strategy, the poor implementation of elementsof Plan Colombia, and a lack of interest by the guerrillas in negotiating peace. An early Pastranaconcession to the FARC was the creation of a sanctuary area (\"despaje\") for the FARC as anincentive to enter into negotiations. The outcome, however, was the consolidation of FARC forcesin the area after the withdrawal of government security forces. Prompted by an intensification ofguerrilla activities, President Pastrana decided in February 2002 to terminate peace talks with theFARC, and ordered the military to retake the despaje. Days later, the FARC kidnaped Senator IngridBetancourt, a presidential candidate with a small following. She remains a captive to this day. Bythe end of Pastrana's term, there was a strong perception that peace talks had failed, guerrilla activity(fed by the drug trade) had increased, and the security situation in major cities had deteriorated.", "Uribe Administration. (11) Alvaro Uribe ran for thepresidency on a platform focusing on defeating the guerrilla insurgents, eliminating theparamilitaries, and ending narcotics trafficking. He won 53% of the vote in an eleven-candidate fieldin the May 26, 2002 presidential elections. He is the first president since the 1991 Constitution towin by an outright majority, thus avoiding a run-off election. Upon taking office on August 7, 2002,he announced a hard-line approach to negotiations, declaring that the government would onlynegotiate with those groups who are willing to \"give up terrorism and agree to a cease-fire,\"including paramilitary groups, with whom President Pastrana had refused to negotiate. The FARCincreased its armed activities by threatening with death all mayors who did not resign their posts, andconducting relatively large armed confrontations with rightist paramilitary groups, resulting inmassacres of civilians in several locations. FARC also was responsible for bombings in urban areasof Medell\u00c3\u00adn and Cartegena, as well as a deadly mortar attack in Bogot\u00c3\u00a1 close to the Congressbuilding where Uribe was being sworn in. These attacks signaled FARC's new-found, andlong-threatened, ability to take their fight to the cities.", "In order to address the complex problems facing Colombia, Uribe took a number of steps,some of which have proven to be controversial. He promulgated a decree invoking emergencypowers, allowing the security forces to make arrests without warrants and imposing controls onmovements in war-torn parts of the country. Under Colombia's 1991 Constitution, states ofemergency may be declared for 90 days, and then can be renewed for two additional 90-day periods. The country's constitutional court has, on several occasions, ruled components of the state ofemergency unconstitutional that give security forces increased powers. In response, the UribeAdministration introduced legislation in April of 2003 to change the Constitution to give securityforces permanent powers to tap phones and to search homes without warrants in all parts of thecountry.", "President Uribe also announced plans to increase the size of the military and police, largelythrough a one-time 1.2% war tax on wealthy individuals and businesses, and to create of a \"civilianinformers\" program. This effort also entails the augmentation of Colombia's regular armed forceswith \"peasant soldiers\" who receive less training than regular troops, and are based near their ownhometowns. The Uribe Administration has inducted 10,000 peasant soldiers, each serving for twoyears, with plans to have a total force of 20,000. Further, Uribe authorized the widespread aerialfumigation of coca crops, that under the Pastrana administration, had been limited to small plots ofgrowers who had signed eradication pledges. On June 26, 2003, a Colombian court ruled that theColombian government should immediately suspend its aerial fumigation program until theEnvironment Ministry charts an Environment Management Plan. Officials of the UribeAdministration have stated that fumigation will continue while it appeals the decision. Two previousappeals have been won by the government.", "Uribe has also received approval from the Constitutional Court for a referendum to cutgovernment spending and pension payments, to prohibit the re-election of corrupt officials, and torestructure the Colombian Congress by reducing the number of representatives, restricting itsbudgetary powers, and allowing it to be dissolved by popular vote. The referendum was scheduledfor October 25, 2003, to coincide with mayoral and gubernatorial elections slated for the followingday. In the weeks leading up to the elections, the FARC threatened to kill all candidates and theirfamilies for the October 26 municipal elections. In total, 25 candidates were killed and 160withdrew their names from the balloting. (12) In order for the referendum to succeed, the law required 25%(6.3 million) of Colombian voters to participate. Not having received sufficient turnout, thereferendum items failed even though all received majority support by those voting. President Uribehas since taken some of the same issues to the Colombian Congress for support, especially thoserelating to the budget. ", "In late December 2002, Uribe appointed a commission to explore the possibility of a dialoguewith the AUC. This initiative grew out of an October 2002 meeting of Colombia's HighCommissioner for Peace and five Roman Catholic bishops with the AUC leadership, after which theAUC declared an indefinite cessation of hostilities, in part because of Uribe's more forceful stanceagainst the guerrillas. The Bush Administration, which on September 25, 2002, requested theextradition of two top AUC leaders, Carlos Casta\u00c3\u00b1o and Salvador Mancuso, announced on January8, 2003, that it would not withdraw the request. On July 15, 2003, the Uribe Administrationannounced that an agreement had been reached with leaders of the AUC that would result in theirdemobilization by the end of 2005. It is estimated that there are between 10,000 and 13,000members of the AUC operating in the country. Formed in the 1980s by wealthy cattle ranchers tofight leftist guerrilla groups, the AUC is a loose coordinating body, leading some observers toquestion whether negotiations with the AUC will result in the demobilization of self-defense groupsnot under the AUC umbrella. It is estimated that as many as 6,500 fighters operate outside of theAUC, (13) some of whomare negotiating separately with the government, and others who are not participating at all. Relatedto this effort is a controversial legislative proposal by the Uribe administration to grant conditionalamnesties to illegal combatants in exchange for their demobilization and reparations to victims.", "Coca Cultivation and Eradication. Colombia isthe source for 80% of the world's cocaine hydrochloride (HCI), and significant quantities of highquality heroin entering the United States. While noting the ill effects of the drug trade on the livesof Colombians, President Uribe linked the drug trade and the guerrilla insurgency as intertwinedproblems that must be addressed in a coordinated fashion. Reflecting this sentiment, the UnitedStates began, in 2002, providing Colombia with the flexibility to use U.S. counterdrug funds for aunified campaign to fight drug trafficking and terrorist organizations. (The State Department hasdesignated the FARC, ELN, and AUC as terrorist organizations.)", "Upon taking office, Uribe announced that aerial eradication and alternative developmentwould form a significant basis of the government's efforts. The Plan Colombia eradication sprayingprogram began in December 2000 with operations by the U.S. funded counternarcotics brigade inPutumayo. (14) Despiteearly indications that coca cultivation had increased by 25% in 2001 even though a reported 22,200acres had been sprayed, Colombian and U.S. officials have reported decreases of 15% in 2002. During 2002, acres devoted to coca cultivation decreased from nearly 420,000 acres in 2001 to357,000 acres in 2002.

The alternative development program, in which farmers canget assistance to grow substitute crops after agreeing to the eradication of their illicit crops, has beenplagued with delays. A U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) report attributed the program'sobstacles to inadequate security in coca-growing areas, where the Colombian governments lackscontrol, and to the government's limited ability to carry out sustained interdiction operations. TheState Department's annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report for 2002 claims that sincethe inception of the Alternative Development program in December 2000, 20,128 families havebenefitted and nearly 39,000 acres of licit crops have been planted in previous coca and poppy areas.The Colombian government reported that 38,000 families in 33 municipalities signed voluntaryeradication pacts. As of early 2002, media reports noted that less than a third of those families havereceived any compensation and many were still growing coca.

In its response to the GAO report, AID argued that alternative development programs do notachieve drug crop reduction on their own, and that the Colombia program was designed to supportthe aerial eradication program and to build \"the political support needed for aerial eradication effortsto take place.\" At the start of his Administration, Uribe announced that increased Colombianresources would be devoted to alternative development.", "With regard to environmental and health consequences, the Secretary of State certified in2002, as required by Congress, that the herbicide, glyphosate, is not considered to pose unreasonablehealth or safety risks to humans or the environment.

However, press reportsindicate that many Colombians believe the health consequences of aerial fumigation are grave.

The U.S. policy debate hasfocused on a number of related issues, such as the effectiveness and implementation of the programin general, respect for human rights, the expansion of U.S. support to address what many considerto be a purely civil conflict, and the level of resources that Colombia, and other countries are willingto contribute. Supporters argue that Colombia is a friendly democracy under siege by powerfularmed forces of the left and right fueled by drug money. In the context of the global war onterrorism, and with the growing recognition of the relationship between drug trafficking and theguerrilla insurgency, proponents argue that Colombia and its neighbors should be supported withcounterterrorism assistance before the situation deteriorates further. They favored expanding thescope of military assistance to strengthen the ability of Colombian security forces to combat theleftist guerrillas and to expand their control throughout rural areas, thereby undercutting the rationaleand support for paramilitary groups.", "Opponents of U.S. policy argue that the counterdrug program uses a repressive and militaryapproach to curbing drug production. They argue for halting aerial fumigation of coca crops and aidto the Colombian military, believing that coca farmers cannot be expected to abandon coca farmingvoluntarily until adequate economic alternatives are in place. They fear that forcing such farmersto give up coca growing will only drive many to the ranks of the armed groups, or to becomedisplaced persons dependent on the state. (19) Instead, they support a policy that focuses largely on economicand social aid to combat the conflict's root causes, curbs the still rampant human rights abuses byparamilitary groups, provides vigorous support for a negotiated end to the fighting, and emphasizesillicit drug demand reduction in the United States. They also argue that assisting Colombia to fightits leftist guerrillas will involve the United States in a major guerrilla conflict of indeterminateduration.", "Others, some of whom support current U.S. policy, argue for a \"Colombianization\" of theprogram in that they believe that Colombians should be conducting the aerial spraying and othercounternarcotics activities, not U.S. government contractors, and for Colombia itself to do more tofight its own war against terrorism and drug trafficking. They have argued that any expansion ofU.S. involvement should await a greater commitment by Colombia's government and elites to thewar effort, including a larger budget for the Colombian military. Still others argue that assistanceto Colombia should have the effect of improving its economy and providing employment forColombians, maintaining that the current implementation in which U.S. contractors are hired doesnot contribute to the economy or employment.", "Debate in the United States has also focused on allegations of human rights abuses by theColombian Armed Forces, the FARC and ELN, and the paramilitary groups. The Colombiansecurity forces have often turned a blind eye to paramilitary activities, considering these groups asaugmenting their fight against the FARC and ELN, despite a record of human rights abuses. Manypolicymakers, both supporters and opponents of U.S. policy, have worked to break the ties betweenthe Colombian military and the AUC, and President Uribe has vowed that paramilitary activities willnot be tolerated. U.S. policy has supported the creation and assistance for a Human Rights Unitwithin the Attorney General's office. Some non-governmental groups have claimed that the unit isineffective and has poor leadership. (20) They argue for full enforcement of legislative conditions thatrequire concrete steps to prosecute members of the armed forces who commit human rightsviolations, or who tolerate activities of paramilitary organizations. Requirements for the U.S.Secretary of State to certify that the Colombian military is prosecuting human rights violators, andbreaking ties with the paramilitaries, are longstanding provisions in legislation.

Thisdetermination was made on August 18, 2003. Having reached an agreement with Colombianauthorities on operational aspects that would provide greater safeguards against accidentalshootdowns, the program was operationally capable of resuming as of August 22. Concern alsoheightened that greater U.S. involvement will result in a protracted commitment in a civil conflictoccurred in response to the loss of five U.S. civilian contractors and aircraft operating in Colombiasince February 2003.

One American and a Colombian werekilled, and three are being held by the FARC. Another Cessna 208, with U.S. civilian contractors,crash landed in March during a subsequent search and rescue operation, killing three Americans. Afifth American contractor was killed on April 7 when his T-65 air tractor crashed during a sprayingoperation.

From December 2002 untilFebruary 2003, the opposition orchestrated a general strike that disrupted the economy but wasunsuccessful in getting President Chavez to agree to early elections or a non-binding referendum onhis rule. After months of negotiations facilitated by OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria, PresidentChavez and the opposition signed an agreement on May 29, 2003, to resolve the political crisis.Implementation of the accord, which could lead to a recall referendum for President Chavez, willnot necessarily be easy, but observers emphasize that it is an important first step for achievingpolitical stability.
