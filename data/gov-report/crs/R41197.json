{"id": "R41197", "title": "Green Procurement: Overview and Issues for Congress", "released_date": "2010-04-20T00:00:00", "summary": ["Economic and environmental concerns have contributed to rising interest in green procurement\u2014a term used in various ways but that may best be described as acquisition of products and services with smaller-than-average environmental footprints. Fully assessing a product or service requires integrated evaluation of cost, performance, and impacts for a set of green factors over all stages of the life cycle. Green building is an example of this approach. More generally, complexities and information gaps may constrict assessment options. However, where choices are comparative, partial assessments may often suffice. Because of such considerations, green procurement often emphasizes particular attributes, such as recycled content, energy efficiency, and waste reduction. Labeling and certification programs such as Energy Star, as well as other approaches, may be used to identify green products and services. While the use of green procurement appears to be increasing nationally, the success of programs is often not clear. Barriers to broader adoption include inadequate information among decisionmakers, lack of common implementation standards, real and perceived cost obstacles, and market and technical uncertainties.", "As a major consumer of goods and services with significant potential impacts on the environment, including human health, the federal government could arguably influence the adoption of green procurement generally and the market for green products and services. Federal green-procurement efforts focus largely on acquisition of products, even though services account for about half of federal procurement spending. Various statutes, regulations, executive orders, and policy documents require or encourage the purchase of several types of products because of their environmental attributes. Agencies are required to purchase alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles, and products that are biobased, Energy Star and energy-efficient, EPEAT (a green technology labeling program), and that contain recycled content, but acquisitions may be exempt in specified circumstances. Agencies must consider purchasing alternatives to toxic and priority chemicals and ozone-depleting substances, and environmentally preferable (EPP) products and services. Only EPP and EPEAT attempt to provide an integrative approach, rather than addressing only one or a few attributes, but they lack a specific basis in enacted statutes.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provides broad guidance through various policy documents, as does the Office of the Federal Environmental Executive (OFEE), housed at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). For some kinds of attributes, procurement criteria are set by specific agencies. EPA, the General Services Administration (GSA), OFEE, and other agencies have databases that help identify green products. OMB requires agencies to have green procurement plans and to report annually on their activities. Those reporting requirements appear to be largely qualitative, but quantitative reports are available for recycled-content and alternative-fuels products.", "Green procurement raises several policy questions, especially for federal acquisitions: (1) What are the most useful and appropriate policy goals for green procurement? (2) Are the legal authorities and other means by which different green product and service initiatives have been established the most appropriate for meeting policy goals? (3) How effectively is agency implementation and performance of green procurement being assessed? (4) How successful are current programs and initiatives at meeting policy goals? (5) Are policies on the acquisition of green services sufficient? (6) Are the policies and the methods of implementing them sufficiently harmonized and integrated? (7) Are there significant gaps in the preferences for green products and services? (8) Are there implementation methods not currently used by the federal government that should be considered? (9) Is training of the acquisition workforce sufficient?"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Increasing concerns about global warming, energy independence, and public health have contributed to a rise in public interest in so-called \"green\" products and services, and the development of a \"green\" economy. A number of federal programs and activities are relevant to that interest. In addition to well-known programs aimed at the public such as Energy Star (see text box below ), the federal government is itself a major consumer of goods and services, spending more than $500 billion per year on procurement ( Table 1 ), with annual spending increasing significantly in recent years. Substantial proportions of those expenditures are on goods and services with significant environmental impacts. For example, in both FY2008 and FY2009, more than half of the funds spent on manufactured goods was for transportation equipment, and more than 15% was for information technology and other electronics and electrical products. Construction of buildings and other structures comprised 11% of spending in FY2008 and 7% in FY2009. ", "Those levels of expenditure imply that greater use of green procurement practices could significantly reduce the environmental impacts of federal activities. Furthermore, federal policies and practices relating to green procurement may have significant impact on the adoption of such practices by state and local governments and the private sector. They might also serve to stimulate growth and innovation in green sectors of the national economy, potentially influencing the availability of green products and services in the marketplace and the development of associated industries. ", "Several relevant federal procurement requirements and programs have been established, beginning with a requirement enacted in the 1970s for federal agencies to purchase products with recycled content. That requirement and some additional initiatives focus largely or entirely on federal procurement, whereas others, such as Energy Star, a joint program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, were specifically designed to have a broader market focus. These two kinds of federal efforts, which may be called agency-focused and market-focused, respectively, are distinct but not completely independent. For example, Energy Star originated as a market-focused program aimed largely at consumers, but it is now included in federal regulations relating to acquisition of energy-consuming appliances and even buildings.", "Most of the federal initiatives focus on specific inputs or effects that a product might have, such as energy use, recycled content, or toxicity. This approach can allow for fairly straightforward implementation of a given initiative, but it may also be criticized as not paying sufficient attention to interactions or trade-offs among various factors. In addition, evaluating the effectiveness of initiatives in implementing federal green policy can be challenging. ", "Several factors contribute to this situation. A fundamental problem is that there is no general agreement on what green procurement is or how best to implement it. Also, several barriers exist to broader adoption, both within the federal government and in the broader economy. Those include inadequate information, lack of common standards, concerns about costs, and both market and technical uncertainties. Debate about the desirability or feasibility of meeting green policy goals such as reducing greenhouse-gas emissions may also create uncertainties.", "However, this report does not specifically address controversies about the desirability of green policy goals, either those Congress has established in various statutes, or those specifically addressed in executive orders issued by Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. Those controversies are complex, often long-standing, and beyond the scope of this report, but some of the major ones are discussed in other CRS documents. This report also does not address issues specific to the complex area of federal procurement, which is also discussed in other CRS documents. ", "Rather, the report focuses on procurement from a green policy perspective. It discusses the problem of what green procurement means, selected aspects of applicability to and implementation by federal agencies (both initiatives aimed largely at federal agencies and those with a broader focus), and issues that Congress may decide to address with respect to federal green procurement programs. Those issues include what green procurement means in the federal context; how programs and requirements should be established, assessed, and harmonized; and what gaps exist at present with respect to focus, implementation, and evaluation. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Green Procurement?", "paragraphs": ["Green procurement may appear to be a somewhat fuzzy concept, given the variety of ways in which it and related terms are used. There are many different practices and criteria that are called \"green,\" and several alternative terms that are used at least somewhat interchangeably in public discourse. In fact, the term green came into widespread use only in the last several years. Other terms used in various documents both historically and currently include \"environmentally preferable,\" \"sustainable,\" \"affirmative,\" and \"socially responsible\" procurement. Those and other terms may have specific meanings in some contexts but they may also be used somewhat interchangeably in other contexts. In addition, green procurement may be used in some cases to refer to purchasing of products and services with specific attributes such as energy or water efficiency, or use of biobased or recycled materials or nontoxic chemicals, without necessarily taking other factors into account. ", "Such variations in usage and meaning can create significant difficulties in understanding what green procurement is and in the development and implementation of policy goals. Therefore, this section of the report develops a general conceptual framework for consideration of policy issues associated with green procurement. It draws from both public- and private-sector initiatives and analyses. It discusses examples from federal programs, including those that have a focus beyond procurement by federal agencies, as well as examples involving states and the private sector. Green-procurement activities by federal agencies are discussed specifically later, in the section on \" Federal Green Purchasing Initiatives .\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Green as a Relative Concept", "paragraphs": ["The apparent fuzziness of green procurement as a concept can create uncertainties and even confusion that may make addressing policy issues difficult. To help avoid such problems, the following characterizations are used in this report: ", "A green product or service can usefully be thought of as one that has a significantly smaller environmental footprint than the average or standard product or service of the same type (see Figure 1 ). The environmental footprint of a product or service can be described as its overall impact on the environment, including use of resources such as energy and water, and effects on health and other aspects of the human environment. Green procurement can be thought of as the range of processes by which such green products and services can be acquired. Green practices also include related procedures and actions that result in a reduced environmental footprint, such as using products in ways that optimize their green characteristics. ", "In this view, the industry average or standard at any given time is generally not considered green. Consequently, as products, services, and practices currently thought of as green become standard practice within an industry, the threshold for something to be considered green would change\u2014moving to a level of environmental impact that is lower than the new standard. ", "Most products and services acquired through procurement activities are likely to be subject to some environmental constraints\u2014for example, they may be subject to environmental regulations, or the industry standard may incorporate environmental protections for other reasons. Consequently, those exhibiting more extreme impacts are unlikely to be considered standard practice, as illustrated in Figure 1 . At the same time, having lower impact than what is currently standard does not necessarily mean that a practice is a sustainable one\u2014that is, maintaining an environmental footprint that is small enough that it will not impede future human activity and the functioning of ecosystems.", "Green procurement practices may also include those that have no net environmental impact (or zero impact , as shown in the figure), which is unattainable in most instances at present, except in some cases for some attributes such as energy (see also the section on \" Life Cycle Analysis \" below). For example, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ) set a goal of zero net energy use by 2030 for new federal buildings. In theory, at least, a product or service could even have a positive environmental impact, at least for some elements, such as a building that produces more energy than it uses, for example via solar panels, and returns the surplus to the grid. ", "The relative approach to green procurement described here may appear to create difficulties for implementation to the extent it makes green a moving target, depending on the current industry average. However, it does not preclude an approach incorporating a fixed target such as zero impact. It can also be seen as an application of the well-established business practice of continual improvement. And it is consistent with a common feature in the development and maintenance of voluntary consensus standards, which are usually reviewed and updated on a periodic basis as technology, practices, and requirements evolve. Current federal law encourages the use of such standards by federal agencies in general, and some specific standards are referenced in some provisions in federal laws relating to environmental policy. States may also reference such standards, for example in building codes and procurement requirements for agencies. Some sets of consensus standards have been developed specifically with respect to green procurement, for example in information technology (IT), as discussed later in this report. ", "This use of green as a relative concept has several potential advantages. It allows for broad application of practices and standards to different products and services, and for adaptation to the specific conditions faced by different sectors and industries. It arguably facilitates the use of performance standards rather than design standards, and the former are generally regarded as preferable. It also permits gradual and continual reduction in environmental impact over time\u2014for example, gradual reduction in energy use or production of pollutants. Finally, it avoids the inherent problems with defining what green is in a more fixed or absolute sense.", "However, some observers may prefer a different meaning. Some may argue that simply taking environmental issues into account is sufficient to practice green procurement. Others may express concerns about a relative approach being more difficult to apply to specific cases, presenting unpredictably shifting goals, not accounting for inherent limitations in reducing environmental footprints, or permitting slower progress toward goals than some may desire. ", "For example, use of recycled content in paper products would generally be regarded as a green practice. If the goal for that practice is set at a particular percentage, such as 50%, of such content, then it is relatively easy for a manufacturer to conform and for buyers to assess whether a given product does so. But if the goal is to have more recycled content than average, a manufacturer or buyer would have to know what that average was to assess what a green percentage would be. Furthermore, if the average were 75% recycled content, then only paper with higher percentages would be considered green. If the average were 100%, no paper would be considered green with respect to recycled content. Finally, setting a high specific target, such as 100%, may result in more rapid increases in average recycled content than setting a relative goal.", "Such objections can be met in several ways. For example, documentary standards can be used, where targets are set by an independent entity and can be revised as conformance improves. A proxy or indicator such as a green label can be used to indicate whether a product meets the standard. That is one approach used, for example in green IT, as discussed later. ", "Also, green practices are not limited to only one factor or attribute, such as percentage of recycled materials, but involve integration of several across the life cycle of a product or service. Even if a maximum is reached for one element, options for improvement are likely to remain for others. In addition, the relative sense in which the term green is used in this report captures the range of meanings given to it by different stakeholders in a way that is comparatively clear and consistent and retains the utility of the concept. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Green Procurement and Environmentally Preferable Purchasing", "paragraphs": ["Finally, some may argue that green procurement as described here is simply a synonym for environmentally preferable procurement, or EPP, which was introduced in the 1990s (see \" Federal Green Purchasing Initiatives \" below). However, EPP refers to various specific programs and initiatives, usually involving explicit comparison of alternative products or services, whereas green procurement is used here in a broader sense that includes a variety of other approaches, such as zero-impact initiatives. Definitions of EPP used by various nonfederal entities often follow closely the federal description, but some entities define it differently.", "A salient feature of the concept of green procurement described above is that it is multidimensional, usually involving an integrated evaluation of criteria such as cost, performance, and impact of a product or service with respect to a set of green factors over the entire life cycle , from design through disposal. These three dimensions\u2014life cycle, green factors, and evaluation criteria\u2014are discussed below, followed by a discussion of considerations relating to implementation.

", "The relative importance of those stages will vary depending on the kind of product or service being considered. Raw materials acquisition, manufacturing, and disposal are unlikely to be direct factors in acquisition of services in many cases, but they will play an indirect role, depending on the degree to which the service provider engages in green product-procurement practices. ", "For example, some consultants may use only green IT products, such as those listed under the Energy Star or EPEAT labeling programs, and may follow green practices in end-of-life management of products they use. Some cleaning services may use environmentally preferable cleaning products. In the latter case, failure to use green products could also have direct consequences for the service recipient, for example if the products contained chemicals with adverse health effects. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research and Design", "paragraphs": ["All products and services that come to market are designed in some manner before they are produced, and that preliminary stage may also involve performing various types of research and development. New kinds of products may require a substantial research effort before they can be designed. Such activities may involve processes with significant environmental impacts. Also, the characteristics set at the design stage can affect impacts and other criteria throughout the life cycle. As with many features, green characteristics work best if they are built in rather than added on.", "Nevertheless, this stage is often omitted in discussions of life cycle aspects of green procurement. That may be because in many cases, acquisitions are of products or services already available in the marketplace. However, institutional green procurement programs can have an influence at this stage, most obviously for acquisitions that require custom design and manufacture. For ready-made products and services, assessment may be made of the degree to which candidates for procurement were specifically designed both to reduce environmental impacts throughout the life cycle (sometimes called design for the environment) and to facilitate recycling and other aspects of end-of-life management (sometimes called design for recycling).

For example, mining or logging may have low to high impact, depending on the practices of the companies involved, through energy and water use, waste production, and effects on health and ecosystems. Green guidelines and practices have been developed to reduce such impacts by changing the processes by and sources from which raw materials are obtained, including increasing the use of recycled and renewable resources. Examples are requirements and programs to reduce by-catch in commercial fishing, reduce mining pollution, and increase use of recycled content and biobased materials in products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Manufacturing", "paragraphs": ["The impacts of processes used in manufacturing products and developing services also vary. Manufacturing processes may differ in the efficiency of input use, the amount and kind of waste generated, and environmental effects on ecosystems and human health. Such impacts may be reduced by manufacturers through various means, ranging from improvements focusing on individual factors such as amounts and sources of energy used, to integrated approaches such as lean manufacturing techniques, which aim to reduce waste and improve efficiency throughout the manufacturing process.

", "In addition to manufacturers claims, various aids have been created by different government and private entities to assist both government and private-sector buyers in identifying green COTS products and services. For example, among federal agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides public access to databases of products assessed as environmental preferable through various criteria. The General Services Administration (GSA) also provides information on green products through its website. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has an online catalogue of biobased products listed under its BioPreferred program, which focuses on renewable biobased products. States such as California, Pennsylvania, and Washington have online guides to help buyers identify green products and services, as do some municipal government entities in states such as Minnesota, and organizations such as the National Association of Counties (NACO) and the Northwest Product Stewardship Council. Private-sector organizations such as Green Seal and the Green Electronics Council also provide lists of products. Such aids are discussed further in the \" Labeling and Certification \" section (see also Table 3 ). ", "Buyers purchasing custom rather than COTS products and services may have greater capability to ensure the use of green practices in various stages of the life cycle.

", "The degree to which green practices are used at this stage also affects impacts. For example, some users may waste large amounts of paper, ink, and energy through inefficient or unnecessary printing practices; power management of computer systems may not be used effectively; and vehicles may be driven or maintained in ways that compromise efficiency measures. ", "Products also vary in the length of their useful life. Some, such as disposable cellular phones, may be designed to be discarded after a short period of use. Others, such as modular computers, may be specifically designed to be readily repaired and upgraded rather than discarded when they fail, or in response to technological advances.

Each of those alternatives will have impacts that vary with the kind of product and the processes chosen. While reuse and recycling are generally considered environmentally preferable where possible, the ways in which those processes are carried out can vary significantly in impact. For example, computers and other electronics may be recycled for disposal. It may not be possible to determine before disposal how items will be recycled. Such \"e-waste\" is often exported. Recycling by recipients may be performed in ways that are dangerous to the health of workers and damaging to the local environment. ", "Another method used to reduce the impact of disposal is leasing or other forms of \"product takeback\" at the end of the life cycle. With this approach, a vendor of a product agrees to accept those disposed of by users and recycle them or make them available for reuse.

", "The operation stage is arguably the easiest for which this input can be measured and controlled for any given product, and most attempts to rate or label products with respect to this input focus on such use energy. Examples of ratings are Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) for furnaces, Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) for air conditioning, and EPA fuel economy estimates for motor vehicles. The most widely known labeling system is probably Energy Star. Programs aimed at energy conservation or efficiency in procurement, including Energy Star, tend to focus on use energy rather than that consumed in other life cycle stages. However, other programs may address energy use at other stages, such as the development of renewable or other green energy sources that may be used by manufacturers. ", "Energy used during other stages is called embedded energy or embodied energy . However, embodied energy may be used by some to refer to all energy used during the life cycle, including use energy. This is how it is defined by the Department of Energy (DOE). It may therefore be most helpful to distinguish between the two terms, defining embodied energy as total energy and embedded energy as total energy minus use energy; that is the usage adopted for this report. Impacts from life cycle stages other than use and operation may be called embedded impacts. ", "In some cases, embedded energy may be substantial. For example, concrete exterior walls in buildings may have some advantages over wood, but concrete has much higher embedded energy. However, there appears to be no widely accepted methodology for applying the concept broadly to purchasing decisions, and little information is available for many products. Some observers also argue that considering embedded energy as a separate factor can lead to erroneous conclusions, and that an integrated life cycle assessment is the best way to capture the total energy footprint of a product or service. ", "One complicating factor for measuring embedded energy is the nature of the energy sources used. For example, if a product with lower embedded energy is manufactured using nonrenewable sources of energy such as fossil fuels, or renewable sources that are produced in ways that have significant environmental impacts, such as on ecosystems, that product may have a greater overall environmental impact than an alternative product with higher levels of embedded energy from more sustainable sources.

They may also be designed to reduce health risks such as those from off-gassed formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs).", "For many kinds of products, for example paper, this factor may exhibit the highest potential impacts at life cycle stages other than use and operation.

For example, one U.N. study has estimated that the impact on water resources from production of a pair of leather shoes is 1.6 times that for a ream of paper and 250 times that for a microchip. For none of these is water likely to be a significant resource at the use stage. That is not the case with other products, perhaps the most obvious being plumbing fixtures and irrigation equipment.

As with energy, most of the focus from the green-procurement perspective has been on the use stage, at which this input may be more readily measured and controlled. For example, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT 1992, P.L. 102-486 ) established water-use standards for certain plumbing fixtures (42 U.S.C. 6295); EPA's Water Sense labeling program lists water-efficient plumbing fixtures and other products; and rebate incentives for water efficiency have been established in some states.

Another example from the building sector is the Athena Institute's EcoCalculator.", "An extension of the standard cradle-to-grave life cycle approach is called cradle-to-cradle. It has been described as an attempt to apply the principles of natural biological cycles to product cycles by creating an explicit connection between the end of a product's life cycle and the beginning.", "Life cycle analysis can also help ensure that evaluation includes interactions and trade-offs among factors and life cycle stages. A classic example of interaction between inputs and effects is in buildings, where attempts to improve energy efficiency by using products that reduce leakage of air to the outside may permit the build-up of potentially harmful air pollutants, contributing to the phenomenon of \"sick building syndrome.\" ", "Another example involves incandescent versus fluorescent lightbulbs. While the latter are widely recognized as more energy efficient, concerns have been raised about the extent to which the presence of mercury in the latter counterbalances their advantage in energy efficiency, by posing an environmental hazard from that toxic metal. Some life cycle analyses have found, however, that more mercury is released into the environment over the life cycle of an incandescent bulb, on average, than a fluorescent one, especially in areas where electricity is generated from coal.", "An example involving trade-offs relating to the length of the operational stage of the life cycle is the relative impacts of concrete versus wood for the framing and walls of buildings. Concrete can be much more durable than wood and may have other potential benefits, such as fire safety, but the high embedded energy and other impacts of concrete can potentially offset such benefits in low-rise buildings where wood is an option.", "Figure 2 depicts a conceptual model of the relationships among the green factors, life cycle stages, and evaluation criteria. In this three-dimensional graphical representation, each element is depicted as a dot on a horizontal matrix, with the criteria forming the third dimension. In making a full assessment using this model, a value for each criterion would need to be determined for each of the 36 elements in the matrix (in the graph, values would be represented by columns of different heights). That would need to be done for each candidate in an acquisition and the results compared to make a decision.", "A model of such complexity may be limited in its usefulness in practice, especially for customers making purchase decisions. But it illustrates both some of the central features of green procurement, as discussed above, and some of the difficulties that can be involved in making an accurate assessment. For example, little information may exist in many cases about many of the elements in the matrix. ", "Also, alternative products and services being considered for a given acquisition may vary substantially in values for different elements and criteria in ways that are difficult to compare. However, such analyses can be used, for example, by trusted third parties who perform such analyses to determine if products meet green certification or labeling criteria, as is discussed in the next section.

The reduction in the environmental footprint of products and services acquired through green-procurement practices may range from marginal to substantial (see Figure 1 ), depending on the specific policies and approaches taken, among other factors. A full assessment of a product or service involves an integrated evaluation of several factors across the life cycle of that product or service (see Figure 2 ). There are likely to be interactions and trade-offs among different green factors and life cycle stages that would need to be taken into account in any such assessment. Information for many of the elements involved may be difficult to assess accurately. As a result, assessments may be potentially very complex and may need to be made on substantially incomplete information or through use of proxy measures such as green labels. However, because choices are usually comparative\u2014is one choice greener than the others?\u2014full assessments may not usually be required for decisions. Nevertheless, failure to consider a sufficient set of elements may lead to erroneous conclusions.", "Because of such characteristics and complexities, and other factors such as the ways in which programs, policies, and regulations tend to be developed by both governments and private industry, green procurement initiatives often emphasize particular attributes, such as recycled content, energy efficiency, water use or footprints, waste reduction at end of life, and reduction in hazardous chemicals. ", "Green procurement may also be complicated by other factors, such as legal requirements or commitments. For example, with respect to international free trade, one author has cautioned that federal \"green purchasing regulations must be carefully crafted to avoid the appearance of providing hidden subsidies to U.S. contractors; otherwise, trade disputes will arise through the World Trade Organization.\"", "Several approaches to implementing green purchasing programs have been developed by various government and private-sector organizations, and some examples are discussed below.

Such labels and certifications may vary in quality and emphasis. Some, such as EPEAT, may be based on technical standards promulgated or recognized by standard-setting organizations such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Such standards are developed through a voluntary consensus process involving experts and other stakeholders and are periodically updated. Other labels may be based on criteria developed internally by the labeling entity. If a labeling program has insufficient quality control, it may not reflect the promised environmental performance. In some cases, labels may not reflect any green characteristics, a practice known as \"greenwash.\" ", "Some labels or certifications focus primarily on a single factor, such as energy use or water, and some involve evaluations of the designated factor only or largely during the operations stage of the life cycle. That is the case, for example, with Energy Star. A focus on a single factor and life cycle stage has benefits in comparative simplicity of evaluation and ease of understanding by potential users, but it could mask trade-offs involving interactions with other factors or effects at other life cycle stages. ", "Alternatively, labels may be based on a broad set of multifactor or multiattribute standards applied across the life cycle, such as EPEAT and Cradle-to-Cradle. However, such broad, integrative standards may be difficult and time-consuming to develop and keep up-to-date, and as a result, they may apply to relatively few products and may become obsolete. This may be one reason why the federal government uses a variety of certification or labeling systems in its agency-focused initiatives, and why many other organizations use third-party labels and standards as criteria for green procurement decisions, rather than performing the necessary assessments themselves.

In at least some cases, higher acquisition costs may be offset by other savings, as discussed elsewhere in this report. Some organizations have implemented policies designed to address such problems. One approach used by various institutions is called price premiums, where institutional policies permit purchasers to pay a somewhat higher price for a product or service that meets green criteria. This approach can help overcome a common problem in the development of green products, namely that economies of scale may keep prices high as long as the market is small. However, the approach can be wasteful because it may reduce price-competitive incentives among providers. Usually, such green price premiums are comparatively small in practice, reportedly ranging from 3%-15% in one study of state and municipal governmental purchasing programs, but they do not appear to be used for federal green procurement programs. The use of this approach also appears to be declining, according to one recent study.

The institute found that one-third of municipal government agencies and one-fifth of nonfederal agencies had green procurement initiatives, but fewer than one in 20 federal agencies had programs. About two-thirds of agencies recognized the Energy Star label, even though energy was listed as a priority by only one-fifth. About 5% of agencies had established goals, but fewer than 20% of those had met them.

That proposal could have required contractors to use green products when doing work for the government even when that work did not involve the supply or delivery of products to federal agencies or facilities. However, the proposal was never finalized. ", "President Obama's Executive Order on \"Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance\" (E.O. 13514) contains provisions that could potentially have a similar effect. However, it is unclear whether they will be interpreted to such effect in either regulations or other policy implementation, and Congress does not appear to have provided any general guidance to agencies on the applicability of green purchasing preferences and programs to various services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integration and Harmonization of Green Procurement Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The federal approach to green procurement is arguably largely piecemeal and fragmented. The emphasis has largely been on single-attribute preferences, with the exception of EPP, which was designed in a way that could permit it to serve as a framework for an integrated, life cycle approach to federal green procurement. However, it has been implemented as just one among the various preferences, and a comparatively weak one. It has no specific basis in enacted statute and no requirement for formal determination of exemptions. ", "Additionally, there appears to be significant ambiguity about which type of green product or service agencies should procure in situations where multiple types could meet their needs. For example, the FAR requires agencies to acquire recovered-content products instead of biobased ones when both types would meet agency needs. However, no similar guidance exists for the other types of preferred products and services discussed in this report. That leaves agencies without guidance in determining whether, for example, they should procure Energy Star or FEMP-designated products, or recovered-content or environmentally preferable products. Such issues could potentially be addressed through an interagency mechanism such as the Interagency Sustainability Steering Committee established under E.O. 13423 and its working group on acquisition and materials management. An examination of the role of these bodies may be useful in determining how best to effect improved integration and harmonization of the various initiatives.

Three gaps that are particularly notable are ", "the focus of the energy-efficiency preference on use (or operational) energy rather than life cycle energy, the lack of an explicit preference with respect to water use and footprints, and the absence of specific green requirements for end-of-life management for government property such as information technology. ", "Also, EPP is among the weakest of the preferences, since it does not require any specific percentages or amounts of environmentally preferable acquisitions and is not accompanied by any requirement for contractor certification. ", "At present, there is also no single, generally accepted, multiattribute life-cycle-based certification or labeling system that procurement officials can use for all green products and services, as, for example, EPEAT provides for information technology. There is not even a single, well-coordinated list of green products for federal agencies to use, but rather several lists maintained by different agencies. In the absence of such resources and stronger requirements, significant gaps in preferences are liable to persist and the federal green procurement process is likely to remain relatively complex and opaque. However, given the complexities of the procurement process, the potential for success and possible disadvantages of bridging those gaps are not clear and might be difficult to ascertain.

To the degree that Congress finds the current level of green procurement by federal agencies inadequate, or agencies have difficulties implementing green procurement, Congress could promote additional or different implementing mechanisms. Doing so could including granting agencies additional legal authorities.

Certain requirements, most notably those involving environmentally preferable products, may be difficult for the existing workforce to implement because agencies must consider multiple attributes of products when determining which product to purchase. This is a more complex determination than ascertaining whether a product possesses a single attribute, such as energy efficiency, and agencies might need information about vendors' production methods to make such determinations. Proposed requirements focused on products' sustainability or life cycle costs could be difficult to implement for similar reasons. "], "subsections": []}]}]}}
