Recent discussions of this issue have focused mainly on controversial legislative proposals to create a pathway to legal status for a large majority of today's unauthorized aliens. For many years, however, narrower bills were regularly introduced in Congress that sought to provide both legal immigration status and education-related relief to a subgroup of the larger unauthorized population: individuals who were brought, as children, to live in the United States by their parents or other adults. Historically, these bills, commonly referred to as the \"DREAM Act,\" have been less controversial than broader legalization proposals. The name DREAM Act derives from a bill title, Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, but refers more broadly to measures to provide immigration relief to unauthorized childhood arrivals, whether or not particular bills carry that name.", "Unauthorized alien children in the United States may face various obstacles as they get older. They receive free public primary and secondary education, but may find it difficult to attend college for financial reasons. A provision enacted as part of a 1996 immigration law prohibits states from granting unauthorized aliens certain postsecondary educational benefits on the basis of state residence, unless equal benefits are made available to all U.S. citizens. This prohibition is commonly understood to apply to the granting of \"in-state\" residency status for tuition purposes. In addition, unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for federal student financial aid. More generally, they are not legally allowed to work in the United States and are subject to being removed from the country at any time.", "Multiple DREAM Act measures were introduced in the 109th and 110th Congresses both as stand-alone measures and as parts of larger immigration reform bills. Most of these bills had two key components. They would have repealed the 1996 provision, thereby eliminating a restriction on state provision of postsecondary educational benefits to unauthorized aliens. They also would have provided immigration relief to certain unauthorized alien students by establishing a process for them to become legal permanent residents of the United States.", "DREAM Act bills introduced and considered in the 109th and 110th Congresses are the focus of this report. While none of these measures were enacted, they serve as a bridge between older and newer versions of the DREAM Act and provide useful background information for analysis of more recent DREAM Act proposals.

Attending college, however, may be more difficult for them because of their unlawful status. One reason for this is a provision enacted in 1996 as section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which discourages states and localities from granting resident unauthorized aliens certain \"postsecondary education benefits,\" commonly interpreted to include in-state tuition rates. IIRIRA\u00a7505 directs that an unauthorized alien", "shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State (or a political subdivision) for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit (in no less an amount, duration, and scope) without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.", "Another factor that may make it difficult for some unauthorized immigrants to attend college is that they are not eligible for federal student financial aid under the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended.

Adjustment of status is the process of becoming an LPR in the United States without having to go abroad to apply for a visa. For the most part, the DREAM Act bills introduced in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses would have enabled eligible unauthorized immigrants to adjust to LPR status through a mechanism in immigration law known as cancellation of removal . C ancellation of removal is a discretionary form of relief that an alien can apply for while in removal proceedings before an immigration judge.

The INA enumerates grounds of inadmissibility\u2014grounds upon which aliens are ineligible for visas and admission. They include health-related grounds and security- and terrorism-related grounds as well as grounds concerning illegal entrants, public charge (the likelihood that an alien will require public support), and other issues. The INA also enumerates companion deportability grounds. S. 2075 and H.R. 5131 each specified which of the inadmissibility and deportability grounds would have applied to aliens seeking to adjust status under its provisions. A greater number of these grounds would have applied under S. 2075 than H.R. 5131 .
