Currently, salaries of Capitol Police officers assigned to the House aredisbursed by the House Chief Administrative Officer, and salaries of officers assigned to theSenate are disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate. The Committee-reported provision wouldhave consolidated these payrolls. However, during consideration of the bill on the Housefloor on July 18, 2002, Representative Robert Ney raised a point of order against the provisionon the grounds that it violated clause 2 of House Rule XXI by changing existing law.
