The amendment would have added the category \"qualified alien\" to the categories of noncitizens eligible for housing benefits under Section 214 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, bringing Section 214 into conformity with PRWORA. The amendment would have effectively made Cuban/Haitian entrants, aliens whose deportation was being withheld on the basis of prospective persecution prior to 1996, and certain battered aliens statutorily eligible for housing benefits.", "Due to the complicated nature of the interaction of the housing law and PRWORA there was confusion over the purpose of the amendment. While some viewed the amendment as a technical correction, others were concerned that it would have broadened noncitizens' eligibility for housing programs, and still others were concerned that it might have restricted eligibility.", "While the Bond amendment was not included in the conference agreement, the conference report directed", "the Department [of Housing and Urban Development] to work with the Department of Justice to develop any necessary technical corrections to applicable housing statutes with respect to qualified aliens who are victims of domestic violence and Cuban and Haitian immigrants to ensure that such statutes are consistent with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Personal Responsibility Act of 1996 ( H.Rept. 108-10 )."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Alien Eligibility as Applied to Specific Housing Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 214-Covered Programs (Including Public Housing and Section 8)", "paragraphs": ["There are several potentially conflicting interpretations of the interaction of Section 214 and PRWORA and uncertainty regarding HUD's interpretation of the noncitizen eligibility restrictions. Under one possible interpretation, to be eligible for Section 214 programs, a class of noncitizens cannot be prohibited from receiving benefits under PRWORA and must be listed as an eligible class under Section 214. For example, parolees who have been in the United States for less than one year would be ineligible for Section 214 programs because, although they are eligible under Section 214, they are prohibited under PRWORA. On the other hand, battered immigrants would be ineligible for Section 214 programs because, although they are not ineligible for benefits under PRWORA, they are not listed as eligible under Section 214. Interestingly, under this interpretation, the interaction between Section 214 and PRWORA make the alien eligibility requirements for Section 214 housing programs more restrictive than the requirements for other federal public benefits, although by itself Section 214 is not necessarily more restrictive than the provisions in PRWORA.", "A second possible interpretation depends on whether or not PRWORA makes qualified aliens affirmatively eligible for benefits. PRWORA states \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision in the law ... an alien who is not a qualified alien ... is not eligible for any federal public benefits.\" It could be asserted that by not prohibiting qualified aliens from federal public benefits, PRWORA grants eligibility to qualified aliens for federal public benefits. Since PRWORA effectively supercedes Section 214 (given the \"notwithstanding\" clause), under this interpretation, all noncitizens who are qualified aliens would be eligible for Section 214-covered housing programs.", "Despite statutory and regulatory arguments, this second interpretation may, in fact, reflect what is happening in practice. Prior to the enactment of PRWORA, HUD released regulations based on Section 214 that established a standard for verifying an applicant's immigration status. To verify eligibility, PHAs and property owners use the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, which enables federal, state, and local governmental agencies to obtain immigration status information to determine eligibility for public benefits. The SAVE system is also used to determine noncitizen eligibility for other benefits including Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and food assistance which use the noncitizen eligibility restrictions outlined in PRWORA. As a result, it is possible that some housing authorities are using the noncitizen eligibility requirements specified in PRWORA, without regard to Section 214.", "As noted earlier, mixed families are eligible to receive prorated assistance from Section 214-covered programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD's Homeless Assistance Programs", "paragraphs": ["HUD's homeless programs include the Shelter Plus Care (S+C) program, the Supportive Housing Program (SHP), the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program, and the Emergency Shelter Grants (ESG) program, all of which are funded under the Homeless Assistance Grants account, as well as the Housing for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) program. One of the programs funded through the Homeless Assistance Grants is a Section 214-covered program: the SRO program. Housing units for homeless individuals provided through the SRO program are developed through the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program and receive Section 8 rental assistance. As a result, nonqualified aliens (e.g., nonimmigrants and unauthorized aliens) as defined by Section 214 are ineligible for the SRO program. However, HOPWA and the remaining homeless programs\u2014S+C, SHP, and ESG\u2014are not covered by Section 214.", "Although PRWORA lists \"housing assistance\" as a federal public benefit governed by the statute, HUD has not issued regulations to clarify whether HUD homeless assistance programs are considered \"federal public benefits,\" and therefore subject to PRWORA's noncitizen eligibility restrictions. Assuming the homeless assistance programs (S+C, SHP, ESG, and HOPWA) are governed by PRWORA, citizens and qualified aliens are effectively eligible for benefits from all homeless assistance programs if they meet need standards. The status of nonqualified aliens is less clear, as the assistance provided through some of HUD's homeless programs could fit the PRWORA exception allowing nonqualified aliens access to emergency programs. The exception applies if the benefit provided meets three requirements:", "1. it is an in-kind benefit provided through public or private nonprofit organizations, 2. the benefit is not conditioned on a client's income or resources, and 3. the benefit is necessary for the protection of life and safety.", "Temporary emergency shelter provided through the ESG program could fulfill the requirements of this exception. However, some transitional and all permanent housing may not meet the second requirement. Formerly homeless individuals who reside in permanent supportive housing provided through S+C or SHP pay a portion of their income toward rent. The same is true for some transitional housing provided through SHP. HUD has not published guidance indicating which, if any, of its programs are considered to meet the three requirements for exception from PRWORA as emergency programs.", "Another portion of PRWORA that could be relevant for homeless assistance programs is a provision that exempts \"nonprofit charitable organizations\" that provide federal public benefits from having to verify the eligibility of program participants. To the extent that administrators of HUD's homeless assistance programs are nonprofit organizations, which many of them are, they are not required under the terms of PRWORA to verify their clients' citizenship status. Thus, nonqualified aliens may be receiving services from these organizations, regardless of their eligibility status. Furthermore, HUD has not published guidance regarding the verification of immigration status for homeless programs that are not governed by Section 214, whether or not they are administered by a charitable organization, making it even more unclear whether or not, in practice, nonqualified aliens receive benefits.

The Section 202 and 811 programs are similar to the Section 8 project-based rental assistance program (which is a Section 214-covered program), but they are administered by nonprofits rather than PHAs. HOME and CDBG are block grants administered by units of state and local government, who generally award the funds to nonprofit partners. HOME funds housing activities; CDBG funds community development-related activities.", "Presumably, the PRWORA restrictions on noncitizen eligibility apply to the other HUD needs-based housing programs; however, the assistance provided through these programs may or may not be considered \"federal public benefits.\" HUD has not issued guidance defining which types of assistance under the other needs-based housing programs are \"federal public benefits\" and subject to PRWORA's noncitizen eligibility restrictions.

Nonqualified aliens (e.g., unauthorized aliens), as a result of PRWORA, are not legally eligible for any housing benefits from other HUD needs-based programs. However, it is important to note that, unlike Section 214-covered programs, there are no regulations requiring the verification of beneficiaries' citizenship for other HUD needs-based programs, so it is possible that nonqualified aliens may be receiving housing benefits, regardless of their eligibility. (See discussion under \" Documentation and Verification \" later in this report.) Further, much of the assistance provided by the other needs-based housing programs is administered through nonprofits, which, as noted earlier in this report, are not required to verify immigration status.
