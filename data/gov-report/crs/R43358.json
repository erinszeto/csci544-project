These products continue to be associated with fraud, along with some other foods. Although the vast majority of fraud incidents do not pose a public health risk, some cases have resulted in actual or potential public health risks. Perhaps the most high-profile case has involved the addition of melamine to high-protein feed and milk-based products to artificially inflate protein values in products that may have been diluted. In 2007, pet food adulterated with melamine reportedly killed a large number of dogs and cats in the United States, followed by reports that melamine-contaminated baby formula had sickened thousands of Chinese children. Fraud was also a motive behind Peanut Corporation of America's actions in connection with the Salmonella outbreak in 2009, which killed 9 people and sickened 700. Reports also indicate that fish and seafood fraud is widespread, consisting mostly of a lower-valued species, which may be associated with some types of food poisoning or allergens, mislabeled as a higher-value species. Other types of foods associated with fraud include honey, meat and grain-based foods, fruit juices, organic foods, coffee, and some highly processed foods.", "It is not known conclusively how widespread food fraud is in the United States or worldwide.

Most incidents go undetected since they usually do not result in a food safety risk and consumers often do not notice a quality problem. Although the full scale of food fraud is not known, the number of documented incidents may be a small fraction of the true number of incidents. The Grocery Manufacturers Association estimates that fraud may cost the global food industry between $10 billion and $15 billion per year, affecting approximately 10% of all commercially sold food products. Fraud resulting in a food safety or public health risk event could have significant financial or public relations consequences for a food industry or company.", "There is no statutory definition of food fraud or \"economically motivated adulteration\" (EMA) of foods or food ingredients in the United States. However, as part of a 2009 public meeting, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted a working definition, defining EMA as the \"fraudulent, intentional substitution or addition of a substance in a product for the purpose of increasing the apparent value of the product or reducing the cost of its production, i.e., for economic gain.\" Efforts are ongoing to compile and capture current and historical data on food fraud and EMA incidents through the creation of databases and repositories.", "Over the years, Congress has introduced a number of bills intended to address concerns about food fraud for a particular food or food ingredient. Such legislation has not addressed food fraud in a comprehensive manner. However, although no single federal agency or U.S. law directly addresses food fraud, a number of existing laws and statutes already provide the authority for various federal agencies to address fraud. Currently, food fraud is broadly addressed through various food safety, food defense, and food quality authorities as well as border protection and import authorities across a number of federal agencies. FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are the principle agencies that are working to protect the food supply from food safety risks\u2014both unintentionally and intentionally introduced contamination\u2014in conjunction with border protection and enforcement activities by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

It is not known conclusively how widespread food fraud is in the United States or worldwide. In part, this is because those who commit fraud do not intend to cause physical harm and want to avoid detection. Most incidents go undetected since they usually do not result in a food safety risk and consumers often do not notice a quality problem. Moreover, as the motivation to commit fraud is illicit monetary gain, the type of food that might be or become adulterated is a secondary consideration (i.e., it could be any type of food or food ingredient); rather, it is the opportunity or feasibility of committing fraud that generally triggers the fraud.", "Although the vast majority of food fraud incidents do not pose a public health risk, there have been fraud cases that have resulted in actual or potential public health risks. Perhaps the most widely cited, high-profile cases have involved the addition of melamine to high-protein feed and milk-based products to artificially inflate protein values in products that may have been diluted. For example, in 2007, evidence emerged that adulterated pet food ingredients from China had caused the deaths of a large number of dogs and cats in the United States. This was followed by reports that melamine-contaminated baby formula had sickened an estimated 300,000 Chinese children, killing a reported 6 infants. Evidence now suggests that safety risks associated with melamine-tainted feed date back to 2003, and that melamine was first reported to be added to artificially increase protein content in feed as far back as 1982. ", "Reports also indicate fish and seafood fraud may be widespread in some markets, consisting mostly of the mislabeling or substitution of a higher-valued species with something different from and inferior to the expected species, possibly with a fish species which could be associated with some types of food poisoning or exposure to certain allergens. Similarly, substitution of olive oil with other types of seed, legume, or nut oils could have unintended consequences, if consumed by those with certain food allergies. ", "Some cases might not initially appear to involve intentional adulteration, except on closer examination. Charges of fraud were part of the federal criminal indictment charging former officials of the Peanut Corporation of America with numerous offenses in connection with the Salmonella outbreak in 2009\u2014which killed 9 people and sickened 700\u2014since company officials were found to have sold and distributed product known to be contaminated. That case resulted in one of the largest product recalls in U.S. history, including 3,912 products that contain peanut butter and peanut paste ingredients, such as cookies, crackers, cereal, candy, ice cream, pet treats, and other foods, which were manufactured by more than 200 companies.", "Risks from other types of fraudulent foods are not as well-documented and may be less immediate or may never be known. Generally, only those who have knowledge of the fraud are those who commit the fraud. In some cases, independent tests might uncover fraud. For example, FDA testing upon import has documented the presence of unapproved chemicals in honey, which have triggered import alerts. Reports indicate that honey from China may contain certain unapproved antibiotics or other agricultural chemicals. Reports also indicate that some fruit juices may be made from or diluted with juice from rotten fruit and may contain toxic mold. In recent years, fraud involving the addition of certain food processing aids (known as \"clouding agents\") has raised concern given the potential public health risks and reportedly increased use in certain highly processed foods. Some fraud cases might only be uncovered following an investigation in the wake of a public health event, such as when pet food adulterated with melamine caused the deaths of dogs and cats in the United States. Some fraud cases, however, might never be discovered even though they could contribute to chronic long-term health consequences. ", "Other food fraud concerns might not result in a public health or food safety crisis, but instead deprive the food buyer of the product they think they are getting. Most food fraud cases involve the substitution of a high-value product with a less expensive or lower quality alternative. Such cases include cheaper products mislabeled as extra virgin olive oil from Italy, wild Alaskan salmon, caviar, and pomegranate juice or juices from other \"super\" fruit. In another example, in Europe in early 2013, it was reported that products labeled as containing beef were found to actually contain 80%-100% horsemeat, which the meat supplier had knowingly failed to report to local authorities. Although the horsemeat incident ultimately did not result in public health consequences, initial concerns about potential health risks due to, for example, phenylbutazone resulted in a substantial expenditure of public resources over the course of the investigation. Such cases also erode consumer confidence and may cause other concerns for a variety of societal or cultural reasons.", "The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) estimates that fraud may cost the global food industry between $10 billion and $15 billion per year, affecting approximately 10% of all commercially sold food products. However, most researchers acknowledge that the full scale of food fraud \"may be unknown or even possibly unknowable\" even though the number of documented incidents is \"most likely a fraction of the true number of incidents, since the goal of adulteration for economic gain is not to be detected.\" Compared to the trillions of dollars spent on food and food ingredients globally each year, however, \"the prevalence of food fraud is ultimately very low.\" Fraud resulting in a food safety or public health risk event, however, could have significant financial or public relations consequences for a food industry or company. GMA estimates that fraud costs food businesses in terms of lost sales, estimated between 2% and 15% of annual revenues, as well as possible bankruptcies if adverse public health consequences occur. ", "The text box on the next page describes some of the types of foods and food ingredients associated with fraud based on available research and information. ", "Addressing food fraud concerns has become exceedingly complicated by rising U.S. imports and increased globalization of the world's food and agricultural supplies. Increasingly, multiple product ingredients and inputs are sourced from a range of countries, both in terms of individually sourced products and ingredients between individual food companies/importers as well as in terms of internally sourced products from foreign-owned entities within a larger multinational company (such as global sourcing between parent and subsidiary). It is difficult to detect and trace not only the source of unintentional contamination and related food safety concerns, but it is often more difficult to detect and trace-back instances of intentional product fraud, especially in highly processed foods with multiple ingredients and inputs from multiple suppliers.", "This report provides an overview of issues pertaining to food fraud and \"economically motivated adulteration\" or EMA, a category within food fraud. First, the report provides general background information on food fraud and EMA, including how it is defined and the types of fraud, as well as how food fraud fits into the broader policy realm of food safety, food defense, and food quality. Second, the report provides available information about foods and ingredients with reported cases of fraud from two databases: (1) the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Food Fraud Database and (2) the National Center for Food Protection and Defense (NCFPD) EMA Incident Database.

A recent European Union (EU) report on food fraud states the EU laws do not provide for a \"generally acknowledged definition of food fraud\" despite an extensive legislative framework focused on food safety. The only general guideline is found in EU regulations requiring that food labeling, advertising, presentation, and packaging \"shall not mislead consumers.\" However, these requirements reportedly vary among EU member states and food fraud in Europe remains largely undetected, similar to that in the United States. The United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency (FSA) describes \"food fraud\" as the deliberate placement on the market, for financial gain, with the intention of deceiving the consumer, covering two main types of fraud. These include the sale of food which is unfit and potentially harmful as well as the deliberate misdescription of food, such as products substituted with a cheaper alternative.", "Researchers and industry groups actively working in this area have myriad definitions of food fraud and EMA.

Food fraud is always economically motivated. Motivation in the case of food defense includes the intention to inflict public harm or threaten consumers, and is considered to be food fraud. Food fraud usually is perpetrated by actors normally involved in the food chain that have regular access to the food product (e.g., manufacturers or distributors). Problems with food defense usually are perpetrated by outsiders, including terrorists, who do not normally have access to the food product. NCFPD reports that most incidents of food fraud generally do not result in public health harm; however, sometimes perpetrators of food fraud \"make mistakes and unintended health consequences result.\" Table 1 contrasts the different types of food-related risks, and provides examples, causes and motivations, primary and secondary effects, and also types of public health risks.", "In contrast, problems with food safety and food quality are unintentional. Both food quality and food safety incidents may result in an economic impact to a particular food or food ingredient industry, for example, due to reduced purchases or brand equity, but also from product recalls, process controls, and liability in the case of food safety. Food safety concerns can also cause a threat to public health and create public fear. Adulteration will cause a loss of the consumer's trust in the food supply chain, and a loss in trust among regulators, industry, and U.S. trading partners, and may result in market and trade disruptions. Unintentional adulteration involving food quality concerns might also occur due to environmental factors, and packaging, storage, and distribution issues, among other factors.

The information contained in these databases is from the University of Minnesota as well as the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), a long-standing scientific nonprofit organization. In addition, researchers from Michigan State University conducted further analysis of the USP databases, along with USP researchers. These databases provide a relatively new resource to examine food fraud incidents, and were first published starting in 2012 and 2013. Since then, information from these databases has been published in peer reviewed journal articles and presented at professional conferences by both academic researchers and industry leaders.

DEHP might also be used in food contact materials, such as seals and packaging. DEHP is associated with public health risks, including cancer and reproductive concerns. The scope of the fraud involving clouding agents covers 877 food products from 315 companies, with 206 products exported to a reported 22 countries.

Comparisons, shown in Table 3 , are intended to illustrate why different reports provide differing rankings of foods associated with fraud. The prominence of \"organic foods\" in the European study may be explained by the decision to distinguish organically certified products separately from all reported foods categorized by food ingredient category (which include both organic and conventionally produced foods and food ingredients). The overall prominence of \"fish\" in the European study may also be explained in that products may have been ranked across all records and not separated according to \"scholarly\" versus \"media\" records.

FDA, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for ensuring the safety of all domestic and imported food products (except for most meats and poultry). USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulates most meat and poultry and some egg products. However, the boundaries between the two agencies' jurisdictions are complex and often at odds with commonplace distinctions among food groups. The laws that grant these and other federal agencies authority over foods and food ingredients also provide these agencies with the authority to govern the labeling of these products, which might also act as a further deterrent to food fraud in some cases.", "Other federal agencies also provide product quality standards and grading, including FDA, USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has actively pursued a number of food fraud cases in the U.S. courts involving a range of products and resulting in criminal convictions in some cases. In the high-profile case involving the Peanut Corporation of America, company executives were indicted in early 2013 with federal criminal charges that included fraud, conspiracy, and the introduction of adulterated food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead. USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) has taken numerous enforcement actions against companies involving false labeling claims on organic foods, and a number of advocacy groups have filed lawsuits involving concerns about the validity of organic claims. NOAA also has conducted federal investigations and taken enforcement actions involving seafood labeling and misbranding.", "The text box below provides a comparison of FDA and USDA responsibilities for food safety and regulations, and responsibilities of other federal agencies.", "The federal government also has helped fund some of the ongoing research.

Along with other specified prohibited acts, the law provides that introducing adulterated or misbranded food into commerce; adulterating or misbranding food that is in commerce; or the receipt and delivery of adulterated or misbranded food in commerce is prohibited. As such, under FFDCA, two of the basic statutory components are \"adulteration\" and \"misbranding.\" ", "FDA-regulated foods may be deemed adulterated or misbranded for a variety of statutorily prescribed reasons. For example, food may be deemed adulterated if it contains an added poisonous or deleterious substance or an unsafe food additive or if the food was prepared, packed, or held under unsanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated or may have been rendered injurious to health.

FFDCA Section 403 (21 U.S.C. \u00a7343) defines a number of conditions under which a food would be deemed to be misbranded. A food is deemed misbranded if it has a false or misleading label, is offered for sale under another name, is an imitation of another food, or is in a \"misleading container\" that is \"made, formed, or filled to be misleading,\" among other types of misrepresentative packing or labeling. Similar to the definition of adulteration, numerous specific types of misbranding are also defined. These include, among others, failure to disclose specific additives or allergens in the food, and failure to provide required nutritional information. (In addition to FFDCA, FDA has regulatory authority under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [FPLA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a71451 et seq. ].

FSMA aims to prevent both intentional and unintentional introduced contamination of foods through a variety of strategies to prevent food contamination and through enhanced regulatory authorities. FDA has not yet implemented many of the law's major provisions. FSMA provides for increased food risk protection by creating mechanisms whereby food companies are required to identify and implement preventive controls to ensure adulterated products are not sold and then share their plan with the FDA to ensure compliance with good manufacturing practices. Having such controls in place would also allow companies to consider their responsibility regarding potentially adulterated foods involving the \"absence, substitution, or addition of constituents.\" Some speculate that provisions under FSMA will likely result in increased detection and prevention of adulterated foods by the food companies, both under FFDCA Section 402(a) (21 U.S.C. \u00a7342[a]) and FFDCA Section 402(b) (21 U.S.C. \u00a7342[b]).

These regulations would address, among other things, \"hazards that occur naturally, may be unintentionally introduced, or may be intentionally introduced, including by acts of terrorism.\" As part of its proposed rule published in January 2013, FDA states that intentional hazards, such as EMA, might require separate agency action. As part of the proposed rulemaking, FDA also has requested public comment on if and how it should address EMA:", "FDA tentatively concludes that intentional hazards, which are not addressed in traditional HACCP or other food safety systems, likely will require different kinds of controls and would be best addressed in a separate rulemaking ... We request comment on whether to include potential hazards that may be intentionally introduced for economic reasons ... [and] on when an economically motivated adulterant can be considered reasonably likely to occur.", "FSMA S ection 106 (Protection Against Intentional Adulteration). FSMA requires FDA to issue regulations to protect against the intentional adulteration of food, such as \"specifying appropriate science-based mitigation strategies or measures to prepare and protect the food supply chain from intentional adulteration at specific vulnerable points.\" The proposal for this rulemaking was published in December 2013, and is the first time FDA has proposed a regulatory approach for preventing intentional adulteration of food. FSMA S ection 108 (National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy). FSMA requires that the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture develop a National Agriculture and Food Defense Strategy, implementation plan, and research agenda. This strategy and the accompanying documents have not yet been published. FSMA Title 3 (Improving the Safety of Imported Food). To the extent that food fraud may be attributable to foods imported into the United States, FSMA provides for a series of requirements to ensure the safety of imported foods. Tightened import requirements may act to limit future fraud, or lend greater credibility to foods and food ingredients that are imported under these requirements. FSMA also recognizes \"third party\" audits or certifications, and several such entities have already started to address food fraud both in term of identifying terms or assessing implementation actions such as vulnerability assessments. FDA's proposed rules were published in July 2013. FSMA S ection 402 (Employee Protections). FSMA expands protections for employees (whistleblowers) who provide information relating to FFDCA violations, such as testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding on such a violation, refusing to participate in an activity that may violate FFDCA. FSMA S ection 201(b) (Annual Report Regarding Food).
