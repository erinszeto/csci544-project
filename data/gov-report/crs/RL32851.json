DOT maintains that addressing security concerns should be partof an overall strategy to manage the risk of hazmats during transportation. Different modaladministrations in DOT have conducted an array of activities to promote hazmat transportationsecurity. Among the most significant actions are DOT's visits to thousands of hazmat carriers andissuance of the security planning and training regulations and permit requirements mentioned below. DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Federal Railroad Administration(FRA), and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrations (PHMSA) are keyparticipants in promoting the security of hazmat transportation in the surface mode. (3) ", "FMCSA has influenced security efforts through direct contacts with industry, enhancedregulatory requirements, grants to state motor carrier safety officers, diverse training, and operationaltesting of security measures. For example, this agency has conducted more than 37,000 visits tohazmat trucking companies to provide technical assistance intended to enhance the security of theiroperations. Since April 2003, FMCSA has conducted more than 850 security contact reviews duringwhich its specialists seek to determine whether a motor carrier's security plan and security trainingprocedures comply with federal regulations. Enforcement actions have resulted from these reviews. Furthermore, FMCSA requires trucking companies transporting shipments of certain \"highly\"hazardous materials to obtain a special hazmat safety permit. (4) FMCSA has stated that thepermit is needed because certain highly hazardous materials, should they be released in crashes orattacked by terrorists, would be more dangerous than some other hazmats. FMCSA also hasprovided enforcement grants to border states to enhance inspection of hazmat shipments entering theUnited States. Also, FMCSA sponsored an evaluation of a variety of technologies intended toenhance security, e.g., systems to track trucks transporting hazmats and ways to stop these vehiclesin case of hijack. More specifically, FMCSA supported an operational test involving about 100trucks equipped with an array of security-oriented technologies. This \"on the road\" experimentassessed the costs and benefits of various security enhancing technologies and communicationsystems to ascertain opportunities for further advances. Also, this agency issued a \"Guide toDeveloping an Effective Security Plan for the Highway Transportation of Hazardous Materials,\"which was developed by Battelle and TotalSecurity.US. (5) ", "In addition, FMCSA has provided training to its safety specialists to increase their knowledgeof the federal transportation security regulations. This DOT modal administration is also deliveringa short course to police officers entitled \"Trucks and Terrorism.\" The course is intended to helppolice officers recognize a suspicious activity pertaining to a trucking operation, (e.g., shippingoranges into Florida during their orange harvesting season), or a suspicious action of a driver thatmay indicate a terrorist intent. FMCSA has developed an extensive communications/notificationsystem, as well, that reaches hundreds of thousands of drivers and thousands of companies regardingpossible security threats and other security-related information. FMCSA has warned industry ofheightened security situations and provides alerts regarding specific vehicles or shipments.

(6) Some inindustry consider DOT's rule on security plans to be overly broad in its applicability. Some areconcerned that DOT's assessment of whether a company's security plan meets federal requirementsis too subjective. (7) ThisDOT regulation covers a wide array of companies, including those offering or transporting a loadof hazmat that needs to be placarded. Thus this regulation covers much of the hazmat industry. According to a spokesman, the DOT has chosen not to be too prescriptive in its security planregulation and instead, within the general framework of what is required, expects each company todevelop and implement appropriate measures tailored to its specific operating conditions andcommodities being transported. (8) ", "PHMSA also requires that security awareness training must be provided by a specified dateto all hazmat employees, and that employees of companies required to prepare a security plan mustreceive training on the plan. (9) (FMCSA, FRA, and PHMSA inspectors are seeking to promotecompliance with these regulations, and state that they are bringing enforcement actions againstcompanies that are not in compliance with the security regulations.) Also, PHMSA has issued aframework for risk management applicable to the transportation of hazardous materials. Theproduct, designated as the \"Risk Management Self-Evaluation Framework (RMSEF)\", is intendedto help companies develop hazmat security plans.

With respect to hazmat transportation byrail, the FRA is participating in various government and private sector efforts to conduct a reviewand security risk assessment of hazmat shipments through various major metropolitan areas. FRAhas provided technical advice to the DHS on tank cars and hazmat transportation. Also FRAconducts hazmat training for first responders that deals with possible toxic releases due to securityor safety issues. FRA has participated in hazmat security exercises that focused on response toterrorist strikes affecting all transportation modes. In addition, FRA has conducted more than 1,200inspections of shippers and railroads to check for compliance with DOT's hazmat securityregulations.

Also,DHS has issued a standardized management plan for incident response. This Department operatesthe Homeland Security Operations Center, which serves as the primary, national-level center forreal-time threat monitoring and situational awareness, domestic incident management, and relatedinformation sharing efforts.

TSA maintains that under this authority, it may \"...identify a securitythreat to a mode of transportation, develop a measure for dealing with that threat, and enforcecompliance with that measure.\" (11) DHS and DOT agree that they share responsibility for hazmattransportation security. In a memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding broad transportationsecurity responsibilities and communications, DOT acknowledges that DHS has primaryresponsibility for transportation security, and that DOT supports DHS by providing technicalassistance and helping DHS with its security policies, when possible. DOT retains statutoryauthority and responsibility for such matters as transportation of hazmat (including security).

Thus, in terms of resources invested, TSA states that it\"...has been unable to place the focus on hazmat transportation security that is warranted.\" (12) TSA's activities intendedto promote hazmat transportation security are not concentrated in one office, but are part of theresponsibility of several of its offices. TSA maintains that this structure is intended to maximizeresources and program effectiveness. ", "TSA uses a variety of different approaches seeking to improve the security of hazmatshipments. These include planning, communications, research, and training activities. One of TSA'searlier planning activities was to develop a document called the \"Sector Specific Plan (SSP) forTransportation,\" which is part of the broader National Infrastructure Protection Plan. The SSP isintended to: (1) identify participants in the transportation sector, their roles and relationships, andmeans of communication; (2) identify critical transportation assets; (3) assess transportation sectorvulnerabilities and prioritize assets; (4) identify protective programs; (5) measure securityperformance; and (6) prioritize research and development to advance security technologies.

For example, on August 16, 2004, TSA andRSPA (now PHMSA) issued a request for comments and information on the feasibility and impactsof initiating security enhancements regarding rail shipments of toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials. Both agencies are examining the need for possible \"hardening\" of aspects of the rail transportationsystem for TIH materials and the costs and benefits of these measures.

An issue is whether alternative means of hazard communication arepracticable that would concurrently promote safety, emergency response and security. Some fearthat existing communication requirements could help a terrorist or criminal identify a potentialtarget for harm; but many in the emergency response community want DOT to continue to requireits hazards communications system. TSA has sponsored a study that bears on this issue. ", "Also, TSA and PHMSA are considering how the security plans pertaining to TIH materialsrequired by PHMSA might be improved, and whether and how specific criteria for these plans mightbe required to more adequately address security risks. It remains uncertain what actions either TSAand/or PHMSA will take as a result of this August 16, 2004 initiative and when such actions mightoccur.", "This August 16, 2004 regulatory announcement suggests that TSA intends to take a muchmore definitive role in promoting the security of these materials in the rail mode.

Experts from industry, FRA, and others under TSA'sleadership conduct these analyses which typically include vulnerability assessments, analysis offreight operations, and buffer zone protection studies. As a result of this process, TSA providesrecommendations to industry and governmental officials in the corridor and tries to get cooperationand buy-in from various stakeholders to implement the necessary improvements. (17) TSA has completed itsassessment of the Washington, DC corridor, and states that it has made progress on assessingcorridors in Ohio and New Jersey.

TSA also provided FMCSA with funds to help that agency formulate its hazmat carrierpermit program, which was previously mentioned. TSA is initiating a security awareness programfor the truck leasing/rental industry. One of the purposes of this effort would be to increase thesensitivity of counter employees to possible security risks, such as illegal transport of hazmat, posedby someone seeking to rent a truck with terrorist intent.

With cooperation from the states, TSA is gradually implementing Section1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act ( P.L. 107-56 ). This provision seeks to reduce some of the securityrisks associated with hazmat transportation by requiring a security threat assessment of drivers witha hazmat endorsement on their commercial drivers license (CDL). This process, which includesimmigration and database checks, may deter a terrorist from obtaining or keeping such anendorsement; nevertheless, the hazmat transportation system remains vulnerable to attack. Membersof Congress are overseeing implementation of TSA's program, reviewing its financial impacts, anddeciding whether to explicitly require in law a similar review of Canadian- and Mexican-domicileddrivers transporting specified hazmats into the United States. This provision is included in H.R. 3 , which the House passed.

These checksgenerated more than 100 leads that were sent to the FBI. TSA recognizes that the reliability of thisprocess will be improved by incorporating a fingerprint-based criminal background check. For eachof the next five years, TSA will put roughly 1/5 of the commercial drivers seeking to renew, obtain,and in some cases transfer, a hazmat endorsement through a more comprehensive threat assessmentprocess, including a fingerprint-based records review. This complex process is underpinned bydetailed federal regulations and state procedures that pose costs or uncertainties for drivers orcarriers. Through its adjudication process, TSA will face the difficult task of quickly responding tomany drivers appealing TSA's initial decisions effectively denying their hazmat endorsement orseeking waivers from program standards. TSA conducts name-based checks periodically of driversholding a hazmat endorsement on their license.", "TSA and the states have faced many challenges in the development and implementation ofthis initiative. The complete program was originally planned to start in 2003, however, it wasdelayed several times. As of January 31, 2005, TSA has not permitted a state to issue a new hazmatendorsement with a CDL until a determination has been made that an applicant does not pose asecurity threat.

As discussed below, some of the federal efforts to promote security are just beginning tohave an impact, and some of these impacts are rather limited in reach or scope. ", "FMCSA Activities. Starting in early 2005,FMCSA began issuing hazmat permits to carriers transporting specified high hazard materials. Allcarriers subject to the hazmat safety permit requirements (e.g., 49 CFR 385.403) are required to gothrough the permit process. Essentially, the first round of carriers should be considered for thepermit within approximately the next 21 months as they register or renew their registration withFMCSA. (22) As thisoccurs, FMCSA will issue temporary permits and conduct compliance reviews on those carrierswithout a safety rating that meet other eligibility requirements for a hazmat permit. FMCSA's reviewis intended to check the compliance of these carriers with various FMCSA-issued safety regulationsas well as PHMSA-issued hazmat security regulations. During the compliance review, FMCSAstates that its safety specialists audit the certifications made by industry as part of the permitapplication. Or, FMCSA will issue the hazmat safety permit to those carriers with a satisfactoryrating that otherwise meet the requirements for the permit. As previously indicated, FMCSA hasalready reviewed hundreds of hazmat carriers to check for their compliance with the PHMSA-issuedregulations prior to January 1, 2005. ", "It is difficult to assess the impact of FMCSA's permit requirements on security because sofew carriers have actually obtained the permit to date. FMCSA expects that eventually some 3,100carriers will seek this permit. As of March 21, 2005, about 180 carriers had received permits, while125 applications were rejected. (23) The financial penalties that can result from enforcement casesbased on FMCSA's compliance reviews plus the legal consequences of falsifying certificationsrequired to obtain the permit serve as two forces promoting compliance with PHMSA's security planregulations. FMCSA maintains that increased security measures required as part of the permitprogram reduces the chance that the high hazard materials transported by the covered carriers couldbe used in a terrorist attack. Although this statement may be true, compliance with current federalsecurity measures, which leave much discretion to industry regarding required measures to be taken, could still leave considerable vulnerability to attack, and also do not require constant 24/7communications for high hazard shipments between a carrier and the driver. (24) ", "DHS Activities. As previously noted, TSA's rolein hazmat transportation is evolving. Not surprisingly, some of TSA's efforts are just beginning tohave an impact. For example, the fingerprint-based, security threat assessment that TSA performson CDL holders regarding their hazmat endorsement began in early 2005. The actual impact of thisprocess on hazmat transportation security is difficult to determine, but most observers would agreethat, at best, its impact will be rather limited in the broader scheme. TSA's threat assessment processmay deter someone who may be a terrorist from obtaining or keeping a hazmat endorsement. Butthat person still can do harm using hazmats in transportation without first obtaining a hazmatendorsement. The questions could be asked: Is a terrorist likely to acquire or maintain a hazmatendorsement if they need to submit to a fingerprint check, an immigration status check, a criminalbackground review, and multiple-database name-only checks? Does the benefit of obtaining ahazmat endorsement overcome the potential risk of being uncovered as a terrorist? TSA's securitythreat assessment process, however, is not intended or designed to address all the vulnerabilities inthe hazmat transportation system. In the war against terrorism, TSA's threat assessment process isviewed by some as a prudent measure, by others as a \"feel good\" measure; it is generally recognized,however, that this investment is inherently limited in its impact. ", "On the other hand, by not being able to obtain or keep such an endorsement, easy access tosome parts of the hazmat transportation system can be reduced, thus making it more difficult to doharm. Also, TSA's security threat process may make it more difficult for a group of terrorists toorganize a coordinated attack using hazmat. Furthermore, TSA's name-only based checks havegenerated more than 100 leads that were sent to the FBI, according to TSA. ", "The impact or reach of some of TSA's other efforts to promote hazmat security also islimited. To date, TSA has not issued a comprehensive set of regulations that requires the various keycomponents of the hazmat transportation industry (e.g., all high hazard shippers and carriers) toimplement a detailed system of security-oriented measures that meets specified criteria beyond thosenow required by DOT. There is little indication that the TSA plans to issue such comprehensiveregulations, at least in the near-term, although this agency, working with DOT, may first strengthenrequirements pertaining to TIH materials transported in the rail mode. ", "TSA notes that it has been working with the DOT on the issuance of certain securitydirectives and guidance documents that would be designed to address the security risks associatedwith shipping and transporting certain types and quantities of hazmat. TSA maintains that beforethe agency issues \"...any regulations or adopt standards for key components of the HAZMATtransportation industry, a detailed risk assessment and identification of system vulnerabilities shouldtake place. Doing so will allow TSA to properly prioritize and focus their resources on those areasthat are deemed to be most vulnerable and subject to terrorist acts.\" (25) It remains uncertain whenTSA will issue new security directives or guidance documents pertaining to hazmat transportationsecurity. ", "Also, DOT and DHS have not issued a final regulation that would result in a national routingsystem governing all rail and highway hazmat shipments that requires local or state jurisdictions totake into account and evaluate various safety considerations, security risks, and logistical tradeoffs,and dictates specific routes and security-based procedures. More importantly, there is not aconsensus that there should be such a routing system. (26) For certain events often involving large numbers of people, DHS states that it works cooperatively with industry to encourage appropriate measures to reducerisk associated with certain hazmat shipments in the impacted vicinity. For example, TSA mayencourage industry to hold certain shipments for several hours away from certain populated areas.

Federal and state motor carrier specialists and railroadinspectors primarily focus on promoting compliance with applicable safety regulations. (In general,security problems can be much more difficult to detect than safety problems.) Funding limitationsfor inspector resources allow only a small percentage of the vehicles (tank trucks and tank cars)entering or near heavily populated areas to be checked. Many safety/regulatory inspectors are notequipped with the necessary technologies, e.g., radiation detection devices, that would help detectsome potential security risks. The increased use of technology (e.g., radiation detectors) wouldenhance security, but there are associated costs. Furthermore, based on discussions with variousparticipants in the commercial vehicle safety community, it appears that all inspectors funded by theMotor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) do not uniformly receive formal and detailedtraining on hazmat transportation security concerns and appropriate interrogatory techniquesregarding this challenge. Nor are all state motor carrier inspectors trained policemen with full lawenforcement responsibilities and arrest powers. FMCSA plans to conduct security awarenesstraining for MCSAP personnel during FY2005.

Federal, state, and local government agencies are evaluating impacts on safety, interstate commerce,transportation logistics, and security that would need to be considered as part of any proposal toreroute certain high hazards shipments permanently away from such locations. At least onejurisdiction, the District of Columbia, has enacted a law that was intended to have the net effect oftemporarily prohibiting the transportation of certain hazmats through a part of its jurisdiction. While not an outright ban, the law requires that, except in cases of emergency, it shall be illegal ina specified zone to transport without a permit specified hazmat. The law authorizes the DCDepartment of Transportation to issue such permits upon a determination that there is no practicalalternative route, which appears to be a stringent standard for review. This law has been challengedin federal court.

They fear that such a change inpolicy would lead to a proliferation of ordinances, higher transportation costs, and disruption ofoperations. There is concern that rerouting of such shipments away from highly populated areascould adversely affect the safety of less populated, remote communities; add trip miles for hazmattransporters; require travel over routes that have lower quality rail transportation infrastructure;encounter areas with less emergency response capability; or present other operational challenges forcarriers.

A catastrophic event caused by a well placed terrorist attack on certain highhazard shipments could kill thousands and endanger hundreds of thousands of people. The argumenthas been made that the number of rail cars to be rerouted is a relatively small number and thatalternative train routes can be used. Some hazmat shipments have been voluntarily rerouted awayfrom populated areas.
