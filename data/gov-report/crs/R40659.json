The health care reform and economic recovery initiatives contained provisions that would affect Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Some budget proposals would require legislative action, while others could be implemented administratively (e.g., via regulatory changes, program guidance, or other methods). President Obama has indicted that health care reform will be a major goal for his Administration's first year. The President's FY2010 budget reflects this emphasis, as the Medicaid and CHIP initiatives for FY2010 were aimed primarily at reducing expenditures to help fund a broader health care reform initiative. Medicaid savings, in particular, would help to fund a proposed $635 billion Health Reform Reserve Fund, which is to be available for the next 10 years. The total Medicaid and CHIP savings from the President's legislative and administrative proposals were estimated to exceed $1.45 billion in FY2010, $8.8 billion over the period FY2010 to FY2014.", "The Senate Budget Committee approved its budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 13) on March 26, 2009.

Prescription drug manufacturers are required to give states rebates on outpatient drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries. Under Medicaid law, manufacturers must enter into agreements with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that guarantee Medicaid their best price. Under these agreements, drug manufacturers must offer for sale to Medicaid programs their entire prescription drug product line. The drug manufacturers also must pay a rebate equal to 15.1% of the purchase price of brand name (single source) products to each state. The purchase price for these brand name products is based on the average manufacturer price (AMP) which excludes certain discounts, free products, and drugs that are delivered through other channels, such as through managed care contracts and other capitation agreements (see the next proposal for a discussion of Medicaid outpatient drugs covered by managed care organizations). Drug manufacturer rebates vary depending on the state and other factors. In 2007, CBO estimated that actual manufacturer rebates were 22.1% of AMP.", "Proposal. This proposal would increase the fixed rebate paid by prescription drug manufacturers from 15.1% to 22.1% of AMP for single source, brand-name drugs. HHS estimated that by increasing the Medicaid rebate on brand-name prescription drugs to 22.1% of AMP federal expenditures would be reduced by $250 million in FY2010 and $2.1 billion over the period FY2010 to FY2014.", "Reports . For more information, see CRS Report RL30726, Prescription Drug Coverage Under Medicaid ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid: Extend Drug Rebates to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Background. Medicaid programs deliver services to beneficiaries through a variety of service delivery options, which range from fee-for-service (FFS) to full risk-bearing managed care/capitation contracts, but also include hybrid approaches that combine elements of both managed care and FFS. Under full risk contracts, managed care organizations (MCOs) accept financial responsibility for Medicaid beneficiaries' medical care needs in exchange for a negotiated, but fixed payment amount. Expenditures for beneficiaries' care that exceeds the agreed to amount are the responsibility of the MCO, but when beneficiaries' care cost less than the contracted amount, the MCO retains the excess as profit. Medicaid programs have increasingly relied on MCO contracts, particularly to cover children and nondisabled adults.", "Prescription drug manufacturers that want to sell drug products to Medicaid programs must agree to pay states discounts on both brand and generic outpatient prescription drug products purchased on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries (see the previous proposal on increasing Medicaid's rebate to 22.1% and the next proposal on applying the Medicaid rebate to new formulations of existing drugs). Under Medicaid law, prescription drug manufacturers are exempted from paying discounts on outpatient prescription drugs that are delivered by MCOs, Part D, and some other distribution channels. With Medicaid's increasing use of managed care to deliver services to beneficiaries, the loss of prescription drug discounts has become substantial. It is estimated that between 35-40% of all Medicaid beneficiaries are covered under full capitation agreements where prescription drugs are included in the contracts. Estimates of the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries covered under some form of managed care, including partial risk contracts and modified FFS delivery approaches, are considerably higher. States often \"carve-out\" prescription drugs from full risk capitation agreements in order to receive the full benefit of Medicaid's rebates. .", "Proposal. This proposal would authorize states to collect rebates from drug manufacturers on outpatient drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries under Medicaid MCO and other health plan contracts. The rebate structure for beneficiaries covered under managed care contracts would be the same as under Medicaid's FFS process and percentage.

Manufacturers must agree to sell their brand name products to state Medicaid programs at the best price offered to all purchasers, with a few exceptions. As part of the agreement with HHS and to help the Secretary monitor Medicaid's and other drug pricing policies, drug manufacturers that participate in Medicaid must report two drug prices to CMS: the average manufacturer price (AMP) and the best price. AMP and best price are used to calculate drug manufacturers' rebates.", "On single source, brand name drugs, drug manufacturers pay two different rebates to states, a basic and an additional rebate. The basic rebate is the greater of either 15.1% of AMP or the difference between AMP and best price. The additional rebate helps to offset rapid price increases that manufacturers might use as a way of reducing the value of the required basic rebate. Manufacturers owe the additional rebates on drugs when the AMP exceeds the original Medicaid base price established for each drug (and each formulation/dosage) when the drug is first brought to market and annually adjusted for inflation. The additional rebate would be equal to the amount each drug increased above the inflation adjusted base price.", "Drug manufacturers sometimes create new products by modifying existing drugs, such as by creating new dosages or formulations, but include minor changes such as extended-release versions, which often are accompanied by substantial price increases. Under current law, even minor changes to existing products can be designated as new products, which result in new base prices. New products have new base prices assigned. With new base prices, manufacturers are able to increase prices and avoid paying the additional Medicaid rebate that they would owe if they raised the price on the original version of the drug.", "Proposal. Under this proposal, extended-release versions of existing products would be classified as the original product for the purpose of calculating the additional Medicaid drug rebate, which would reduce the ability of prescription drug manufacturers to avoid paying additional rebates to state Medicaid programs by introducing new versions of existing drugs and charging higher prices for these reformulated products. In the President's FY2010 budget, it was estimated that this proposal would reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $150 million in FY2010 and $1.3 billion over the period from FY2010 to FY2014.", "Reports.

Unlike Medicaid, where states administer the program, the Medicare program is national and is administered by CMS. Working through contractors, primarily health insurance companies, CMS processes Part B Medicare claims, including payments for physician, laboratory, and radiology services. To help ensure correct payment for claims, CMS implemented a Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) for Medicare in 1996. Under Medicare's CCI, CMS' contractors review claims from Part B health care providers, before payment, using automated edits. These automated edits scan each claim to detect inconsistencies that would make the claims invalid or ineligible for payment. Reimbursement claims submitted by providers follow standard formats and the vast majority are submitted and processed electronically. Reimbursement claims must all contain numeric codes that classify the patient's condition as well as the services performed during a visit (encounter) to a health care provider. The Healthcare Common Procedure Codes (HCPCS) system is a classification system used to describe physician office visits and outpatient claims. CCI edits review the HCPCS codes contained on health care claims to identify coding inconsistencies such as, duplicate services delivered to the same beneficiary on the same date of service; individual services billed erroneously as service bundles (when individual services are grouped together, but cheaper comprehensive codes are available to describe the same services); and also when bundled services are submitted for payment which should have been billed individually, not as bundled services.", "Proposal. This proposal would mandate that Medicaid participate in a national CCI, presumably similar to Medicare's correct coding initiative.

In 2003, Medicaid paid for approximately 40% of all U.S. births. Thus, the federal government and states paid for the prenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care for approximately 1.5 million children and their families. In addition, studies suggest that nearly half of all pregnancies in this country are unplanned and that unplanned pregnancy rates may be as much as four times higher for low-income women. Medicaid coverage of family planning services is a mandatory benefit for women whose income is not more than 133% of poverty. Family planning is covered for these women for 60 days postpartum. Approximately half of the states and the District of Columbia have used waivers to extend family planning coverage for women up to 200% of poverty. In addition to family planning services, many women, up to 200% of poverty, would be eligible for Medicaid if they became pregnant. The federal government's share of most Medicaid service costs is based on the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) . FMAP rates vary among states, but certain Medicaid services are matched for all states at higher rates. States receive a 90% FMAP rate for family planning services.", "Proposal. This proposal would require states to cover family planning services for women between the ages of 15 and 44 who were not pregnant and whose family income was not more than 200% of poverty. A rationale for this proposal is that it would reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies and reduce Medicaid expenditures for the federal government and states. CBO estimated that 2.4 million women would be covered under this proposal in 2014.

Approximately 75% of biologic spending was on brand-name products that will lose patient protection over the next 10 years.", "Generic non-biologic products (made from chemicals or other non-biologic compounds) are covered under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This law authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use an abbreviated regulatory process to approve generic versions of single source, innovator drugs based on FDA's approval for the brand-name versions of these products. FDA's authority to approve generic drug products is possible because the generic products are chemically the same as the approved brand named products. As patents on single source non-biologic drug products approach expiration, generic drug manufacturers compete to offer the first generic version of these branded products, especially for drugs with significant sales potential. For the growing number of biologic products, however, FDA lacks abbreviated regulatory authority to license follow-on or biosimilar versions of biologic products. Thus, even after patents on biologics expire, there is little competitive pressure on brand name biologic drug companies to reduce prices, because there are no alternative products. In most cases it would be illegal and cost prohibitive for generic drugmakers to fully replicate safety and efficacy research and the manufacturing processes used to make biologic products in order to introduce biosimilar products.", "Proposal. This proposal would establish a new abbreviated regulatory pathway for biosimilars analogous to the FDA's existing authority for approving generic chemical drugs under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 P.L. 98-417 .

An abbreviated approval process would encourage other manufacturers to develop similar competitive products as patents on the original biologic products expired.

People who do not fall into these categories\u2014such as childless, single adults and couples\u2014generally do not qualify for Medicaid regardless of their income level. Historically, Medicaid eligibility has been divided into two basic classes, the \"categorically needy\" and the \"medically needy.\" The two terms once distinguished between welfare-related (categorically needy) beneficiaries and those qualifying under special Medicaid rules which allow states to cover people whose incomes are too high to qualify for cash welfare support, but who nevertheless need help with medical bills (medically needy). As non-welfare groups have been added to the \"categorically needy\" list over the years, the terms categorically and medically needy have become less meaningful in describing the various populations for whom mandatory or optional Medicaid coverage is available. Nonetheless, the distinction can be useful when considering Medicaid benefits. Some benefits are considered mandatory for categorically needy individuals; that is, states must cover those benefits for the categorically needy, but they are optional for medically needy individuals. Other benefits are optional for both groups of beneficiaries. Some states provide those optional benefits only to categorically needy individuals, while some states provide optional benefits to both groups, and still other states provide optional benefits to selected subcategories of the medically needy as well as to all categorically needy beneficiaries.", "Although home visitation services are not specifically required benefits under Medicaid law, these services could potentially be covered by states under mandatory and optional benefit categories. Under current Medicaid law, many states may not routinely cover home visitation or would only cover these services in selected situations where beneficiaries or their providers were able to demonstrate a need. Some states may be providing services similar to home visitation under existing Medicaid authorities, but not describing these activities in their state plans as home visitation services. Under Early and Periodic, Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) requirements, Medicaid must cover an array of services for eligible children. Depending on the specific services needed by beneficiaries, home visitation services could be considered EPSDT services and covered by a state Medicaid program. Home visitation might be viewed as services related to home health care. Even though home health is a mandatory Medicaid benefit, these services are mandatory only for individuals entitled to nursing facility levels of care. In other words, states must cover home health services for categorically eligible individuals, whose medical conditions would warrant placement in a nursing facility, but are not required to cover home health for medically needy individuals, or beneficiaries who do not require nursing facility levels of care. Some groups claim that home visitation services could be covered by Medicaid as optional targeted case management and administrative case management.", "Proposal. The President's FY2010 Budget includes a legislative proposal to create a mandatory new program which would provide funds to states to establish and expand evidence-based home visitation programs for low-income families. This program would primarily be intended to provide services to children to improve: child health and development, readiness for school, child maltreatment, and parenting abilities to support children's optimal cognitive, language, social-emotional, and physical development. Although the home visitation initiative would be administered by the Administration for Children and Families, the Obama Administration envisions that the home health visitation program would have substantial interaction with Medicaid and CHIP. Under this proposal, future Medicaid and CHIP expenditures are expected to decrease because low income children would receive preventive and early treatment that would reduce the incidence of more serious health and social problems. The Administration estimated that the interaction of the home visitation initiative with Medicaid and CHIP would reduce federal expenditures by $1 million in FY2010 and $81 million over the period FY2010 to FY2014.
