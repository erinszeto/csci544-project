{"id": "RS22184", "title": "Military Base Closures: Redevelopment\u00a0Assistance Programs", "released_date": "2007-01-24T00:00:00", "summary": ["On September 15, 2005, President Bush approved the list of military facilities that the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission recommended be closed or realigned in the current round of base closures, known generally as \"BRAC.\" (See http://www.brac.gov/finalreport.asp.) The list includes 22 major base closures and 33 major realignments and would result in a net reduction of more than 8,000 military and civilian personnel. (The original BRAC list from DOD indicated a reduction of more than 26,000 personnel, but this included more than 13,000 from overseas deployments that are not included in the BRAC Commission recommendations.) On October 27, the House failed to pass H.J.Res. 65, a motion of disapproval of this list. Thus, barring some future congressional action, the recommendations will take effect over the next six years. (See CRS Report RL32216, Military Base Closures: Implementing the 2005 Round, by [author name scrubbed], for additional information on the BRAC process.) Despite the difficulties inherent in a base closure, communities near facilities on the list must now face a very high probability of life without a local military base. Recognizing that closures and realignments can have a major impact on the economies of the affected regions, Congress has created a variety of different resources available both to communities and individual workers to help mitigate the resulting economic dislocation. This report is intended to summarize these various programs. It will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aid to Communities", "paragraphs": ["Federal aid to communities affected by base closures and realignments covers a wide range of activities and agencies: planning and economic adjustment assistance provided by the Office of Economic Adjustment of Department of Defense (DOD), the Economic Development Administration, and the Rural Development Administration; environmental cleanup at military bases; disposal of surplus federal properties; the Federal Airport Improvement Program; community development block grants; and community service grants."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Economic Adjustment", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA), http://www.oea.gov , is the primary source within DOD for assistance to communities affected by both increases and decreases in military spending.

The OEA has provided a total of $280 million in funding for previous BRAC rounds, primarily with the intent of preparing strategies for local development efforts and other federal funding.", "Over the years, the OEA has provided planning and implementation assistance to communities, regions, and states in an effort to alleviate serious economic impacts that result from defense program changes, such as base closings, expansions, and openings; contract changes affecting firms; and personnel reductions or increases at military facilities. The OEA has also maintained close working relationships with other federal agencies that have programs that can be utilized to assist communities adversely affected by defense cutbacks or realignments. By design, the OEA plays a facilitating role in the economic adjustment process. The affected community, however, must play the principal role in initiating and carrying out the adjustment and conversion plan.", "Currently, the OEA operates with a staff of 45 civilian and 3 military personnel. Funding for the office has been provided in the Defense Appropriations bill under the general operations and maintenance account. In previous budget estimates, the OEA has indicated that most communities affected by a BRAC round receive assistance averaging $400,000 to $500,000 a year for three to five years depending on individual circumstances. In addition, there have been a number of congressional adjustments for specific sites over the years, in amounts as high as $10,000,000 in a single year.

To be eligible to receive training services, such as occupational skills training and on-the-job training, an individual must have received at least one intensive service, and must have been unable to obtain or retain employment. Individuals receive these services through a coordinated service delivery system called the \"one-stop\" system.
