Sanctions have had a substantial effect on Iran's economy but little, if any, observable effect on Iran's conventional defense programs or regional malign activities. During 2012-2015, when the global community was relatively united in pressuring Iran, Iran's economy shrank as its crude oil exports fell by more than 50%, and Iran had limited ability to utilize its $120 billion in assets held abroad.", "The 2015 multilateral nuclear accord (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA) provided Iran broad relief through the waiving of relevant sanctions, revocation of relevant executive orders (E.O.s), and the lifting of U.N. and EU sanctions. Remaining in place were a general ban on U.S. trade with Iran and U.S. sanctions on Iran's support for regional governments and armed factions, its human rights abuses, its efforts to acquire missile and advanced conventional weapons capabilities, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which enshrined the JCPOA, nonbinding U.N. restrictions on Iran's development of nuclear-capable ballistic missiles and a binding ban on its importation or exportation of arms remain in place for several years.", "JCPOA sanctions relief enabled Iran to increase its oil exports to nearly pre-sanctions levels, regain access to foreign exchange reserve funds and reintegrate into the international financial system, achieve about 7% yearly economic growth (2016-17), attract foreign investment, and buy new passenger aircraft. The sanctions relief contributed to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's reelection in the May 19, 2017, vote. However, the economic rebound did not prevent sporadic unrest from erupting in December 2017. And, Iran has provided support for regional armed factions, developed ballistic missiles, and expanded its conventional weapons development programs during periods when international sanctions were in force, when they were suspended, and after U.S. sanctions were reimposed in late 2018.", "The Trump Administration has made sanctions central to efforts to apply \"maximum pressure\" on Iran's regime. On May 8, 2018, President Trump announced that the United States would no longer participate in the JCPOA and that all U.S. secondary sanctions would be reimposed by early November 2018. The reinstatement of U.S. sanctions has driven Iran's economy into mild recession as major companies exit the Iranian economy rather than risk being penalized by the United States. Iran's oil exports have decreased significantly, the value of Iran's currency has declined sharply, and unrest has continued, although not to the point where the regime is threatened. But, the European Union and other countries are trying to keep the economic benefits of the JCPOA flowing to Iran in order to persuade Iran to remain in the accord. To that end, in January 2019 the European countries created a trading mechanism (Special Purpose Vehicle) that presumably can increase trade with Iran by circumventing U.S. secondary sanctions. On November 5, 2018, the Administration granted 180-day \"Significant Reduction Exceptions\" (SREs) to eight countries\u2014enabling them to import Iranian oil without penalty as long as they continue to reduce purchases of Iranian oil. On April 22, 2019, the Administration announced it would not renew any SREs when they expire on May 2, 2019, instead seeking to drive Iran's oil exports as close to zero as possible. On May 3, 2019, the Administration ended some waivers for foreign governments to provide technical assistance to some JCPOA-permitted aspects of Iran's nuclear program. The economic difficulties and other U.S. pressure measures have prompted Iran to cease performing some of the nuclear commitments of the JCPOA.", "See also CRS Report R43333, Iran Nuclear Agreement and U.S. Exit, by Paul K.

After the mid-2000s, U.S. and international sanctions focused largely on ensuring that Iran's nuclear program is for purely civilian uses. During 2010-2015, the international community cooperated closely with a U.S.-led and U.N.-authorized sanctions regime in pursuit of the goal of persuading Iran to agree to limits to its nuclear program.

The ITRs prohibit U.S. transshipment of prohibited goods across Iran, and ban any activities by U.S. persons to broker commercial transactions involving Iran. Iranian Luxury Goods . Pursuant to the JCPOA, Iranian luxury goods, such as carpets and caviar, could be imported into the United States after January 2016. This prohibition went back into effect on August 6, 2018 (90-day wind-down). Shipping Insurance . Obtaining shipping insurance is crucial to Iran's expansion of its oil and other exports. A pool of 13 major insurance organizations, called the International Group of P & I Clubs, dominates the shipping insurance industry and is based in New York. The U.S. presence of this pool renders it subject to the U.S. trade ban, which complicated Iran's ability to obtain reinsurance for Iran's shipping after Implementation Day. On January 16, 2017, the Obama Administration issued waivers of Sections 212 and 213 of the ITRSHRA to allow numerous such insurers to give Iranian ships insurance. However, this waiver ended on August 6, 2018 (90-day wind-down). Civilian Airline Sales . The ITRs have always permitted the licensing of goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft for sale to Iran (\u00a7560.528 of Title 31, C.F.R.), and spare parts sales have been licensed periodically. However, from June 2011 until Implementation Day, Iran's largest state-owned airline, Iran Air, was sanctioned under Executive Order 13382 (see below), rendering licensing of parts or repairs for that airline impermissible. Several other Iranian airlines were sanctioned under that Order and Executive Order 13224. In accordance with the JCPOA, the United States relaxed restrictions on to allow for the sale to Iran of finished commercial aircraft, including to Iran Air, which was \"delisted\" from sanctions. A March 2016 general license allowed for U.S. aircraft and parts suppliers to negotiate sales with Iranian airlines that are not sanctioned, and Boeing and Airbus subsequently concluded major sales to Iran Air. In keeping with the May 8, 2018, U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, preexisting licensing restrictions went back into effect on August 6, 2018, and the Boeing and Airbus licenses to sell aircraft to Iran were revoked. Sales of some aircraft spare parts (\"dual use items\") to Iran also require a waiver of the relevant provision of the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act, discussed below. Personal Communications , Remittances , and Publishing . The ITRs permit personal communications (phone calls, emails) between the United States and Iran, personal remittances to Iran, and Americans to engage in publishing activities with entities in Iran (and Cuba and Sudan). Information Technology Equipment. CISADA exempts from the U.S. ban on exports to Iran information technology to support personal communications among the Iranian people and goods for supporting democracy in Iran. In May 2013, OFAC issued a general license for the exportation to Iran of goods (such as cell phones) and services, on a fee basis, that enhance the ability of the Iranian people to access communication technology. Food and Medical Exports. Since April 1999, sales to Iran by U.S. firms of food and medical products have been permitted, subject to OFAC stipulations. In October 2012, OFAC permitted the sale to Iran of specified medical products, such as scalpels, prosthetics, canes, burn dressings, and other products, that could be sold to Iran under \"general license\" (no specific license application required). This list of general license items list was expanded in 2013 and 2016 to include more sophisticated medical diagnostic machines and other medical equipment. Licenses for exports of medical products not on the general license list are routinely expedited for sale to Iran, according to OFAC. The regulations have a specific definition of \"food\" that can be licensed for sale to Iran, and that definition excludes alcohol, cigarettes, gum, or fertilizer. The definition addresses information in a 2010 article that OFAC had approved exports to Iran of condiments such as food additives and body-building supplements that have uses other than purely nutritive. Humanitarian and Related Services . Donations by U.S. residents directly to Iranians (such as packages of food, toys, clothes, etc.) are not prohibited, but donations through relief organizations broadly require those organizations' obtaining a specific OFAC license. On September 10, 2013, the Department of the Treasury eliminated licensing requirements for relief organizations to (1) provide to Iran services for health projects, disaster relief, wildlife conservation; (2) to conduct human rights projects there; or (3) undertake activities related to sports matches and events. The amendment also allowed importation from Iran of services related to sporting activities, including sponsorship of players, coaching, referees, and training. In some cases, such as the earthquake in Bam in 2003 and the earthquake in northwestern Iran in August 2012, OFAC has issued blanket temporary general licensing for relief organizations to work in Iran. Payment Methods, Trade Financing , and Financing Guarantees . U.S. importers are allowed to pay Iranian exporters, including with U.S. dollars. However, U.S. funds cannot go directly to Iranian banks, but must instead pass through third-country banks. In accordance with the ITRs' provisions that transactions that are incidental to an approved transaction are allowed, financing for approved transactions are normally approved, presumably in the form of a letter of credit from a non-Iranian bank. Title IX of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-387 ) bans the use of official credit guarantees (such as the Ex-Im Bank) for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. The Ex-Im Bank is prohibited from guaranteeing any loans to Iran because of Iran's continued inclusion on the terrorism list, and the JCPOA did not commit the United States to provide credit guarantees for Iran.

Section 105 of CISADA bans travel and freezes the U.S.-based assets of those Iranians determined to be human rights abusers. On September 29, 2010, pursuant to Section 105, President Obama issued Executive Order 13553 providing for CISADA sanctions against Iranians determined to be responsible for or complicit in post-2009 Iran election human rights abuses. Those sanctioned under the provisions are listed in the tables at the end of this report. Section 105 terminates if the President certifies to Congress that Iran has (1) unconditionally released all political prisoners detained in the aftermath of the June 2009 uprising; (2) ceased its practices of violence, unlawful detention, torture, and abuse of citizens who were engaged in peaceful protest; (3) fully investigated abuses of political activists that occurred after the uprising; and (4) committed to and is making progress toward establishing an independent judiciary and respecting human rights.

Section 402 of the ITRSHRA amended Section 105 by adding provisions that sanction (visa ban, U.S. property blocked) any person or company that sells the Iranian government goods or technologies that it can use to commit human rights abuses against its people.

Section 1248 of IFCA (Subtitle D of P.L. 112-239 ) mandates inclusion of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the state broadcasting umbrella group, as a human rights abuser. IRIB was designated as an SDN on February 6, 2013, under E.O. 13628 for limiting free expression in Iran. On February 14, 2014, the State Department waived IFCA sanctions under Sections 1244, 1246, or 1247, on any entity that provides satellite connectivity services to IRIB. The waiver has been renewed each year since. Sanctions a gainst Iranian Profiteers . Section 1249 of IFCA amends Section 105 by imposing sanctions on any person determined to have engaged in corruption or to have diverted or misappropriated humanitarian goods or funds for such goods for the Iranian people. The measure is intended to sanction Iranian profiteers who are, for example, using official connections to corner the market for vital medicines. This provision, which remains in forces, essentially codifies a similar provision of Executive Order 13645. The Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA, P.L. 115-44 ). Section 106 authorizes, but does not require, the imposition of the same sanctions as those prescribed in E.O. 13553 on persons responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, or other gross violations of internationally recognized human rights against Iranians who seek to expose illegal activity by officials or to defend or promote human rights and freedoms in Iran. The persons to be sanctioned are those named in a report provided 90 days after CAATSA enactment (by October 31, 2017) and annually thereafter. The provision is similar to E.O. 13553 but, in contrast, applies broadly to Iranian human rights abuses and is not limited to abuses connected to suppressing the June 2009 uprising in Iran. Additional designations of Iranian human rights abusers under E.O. 13533 were made subsequent to the enactment of CAATSA and the October 31, 2017, CAATSA report deadline. Separate Visa Bans. On July 8, 2011, the State Department imposed visa restrictions on 50 Iranian officials for participating in political repression in Iran, but it did not name those banned on the grounds that visa records are confidential. The action was taken under the authorities of Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which renders inadmissible to the United States a foreign person whose activities could have serious consequences for the United States. On May 30, 2013, the State Department announced it had imposed visa restrictions on an additional 60 Iranian officials on similar grounds. High Level Iranian Visits . There are certain exemptions in the case of high level Iranian visits to attend U.N. meetings in New York. The U.N. Participation Act (P.L. 79-264) provides for U.S. participation in the United Nations and as host nation of U.N. headquarters in New York, and visas are routinely issued to heads of state and their aides attending these meetings. In September 2012, the State Department refused visas for 20 members of Iranian President Ahmadinejad's traveling party on the grounds of past involvement in terrorism or human rights abuses. Still, in line with U.S. obligations under the act, then-President Ahmadinejad was allowed to fly to the United States on Iran Air, even though Iran Air was at the time a U.S.-sanctioned entity, and his plane reportedly was allowed to park at Andrews Air Force base.

", "There is little evidence that even the strict sanctions of 2011-2016 slowed Iran's nuclear program or its missile program. And, even though U.S. and EU sanctions remain on Iran's missile programs, U.S. intelligence officials have testified that Iran continues to expand the scale, reach, and sophistication of its ballistic missile arsenal. Still, some U.S. officials have asserted that Iran's nuclear and missile programs might have advanced faster were sanctions not imposed.", "Sanctions have apparently prevented Iran from buying significant amounts of major combat systems since the early 1990s. Iran's indigenous arms industry has grown over the past two decades. U.S. intelligence directors testified in January 2019 that Iran continues to field increasingly lethal weapons systems, including more advanced naval mines and ballistic missiles, small submarines, armed UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), coastal defense cruise missile batteries, attack craft, and anti-ship ballistic missiles. Iran has been able to acquire some defensive systems that were not specifically banned by Resolution 2231; Russia delivered the S-300 air defense system in April 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects on Iran's Regional Influence", "paragraphs": ["Neither the imposition, lifting, nor reimposition of strict sanctions has appeared to affect Iran's regional behavior. Iran intervened extensively in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen during the 2012-2016 period when sanctions had a significant adverse effect on Iran's economy.

Iran has remained engaged in these regional conflicts since sanctions were eased in early 2016. ", "On the other hand, press reports since March 2019 note that Iran has scaled back payments to Hezbollah and to various pro-Iranian fighters in Syria, perhaps as a reflection of Iranian financial difficulties. An alternate explanation is that Iran is adjusting its expenditures in the Syria conflict to the reduced activity on the battlefield there. The Administration points to reports of the reduced payments as evidence that its \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran is working.", "The Administration has asserted that the easing of sanctions during the period of U.S. implementation of the JCPOA (2016-2018) caused Iran to expand its regional activities. President Trump stated that Iran's defense budget had increased 40% during that time. He stated on August 6, 2018, that \"Since the deal [JCPOA] was reached, Iran's aggression has only increased. The regime has used the windfall of newly accessible funds it received under the JCPOA to build nuclear-capable missiles, fund terrorism, and fuel conflict across the Middle East and beyond.... The reimposition of nuclear-related sanctions through today's actions further intensifies pressure on Tehran to change its conduct.\" However, most outside Iran experts who assess Iran's regional activities asserted that Iran's regional activities were not facilitated by the easing of sanctions during that period, but instead increased because of the opportunities to expand its influence that were provided by Iran by the region's several conflicts. ", "In terms of congressional oversight, a provision of the FY2016 Consolidated Appropriation ( P.L. 114-113 ) required an Administration report to Congress on how Iran has used the financial benefits of sanctions relief. And, a provision of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act ( P.L. 114-17 ) requires that a semiannual report on Iran's compliance with the JCPOA include information on any Iranian use of funds to support acts of terrorism.

Iranians seeking reintegration with the international community and sanctions relief helped propel the relatively moderate Rouhani to election victories in both 2013 and 2017. Many Iranians cheered the finalization of the JCPOA on July 15, 2015, undoubtedly contributing to Supreme Leader Khamene'i's acceptance of the deal. Despite the Trump Administration's withdrawal from the JCPOA and its additional steps to pressure Iran in 2019, there does not appear to be an imminent political threat to Rouhani's grip on his office.", "Still, the IRGC and other hardliners control domestic security and the judiciary, and these factions have criticized Rouhani for remaining in the JCPOA despite the U.S. exit. In July 2018, the IRGC and Iran's parliament ( Majles ) called for cabinet changes to address economic mismanagement and, in September 2018, the Majles compelled Rouhani to be questioned about the economic situation. In July 2018, Rouhani replaced Iran's Central Bank governor as an apparent gesture to indicate responsiveness to economic concerns. In February 2019, apparently under pressure from hardliners, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced his resignation, but Rouhani\u2014apparently as a challenge to the hardliners\u2014did not accept the resignation and reinstated him.

Other protests occurred over flooding in the southwest in March-April 2019, but again not to the level where the regime was threatened. Still, some protesters complain that the country's money is being spent on regional interventions rather than on the domestic economy. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Effects", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. sanctions enacted since 2011, when fully implemented, take a substantial toll on Iran's economy. ", "GDP and Employment Trends . At the height of the sanctions regime in April 2015, then-Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said that Iran's gross domestic product (GDP) was 15%-20% smaller than it would have been had global sanctions not been imposed in 2011. The unemployment rate rose to about 20% by 2014, and many Iranians worked unpaid or partially paid. In 2015, Iran's GDP was about $400 billion at the official exchange rate ($1.4 trillion if assessed on a purchasing power parity [PPP] basis). The 2016 lifting of sanctions enabled Iran to achieve 7% annual growth during 2016-2018. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions in mid-2018 caused Iran's GDP to decline 2% from March 2018 to March 2019, and it is projected to decline by more than 5% during March 2019-March 2020. Oil Exports . Global Iran sanctions (2011-2016) reduced Iran's crude oil sales about 60% from the 2.5 mbd level of 2011, causing Iran to lose over $160 billion in oil revenues during that time. The JCPOA sanctions relief enabled Iran to increase its oil exports to 2011 levels, but the reimposition of U.S. sanctions has driven Iran's oil exports to under 1 mbd as of the end of April 2019. The Trump Administration said in an April 2019 factsheet that the reimposition of sanctions since May 2018 has cost Iran $10 billion in lost oil revenues. The May 2019 end to SREs was an effort to cause Iran's oil exports to fall to zero, although results will depend on whether China, India, and Turkey continue buying Iran oil. Bankin g. Global banks mostly left the Iranian market after 2011 because of the international sanctions in force. Banks were hesitant to reenter the Iran market after the 2016 easing of sanctions because of (1) reported concerns that the United States might still sanction their transactions with Iran; (2) a lack of transparency in Iran's financial sector; (3) lingering concerns over past financial penalties for processing Iran-related transactions in the U.S. financial system; and (4) extra costs and procedures caused by the inability to process Iran-related transactions through the U.S. financial system and/or easily use dollars in Iran-related transactions. Those banks that did reenter the Iran market have, as a consequence of the U.S. exit from the JCPOA, stopped or limited their transactions with Iran. Shipping Insurance . Iran was able after 2016 to obtain shipping insurance as a result of U.S. waivers given to numerous insurers, as discussed above. However, as of August 7, 2018, U.S.-based shipping reinsurers no longer have active U.S. waivers, and Iran has been compelled to self-insure most of its shipments. Hard Currency A ccessib ility . The 2011-2016 sanctions regime prevented Iran from accessing the hard currency it was being paid for its oil. By January 2016, Iran's hard currency reserves held in foreign banks stood at about $115 billion. Iranian officials stated in February 2016 that sanctions relief had allowed them to access the funds, and it could move the funds via renewed access to the SWIFT electronic payments system. Of this amount, about $60 billion was due to creditors such as China ($20 billion) or to repay nonperforming loans extended to Iranian energy companies working in the Caspian and other areas in Iran's immediate neighborhood. After 2016, Iran kept most of its reserves abroad for cash management and to pay for imports, but Iran's foreign reserves are again restricted by reimposed U.S. sanctions. Currency Decline . Sanctions caused the value of the rial on unofficial markets to decline about 60% from January 2012 until the 2013, when the election of Rouhani stabilized the rial at about 35,000 to the dollar. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018 caused the rial 's value to plummet to 150,000 to the dollar by the November 5, 2018. The value later recovered somewhat to about 100,000 to one at the beginning of 2019. The downturn has made it difficult for Iranian merchants to import goods or properly price merchandise, and the government has banned the importation of 1,400 goods to preserve hard currency. Inflation . The drop in value of the currency caused inflation to accelerate during 2011-2013 to a rate of about 60%\u2014a higher figure than that acknowledged by Iran's Central Bank. As sanctions were eased, inflation slowed to the single digits by June 2016, meeting the Central Bank's stated goal. However, in 2017, the inflation rate reportedly increased back to double digits, and turmoil surrounding the possible U.S. exit from the JCPOA caused inflation to increase to about 15% by late June 2018. It increased significantly, to nearly 40%, by the end of 2018. Industrial/Auto Production and Sales . Iran's light-medium manufacturing sector was expanding prior to 2011, but its dependence on imported parts left the sector vulnerable to sanctions that reduced the availability of import financing. Iran's vehicle production fell by about 60% from 2011 to 2013. Press reports say that the auto sector, and manufacturing overall, rebounded since sanctions were lifted, but is declining again in light of the announced divestments by auto makers following the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. Researchers at Iran's parliament estimated in September 2018 that auto production would decline 45% by March 2019, and other industrial production would drop by 5%. U.S.-Iran Trade. U.S.-Iran trade remains negligible. In 2015, the last full year before JCPOA implementation, the United States sold $281 million in goods to Iran and imported $10 million worth of Iranian products. The slight relaxation of the U.S. import ban stemming from the JCPOA likely accounts for the significant increase in imports from Iran in 2016 to $86 million. U.S. imports from Iran were about $63 million in 2017 and about that same amount in 2018. U.S. exports to Iran remained low for all of 2016 and 2017 ($172 million and $137 million, respectively) but spiked to $440 million for 2018. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Iran's Economic Coping Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Iran had some success mitigating the economic effect of sanctions. These strategies will likely be used to try to cope with reimposed U.S. sanctions. ", "Export Diversification . Over the past 10 years, Iran has promoted sales of nonoil products such as minerals, cement, urea fertilizer, and other agricultural and basic industrial goods. Such \"nonoil\" exports now generate much of the revenue that funds Iran's imports. This diversification might have been a factor in the Trump Administration decision in May 2019 to sanction Iran's mineral and metals sector (see above). Even in the energy sector, Iran has promoted the sale of oil products such as petrochemicals and condensates, earning about $4.7 billion in revenue from that source by 2016. ", "Reallocation of Investment Funds and Import Substitution . Sanctions compelled some Iranian manufacturers to increase domestic production of some goods as substitutes for imports. This trend has been hailed by Iranian economists and Supreme Leader Khamene'i, who supports building a \"resistance economy\" that is less dependent on imports and foreign investment. ", "Partial Privatization/IRGC in the Economy . Over the past few years, portions of Iran's state-owned enterprises have been transferred to the control of quasi-governmental or partially private entities. Some of them are incorporated as holding companies, foundations, or investment groups. Based on data from the Iranian Privatization Organization, there are about 120 such entities that account for a significant proportion of Iran's GDP. Rouhani has sought to push the IRGC out of Iran's economy through divestment, to the extent possible. However, a substantial part of the economy remains controlled by government-linked conglomerates, including the IRGC. Although estimates vary widely, the IRGC's corporate affiliates are commonly assessed as controlling at least 20% of Iran's economy, although there is little available information on the degree of IRGC-affiliated ownership stakes.", "Subsidy Reductions . In 2007, the Ahmadinejad government began trying to wean the population off of generous subsidies by compensating families with cash payments of about $40 per month. Gasoline prices were raised to levels similar to those in other regional countries, and far above the subsidized price of 40 cents per gallon. Rouhani has continued to reduce subsidies, including by raising gasoline and staple food prices further and limiting the cash payments to only those families who could claim financial hardship. Rouhani also has improved collections of taxes and of price increases for electricity and natural gas utilities.", "Import Restrictions /Currency Controls . To conserve hard currency, Iran has at times reduced the supply of hard currency to importers of luxury goods, such as cars or cellphones, in order to maintain hard currency supplies to importers of essential goods. These restrictions eased after sanctions were lifted in 2016 but were reimposed in 2018 to deal with economic unrest and the falling value of the rial .

U.S. officials estimated in 2011 that Iran had lost $60 billion in investment in the sector as numerous major firms pulled out of Iran. Iran says it needs $130 billion-$145 billion in new investment by 2020 to keep oil production capacity from falling. Further development of the large South Pars gas field alone requires $100 billion. Table B-1 at the end of this report discusses various Iranian oil and gas fields and the fate of post-1999 investments in them. ", "During 2012-2016, there was little development activity at Iran's various oil and gas development sites, as energy firms sought to avoid sanctions. Some foreign investors resold their equity stakes to Iranian companies. However, the Iranian firms are not as technically capable as the international firms that have withdrawn. The lifting of sanctions in 2016 lured at least some foreign investors back into the sector, encouraged by Iran's more generous investment terms under a concept called the \"Iran Petroleum Contract.\" That contract gives investing companies the rights to a set percentage of Iran's oil reserves for 20-25 years. Iran signed a number of new agreements with international energy firms since mid-2016 but, as noted in the tables and other information above, major energy firms have begun to divest in response to the U.S. exit from the JCPOA. ", "Sanctions relief also opened opportunities for Iran to resume developing its gas sector. Iran has used its gas development primarily to reinject into its oil fields rather than to export. Iran exports about 3.6 trillion cubic feet of gas, primarily to Turkey and Armenia. Sanctions have rendered Iran unable to develop a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export business. However, it was reported in March 2017 that the Philippine National Oil Company is seeking to build a 2-million-ton LNG plant in Iran, suggesting that patent issues do not necessarily preclude Iran from pursuing LNG. ", "With respect to gasoline, the enactment of the CISADA law targeting sales of gasoline to Iran had a measurable effect. Several suppliers stopped selling gasoline to Iran once enactment appeared likely, and others ceased supplying Iran after enactment. Gasoline deliveries to Iran fell from about 120,000 barrels per day before CISADA to about 30,000 barrels per day immediately thereafter, although importation later increased to about 50,000 barrels per day. As a result, Iran expanded several of its refineries and, in 2017, Iranian officials said Iran had become largely self-sufficient in gasoline production.

Some observers say the Iranian government exaggerated reports of medicine shortages to generate opposition to the sanctions. Other accounts say that Iranians, particularly those with connections to the government, took advantage of medicine shortages by cornering the import market for key medicines. These shortages resurfaced in 2018 following the reimposition of sanctions by the Trump Administration. For example, reports indicate that the reimposition of U.S. sanctions may be inhibiting the flow of humanitarian goods to the Iranian people and reportedly contributing to shortages in medicine to treat ailments such as multiple sclerosis and cancer. Other reports indicate that Cargill, Bunge, and other global food traders have halted supplying Iran because of the absence of trade financing.

Following a reported agreement among House and Senate leaders, H.R. 3364 , with additional sanctions provisions related to North Korea (and provisions on Iran remaining virtually unchanged from those of the engrossed S. 722 ), was introduced and passed both chambers by overwhelming margins.

Overall, CAATSA does not appear to conflict with the JCPOA insofar as it does not reimpose U.S. secondary sanctions on Iran's civilian economic sectors. The JCPOA did not require the United States to refrain from imposing additional sanctions\u2014as CAATSA does\u2014on Iranian proliferation, human rights abuses, terrorism, or the IRGC. Section 108 of CAATSA requires an Administration review of all designated entities to assess whether such entities are contributing to Iran's ballistic missile program or contributing to Iranian support for international terrorism.

The Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, passed the House on October 26, 2017, by a vote of 423-2. It would have amended the remaining active (not waived) section of ISA (Section 5b) to clarify that assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program is included as subject to sanctions. The provision would have applied the sanctions to foreign governments determined to be assisting Iran's missile programs, and would have applied several ISA sanctions to foreign entities, including foreign governments, that sell to or import from Iran the major combat systems banned for sale to Iran in Security Council Resolution 2231. This represents a more specific list of banned items than the \"destabilizing numbers and types\" of weaponry the sale to Iran of which can be sanctioned under ISA and several other U.S. laws discussed above. H.R. 1638 . On November 14, 2017, the House Financial Services Committee ordered reported H.R. 1638 , the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, which would have required the Treasury Secretary to report to Congress on the assets and equity interests held by named Iranian persons, including the Supreme Leader, the President, various IRGC and other security commanders, and members of various leadership bodies. H.R. 4324 . The House Financial Services Committee also ordered reported on November 14, 2017, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act. The bill would have required Administration reports on whether financing of Iranian commercial passenger aircraft purchases posed money-laundering or terrorism risks or benefited Iranian persons involved in Iranian proliferation or terrorism. Some argued that the bill might affect the willingness of the Treasury Department to license aircraft sales to Iran, and in so doing potentially breach the U.S. JCPOA commitment to sell such aircraft to Iran. Following President Trump's October 13, 2017, statement on Iran, then-Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker and Senator Tom Cotton released an outline of legislation that would reimpose waived U.S. sanctions if, at any time\u2014including after JCPOA restrictions expire\u2014Iran breaches JCPOA-stipulated restrictions. The bill draft, which was not introduced, included sanctions triggers based on Iranian missile developments. H.R. 5132 . The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Economic Exclusion Act. This bill mandated Administration reports on whether specified categories of entities are owned or controlled by the IRGC, or conduct significant transactions with the IRGC. The bill defined an entity as owned or controlled by the IRGC even if the IRGC's ownership interest is less than 50%\u2014a lower standard than the usual practice in which ownership is defined as at least 50%. The bill would have required Administration investigation of several specified entities as potentially owned or controlled by the IRGC, including several telecommunications, mining, and machinery companies, and required a report on whether the Iran Airports Company violates E.O. 13224 by facilitating flight operations by Mahan Air, which is a designated SDN under E.O. 13224. Whereas the bill's provisions did not mandate any sanctions on entities characterized within, the bill appeared to establish a process under which the Administration could name as SDNs entities in Iran's civilian economic sectors, including civil aviation. H.R. 6751 . The Banking Transparency for Sanctioned Persons Act of 2018, would have required reporting to Congress on any license given to a bank to provide financial services to a state sponsor of terrorism. H.R. 4591 , S. 3431 , and H.R. 4238 . Several bills would have essentially codified Executive Order 13438 by requiring the blocking of U.S.-based property and preventing U.S. visas for persons determined to be threatening the stability of Iraq\u2014legislation apparently directed at Iran's Shiite militia allies in Iraq. The latter two bills specifically mentioned the Iraqi groups As'aib Ahl Al Haq and Harakat Hizballah Al Nujabi as entities that the Administration should so sanction.

As the 116 th Congress began work in 2019, press reports indicated that several Senators and at least one House Member planned to introduce legislation to greatly expand U.S. secondary sanctions on Iran's financial sector. Among the reported provisions were (1) mandatory imposition of sanctions on the SWIFT electronic payments system if it does not expel sanctioned Iranian banks from its network; (2) amending IFCA to sanction any significant transactions with Iran's financial sector (in addition to energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors in the current law); (3) requiring the Treasury Department to issue a final rule that would sanction any international transaction with Iran's Central Bank; and (4) sanctioning foreign persons that supply or provide other help to Iran's efforts to establish a digital currency.
