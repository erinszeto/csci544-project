It survives by killing infested trees, usually individually, but occasionally in epidemics. Mountain pine beetle epidemics are particularly associated with lodgepole pine, a common western tree that typically grows in dense, even-aged stands. The beetle is a seasonally adapted species that thrives in areas where it can complete its life cycle in one year. The beetle has evolved a mass-attack approach to overwhelm tree defenses through large numbers, and adults congregate on large trees under stress. Widespread stress (e.g., a regional drought) sets the stage for an epidemic.", "Mountain pine beetle epidemics are recurrent events in western forests. The current epidemic can be separated into three distinct events: the central U.S. Rocky Mountains, interior British Columbia (Canada), and high-elevation pines. Two aspects of the current epidemic are widely believed to have been exacerbated by climate change: (1) increased temperatures farther north and at higher elevations (allowing complete life cycles in areas previously not susceptible to the beetle) and (2) possibly regional drought (making trees more susceptible to beetle attacks).", "Controlling a mountain pine beetle epidemic can be problematic. Individual trees can be protected by insecticide sprays, but the cost of preventive spraying at a landscape scale is prohibitive. Once a tree is infested, nothing can be done to save the tree. In the long run, silvicultural treatments to provide less dense, more diverse forests may reduce the extent of future epidemics, but epidemics cannot be prevented.", "One concern about the consequences of the current epidemic is the possible increase in wildfire threats. Little research has been done to assess the change in threats and impacts of wildfires. The limited existing information suggests that tree mortality due to mountain pine beetles may have little effect on the threat or impacts of wildfire in the affected areas, because lodgepole pines (live or dead) naturally burn in extensive crown fires that typically kill most of the large trees. Furthermore, because of the natural regeneration cycle of lodgepole pine and because the beetles do not kill small trees, natural regeneration of the pine forests is likely.", "However, warming as a result of climate change could have two consequential ecological outcomes. First, the beetle outbreak in the high-elevation pine ecosystems could significantly alter these ecosystems, because these pines are much slower to regenerate and small high-elevation pines are highly susceptible to the white pine blister rust (an introduced fungus). The second concern is the potential for the mountain pine beetle to spread across northern Canada through the boreal jack pine forest, and become an invasive pest of eastern pine forests.", "There are economic consequences of the mountain pine beetle epidemic. The aesthetic values of the area\u2014such as property values and tourism\u2014will likely be harmed by the extensive tree mortality. Much of the beetle-killed timber could be used, for lumber or for biomass energy, but the substantial volume of timber available far exceeds existing capacity to use the wood, and expanding capacity could be unsustainable\u2014a short-run surplus and long-run shortage. Also, Canadian lumber faces restrictions on shipments to U.S. markets."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Numerous insect epidemics appear to be damaging North American forests at unprecedented levels.

The continuing concern over wildfires and forest health may lead to congressional efforts to combat the epidemics. Some also assert that insect epidemics are exacerbated by global climate change, and that they may even contribute to that change.

The majority of its life is spent as larva in the phloem (innermost bark layer) of pine trees. The eggs hatch 10-14 days after being laid, and the larvae feed on the phloem. In the fall, the larvae produce glycerol , a natural antifreeze that allows them to survive winter temperatures. Larvae are vulnerable to frosts in the fall, before producing glycerol, and when they pupate. During winter, temperatures below -30\u00b0F for at least five days can kill most larvae. Larvae pupate in very late spring or early summer (usually June).", "Adult mountain pine beetles usually emerge in midsummer, late enough to avoid harm from late spring frosts but early enough to allow eggs to hatch into larvae; ambient air temperatures determine the timing of emergence. The adults disperse, with preference for trees of larger diameter (thicker trees have thicker phloem, and thus more food) and trees under stress (e.g., injured, diseased, or suffering from drought, and thus offering less resistance to attack). Trees less than five inches in diameter are rarely attacked, even in an epidemic. Females first attacking a tree release chemicals called aggregating pheromones , which attract males and other females in a mass attack on the tree. ", "The beetles cannot readily attack and kill any tree. Native predators, notably woodpeckers and clerid beetles, help to control populations. In addition, the trees \"have evolved significant defensive chemistry that serves to protect them from beetle attack. The mountain pine beetle, in turn, has evolved a mass-attack strategy that overwhelms tree defenses through sheer numbers of attacking beetles.\" Also, the beetles introduce a blue-stain fungus into the trees they attack, which clogs water transport systems and contributes to killing the trees. Thus, trees under stress\u2014from drought, disease, injury, or other cause\u2014are more susceptible to attack by the mountain pine beetle and blue-stain fungus.

There is wide variability in the mortality of pure lodgepole pine forests, and even forests that appear to be completely killed will have lodgepole pine seedlings and saplings released from the competition in dense stands. ", "There is no single, simple cause for a population to reach epidemic levels. Research has provided information about the population ecology of the mountain pine beetle in lodgepole pine, but not about the transition to epidemic populations. Widespread stress in a mature forest clearly provides a setting for an outbreak, but no specific trigger has been identified. One source suggests that prolonged warm periods, especially with warm winters, may trigger epidemics, but the evidence is not conclusive.

The dead trees are still standing, a stark reminder that not all forests are adapted to recover from devastating natural events.

Forest practices can provide diverse forest landscapes, with patches varying in tree age and size, and with more species diversity where feasible.

However, these activities can be expensive, even in places where a commercial timber industry exists to harvest and utilize the wood. Others caution that some activities, such as conventional timber harvests and salvage harvests, may have little effect on the future stand conditions. This type of harvesting might not reduce the potential for catastrophic wildfires or insect epidemics. A group of authors noted:", "Creating diverse patch ages and sizes (including young patches) and perhaps more mixed-species forests across the landscape may or may not reduce the spread of future mountain pine beetle outbreaks, but it likely would reduce the amount of forest susceptible through time to a monolithic [uniform, widespread] disturbance, including mountain pine beetle attack or fire. Thus while unproven, the increased landscape heterogeneity may be effective for limiting the scale and severity of future mountain pine beetle impacts. The effectiveness of such measures cannot be assured, nor are all the ecological consequences known, though even in the current epidemic, stands and patches of younger lodgepole pine trees appear to have survived the epidemic with no or only limited mortality.

In addition to these two primary concerns, trees killed by the mountain pine beetle will eventually release their carbon to the forest soils or to the atmosphere, either quickly through wildfires or more slowly through decay. Other than new forest stands to sequester carbon and long-term wood products to store some of the carbon from beetle-killed trees, little can be done to ameliorate the carbon release.

Two groups of researchers have examined this concern and found little evidence to support or refute the belief that extensive mountain pine beetle epidemics increase the threat of conflagrations. Thus, both groups chose to examine the impacts by assessing likely changes in wildfire behavior over time in lodgepole pine stands killed by mountain pine beetles.", "Both groups of researchers noted that wildfire is a complex phenomenon, with fire intensity depending on variations in weather (wind and fuel moisture content) as well as the level and the arrangement of fuels. Lodgepole pine forests historically burned occasionally, typically in crown fires (conflagrations that kill most of the trees in the stand) under extreme weather conditions. Both research groups concluded that the threat of a conflagration remains high while the dead needles remain on the trees\u2014up to two years following the infestation. After the needles fall, the threat of a conflagration declines, because the forests lack the small-diameter fuels needed to start and spread the fire. After the dead trees fall\u2014one to several decades after the outbreak\u2014the risk increases for intense surface fires. However, both research groups also noted that even intense surface fires would be within the historic range of natural variability of lodgepole pine ecosystems, and not something unusual or catastrophic for lodgepole pine ecosystems. One of the groups did caution, however, that the magnitude and extent of the current mountain pine beetle outbreak has not been experienced since white settlers reached the Rocky Mountains, and thus:", "we are uncertain about fire behavior at landscape or regional scales because we have not seen systems with such heavy fuel loads over such extensive areas; and we know little about the ecological consequences of such fires at these scales.

Areas dominated by relatively small trees (less than 5 inches in diameter) are likely to remain green lodgepole pine forests, since trees of this size are rarely attacked. Areas with extensive beetle-killed trees will likely regenerate to lodgepole pine forests, but it may take time, since wildfire is needed to open the serotinous cones of the remaining live lodgepole pine trees. However, once such a fire occurs, vast areas can be reforested, since lodgepole pine is a prolific seed producer.

The interspersed pattern of openings created by crown fires, together with the destruction of spruce and fir by wildfire, creates opportunities for whitebark pine and other high-elevation pines (such as bristlecone and foxtail pines) to regenerate. However, mountain pine beetles typically kill the largest-diameter trees\u2014those that produce most of the seeds needed for regeneration. In addition, the high-elevation pines are susceptible to destruction by white pine blister rust.

It is unclear whether lumber production capacity is a constraint on using beetle-killed trees in Canada. However, lumber markets could be a problem. The largest market for Canadian lumber is the U.S. housing market. Even presuming that the current economic difficulties will be resolved quickly, and the U.S. housing market recovers from the doldrums, Canadian shipments to the U.S. market could continue to be constrained. In October 2006, the United States and Canada signed a Softwood Lumber Agreement to settle pending litigation over U.S. efforts to restrain allegedly subsidized Canadian lumber.
