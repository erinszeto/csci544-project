A combination of factors have combined to present policymakers with difficult decisions on how best to stimulate the economy. Troubling instability in the housing and financial services sectors have combined with weak auto manufacturing demand, and high energy costs earlier in the year to slow growth dramatically and force millions into unemployment. With declining tax revenue and increasing costs to provide unemployment and other benefits to unemployed workers, states are considering measures to rein in spending, including restricting Medicaid eligibility and services.", "Congress is considering legislation aimed at stimulating economic activity in selected industrial sectors to save existing and create new jobs, reduce taxes, invest in future technologies, and fund infrastructure improvements. The House-approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, H.R. 1) on January 22. ARRA provisions would provide temporary support to families and individuals by providing additional unemployment compensation benefits, short-term access to Medicaid, financial assistance for individuals to maintain their health coverage under provisions in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), and temporary increases in Medicaid matching rates and disproportionate share hospital allotments.

However, some economists and forecasters have been concerned that a combination of factors might make this economic contraction much worse than other post-war slowdowns. At first, economic instability seemed limited to the housing sector as housing values decreased in many markets, forcing some subprime and highly leveraged home owners into foreclosure. The problems that began in housing, quickly spread to banking and financial services and were compounded earlier in 2008 by spikes in energy prices. The solvency of automobile manufacturers rapidly deteriorated, possibly due in part to tight credit policies, rising unemployment, and high fuel costs. National unemployment rose steadily throughout 2008 reaching 7.2% in December. Many states also face large tax revenue decreases, forcing them to consider reducing Medicaid eligibility and spending, just when the demand for additional public sector health care is expanding to fill the gap left when unemployed individuals no longer can afford employer-based health insurance for their families. Although by themselves the problems in housing, financial services, manufacturing, and energy sectors might not force the economy into recession, taken together these problems have contributed to the emergence of a recession and, if the underlying fundamentals have changed as some forecasters suspect, perhaps a prolonged, global economic slow down that could have widespread impact on living standards here and abroad.", "Policymakers quickly moved to prevent the instability in housing and financial services from spilling over into the broader economy. Looking to the future, members of Congress and the Obama Administration have sought additional mechanisms to stimulate economic activity. Various approaches have been considered to ensure that a stimulus package could reach many different segments of the economy, provide a sustained economic boost, and wide spread job growth. Some stimulus proposals have included infrastructure spending, revenue sharing with states, middle class tax cuts, business tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and food stamps. On January 22, 2009 the House Committee on Energy and Commerce marked-up and approved selected health components of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, H.R. 1 ). The full House amended and approved H.R. 1 on January 28, 2009. ARRA included approval of an amendment to Division B, Title V, Medicaid Provisions, that removed a provision that would have given states the option to cover family planning services under Medicaid.

Although the House-passed and Senate Finance versions of a temporary increase in the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) are broadly similar, they differ on the degree to which funds are targeted at states experiencing unemployment rate increases and whether the temporary FMAP increase applies to expenditures for individuals who are eligible for Medicaid because of an increase in a state's income eligibility standards. Unemployed Covered Under Medicaid . Under H.R. 1 , but not S.Amdt. 570 , states would have a temporary option to cover unemployed workers under Medicaid. States would receive 100% FMAP for this temporary Medicaid expansion for both medical services and related administrative expenditures. Medicaid Regulations Moratoria. H.R. 1 includes a 60-day extension until July 1, 2009, of moratoria on six controversial Medicaid regulations, and a new moratorium on a seventh regulation. S.Amdt. 570 does not have a provision to extend the Medicaid moratoria. DSH Allotment Increases . H.R. 1 would temporarily, but uniformly, increase states' DSH allotments by 2.5% for FY2009 and FY2010. S.Amdt. 570 also would increase temporarily states' DSH allotments, but the enhanced allotments would be provided only to low-DSH states (states with DSH spending below 3% of their total Medicaid expenditures in FY2006). States with higher DSH spending would not receive enhanced allotments under S.Amdt. 570 . Medicare Special Workload Agreements . S.Amdt. 570 includes a provision that would require the HHS Secretary, in consultation with the SSA Commissioner, to negotiate agreements with states on the Medicare Special Disability Workload program. H.R. 1 does not have a similar provision. Medicaid Indian Protections . H.R. 1 and S.Amdt. 570 both include provisions that would exempt Indians from Medicaid and SCHIP cost sharing and premiums as well as provide for the creation of a Tribal Technical Advisory Panel within CMS. Under S.Amdt. 570 , in order to receive Medicaid payment, managed care entities would need to fulfill certain conditions. The Senate amendment would also apply specific provisions affecting Medicaid managed care to SCHIP. TMA and QI Extensions . H.R. 1 would extend the work-related Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) program through December 2010. Similar to H.R. 1 , S.Amdt. 570 would extend the work-related TMA program through December 2010, as well as the Qualified Individual (QI) program through the end of 2010. OIG and GAO . Under S.Amdt. 570 , but not H.R. 1 , funds would be appropriated to OIG for Medicaid integrity activities related to increased recession spending. Also under S.Amdt. 570 and not H.R. 1 , GAO would be tasked with preparing a report on the effect of recessions since 1974 on Medicaid. NH Prompt Pay . Under S.Amdt. 570 , states would need to comply with Medicaid's prompt payment rules to receive recessionary FMAP increases. Sunset. Under S.Amdt. 570 , all of the provisions in Title III, Subtitle D, Other Provisions, would sunset at the end of the recession period, December 31, 2010, including Indian protections (Sec. 3301, 3302, 3303) and nursing home prompt pay requirements (Sec. 3304).", "For a discussion of the Medicaid provisions approved in the Joint House and Senate Conference Agreement, see CRS Report R40223, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA): Title V, Medicaid Provisions , coordinated by [author name scrubbed].

Intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) are used by some states to finance the non-federal share of Medicaid costs. Certain IGTs are specifically allowed for funding the state share of program costs. Some states have instituted programs where the state share of Medicaid spending is paid by hospitals or nursing homes that are public providers, but not units of government, or are units of government, but the state share is returned to the provider sometimes through Medicaid payments.

Medicaid rehabilitation services include a full range of treatments designed to reduce physical or mental disability or restore eligible beneficiaries to their best possible functional levels. There has been enough misunderstanding about what Medicaid pays for and what constitutes rehabilitation services that both the executive and legislative branches have addressed this benefit repeatedly.

Case management services assist Medicaid beneficiaries in obtaining needed medical and related services. Targeted case management (TCM) refers to case management for specific beneficiary groups or for individuals who reside in state-designated geographic areas. Similar to rehabilitative services, there has been considerable ambiguity about what services are covered and what is legitimately considered TCM. The case management regulation addressed a provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA; P.L. 109-171 ), where Congress added new language to clarify and narrow the case management definition and directed the Secretary of HHS to issue regulations to guide states' claims for matching federal reimbursement for case management.

As a condition of accepting funds under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( P.L. 108-446 , IDEA), public schools must provide special education and related services necessary for children with disabilities to benefit from public education. States can finance only a portion of these costs with federal IDEA funds. Medicaid may cover IDEA required health-related services for enrolled children as well as related administrative activities. According to federal investigations and congressional hearings, Medicaid payments to schools have sometimes been improper. To address these problems, CMS issued this regulation that was intended to restrict federal Medicaid payments for school-based administrative activities (e.g., outreach, service coordination, referrals performed by school employees or contractors), and for certain transportation services (e.g., from home to school and back for certain school-age children).

States use provider-specific taxes to help finance their share of the Medicaid program. Under these funding methods, states collect funds (through taxes or other means) from providers and pay the money back to those providers as Medicaid payments, and claim the federal matching share of those payments. Once the state share has been subtracted, the federal matching funds may be used to raise provider payment rates, to fund other portions of the Medicaid program, or for other non-Medicaid purposes. Provider taxes must be consistent with federal laws and regulations, which may have been ambiguous or changing. CMS issued a provider tax regulation to address issues related to provider taxes.

OPH services include preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, or palliative services provided under the direction of a physician or a dentist in the hospital. These outpatient facilities may be located on or off the hospital campus or in satellite facilities. States use a number of different reimbursement methods for different types of services provided in OPH departments and clinics. CMS issued a regulation intended to limit the definition and scope of Medicaid-covered OPH. Given the moratorium on a related regulation covering cost limits for government providers, CMS excluded from the regulatory language methods for demonstrating compliance with the upper payment limit for Medicaid OPH and clinic services provided in privately operated facilities.
