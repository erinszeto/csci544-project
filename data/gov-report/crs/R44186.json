With over 70 different appropriations and over 100 PPAs, DHS has functioned for over a decade with significant budget disparities and inconsistencies in component's [sic] appropriations accounts and PPAs. Without question, the current budget structure is a contributing factor to the failure to recognize how poorly components have been underexecuting personnel costs.
