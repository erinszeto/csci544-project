One aspect of this congressional concern is what happens when bankrupt employers are unable to provide promised pension and health benefits to their retired employees.", "In chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, the employer receives protections against its financial commitments in the hope that it may once again become profitable. This protection could include not having to honor obligations concerning pensions and retiree health insurance. Its employees may therefore be at risk of not receiving some of their promised benefits. Unionized and nonunionized employees may be treated differently under the law because unionized workers have a legal contract governing their terms and conditions of employment.", "The costs to employers for the pension, health insurance, and other benefits promised to retired employees are known as legacy costs, and different costs are subject to different federal laws. Although employers are required to prefund their defined benefit pension trusts, the level of required funding may not be present as the employer enters bankruptcy. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), a quasi-public agency, monitors the finances of pension plans. The PBGC becomes the trustee of and pays benefits to participants in terminated, underfunded single-employer pension plans. PBGC benefits are subject to a statutory maximum that may be less than the retiree was promised by his or her employer. The PBGC has been running deficits for several years, and the deficit for one of its two programs is at an all-time record high. PBGC funding comes from employer premiums set by Congress, the assets of the plans it takes over, and investment returns. There is no taxpayer funding.", "Some retirees receive health benefits from their former employer. Retiree health benefits, however, are not insured by any public agency, and employers are not required to prefund health benefits. However, health benefits (for active and retired employees) can be funded through a tax-preferred trust fund known as a Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA). When an employer and union agree to form a VEBA, and it is approved by a bankruptcy court, the employer generally contributes a collectively bargained level of funding to the VEBA. Providing this contribution usually fulfills the employer's total responsibility for retiree health care. All subsequent retiree health benefit decisions are transferred to the trustees of the VEBA. (VEBAs often are created outside of bankruptcy and are not restricted to unionized work places. In addition, VEBAs may be funded by employers only, by employees only, or jointly by both employers and employees.)", "After a discussion of these issues, this report provides three examples of bankruptcy proceedings in which the retirees' pensions and health insurance benefits received substantial federal attention: the General Motors Corporation, the Delphi Corporation, and the Patriot Coal Corporation.", "During bankruptcy proceedings for the General Motors Corporation (commonly known as Old GM or pre-bankruptcy GM), retiree health benefits were central and pensions, although underfunded, were not a major issue. Old GM's main union, the United Auto Workers (UAW), accepted stock in the General Motors Company (commonly known as New GM or post-bankruptcy GM) as a partial funding source for its retiree health care VEBA, which has covered retiree health benefits since 2010. The VEBA was intended to cover retiree health benefits for 80 years, but it is unclear how long its funding will last.", "Pensions were a central source of controversy during the Delphi Corporation's bankruptcy. Some (union and nonunion) employees had been promised a pension greater than the PBGC maximum. When the various Delphi pension plans were terminated by the PBGC, most unionized employees did not see their pensions fall because of supplemental pension coverage originally negotiated by Old GM and the UAW. The salaried Delphi workers, however, had no union, and some found themselves receiving lower pension benefits than had been promised by Delphi. Salaried workers formed a labor association, the Delphi Salaried Retirees Association (DSRA), with hopes of strengthening their position. The DSRA has been unsuccessful in its efforts to have its members' pensions increased, and a subsequent court case has not yet been settled.", "Both pension and retiree health benefits were central to the complicated and contentious negotiations during the bankruptcy of the Patriot Coal Corporation. The relevant union, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), is a multiemployer union in which the collectively bargained contracts cover the employees of many employers. The UMWA Pension Trust was underfunded before the Patriot bankruptcy, and it remains underfunded today. In fact, some consider the potential insolvency of the coal employers' pension plan a threat to the overall solvency of PBGC's program on multiemployer pension plans. Because many Patriot retirees were employees of another employer, Peabody Energy, when they were actively working, the bankruptcy court ruled that Peabody, and not Patriot, was responsible for funding the VEBA created to cover health benefits."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Benefits for retired employees are of particular interest to policymakers, who often are concerned with the income security of retirees, a large and fast-growing population.

The bankruptcy of the General Motors Corporation (Old GM) in 2009 was the fourth-largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, and it was accompanied by a period of federal aid to the automotive industry. Two distinctive features of the Old GM bankruptcy were that federal financing was important to the ultimate outcome (and subsequent retiree benefits) and that the outcome was associated with a particularly strong labor union\u2014the United Auto Workers (UAW).", "The report also focuses on the Delphi Corporation, an automobile parts supplier whose salaried retirees attempted to receive the benefits that hourly UAW retirees received. Hourly UAW hourly employees at Delphi had received contractual promises regarding their benefits from Old GM in the pre-bankruptcy period. Salaried workers at Delphi had received no such contractual promises. To facilitate increasing their benefits, salaried retirees formed their own labor association, the Delphi Salaried Workers Association (DSRA). ", "Coal Industry . The United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) represents more than 73,000 coal miners. Congress has periodically passed legislation covering retiree benefits for coal miners since at least the 1940s. In October 1992, passage of the Coal Act protected health benefits for some retired coal miners. In 2006, trust funds covering health insurance for retired miners received federal assistance. Various proposals dealing with pensions and health benefits provided by bankrupt coal employers have been advanced over the last several years. These proposals were influenced by the July 2012 bankruptcy of the Patriot Coal Corporation, an employer with coal mines in West Virginia.", "These three case studies are not necessarily representative of all chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of large, unionized firms. Indeed, as case studies, they are not necessarily representative of all bankruptcy proceedings of large, unionized firms in industries in which Congress has become involved.

When a multiemployer plan becomes insolvent, the PBGC provides a loan to the trustees of the pension plan and the pension plan uses the loan to pay benefits.

Therefore, retirees have no guarantee that they actually will receive any of the benefits they were promised in a CBA.

Employers are required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which establishes financial and reporting standards for private-sector U.S. firms, to use accrual-basis accounting when calculating liabilities for retiree health benefits. In other words, the employer's liability increases as the number of employees eligible for benefits, along with the expected amount of these benefits, increases. This liability must be reported on the firm's balance sheet, where a particularly large liability value can depress the firm's market value.

The calculation of the level of funding needed to meet such a guarantee typically involves forecasting the following variables:", "the expected date of retirement for each employee working on December 31, 2014; each employee's (and his or her covered family's) life expectancy; each employee's (and his or her covered family's) health care utilization over time; the rate of medical inflation over time; the return on the VEBA trust's assets over time; and changes in the tax code affecting the value of the VEBA.", "If any of these forecasts prove to be incorrect, then the amount of money needed to fully fund the VEBA over the course of its lifetime would be calculated incorrectly.", "The calculation becomes more complicated if future employees (i.e., those who are not yet hired) are eligible for retiree health benefits funded from the VEBA. The number of such employees, together with the years in which they will start work and ultimately retire, must also be estimated. Calculating the fully funded level for an employer that has terminated the availability of benefits for new hires is therefore easier than calculating the fully funded level for a financially healthy employer that intends to continue offering retiree health benefits to new hires. ", "Some VEBAs are created as part of the course of doing business, and others are created during chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. A VEBA also may be negotiated as part of a standard CBA and then modified during bankruptcy proceedings. Financial negotiations can be contentious.

For example, it was reported that health care costs were the single largest component of the growing disparity in labor costs between the domestic and foreign automakers.

The 2007 contract stipulated that GM was responsible for funding retiree health until January 1, 2010.

According to PBGC estimates, at the time of termination the plans for the Delphi salaried employees had $2.4 billion in assets and $5.0 billion in liabilities; the plan was therefore only 48% funded.
