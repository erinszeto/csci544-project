As a result, the scope of patentable subject matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the types of inventions that may be patented\u00e2\u0080\u0094has largely been left to the federal courts to develop through \"common law\"-like adjudication. In the 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court established that three main types of discoveries are categorically patent-ineligible: laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.", "Recent Supreme Court decisions have broadened the scope of these three judicial exceptions to patent-eligible subject matter. Over a five-year period, the Supreme Court rejected, as ineligible, patents on a business method for hedging price-fluctuation risk; a method for calibrating the dosage of a particular drug; isolated human DNA segments; and a method of mitigating settlement risk in financial transactions using a computer. These cases established a new two-step test, known as the Alice / Mayo framework, for determining whether a patent claims ineligible subject matter.", "The first step of the Alice / Mayo test addresses whether the patent claims are \"directed to\" a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea. If not, the invention is patentable. If the claims are directed to one of the ineligible categories, then the second step of the analysis asks whether the patent claims have an \"inventive concept.\" To have an inventive concept, the patent claim must contain elements that transform the nature of the claim into a patent-eligible application of the ineligible concept, so that the claim amounts, in practice, to something \"significantly more\" than a patent on the ineligible concept itself. If the invention fails the second step of Alice / Mayo , then it is patent-ineligible.", "The Supreme Court's decisions have been widely recognized to effect a significant change in the scope of patentable subject matter, restricting the sorts of inventions that are patentable in the United States. The Alice / Mayo test has been the subject of criticism, with some stakeholders arguing that the Alice / Mayo framework is vague and unpredictable, unduly restricts the scope of patentable subject matter, reduces incentives to invest and innovate, and harms American industry's competitiveness. In particular, the Alice / Mayo test has created uncertainty in the computer technology and biotechnology industries as to whether innovations in medical diagnostics, personalized medicine, methods of treatment, computer software, and artificial intelligence are patent-eligible.", "As a result, some patent law stakeholders, including academics, bar associations, industry representatives, judges, and former Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) officials, have called for the Supreme Court or Congress to act to change the law of patentable subject matter. However, other stakeholders defend the legal status quo, arguing that the Alice / Mayo framework provides an important tool for combating unmeritorious patent litigation, or that the revitalized limits on patentable subject matter have important benefits for innovation.", "Recently, there have been several substantial administrative and legislative efforts to clarify or reform patent-eligible subject matter law. In January 2019, the PTO issued revised guidance to its patent examiners with the aim of clarifying and improving predictability in how PTO patent examiners make Section 101 determinations. In April and May of 2019, a bipartisan and bicameral group of Members released draft legislative proposals that would abrogate the Alice / Mayo framework and transform the law of Section 101 and related provisions of the Patent Act. Following a series of hearings in June 2019, many expect a bill to reform Section 101 to be introduced this fall.", "These proposed changes could have significant effects as to the types of technologies that are patentable. The availability of patent rights, in turn, affects incentives to invest and innovate in particular fields, as well as consumer costs and public access to technological innovation. Understanding the legal background and context can aid Congress as it debates the legal and practical effects that legislative Section 101 reforms would have if enacted."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he statutory language governing patent-eligible subject matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the types of inventions that may be patented\u00e2\u0080\u0094has remained remarkably constant over the nearly 250-year history of U.S. patent law. Under the Patent Act of 1793, which Thomas Jefferson authored, \"any new and useful art, mac hine, manufacture or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement [of the same]\" was patentable. Current law\u00e2\u0080\u0094Section 101 the Patent Act of 1952\u00e2\u0080\u0094permits the patenting of \"any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof.\" Through these four expansive statutory categories, Congress sought to ensure that nearly \"anything under the sun made by man\" is patentable if it meets all the requirements for patentability, such as novelty, enablement, and nonobviousness.", "Consistent with the broad statutory language, Section 101 permits patenting in fields of applied technology such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, chemistry, computer hardware and software, electrical engineering, agriculture, mechanical engineering, and manufacturing processes. However, the Supreme Court has long read Section 101 to categorically prohibit patents on three types of discoveries: \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas.\" Even if \"not required by the statutory text\" of Section 101, the Court has held that these three judicial exceptions \"define[] the reach of the statute as a matter of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years.\"", "In a recent series of decisions, the Supreme Court relied on Section 101 to reject patent claims on", "a method for hedging price-fluctuation risks in commodity markets; a method for measuring metabolites in human blood for the purpose of calibrating the dosage of particular drug; isolated human DNA segments; and a method of mitigating settlement risk in financial transactions using a computer.", "These decisions established a two-step test for patentable subject matter sometimes called the \" Alice/Mayo test\" or the \" Alice / Mayo framework.\" These cases have been widely recognized to effect a significant change in the scope of patentable subject matter, restricting the sorts of inventions that are patentable in the United States. The Alice / Mayo framework has thus shifted, for better or worse, the balance between providing incentives to innovate and the social costs of exclusive rights that is at the heart of patent law. The effects of this change have been particularly pronounced in the fields of computer technology and biomedical technology.", "As a result, there is a significant and ongoing debate about the effects of Alice / Mayo framework, with a number of patent law stakeholders raising concerns about recent patentable subject matter rulings. Critics argue that the Alice/Mayo framework is vague, unpredictable, and not administrable ; muddies patent law by confusing patent eligibility with distinct patent law concerns, such as nonobviousness ; reduces incentives to innovate and invest in particular industries, such as biotechnology; or puts the U.S. industry at a disadvantage with respect to international competitors. Other stakeholders defend the Alice / Mayo framework, arguing that the Court's recent decisions are a part of the ordinary common law development of Section 101; an important tool for combating unmeritorious litigation or preventing overbroad or otherwise harmful patents ; or beneficial to American consumers by lowering prices.", "In response to the concerns of some stakeholders, there have been several significant recent administrative and legislative developments that aim to clarify and/or reform the law of Section 101. On January 7, 2019, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) issued Revised Patent Subject Matter Eligibility Guidance designed to assist PTO patent examiners in determining patent eligibility with greater clarity and predictability. On April 17, 2019, Senators Thom Tillis and Chris Coons, along with Representatives Doug Collins, Hank Johnson, and Steve Stivers, released a \"bipartisan, bicameral framework\" for legislative Section 101 reform. On May 22, 2019, following feedback on their first draft framework, the same group of Members released a \"bipartisan, bicameral draft bill\" to reform Section 101. After the release of the draft bill, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Intellectual Property Subcommittee held a series of three public hearings on Section 101 reform, soliciting the views of 45 patent law stakeholders. Senators Tillis and Coons continue to seek input from stakeholders following the hearings, and are expected to make further changes before introducing a formal bill.", "This report provides the necessary background and context to understand the legal and practical effects that these legislative reforms would have if enacted. First, the report reviews the basic legal principles of the U.S. patent system. Second, it examines the historical development and current state of patentable subject matter law.

On the other hand, as Halliburton recognized, functional claims may be overbroad and ambiguous, or permit the patentee to claim more than he actually invented. In the Patent Act of 1952, Congress enacted current Section 112(f) as a compromise for functional claims, overruling Halliburton but providing a standard to make functional claims more definite.", "Under Section 112(f), a patentee may opt to express a claim element as \"a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof.\" If the patentee chooses to claim functionally, however, the claim is construed not to cover all possible means of performing the function, but only \"the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.\" Courts have held that a patentee is presumed to invoke Section 112(f) when the term \"means\" is used in the claims. Conversely, there is a presumption that the patentee does not invoke Section 112(f) if she does not use the term \"means,\" but that presumption may be overcome, such that Section 112(f) will apply to any claim that fails to recite a \"sufficiently definite structure\" for performing a function."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Rights of Patent Holders", "paragraphs": ["With some exceptions, a patent is generally granted \"for a term beginning on the date on which the patent issues and ending 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed.\" The Patent Act includes provisions that may modify the 20-year term, including to account for excessive delays in patent examination at the PTO, or delays associated with obtaining marketing approval from other federal agencies.", "Once granted, the holder of a valid patent has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, or import the invention in the United States until the patent expires.

Because these exceptions to patent-eligible subject matter are judicially created, they have no formal statutory definition; their meaning has instead been developed through two centuries of \"common law\" case-by-case adjudication in the federal courts.

Tatham , the \"fountainhead\" of American patentable subject matter jurisprudence, concerned a patent on machinery to manufacture metal pipes that exploited a newly developed property of lead. Although the Court ultimately did not decide the case on subject matter grounds, Le Roy relied on influential English patent cases to set forth a basic distinction between abstract \"principles\" and natural laws (which may not be patented) and practical applications of those principles (which may be patented). The Court stated that \"[a] principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.\" On the other hand, a \"new property discovered in matter, when practically applied, in the construction of a useful article of commerce or manufacture, is patentable,\" for the \"invention is not in discovering [the natural principles], but in applying them to useful objects.\"", "In its next term, the Court applied this rule in the famous case of O'Reilly v. Morse , concerning Samuel Morse's patent on the telegraph. Although the Court found that Morse was the first inventor of the telegraph and sustained much of his patent, the Court rejected Morse's eighth claim to any \"use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current . . . however developed for marking or printing intelligible characters, signs, or letters, at any distances, being a new application of that power of which I claim to be the first inventor or discoverer.\" Observing that \"the discovery of a principle in natural philosophy or physical science, is not patentable,\" Chief Justice Taney's majority opinion held that Morse's eighth claim was \"too broad\" because he had not discovered \"that the electric or galvanic current will always print at a distance, no matter what may be the form of the machinery\" used, but only that the specific \"complicated and delicate machinery\" disclosed in the patent specification would do so.", "In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Court issued a series of important decisions on the patentability of processes. The end result of these cases was a move away from an earlier rule that prohibited \"pure\" method patents as ineligible (i.e., a process claimed independently of the specific machinery used to accomplish the method) either by construing nominal process patents as claiming a machine or limiting the process patents to the machinery disclosed and its equivalents. In Cochrane v. Deener , which involved a patent on an improved manufacturing process for flour, the Court defined a patentable process as \"a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is an act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\" Cochrane held that such methods are patentable \"irrespective of the particular form of the instrumentalities used.\" Similarly, in Tilghman v. Proctor , the Court held that a method for separating fat into glycerin and fatty acids using water, pressure, and heat was patentable.", "In The Telephone Cases , the Court distinguished Morse to allow Alexander Graham Bell's patent claim on a \"method of and apparatus for transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially as set forth.\" Chief Justice White interpreted Morse as holding that \"the use of magnetism as a motive power, without regard to the particular process with which it was connected in the patent, could not be claimed, but that its use in that connection could.\" The Court found that Bell's claim, in contrast to Morse's, did not reach uses of electricity to transmit speech that are \"distinct from the particular process with which it is connected in [Bell's] patent,\" and upheld the claim, so construed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Twentieth Century", "paragraphs": ["In the first half of the 20th century, the Court decided two major cases on the patentability of natural phenomena.

Kalo Inoculant Co. , the Court rejected patent claims on an inoculant for leguminous plants consisting of multiple species of bacteria, where the particular bacterial strains were selected so as not to inhibit each other (as prior multispecies combinations had).

In Gottschalk v. Benson , the Court held that an algorithm for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary numerals (either by hand, or, more practically, on a computer) was patent-ineligible. Justice Douglas reasoned that \"one may not patent an idea\" and that upholding this patent would \"wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself.\" Second, in Parker v. Flook , the Court rejected a patent on a method for updating alarm limits during catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons (such as petroleum), which relied in part on a mathematical formula, because the only novel feature of the method was the mathematical formula. Third, in Diamond v. Chakrabarty , the Court upheld a patent on a genetically engineered bacterium useful in breaking down oil (e.g., in cleaning up oil spills). Chief Justice Burger distinguished American Fruit Growers and Funk Brothers because this bacterium, although a living organism, was human-made and possessed \"markedly different characteristics from any [bacteria] found in nature.\" Finally, in Diamond v. Diehr , the Court distinguished Flook to uphold a patent on a process for molding synthetic rubber that relied on a mathematical formula (the Arrhenius equation). Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion reached back to Cochrane v. Deener , holding that the process at issue was patentable because it transformed an article (uncured rubber) into a different state or thing. Even though the method used a mathematical formula, the patent in Diehr did not claim the formula itself and would not \"pre-empt the use of that equation\" in other fields.", "After Diehr , the Court did not decide a major patentable subject matter case for nearly 30 years.

Writing for five Justices, Justice Kennedy held that the machine-or-transformation test was not the \"sole test\" for determining whether a process is patent-eligible but nonetheless \"a useful and important clue.\" While the majority rejected the \"atextual\" notion that business methods were categorically unpatentable under Section 101, it relied on Benson and Flook to conclude that this particular patent attempted to claim an unpatentable abstract idea: the \"concept of hedging risk.\" Concurring only in the judgment, Justice Stevens wrote for four Justices who would have held, based on the history of the Patent Act and its constitutional purpose, that business methods were categorically patent-ineligible.", "In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories , the Court addressed the scope of the \"law of nature\" exception. The patent in Mayo claimed a method for measuring metabolites in human blood in order to calibrate the dosage of thiopurine drugs in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Breyer's opinion held that the patent claims were addressed to a law of nature: \"namely, relationships between concentrations of certain metabolites in the blood and the likelihood that a dosage of a thiopurine drug will prove ineffective or cause harm.\" Because the claims were little \"more than an instruction to doctors to apply the applicable laws when treating their patients,\" the patent lacked any inventive concept and was held to be patent-ineligible.", "The next case, Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc. , concerned the applicability of the \"natural phenomena\" exception to the patentability of human DNA. The inventor in Myriad had discovered the precise location and genetic sequence of two human genes associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Based on this discovery, the patentee claimed two molecules associated with the genes: (1) an isolated DNA segment and (2)\u00c2\u00a0a complementary DNA (cDNA) segment, in which the nucleotide sequences that do not code for amino acids were removed in the laboratory. Justice Thomas's unanimous opinion in Myriad held that isolated DNA segments were nonpatentable products of nature because the patent claimed naturally occurring genetic information. The Court concluded, however, that cDNA, as a synthetic molecule distinct from naturally occurring DNA, was patentable even though the underlying nucleotide sequence was dictated by nature.", "Most recently, Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International examined the scope of the \"abstract idea\" category of nonpatentable subject matter. Alice concerned a patent on a system for mitigating \"settlement risk\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094the risk that only one party to a financial transaction will pay what it owes\u00e2\u0080\u0094using a computer as an intermediary. The Court first held, relying on Bilski , that the invention was directed at \"the abstract idea of intermediated settlement.\" Although this idea was implemented on a computer (which is, of course, a physical machine), the patent lacked an inventive concept because the claims merely \"implement[ed] the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer.\"", " Table 1 summarizes the facts and holding of the Supreme Court's major patentable subject matter cases, in reverse chronological order."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Debate Over Alice/Mayo and Section 101 Reform", "paragraphs": ["A substantial group of patent law stakeholders, including inventors, academics, industry representatives, patent attorneys, current and former Federal Circuit judges, and former PTO officials, has criticized the Alice / Mayo framework on various grounds. However, other patent law stakeholders defend the Supreme Court's recent Section 101 decisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Criticisms of the Alice/Mayo Framework", "paragraphs": ["Generally, critics of the Court's recent patentable subject matter jurisprudence raise four principal concerns. First, the Alice / Mayo framework is criticized as excessively vague, subjective, and/or unpredictable in application. For example, the Federal Circuit has indicated that when determining whether a patent claim is \"directed to\" an ineligible concept at step one, the court must determine whether the \"focus\" of the claims is on that concept. At the same time, the Federal Circuit has cautioned that this \"focus\" must be articulated \"with enough specificity to ensure the step one inquiry is meaningful.\" But the appropriate level of specificity can vary from patent to patent and from judge to judge.", "Thus, in the view of many stakeholders, the Supreme Court's patentable subject matter case law and the Federal Circuit's implementation of the Alice / Mayo framework fail to articulate \"objective, predictable criteria\" for making patent-eligibility determinations. Key terms, such as what an \"abstract idea\" is, or precisely how claim elements can make an invention \"significantly more\" than an ineligible category (the \"inventive concept\"), are largely left undefined, making it difficult for patent applicants and litigants to know whether their patent claims will survive judicial scrutiny. Moreover, the Federal Circuit has explicitly recognized that the two steps of the analysis are not clearly defined and may overlap. As a result, many observers characterize the court's Section 101 jurisprudence as a \"highly subjective,\" \"I know it when I see it\" approach. This subjectivity, in the view of critics, injects unpredictability and uncertainty into whether an invention is of a type that is patentable.", "Second, the Alice / Mayo framework is criticized as legally flawed on various grounds. Some stakeholders argue that the Alice / Mayo framework misinterprets Section 101, imposing \"extra-statutory\" requirements for patent eligibility, contrary to congressional intent or the constitutional purpose of patent law. Others argue that Mayo 's requirement of an \"inventive concept\" rests on a historically inaccurate understanding of 19th century English patent law, first imported into American jurisprudence in cases such as Le Roy and Morse . Finally, many commentators and stakeholders argue that the Alice / Mayo framework confuses patent law by conflating eligibility under Section 101 with policy concerns\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as the obviousness of the invention and claim breadth\u00e2\u0080\u0094that are better addressed by other provisions in the Patent Act, such as Sections 102, 103, and 112. For example, patent claims have been found to lack an inventive concept at Alice / Mayo step two where they implement an abstract idea on conventional computer hardware. Issues about what was \"conventional\" or \"well-understood\" at the time of the invention, however, are questions usually reserved for novelty or nonobviousness analysis.", "Third, the Alice / Mayo framework is alleged to have detrimental effects on incentives to innovate, especially in the biotechnology and computer software industries. Given the patent claims at issue in Alice (a computer-implemented business method), Myriad (an isolated human DNA segment), and Mayo (a drug dose optimization method), most observers agree that these two industries have been the most affected by the Supreme Court's recent Section 101 rulings. In the biotechnology industry, stakeholders argue that the Alice / Mayo framework has limited their ability to obtain patents on diagnostic methods and kits, personalized medicine, and isolated natural substances. Views in the computer industry are \"sharply divided,\" but at least some stakeholders argue that Alice has devalued their patents and/or created uncertainty for their business. In both fields, some stakeholders argue that the law of Section 101 is reducing incentives to innovate in these areas and driving investment elsewhere.", "Finally, the uncertainty and unpredictability caused by Alice/Mayo is alleged to put the United States at a disadvantage relative to international competitors. Some stakeholders argue that U.S. competitiveness may be harmed because a lack of patent availability will drive investment in certain industries to other countries where such inventions are more clearly patent-eligible. Others argue that one effect of Alice / Mayo is a loss of any patent protection for certain inventions, which will enable competitors to \"free ride\" off of American innovation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defenses of the Alice/Mayo Framework", "paragraphs": ["Defenders of the current law of Section 101 respond that these criticisms of Alice / Mayo are overstated, and/or that the Supreme Court's reinvigoration of Section 101 has important benefits for the patent system. As to the subjective or unpredictable nature of Section 101 doctrine, there is some indication that the Alice / Mayo framework is not quite as unpredictable as is sometimes claimed. Some commentators also observe uncertainty in patentable subject matter law is hardly a new phenomenon, and may even be \"inevitable.\" A subjective or \"amorphous\" approach to patentable subject matter, on this view, may have certain benefits, including flexibility and adaptability to new technologies. Moreover, even if one views the current state of the law as unacceptably vague, courts may eventually clarify or change Section 101 doctrine in line with the long history of common law development in this area.", "As to legal correctness of Alice / Mayo , defenders of the framework note that while the judicially created categories are not directly grounded in the text of Section 101, they have been treated as part of the law \"as a matter of statutory stare decisis going back 150 years.\" As to Mayo 's reliance on 19th century English patent law, some commentators defend the Supreme Court's \"inventive application\" requirement as a faithful reading of this precedent. Finally, although the Alice / Mayo framework may overlap with other patent law doctrines, several commentators and judges of the Federal Circuit argue that Section 101 serves purposes that are distinct from Sections 102, 103, and 112. For example, even if the invention in Myriad \u00e2\u0080\u0094an isolated human DNA sequence discovered to be associated with increased breast cancer risk\u00e2\u0080\u0094was novel, nonobvious, and sufficiently disclosed, some commentators would still argue that the invention should not be patented based on detrimental effects for future innovation or moral concerns about patenting human DNA.", "As to the alleged detrimental effects of the Court's recent Section 101 law on innovation, some stakeholders point to countervailing benefits in either certain industries or more generally. In particular, some stakeholders in industries (such as computer software) affected by litigation by patent assertion entities argue that Section 101 is a useful and important tool for weeding out overly broad or vague patents at the outset of litigation. Other commentators point to general utilitarian or moral benefits of robust exclusions for patents on basic discoveries in science and nature.", "As to concerns about the Alice / Mayo framework's effect on international competitiveness, some commentators view these changes as good for the United States as a geopolitical matter. In particular, restricted patent-eligibility standards may benefit U.S. consumers if a lack of patent protection leads to increased competition and lower prices for certain products without harming innovation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Rationales for Section 101", "paragraphs": ["More broadly, there is a long-running and thoughtful debate over the functions and purposes that Section 101 serves in the patent system. For its part, the modern Supreme Court has largely settled on the \"preemption rationale\" for the judicially created subject matter exclusions. Recent decisions assert that abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena should not be patentable because permitting a monopoly on the \"'basic tools of scientific and technological work' .\u00c2\u00a0. . might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it,\" in that such patents would \"significantly impede future innovation.\" The gist of the preemption rationale is that Section 101 functions to prevent patents that reach so broadly that they \"threaten downstream innovation\" by preempting all uses of a natural law, abstract idea, or fundamental research tools.", "The preemption rationale is not the only potential justification for Section 101, however. Although a complete survey of the various rationales proffered for Section 101 is beyond the scope of this report, at least four broad categories of rationales for Section 101 have been proposed.", "First, some commentators argue that Section 101's purpose is to identify certain patents or categories of patents that should not be granted because their economic harms exceed their benefits\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, their net social costs are negative with respect to innovation, or more generally. Preemption theory, which claims that certain overbroad patents should be denied patent protection under Section 101 because of their negative effects on downstream innovation, is an example from this group.", "Second\u00e2\u0080\u0094in what is in some sense a special case of the first rationale\u00e2\u0080\u0094other commentators assert that Section 101's purpose is to identify and deny patents to categories of inventions that would have been developed even without a patent incentive. For example, several commentators have argued the patents on business methods should be excluded under Section 101 either because they affirmatively harm innovation and the economy, or because they are simply unnecessary because sufficient incentives to create business methods would exist even if patents are unavailable.", "Third, some commentators assert that Section 101 (or elements of Section 101 doctrine) are based not on economic considerations but on moral or ethical concerns. For example, the judicial prohibition on patenting products of nature\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as human DNA sequences\u00e2\u0080\u0094may be motivated by noneconomic, deontological notions of human dignity, or the inviolability of natural creation.", "Finally, some commentators believe that Section 101 serves no independent purpose in patent law not already better served by other patentability requirements. On this view, Section 101's judicially created exceptions to patentable subject matter should simply be eliminated as an independent requirement for patentability, in favor of a rigorous application of the other patentability requirements in Sections 102, 103, and 112 of the Patent Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Options for Section 101", "paragraphs": ["Before examining the particular approaches introduced by the PTO and in the 116th Congress, this section will review some of the general ways in which Section 101 may or may not be reformed.

First, some oppose any legislative intervention, proposing instead to allow the courts to continue to develop and refine the standards for patent eligibility. Second, some propose replacing the Alice / Mayo framework with an explicit list of subject matter that is patent-eligible or -ineligible, perhaps along the lines of an approach that is used for European patents. Third, some propose replacing the Alice / Mayo framework with a different, usually lower, standard for patent eligibility, such as a requirement that the invention result from human effort, exist outside the human mind, or contribute to the technological arts.

The \"laundry list\" approach would seek to make Section 101 clearer and more predictable by specifically defining categories of eligible and/or ineligible subject matter. Depending on how this sort of proposal is structured, it would retain the notion of ineligible classes of subject matter, but define such categories differently, more precisely, and perhaps more narrowly than the common law exceptions under the Alice / Mayo framework.", "The European Patent Convention's (EPC's) approach to patent eligibility offers a potential model for this type of approach.

On the other hand, the list-of-specific-exclusions approach would potentially be less flexible and less able to adapt to unforeseen new technologies than other reform options.

The PTO noted that the \"legal uncertainty\" surrounding the Alice / Mayo framework \"poses unique challenges\" for the agency, which has thousands of patent examiners who must make patent-eligibility determinations on hundreds of thousands of applications each year. Accordingly, the PTO issued revised guidance to its patent examiners to provide \"more clarity and predictability\" in their Section 101 determinations.", "The PTO's Revised Guidance made two major changes to how patent examiners evaluate whether a patent application claims patent-ineligible subject matter. First, the guidance attempts to provide a clearer definition of what constitutes an ineligible \"abstract idea.\" Previously, examiners would make that determination by comparing the patent claim at issue to those found to be ineligible \"abstract ideas\" in previous judicial cases. The PTO found that this approach had become \"impractical\" because of an expanding volume of sometimes contradictory Section 101 case law. The PTO's Revised Guidance \"synthesizes\" the case law into three categories that examiners will treat as \"abstract ideas\":", "(a) Mathematical concepts\u00e2\u0080\u0094mathematical relationships, mathematical formulas or equations, mathematical calculations;", "(b) Certain methods of organizing human activity\u00e2\u0080\u0094fundamental economic principles or practices (including hedging, insurance, mitigating risk); commercial or legal interactions (including agreements in the form of contracts; legal obligations; advertising, marketing or sales activities or behaviors; business relations); managing personal behavior or relationships or interactions between people (including social activities, teaching, and following rules or instructions); and", "(c) Mental processes\u00e2\u0080\u0094concepts performed in the human mind (including an observation, evaluation, judgment, opinion).", "Under the Revised Guidance, patent claims that do not recite matter that falls into one of these three groupings should not be treated as an \"abstract idea\" except in \"rare circumstance[s].\"", "Second, the PTO's Revised Guidance clarifies when examiners will treat a patent claim as \"directed to\" an ineligible category (abstract ideas, laws of nature, or natural phenomena) under step one of the Alice / Mayo test. In particular, the PTO will not treat a claim as \"directed to\" an ineligible concept if \"the claim as a whole integrates the recited judicial exception into a practical application of the exception .\" If the claim does integrate such a practical application\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as improving the functioning of a computer, effecting a particular treatment for a disease, or implementing the exception into a particular machine or manufacture\u00e2\u0080\u0094then the PTO will treat the claim as patent-eligible, without having to examine the patent application for an \"inventive concept\" under step two of the Alice / Mayo framework.", "PTO's Revised Guidance was generally perceived as lowering Section 101 barriers to patentability, especially with respect to computer-related inventions.

To be patent-eligible subject matter under the Second Tillis-Coons Proposal, the invention would need to fit into one of the four statutory categories of eligible subject matter (which remain unchanged) and be \"useful.\" To be \"useful,\" an invention or discovery would need to provide \"specific and practical utility in any field of technology through human intervention.\"", "Finally, to combat overbroad patent claims, the Second Tillis-Coons Proposal would alter the functional claiming rules under Section 112(f), which permits patentees to claim their invention in functional terms as opposed to reciting specific physical structures. In particular, the draft bill provides that if any patent claim element is \"expressed as a specified function without the recital of structure, material, or acts in support thereof,\" then that claim element will be limited to the \"corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification\" and their equivalents. Consistent with a recent decision of the Federal Circuit, this language would clarify that Section 112(f) applies to any claim element that fails to sufficiently recite a structure for performing a function. This change would arguably make it more difficult for a patentee to avoid the limiting effects of Section 112(f), even if the words \"means for\" are not used in the claim language.", "As with the first proposal, reactions to the Second Tillis-Coons Proposal from patent law stakeholders were mixed. Critics of the Alice/Mayo framework generally applauded the draft bill as bringing much needed clarity and certainty to the law of patent eligibility, particularly with respect to biotechnology innovation.

One notable concern, raised by the American Civil Liberties Union in opposition to the draft bill, was that the Second Tillis-Coons Proposal, by abrogating the Myriad decision, would permit the patenting of human genes. Several witnesses denied that the draft bill would lead to that result because of the bill's \"human intervention\" requirement or other patent law principles. For their part, Senators Tillis and Coons made clear that they have \"no intention\" of overruling the holding of Myriad that no one may patent \"genes as they exist in the human body.\"", "Following the hearings, Senators Tillis and Coons indicated that what they heard reinforced their view that \"patent eligibility is broken and desperately needs to be repaired,\" and that there is a \"necessity for Congress to intervene\" to bring greater clarity to Section 101. Moving forward, they indicated they were \"considering a provision that would exempt research and experimentation from infringement liability\" in response to concerns about inhibiting scientific research. The Senators also indicated that they would continue to welcome input from all stakeholders and would seek to \"clarify\" the proposal regarding the eligibility of gene patents, and potentially \"sharpen the 'field of technology' requirement to ensure that critical advances like artificial intelligence and medical diagnostics qualify [as patent-eligible].\" At the same time, the Senators expressed their view that certain concepts should remain patent-ineligible under a revised Section 101, such as \"economic transactions or social interactions.\" Observers expect a revised formal bill reflecting these provisions this fall."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
