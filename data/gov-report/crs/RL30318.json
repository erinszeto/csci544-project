However, exceptions in that statute and succeeding statutes resulted in only minimal restrictions on governmental usage of the SSN. Today, an individual needs an SSN to pay taxes, obtain a driver's license, and open a bank account, among other things. The continued use of, and reliance on, SSNs by public and private sector entities and the potential for SSN misuse, including identity theft concerns, has led to increasing efforts by governmental entities to limit the use and disclosure of SSNs.

However, in spite of the Executive Order, there was little program use of SSN's within the Federal Government in the 1940's and 1950's, because there was no real incentive for those agencies which kept individual records (e.g., Civil Service Commission, the Armed Forces, IRS, etc.) to change their record keeping systems. The potential for expanded use of the SSN was increasingly recognized during this period, though. After its adoption in 1961 by the Civil Service Commission for Federal employees, the next major use of the SSN for other than social security purposes occurred in 1962, when the IRS adopted the SSN as its official taxpayer identification number. While the use of the SSN by IRS has no relationship to the social security system as such, this step was nevertheless considered entirely appropriate.", "On November 18, 2008, this longstanding executive order was amended by President George W.

This is in part due to the fact that organizations, both private and public, use SSNs for account authentication, often utilizing a social security number as a password to access or modify account information. The Social Security Administration now truncates SSNs on the millions of benefit statements it mails each year. Since 2007, beneficiaries of the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) have received randomly assigned account numbers in place of their SSN, which had previously served as the account number.

Testimony in 2009 by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) cited prior work documenting that SSNs were displayed on millions of cards issued by federal agencies, including 42 million Medicare cards, 8 million Department of Defense (DOD) identification cards and insurance cards, and 7 million Veteran Affairs (VA) identification cards. GAO noted in its 2009 testimony that the VA and DOD had begun taking action to remove SSNs from identification cards. As of June 1, 2011, as current military identification cards expire, they are being replaced with new cards having a unique DOD identification number.

The SSN, as part of the health insurance claim number, helps CMS to interact with beneficiaries. While the SSA directs persons not to carry their cards, CMS, contrastingly, instructs Medicare participants to carry the card so that the card can be shown whenever medical care is provided. In a 2006 report to Congress, CMS had estimated the cost of transitioning to a non-SSN based Medicare identifier to be over $300 million. In conclusion, the OIG report stated,", "While we recognize SSA cannot prohibit CMS from using SSNs as its primary beneficiary identifier, we believe it can help reduce the potential threats to SSN integrity by taking a proactive role in supporting legislation that would mandate the removal of SSNs from Medicare cards. We recognize that such legislation could be inconvenient for both agencies and may result in additional costs. However, given the potential threats to SSN integrity, such a challenge should not discourage SSA from taking additional steps to safeguard SSNs. Accordingly, we recommend that SSA:", "1.

Continue to partner with CMS to develop an alternative Medicare identifier that meets both agencies' needs.", "In August of 2012, the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing concerning feasible options for HHS and CMS to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. CMS claimed that it would now cost as much as $845 million to remove SSNs from Medicare cards. During the hearing and in a corresponding report, GAO outlined more cost-effective solutions such as truncating the number or replacing the SSN with a new \"Medicare Beneficiary Identifier.\" In response to these concerns, the House passed the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2012, which would have directed the Secretary of HHS to establish cost-effective procedures to ensure that an SSN is not displayed on Medicare cards issued after a specified date in the bill. However, in September 2013, GAO reported that CMS has yet to take the necessary steps, such as initiating an information technology project, to develop a system to remove SSNs from Medicare cards.", "In addition to government-issued identification cards, the Death Master File (DMF) also involves identity theft concerns.

However, the court found that Virginia had failed to comply with Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act by not stating whether the disclosure was mandatory or voluntary, and by not listing what uses would be made of the SSNs. The court went on to find that Virginia's practice of making voter records, including SSNs, available for public inspection placed \"a burdensome condition on the exercise of the fundamental right to vote.\" Virginia's justification for collecting and disclosing SSNs was to prevent voter fraud. The court held that while Virginia's rationale amounted to a compelling state interest, its policy of keeping SSNs available for public inspection was not \"narrowly tailored\" to the state's interest, so the court barred further dissemination of voters' SSNs. Thus, the court's specific holding in this case was that the public availability of SSNs was unconstitutional only because it burdens another fundamental right, the right to vote, not because it was per se unconstitutional.", "In another case involving constitutional principles, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in Ostergren v. Cuccinelli , held that a Virginia statute prohibiting the intentional publication of a person's social security number over the Internet violated the First Amendment's protection of free speech. The plaintiff, Ostergren, was a privacy advocate who published public land records that revealed the SSNs of various public officials on her website. Virginia counties had been in the process of redacting SSNs from land records available online since 2007, but not all counties had finished the process, and not all SSNs were redacted due to errors. The circuit court stated that, given Ostergren's \"criticism about how public records are managed, we cannot see how drawing attention to the problem by displaying those very documents could be considered unprotected speech. Indeed, the Supreme Court has deemed such speech particularly valuable within our society.\" Thus, the court applied the strict scrutiny standard of review: \"Accordingly, Virginia may enforce Section 59.1-443.2 against Ostergren for publishing lawfully obtained, truthful information about a matter of public significance 'only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order.'\" The court then ruled that punishing Ostergren for posting publicly available online land records when Virginia itself continued to make unredacted documents publicly available violated Ostergren's First Amendment rights.", "In recent court cases involving requests for SSNs through vehicles such as federal and state open records laws, courts have increasingly balanced the public's right to know against a person's right to keep personal information private, and have, in a number of cases, sided with protecting informational privacy. For example, in Sherman v. U.S. Dep't of the Army , the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals examined a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for personnel record information with unredacted SSNs. The court stated,", "[A]n individual's informational privacy interest in his or her SSN is substantial.

In a similar state court decision, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, in Oklahoma Public Employees Assn v. Oklahoma , denied public access via the Oklahoma Open Records Act to SSNs and dates of birth of state employees. The court used a balancing test to determine whether the employees' interest in non-disclosure outweighed the public's right to know under the state statute which provided an exception to disclosure when the information sought would constitute a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of the state employees' personal privacy.\" In this case, the court found that disclosure of the personal information sought \"would not significantly serve the principal purpose of disclosure, i.e. , ensuring public confidence in government by increasing the access of the public to government and its decision-making processes.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSN Use in the Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["Private sector use of the SSN is widespread, including activities such as using SSNs for data exchanges to assess credit risk, tracking patient care among multiple providers, locating bankruptcy assets, and providing background checks on new employees.

In some cases, an accommodation may be reached whereby a business agrees to use an identifier other than a person's SSN, but there is no federal law that prohibits the private entity from requiring a person's SSN as a condition to providing goods or services. State laws may, however, restrict private sector use of SSNs, and should be consulted.", "One federal statute that does impact the collection of SSNs by businesses and financial institutions in the private sector is Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act. That provision directed the Treasury Department to promulgate regulations that require certain financial institutions to verify the identity of persons establishing a new line of credit or opening a new account and to consult \"lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by any government agency to determine whether a person seeking to open an account appears on any such list.\" These regulations require financial institutions such as banks to implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP), which, at a minimum, must require that an individual provide his or her name, date of birth, residential or business address, and taxpayer identification number, which for U.S. citizens is the person's SSN. Thus, a person opening a bank or credit card account or financing a car through a loan from a financial institution may be told that supplying his or her SSN is \"required by the Patriot Act.\" To be precise, it is the CIP regulations issued pursuant to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act that require disclosure of a person's SSN under these circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Laws Affecting SSN Confidentiality and Disclosure", "paragraphs": ["A number of states have enacted statutes that restrict the use or display of SSNs in various contexts, including restricting companies and individuals from posting or publicly displaying SSNs, printing them on cards, transmitting them over the Internet, or mailing them without safety measures. California was the first state to pass such a law that bars certain businesses, such as insurance companies, from publicly displaying SSNs. The California law also prohibits printing an SSN on identification cards; printing SSNs on documents mailed to customers, except under certain circumstances; and requiring persons to use an SSN to log onto a website without a password. Other states, including Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Virginia, have passed laws similar to California's law. Some states have gone further in protecting SSNs, including restricting the solicitation of SSNs by private companies, prohibiting disclosure of SSNs or any number derived therefrom, or subjecting a truncated SSN to the same restrictions on display and transfer as the full SSN.", "Concerns have been expressed regarding the effect of technological advances on the availability and use of the SSN in private sector databases: Organizations that sell personal information, including SSNs, have benefited greatly from continuing advances in computer technology and the availability of computerized databases. This practice may be exploited in a fraudulent manner. For example, in February 2005, ChoicePoint, the largest information broker in the country, \"unwittingly sold personal information on at least 145,000 Americans to a criminal ring engaged in identity theft.\" Increasingly, states have passed laws that require state agencies and private entities to notify residents when a security breach results in the release of personal information, including SSNs. California was the first jurisdiction to pass such a law in 2002. As of October 2010, at least 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have enacted laws with similar requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chronology of Federal Developments Affecting the Social Security Number", "paragraphs": ["The chronology that follows details various federal developments relating to use of the SSN."], "subsections": []}]}}
