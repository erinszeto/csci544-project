Secretary General's MDG report finds that the recent food and economic crises have also reversed the declining trend in the proportion of people who are undernourished. According to U.N. estimates, the proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from about 20% in the early 1990s to about 16% in the middle of the following decade.

Critics have suggested that the \"leadership vacuum\" at USAID provided an opening for other federal agencies, including the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, to step up and play a bigger role in longer-term development activities that have typically been under the jurisdiction of USAID. Some have been critical of a development approach divided among different federal agencies and have questioned whether it undermines the authority and resources of USAID. The Center for Global Development, for example, maintains that \"USAID and its development perspective are conspicuously absent from our most significant foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq.\"", "On November 10, 2009, the White House announced the appointment of Dr. Rajiv Shah as the new USAID Administrator. Dr. Shah was recently confirmed as the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics and Chief Scientist in May 2009 and previously served in a range of leadership roles at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including Director of the Agricultural Development Program. The nomination leaves many with questions about the Obama Administration's position on USAID. Many in Congress and in the development community are calling for the restoration of the authority, independence, and stature of USAID, which they think has been eroded. Some also question the role and authority of the USAID Administrator position itself, vis-\u00e0-vis the Secretary of State. Some have noted that the recent nomination \"might raise more questions than it answers\u2014but those questions increasingly point to a diminished USAID.\" Others view the choice as one \"that underscores the Obama Administration's commitment to the vital role development plays in foreign policy and to the rebuilding of USAID as the strong agency the country and the world need it to be.\" The strategic reviews of U.S. development efforts currently underway\u2014for example, the QDDR and the PSD\u2014likely will clarify, and possibly strengthen, the role of USAID and its Administrator in formulating and carrying out U.S. development assistance policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Resources", "paragraphs": ["A concern has been raised by several senior government officials (and former government officials), including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former USAID Administrator Peter McPherson, about the severe decline in staff capacity at USAID over the past few decades. To illustrate this point, Secretary Gates made the following observations in an article published in Foreign Affairs in January/February 2009:", "The military and civilian elements of the United States' national security apparatus have responded unevenly and have grown increasingly out of balance. The problem is not will; it is capacity. In many ways, the country's national security capabilities are still coping with the consequences of the 1990s, when, with the complicity of both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced or allowed to wither on the bureaucratic vine. The State Department froze the hiring of new Foreign Service officers. The U.S. Agency for International Development dropped from a high of having 15,000 permanent staff members during the Vietnam War to having less than 3,000 today.", "In testimony at a hearing on foreign assistance reform before the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs last year, Peter McPherson noted that \"in 1980 USAID had 2,000 permanent foreign officers, which had declined to about 1,000 by 2008.\" He also stated that,\\ \"USAID currently [in 2008] has only two engineers, 16 agriculture experts and 17 education experts.\"", "Some contend that the staff cuts have had detrimental impacts on USAID, including the loss of on-the-ground effectiveness (e.g., the reduced staff capacity has resulted in the closing of a number of overseas missions) and the loss of technical expertise. Staff cuts have changed USAID from an implementation agency to one that contracts out large portions of its foreign aid program to others. Some believe that this has meant less coherence and effectiveness in the overall effort, less flexibility, and diminished leverage with other private and public funders. In addition, a recent report documented the country-level fragmentation in USAID-managed agricultural development assistance and the difficulty USAID has in managing the large number of relatively small projects that comprise its agricultural development portfolio due to shortages of staff, including expertise in agriculture and related technical areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutional Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. government requested that some land-grant universities help create counterpart institutions in developing countries. In 1975, with the passage of the Title XII \"Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger\" amendment ( P.L. 94-161 ) to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (P.L. 87-195), the land-grant universities' participation in international development efforts was formalized. ", "One of the flagship capacity-building programs at USAID authorized under Title XII is the Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP), which supports theme-based agricultural research programs anchored in U.S. universities that train, mentor, and collaborate with scientists in developing countries. There are currently eight active CRSP programs, involving 60 U.S. universities and academic and research institutions in more than 60 developing countries. The objectives of the CRSPs are to help build sustainable capacity in the national agricultural research systems (NARS) of developing countries so that the countries themselves will be able to solve problems of food insecurity and malnutrition globally over the long term. The CRSPs comprise a long-term, multi-disciplinary research and training effort to address the problem of food insecurity and malnutrition in developing countries and since 1978 have educated scientists in a wide range of agricultural disciplines. The CRSPs consist of communities of U.S. land grant universities working with developing-country national agricultural research systems (NARSs), international agricultural research centers, U.S. agribusiness firms and associations, private voluntary organizations, developing-country colleges and universities, USAID headquarters and field missions, and other U.S. agencies, such as USDA. In FY2008, USAID provided $29 million to support CRSP research, training, and technology transfer activities.", "Since the 1990s, the role of capacity building as a strategic direction at USAID both in developing countries and in the United States has been reduced. Over the last decade USAID has reduced the duration of new projects and downgraded the role of research with its longer-term outcomes. The most obvious manifestation of this is the pronounced reduction of the CRSP training program to a small fraction of its size in the 1980s. This has resulted in a significant loss of institutional capacity for training and work abroad for U.S. universities. It also has resulted in even weaker institutional capacity of partner institutions in developing countries. Some have argued that the CRSPs were not cost-effective and had little accountability in terms of showing results and impact. Others argued that the long-term linkages with private- and public-sector partners in developing countries, and the additional resources leveraged, were not counted in the cost-benefit analysis. ", "At the same time, USAID has acknowledged that long-term institutional building is a key component for aid effectiveness. A 2004 white paper stated that the agency was moving toward \"attaching more importance to strengthening institutional capacity and avoiding programs and practices that undermine institutional capacity.\" Nonetheless, the funding, scope, and duration of USAID training and capacity-building programs, especially as relevant to agriculture, have not been restored.", "Some questions exist about whether there is sufficient institutional capacity\u2014both in the United States and in developing countries, particularly Africa\u2014to effectively implement agricultural research, education, training, and market development programs. Some have noted that sub-Saharan Africa has a weak scientific foundation for developing a modern agriculture and that African governments and donors have been reluctant to make long-term investments in science and technology and training to increase agricultural productivity.

The most directly involved are USAID, the State Department, USDA, the MCC, the Treasury Department (via the World Bank and other international financial institutions), and the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), because of trade capacity building activities. The need for interagency coordination in the provision of agricultural development and food security assistance has been widely discussed. Some view it as a challenge and opportunity to further U.S. efforts to enhance global food security; others view what they see as a lack of interagency coordination as a major constraint to U.S. food security efforts. The report of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs noted that \"interagency coordination is a particular challenge in the area of foreign assistance, including food aid and nutrition, where literally scores of different agencies can play a role.\" The Chicago Council recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture within the Executive Office of the President to provide leadership and maintain consistent and effective priorities and actions among U.S. government agencies in this area. The Administrator of USAID would serve as a co-chair of this group. In addition, the Chicago Council called for the establishment of a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture who also would serve as a co-chair of the ICOGA.

The United States carries on regular bilateral consultations on international aid with such major donor governments as Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, and with regional entities such as the European Union. The United States also plays a leading role in discussion and coordination within such international bodies as the United Nations and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD, and with the World Bank and regional multinational lending bodies such as the African Development Bank.", "Global summits sponsored by the United Nations also have played an important role in donor coordination, establishing international development goals, mobilizing political support, and creating new coordination mechanisms. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies began to acknowledge that they imposed considerable costs on aid recipients by their many different approaches and requirements, and began working with one another and with partner countries to harmonize their strategies and activities. At a 2003 High-Level Forum on Harmonization (HLF-Rome) donors agreed on two primary goals: to ensure that aid is demand-driven and that it is aligned with the developing country's priorities.", "In March 2005, at the Paris High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, over 100 signatories from partner governments, bilateral and multilateral donor agencies, regional development banks, and international agencies endorsed the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, which made a commitment to help developing-country governments formulate and implement their own national development plans, according to their own national priorities and, where possible, using their own implementation systems. The Paris Declaration also established measurable indicators and targets to track progress.", "The most recent effort in donor coordination is represented by the 2008 High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra, Ghana, with the participation of more than 100 ministries and heads of agencies from developing and donor countries, U.N. and multilateral institutions, global funds, foundations, and civil society organizations. The Accra meeting was different from its predecessors in that developing countries and nongovernmental organizations played a more active role in preparing and participating in the meeting's agenda. There was broad acknowledgement that new global challenges, such as rising food and fuel prices and climate change, bring added urgency to efforts to make aid as effective as possible. The Accra Agenda for Action added additional principles for donor coordination: ", "P redictability . Donors will provide advance information on their planned aid to partner countries for a three- to five-year period. Country systems . \u00a0Aid should be delivered according to the priorities and strategies laid out by the partner country, rather than on the strategy laid out by the donor. Conditionality . \u00a0Donors will switch from using prescriptive conditions about how and when aid money is spent to conditions based on the developing country's own development objectives. Untying .\u00a0Donors will relax restrictions that prevent developing countries from buying the goods and services they need from whomever and wherever they can get the best quality at the lowest price.", "The multilateral agreements on aid effectiveness have had some effect on the U.S. government approach to bilateral foreign assistance. Some of the focus has shifted to implementation of programs in keeping with the 2005 Paris Declaration. For instance, the Presidential Initiative to End Hunger in Africa, which is administered by USAID, has increasingly focused on fostering African ownership of the development process by supporting African initiatives, institutions, and capacity building at the national and regional levels. This includes USAID support for the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), which, as noted above, is an African-owned and -led initiative to boost agricultural productivity in Africa. The Administration's global food security initiative expressly endorses the principles and objectives laid out in the Accra Agenda for Action.

The FY2010 Foreign Operations appropriations bill, which appropriates funds for development and disaster assistance, is still pending. For international disaster assistance, the House-passed Foreign Operations appropriations measure ( H.R. 3081 ) provides $200 million for food security aid, $100 million less than requested by the President. For agricultural development assistance, the President's FY2010 budget requested approximately $1.36 billion, more than double the FY2009 request. The House-passed Foreign Operations bill provides $1.0 billion for agriculture and food security assistance. The Senate Foreign Operations bill ( S. 1434 ), which has not passed the full Senate, recommends $1.5 billion for agriculture and food security assistance. S. 1434 does not include a reference to disaster assistance funds for local and regional purchase of food aid commodities.", "Some see the experience of administration requests and congressional appropriations for the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) as cautionary with respect to prospects for U.S. funding for a food security initiative. In each year since the MCC was established, the MCC proposal was the largest increase sought by the Administration in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill and was viewed by many observers as one of the most vulnerable items in an increasingly difficult budget environment. In each year as well, its enacted appropriation has been well below the President's request. Supporters of the MCC are disturbed by this trend, reflected again in proposed congressional funding levels for FY2009, well below the (Bush) Administration request. Funding levels for the MCC for FY2010 are still pending. ", "At the L'Aquila summit, the President pledged that the United States would provide $3.5 billion over three years to support the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership. The funds called for in congressional appropriations measures could be considered as parts of the U.S. pledge. As for the overall G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership, which now stands at $22 billion over three years, some skepticism exists in the international community that the G8 pledge will be met. Skeptics note that the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, pledged to provide $50 billion in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa by 2009, but by some accounts the G8 is $15 billion short of meeting this commitment.
