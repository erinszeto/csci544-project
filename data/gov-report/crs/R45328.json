Approximately 82% of identified commissions provided for one or more appointments in this manner.", "The second entry in Table 1 , the Commission on Wartime Contracting, shows another common method of appointment: members of the commission were appointed by selected officials, in concert with other officials. In this instance, Members of House and Senate leadership were required to consult with relevant House or Senate committee chairpersons, while the President was required to consult with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State prior to making his appointments. Approximately 53% of identified commissions provided for one or more appointments to be made by officials in concert with other officials.", "The third example in Table 1 , the Thomas Jefferson Commemoration Commission, shows a somewhat less common appointment structure, where the statute designated 10 specific officials (or their designees) to serve on the commission. The statute directly names the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Librarian of Congress, the Archivist of the United States, and selected congressional leaders, among others, to the commission. Approximately 17% of identified commissions provided for one or more individuals directly designated to serve as a member.", "A commission statute may provide for appointments according to a single method or multiple methods. Similarly, appointment authority may be provided to a small number or a large number of selected leaders or officials. Providing appointment authority to a wider range of individuals may have the advantage of generating additional \"buy-in\" from selected leaders.

The statute establishing the Commission on Indian and Native Alaskan Health Care required the appointment of \"[n]ot fewer than 10\" Indians or Native Alaskans to serve on the commission.", "Congress may also choose qualifications to ensure that a commission contains a wide range of viewpoints. A commission may be designed to review a policy issue that affects a variety of interests or economic sectors, and legislators may place qualifications on appointments to ensure each interest is represented. For instance, the statute creating the Motor Fuel Tax Enforcement Advisory Commission mandated the appointment of a certain number of individuals to represent the interests of highway construction, fuel distribution, state tax administration, state departments of transportation, and relevant federal agencies, among other interests. Similarly, the act creating the Commission on Long-Term Care required the following:", "The membership of the Commission shall include individuals who\u2014", "(A) Represent the interests of\u2014", "(i) Consumers of long-term services and supports and related insurance products, as well as their representatives;", "(ii) Older adults;", "(iii) Individuals with cognitive or functional limitations;", "(iv) Family caregivers for individuals described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii);", "(v) The health care workforce who directly provide long-term services and supports;", "(vi) Private long-term care insurance providers", "(vii) Employers;", "(viii) State insurance departments; and", "(ix) State Medicaid agencies;", "(B) Have demonstrated experience in dealing with issues related to long-term services and supports, health care policy, and public and private insurance; and", "(C) Represent the health care interests and needs of a variety of geographic areas and demographic groups.", "Qualifications or restrictions placed on appointments may help ensure that the commission is populated with genuine experts in a policy area, is representative of particular groups or sectors, or is made up of members with a wide range of viewpoints. This may help improve the commission's final work product, increase its stature and credibility, ensure that the desired range of voices can be heard during commission deliberations, or help obtain broader acceptance of the commission's recommendations or findings.", "On the other hand, placing qualifications on appointments has the effect of limiting the degree of autonomy provided to those responsible for making appointments. Additionally, the specificity of the language used to establish qualifications may affect whether the qualification achieves its intended goal. If the language establishing qualifications is too precise, certain individuals who might be valuable members of the commission may be excluded from consideration.

A small number of these were designed to have a perfectly even split between the parties. Typically, commissions are structured to be bipartisan by dividing commission appointment authority between Members of the majority and minority parties in the House and Senate. A smaller number of commission statutes ensure bipartisanship by detailing the partisan breakdown of individual commission members. For instance, P.L. 104-275 established a 12-member Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, and specified that \"[n]ot more than seven of the members of the Commission may be members of the same political party.\" The latter approach, directly specifying or limiting the partisan composition of commission membership, is less common and likely more difficult to enforce; determining the political affiliation of some potential members, who may have no official affiliation with a party (through voter registration, for example), may not be possible. Overall, approximately 74% of identified commissions required some level of bipartisanship in the appointment process.", "Bipartisan arrangements may make congressional commissions' findings and recommendations more politically balanced. A bipartisan membership may also lend additional credibility to a commission's recommendations, both within Congress and among the public. A commission that is perceived as partisan may have greater difficulty generating interest and support among the public and gathering the necessary support in Congress.", "In some cases, bipartisanship may arguably impede a commission's ability to complete its mission; in situations where a commission is tasked with studying potentially controversial or partisan issues, the appointment of an equal number of commissioners by both parties may result in a situation where the commission's activities are stymied, with neither side able to garner a majority to take action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Terms and Vacancies", "paragraphs": ["Because most advisory commissions are designed to last only for a set period of time, appointments are usually made for the life of the commission.
