It is worth noting as the regulations are examined, that some of the provisions carried over from prior regulations are included due to the requirements of this section. In addition, in at least one situation, an argument by a commenter that a proposed section of the regulations would violate this statutory requirement led ED to remove the section.", "ED issued additional regulations \"to clarify and strengthen current regulations\"on December 1, 2008.

The IDEA definition requires that all special education teachers\u2014not just those who teach core subjects\u2014must meet certain requirements. In addition, P.L. 108-446 modifies the ESEA requirements with respect to two groups of special education teachers: those who teach only the most severely disabled children and those who teach more than one core subject.", "Both new and veteran special education teachers teaching core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities who are assessed against alternative achievement standards under ESEA (i.e., the most severely cognitively disabled) can, of course, meet the definition of highly qualified by meeting their applicable ESEA standards. Alternatively, new, as well as veteran, teachers of these students at the elementary level may meet the highly qualified definition by demonstrating \"competence in all the academic subjects in which the teacher teaches based on a high objective uniform State standard of evaluation\" (HOUSSE). Teachers of these students at levels above elementary school can meet the definition by demonstrating \"subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction ... as determined by the State, needed to effectively teach to those standards [i.e., alternative achievement standards]\" (\u00a7602(10)(C)(ii)).", "New and veteran special education teachers who teach two or more core subjects exclusively to children with disabilities may qualify as highly qualified by meeting the requirements in each core subject taught under applicable ESEA provisions. Alternatively, veteran special education teachers teaching two or more core subjects may also qualify as highly qualified based on the ESEA HOUSSE option (\u00a7602(10)(D)(ii)), which may include a single evaluation covering multiple subjects. Finally, newly hired special education teachers teaching two or more core subjects who are already highly qualified in mathematics, language arts, or science are given two years from the date of employment to meet the highly qualified definition with respect to the other core subjects taught. This could occur through the HOUSSE option (\u00a7602(10)(D)(iii)).

For example, a teacher certified under this provision must demonstrate \"satisfactory progress toward full certification as prescribed by the State.\" The regulations include specific language (following clarifying language in Note 21 of the conference report ) that special education teachers who do not provide instruction in core academic subjects need only meet the requirements of a baccalaureate degree and a full special education certification to meet the highly qualified definition. In addition, the regulations add explicit language that the highly qualified definition does not apply to teachers in private schools.", "The regulations permit states to develop separate HOUSSE procedures for special education teachers, including a single procedure assessing multiple core subject areas, \"provided that any adaptations of the State's HOUSSE would not establish a lower standard for the content knowledge requirements for special education teachers and meets all the requirements for a HOUSSE for regular education teachers ...\" (34 C.F.R. \u00a7300.18(e)).", "The statute declares that there is no right of action based on an employee not meeting the highly qualified requirements of the act.

For the latter teachers, the statutory language does not explicitly reference the ESEA HOUSSE alternative but states the following:", "or, in the case of instruction above the elementary level, has subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided, as determined by the State, needed to effectively teach to those standards.", "For this second group of special education teachers, the regulations do reference the ESEA HOUSSE alternative as follows:", "or, in the case of instruction above the elementary level, meet the requirements of subparagraph (B) or (C) of section 9101(23) of the ESEA as applied to an elementary school teacher and have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided, as determined by the State, needed to effectively teach to those standards.", "\u00a7300.156(a) contains the general requirement that states must have personnel qualifications to ensure that teachers, paraprofessionals, providers of related services, and other personnel carrying out the purposes of part 300 \"are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained, including that those personnel have the content knowledge and skills to serve children with disabilities.\" Note 21 of the conference report clarifies that the statute is not intended to prevent highly qualified general education teachers who lack certification in special education from providing children with disabilities with instruction in core subjects.

The provisions relating to children placed in private schools by public agencies were not changed from previous law. A child with a disability may also be unilaterally placed in a private school by his or her parents. In the latter situation, the cost of the private school placement is not paid by the LEA unless a hearing officer or a court makes certain findings. However, IDEA does require some services for children in private schools, even if they are unilaterally placed there by their parents. Exactly what these services are or should be has been a contentious subject for many years. The 1997 reauthorization of IDEA expanded the private school provisions, and the 2004 reauthorization includes several changes to the provisions relating to children with disabilities who are placed in private school by their parents.", "Generally, children with disabilities enrolled by their parents in private schools are to be provided special education and related services based on where the private school is located, not on where the child resides. This provision was changed from previous law, which made the LEA where the child resided responsible for providing services. Thus the LEA responsible for providing services to parentally placed children with disabilities has changed from the LEA of residence to the LEA of attendance. The Senate report described this change as protecting \"LEAs from having to work with private schools located in multiple jurisdictions when students attend private schools across district lines.\" P.L. 108-446 adds requirements that the LEA consult with private school officials and representatives of the parents of parentally placed private school children with disabilities. In addition, the current law adds compliance procedures which allow a private school official to submit a complaint to the SEA about the consultation and, if the private school official is dissatisfied with the SEA's response, he or she may submit a complaint to the Secretary of Education."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Final Regulations", "paragraphs": ["The final regulations track the statutory requirements and add provisions to address some issues raised by comments on the proposed regulations. The regulations reiterate that it is the LEA of attendance that is responsible for locating, identifying, and evaluating all parentally placed children in private schools within their geographic boundaries (the so called \"child find\" requirement). The regulations stipulate that the LEA of attendance is responsible for child find and proportional provision of services even if the child resides in another state. The regulations clarify that children with disabilities ages three to five are considered to be \"parentally placed\" only if they attend private schools that meet the definition of \"elementary school\" contained in the act. As noted above, the highly qualified teacher requirements do not apply to private school teachers providing services to parentally placed children with disabilities.", "The regulations follow the act in requiring that an LEA use a share of its IDEA grants in proportion to the number of parentally placed children with disabilities in private schools within the LEA to provide equitable services for these children. In addition, the regulations present a hypothetical example of how a proportional share of an LEA's IDEA grant is to be calculated. Again, following the language of the statute, the regulations exclude the cost of child find from this proportional share. While requiring consultation on the child find process and the provision of services as the statute requires, the regulations specify that \"[n]o parentally-placed private school child with a disability has an individual right to receive some or all of the special education and related services that the child would receive if enrolled in a public school.\" In addition, the LEA makes the final decisions about the nature of services, and the LEA is responsible for devising a service plan for every parentally placed child with a disability receiving special education or related services.", "Some commenters proposed that \"the LEA where the private school is located to provide [sic] the district of residence the results of an evaluation and eligibility determination of the parentally-placed private school child.\" ED is concerned that the privacy rights of the child be protected and added the following requirement:", "If a child is enrolled, or is going to enroll in a private school that is not located in the LEA of the parent's residence, parental consent must be obtained before any personally identifiable information about the child is released between officials in the LEA where the private school is located and officials in the LEA of the parent's residence.", "Some public school advocates, who had hoped that ED might relax the statutory requirements, continue to express concerns. Reggie Felton, director of federal relations for the National School Boards Association, noted that \"[i]t creates an additional burden for school districts that happen to have a higher number of private schools physically located in their district.\" Mary Kunstler, assistant director of government relations for the American Association of School Administrators (AASA), argues that \"[c]hild find costs can be extravagantly high, and local taxpayers are footing the bill to find students who aren't living in their area.\" She notes that AASA \"has every intention of going back to Congress with this.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Procedural Safeguards and Discipline", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Overview", "paragraphs": ["Section 615 of IDEA provides procedural safeguards for children with disabilities and their parents. Procedural safeguards are provisions protecting the rights of parents and children with disabilities regarding a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and include notice of rights, mediation, resolution sessions, and due process procedures. Section 615 has been a continual source of controversy, especially the provisions relating to the discipline of children with disabilities. The changes made by P.L. 108-446 include adding provisions relating to homeless children, adding a two-year statute of limitations for the filing of a complaint and a two-year statute of limitations regarding requests for a hearing, adding additional requirements for hearing officers, changing the mediation provision, and specifically allowing the local educational agency, not just the parents, to file for a due process hearing. The discussion of the provisions of P.L. 108-446 in this report regarding procedural safeguards and discipline is not comprehensive. There were significant changes made by the new law in areas such as attorneys' fees which are not discussed here as the regulations do not make significant additions to the statutory language.", "One of the major changes was the addition of a \"resolution session.\" This is a preliminary meeting between the parents and the LEA and IEP team held within 15 days of receiving the parent's complaint. The reason for this addition was to attempt to resolve disputes prior to the more adversarial due process hearing. The House report noted that the resolution session \"is intended to improve the communication between parents and school officials, and to help foster greater efforts to resolve disputes in a timely manner so that the child's interests are best served.\" If an agreement is reached during the resolution session, the parties must execute a legally binding agreement signed by both parties and which is enforceable in court.", "Disciplinary issues relating to children with disabilities were a contentious issue during the 2004 reauthorization. Although P.L. 108-446 made significant changes to \u00a7615(k), it did keep many of the provisions of the previous law. One of the changes was the addition of a provision allowing school personnel to consider, on a case-by-case basis, any unique circumstances when determining whether to order a change in placement for a child with a disability who violates a code of student conduct.", "Another major change was in the language regarding manifestation determinations. The concept of a manifestation determination originated in policy interpretations of IDEA by the Department of Education. The theory is that when behavior, even inappropriate behavior, is caused by a disability, the response of a school must be different that when the behavior is not related to the disability. The concept of a manifestation determination was placed in statutory language in the 1997 reauthorization and amended in 2004 by P.L. 108-446 .", "P.L. 108-446 reauthorization provides that, within 10 days of a decision to change the placement of a child with a disability because of a violation of a code of student conduct, the LEA, the parent, and appropriate members of the IEP team shall review all relevant information in the student's file, including the IEP, teacher observations, and any relevant information provided by the parents to determine if the conduct in question was caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP. If the LEA, the parent and relevant members of the IEP team determine that the conduct in question was caused by or had a direct and substantial relationship to the child's disability or if the conduct in question was the direct result of the LEA's failure to implement the IEP, the conduct is determined to be a manifestation of the child's disability. Except for situations involving weapons, drugs, or serious bodily injury, when the conduct is a manifestation of the disability, the child shall return to the placement from which he or she was removed unless the parent and the LEA agree to a change of placement as part of the modification of the behavioral intervention plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural Safeguards in the Regulations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Parental Revocation of Consent", "paragraphs": ["IDEA currently contains statutory provisions requiring that parental consent be obtained prior to providing special education or related services to a child with a disability. However, the statute does not specifically address the issue of what responsibilities the LEA has when a child has been receiving special education services and a parent wishes to revoke consent for such services. Previously, ED had interpreted the statute and regulations to prohibit the unilateral withdrawal of a child from special education in most circumstances.", "The regulations promulgated in December 2008 reverse this interpretation to allow parents to unilaterally withdraw their child from the receipt of special education services, but require that the revocation be in writing. The Department described the rationale for the new provision as a continuation of the parents' right to consent to services. \"Allowing parents to revoke consent for the continued provision of special education and related services at any time is consistent with the IDEA's emphasis on the role of parents in protecting their child's rights and the Department's goal of enhancing parent involvement and choice in their child's education.\" The regulations do not allow a LEA to use mediation or due process procedures to override a parent's decision to refuse to consent to further services. Under the regulations, the LEA will not be considered in violation of the FAPE requirement if the child was not provided with special education or related services because of the parent's revocation of consent. In addition, the regulations specifically provide that if the parents revoke consent, the LEA is not required to amend the child's records to remove references to the child's receipt of special education services. ED described the rationale for not requiring changes in the child's records by observing that \"[a] parent's revocation of consent is not retroactive....\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedural Safeguards Notice", "paragraphs": ["The majority of the regulatory language regarding procedural safeguards mirrors the statutory language in P.L. 108-446 . However, the regulations do make several additions. For example, regarding the procedural safeguards notice, ED clarifies that a procedural safeguards notice must be provided upon receipt of the first filing of a state complaint or request for a due process hearing in a school year, not just the first request at any point in the child's education. In addition, ED attempts to reduce the confusion about the distinctions between a due process complaint and a complaint under the state complaint procedures by requiring that the procedural safeguards notice explain the differences between the two procedures, including the jurisdiction of the procedures, the issues that may be raised, filing and decisional time lines and relevant procedures. ED has provided a model procedural safeguards notice on its website."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mediation", "paragraphs": ["Several changes were made by ED regarding the manner in which mediators are chosen. The previous regulations provided that the states shall maintain a list of individuals who are qualified mediators and knowledgeable about special education and that if the mediator is not selected on a rotational basis from the list, both parties must be involved in selecting the mediator. The new regulations keep the listed requirements but also require that the SEA must select mediators on a random, rotational or other impartial basis, and delete the language regarding involvement by the other party. ED noted in its discussion of this section that \"[t]hese provisions are sufficient to ensure that the selection of the mediator is not biased, while providing SEAs additional flexibility in selecting mediators. Selecting mediators on an impartial basis would include permitting the parties involved in a dispute to agree on a mediator.\" The final regulations eliminate a provision relating to the signing of confidentiality pledges prior to the commencement of mediation. ED observed that this removal was \"not intended to prevent States from allowing parties to sign a confidentiality pledge to ensure that discussions during the mediation process remain confidential, irrespective of whether the mediation results in a resolution.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-Attorney Representation in Due Process Hearings", "paragraphs": ["One of the changes made in the December 2009 regulations relates to the use of lay advocates. Currently, IDEA provides that any party to a hearing under Part B of IDEA has \"the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities.\" However, neither the Act nor previous regulations addressed the issue of whether individuals with special knowledge, but who are not attorneys, may represent parties at due process hearings. In a 1981 letter from Theodore Sky, Acting General Counsel of the Department of Education, to the Honorable Frank B. Brouillet, the Department had previously interpreted Section 615(h) of the Act and implementing regulations as allowing both attorneys and non-attorneys to perform the same functions at due process hearings. However, ED specifically rejected this previous interpretation.", "In 2000, a decision by the Delaware Supreme Court in In the Matter of Arons , held that a lay advocate who represented families of children with disabilities in due process hearings had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. A 2006 survey found that ten states, like Delaware, prohibit lay advocates from representing parents, twelve states permit lay advocates, twenty one states have no official policy, and eight states leave the matter to the hearing officer. This survey also noted a shortage of \"readily affordable attorneys\" to represent parents, and that the \"availability of specialized lay advocates has not been nearly sufficient to close the gap.\" The issue regarding representation by lay advocates had prompted attempts to add statutory language authorizing lay advocates during the last IDEA reauthorization (culminating in P.L. 108-446 ), but language in the House bill ( H.R. 1350 , 108 th Cong.) was deleted in conference. The December 2008 regulations change the previous interpretation by ED which allowed the use of lay advocates at due process hearings. The regulations allow the right to be accompanied and advised by counsel and by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities, but add an exception stating that \"whether parents have the right to be represented by non-attorneys at due process hearings is determined under State law.\" The Department stated that \"[g]iven that the Act is silent regarding the representational role of non-attorneys in IDEA due process hearings, the issue of whether non-attorneys may 'represent' parties to a due process hearing is a matter that is left, by the statute, to each State to decide.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resolution Session", "paragraphs": ["ED provides guidance regarding the new statutory requirement for a resolution session in its regulations. For example, the regulations state that unless the parties have jointly agreed to waive the resolution process or to use mediation, the failure of the parent filing the due process complaint to participate in the resolution session will delay the timeline for the resolution session and due process hearing until the resolution session is held. If the parent refuses to participate in the resolution session, the regulations provide that the LEA may request that the hearing officer dismiss the parent's due process complaint. Similarly, a parent may seek intervention by a hearing officer if the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting within 15 days of receiving notice or fails to participate in the resolution session. The regulations also specifically discuss when the timeline for the due process hearing starts. One of the issues commenters on the proposed regulations had raised concerning the resolution session was whether the discussions were confidential. ED declined to discuss this issue in the regulations since the statute is silent but noted that \"nothing in the Act or these regulations ... would prohibit the parties from entering into a confidentiality agreement as part of their resolution agreement.

However, in the comments to the regulations, ED did observe that certain factors, such as a child's disciplinary history, ability to understand consequences, expression of remorse, and supports provided to the child prior to the violation, could be unique circumstances.

The 2006 regulations add a subsection stating that where a child has been removed for more than 10 school days in the same school year, and the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not a change of placement, school personnel, in consultation with the child's teacher or teachers, determine the extent to which services are needed so as to enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum.

An LEA is not required to provide children suspended for more than 10 school days in a school year for disciplinary reasons, exactly the same services in exactly the same settings as they were receiving prior to the imposition of discipline.
