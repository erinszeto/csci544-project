In many Administrations, the President has concurrently appointed the OSTP Director to the position of Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), a position which allows for the provision of confidential advice to the President on matters of science and technology. While Congress can require the OSTP Director to testify, the APST may decline requests to testify on the basis of separation of powers or executive privilege. The APST manages the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), an interagency body established by Executive Order 12881 that coordinates science and technology (S&T) policy across the federal government. The APST also co-chairs the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), a council of external advisors established by Executive Order 13539 that provides advice to the President. Executive Order 13708 continued PCAST through September 30, 2017. As of August 2017, President Trump had not named a director of OSTP or an APST.", "Several recurrent OSTP issues face Congress: the need for science advice within the EOP; the title, rank, and responsibilities of the OSTP Director; the policy areas for OSTP focus; the funding and staffing for OSTP; the roles and functions of OSTP and NSTC in setting federal science and technology policy; and the status and influence of PCAST. Some in the S&T community support raising the OSTP Director to Cabinet rank, contending that this would imbue the position with greater influence within the EOP. Others have proposed that the OSTP Director play a greater role in federal agency coordination, priority setting, and budget allocation. Both the Administration and Congress have identified areas of policy focus for OSTP staff, raising questions of prioritization and oversight. Some experts say NSTC has insufficient authority over federal agencies engaged in science and technology activities and that PCAST has insufficient influence on S&T policy; they question the overall coordination of federal science and technology activities. Finally, some in the scientific community support increasing the authority of the OSTP Director in the budget process to bring greater science and technology expertise to federal investment decision making."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["H istorically, advice to the President was provided through advisors and boards without statutory authorities.

Starting in the early 1930s, Presidents attempted to expand their sources of S&T advice through advisory boards and committees. Lacking a statutory foundation, these boards and committees tended to lack permanency, as subsequent Presidents often disbanded them. When again faced with the need for S&T advice, Presidents would form new advisory boards or committees, sometimes reconstituted from previously disbanded ones.", "In the years leading up to World War II, the importance of research and development (R&D) to the nation's economic and military strength became increasingly evident. As a result, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) in 1941. The federal R&D enterprise is widely credited with contributing substantially to the Allied victory in World War II, as well as to the development of subsequent U.S. industrial strength. In November 1944, President Roosevelt wrote a letter to OSRD Director Vannevar Bush seeking recommendations on how research and the research infrastructure established to support America's war effort could be \"profitably employed in times of peace.\" Bush's response, Science: The Endless Frontier , laid out a framework that asserted the essential role of scientific progress in meeting the nation's economic, national security, and social needs. Experts widely view the Bush report as foundational to today's U.S. science and technology policy.", "Subsequent Presidents used a variety of mechanisms to obtain S&T advice within the EOP, to enhance interagency coordination, and to receive counsel from outside advisors. The primary provision of advice to the President on science and technology issues continued through advisors and assistants to the President who continued to perform this function without statutory authorities. Organizations within the EOP included the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (Eisenhower) and the Office of Science and Technology (OST; Kennedy, Johnson). Organizations focused on interagency coordination included the President's Scientific Research Board (Truman), the Federal Council for Science and Technology (FCST; Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon), and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET; Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush). External advisory committees included the Science Advisory Committee (Truman, Eisenhower), and the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC; Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon).", "In 1973, President Nixon abolished the Office of Science and Technology. The National Science Foundation (NSF) assumed its civilian functions and the National Security Council (NSC) its security functions. In addition, President Nixon opted not to appoint new members to PSAC after accepting the pro forma resignation of its members. With this backdrop, President Ford chose to establish OSTP through legislation, rather than executive order. The National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 ( P.L. 94-282 ) established OSTP and the position of OSTP Director. President Ford signed it into law on May 11, 1976. ", "The creation of OSTP provided a new structure for the provision of science and technology policy advice to the President, but did not end Presidents' authority to appoint advisors in parallel. The OSTP director is a statutory position; the authority to appoint others to assist the President exists solely with the President. Thus, a President may opt to appoint the OSTP director to also serve as an assistant to the President, may concurrently appoint another individual to serve as Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (APST), or may appoint no one to serve as APST. This also raised new and continuing questions with respect to coordination of advice.", " Appendix A provides a historical compilation of presidential S&T policy advisors with their titles, EOP S&T agencies/offices, interagency coordination organizations, and advisory committees.

If appointed early in a new Administration, some experts in the S&T community contend, the individual filling the APST position could help identify and recruit the best scientists, engineers, health professionals, and other public policy professionals for the S&T policy-related presidential appointments.", "Additionally, some contend that an APST/OSTP Director with Cabinet rank would have greater access to the President and other senior Administration staff. They assert that Cabinet rank would enhance the OSTP Director's authority and influence in incorporating scientific and technical viewpoints into Administration decision making. Others contend that the issue of Cabinet rank for the APST/OSTP Director status would be unlikely to substantially improve the APST/OSTP Director's role and influence in EOP activities, including Cabinet meetings.

Scientists, engineers, and S&T policy professionals\u2014both within and outside of the federal government\u2014play a substantial role in providing S&T input to federal policy decision making in areas such as R&D, regulation, procurement, and standards development. ", "Other experts assert that the organization of the White House determines the S&T advisor's status and access. According to this perspective, if the President relies primarily on a group of White House staff members for advice, the advisor should be the APST. Conversely, if the Cabinet is the primary source of advice, then the science advisor should be made a member of the Cabinet. From this perspective, the title itself is less important than the access to the President that it provides.

For example, the S&T community has debated the utility of having two different individuals serve as APST and OSTP Director.
