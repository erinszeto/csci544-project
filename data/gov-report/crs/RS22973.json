The passage of the reauthorization of the North Korean Human Rights Act in October 2008 (P.L. 110-346) reasserted congressional interest in influencing executive branch policy toward North Korea. In addition to reauthorizing funding at original levels, the bill expresses congressional criticism of the implementation of the original 2004 law and adjusts some of the provisions relating to the Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea and the U.S. resettlement of North Korean refugees. Some outside analysts have pointed to the challenges of highlighting North Korea's human rights violations in the midst of the ongoing nuclear negotiations, as well as the difficulty in effectively reaching North Korean refugees as outlined in the law. Further, the law may complicate coordination on North Korea with China and South Korea. At this point, it remains unclear what focus the Obama Administration will place on human rights and refugees as it takes over the nuclear negotiations.

The Bush Administration initially highlighted and later de-emphasized Pyongyang's human rights record as its policy on nuclear weapons negotiations evolved. Congress has consistently drawn attention to North Korean human rights violations on a bipartisan basis. On several occasions, Congress has criticized the executive branch for its approach to these issues, through tough questioning of Administration witnesses during multiple hearings and through written letters of protest to high-level officials. Although the Obama Administration has indicated that it will seek to continue the nuclear negotiations, it has not indicated how the issue of human rights will be addressed.", "The passage of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 ( H.R. 4011 ; P.L. 108 - 333 ; and 22 U.S.C. 7801.) and its reauthorization in 2008 ( H.R. 5834 , P.L. 110 - 346 ) serve as the most prominent examples of legislative action on these issues. The legislation both reinforced some aspects of the Bush Administration's rhetoric on North Korea and expresses dissatisfaction with other elements of its policy on North Korea. The reauthorization bill explicitly criticizes the implementation of the original law and reasserts Congressional interest in adopting human rights as a major priority in U.S. policy toward North Korea.", "U.S. attention to North Korean human rights and refugees is complicated by the geopolitical sensitivities of East Asia. China is wary of U.S. involvement in the issue and chafes at any criticism based on human rights. South Korea also had reservations about a more active U.S. role, particularly in terms of refugees, although the current Lee administration in Seoul has been more amenable to such efforts. Both want to avoid a massive outflow of refugees, which they believe could trigger instability or the collapse of North Korea. U.S. executive branch officials worry that criticism of how Seoul and Beijing approach North Korea's human rights violations could disrupt the multilateral negotiations to deal with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programs. North Korean refugees seeking resettlement often transit through other Asian countries, raising diplomatic, refugee, and security concerns for those governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Human Rights in U.S. Policy Toward North Korea under the Bush Administration", "paragraphs": ["In the first several years of the Bush Administration, high-level officials, including the President and Secretary of State, publicly and forcefully criticized the regime in Pyongyang for its human rights practices. As efforts to push forward the Six-Party talks accelerated in 2007, the Administration did not propose any negotiations with North Korea over human rights but asserted that human rights is one of several issues to be settled with North Korea after the nuclear issue is resolved. The Six-Party Agreement of February 13, 2007, calls for the United States and North Korea to \"start bilateral talks aimed at resolving bilateral issues and moving toward full diplomatic relations.\" Prior to the Agreement in 2007, the Bush Administration held that it would not agree to normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea until there was progress on human rights (presumably including refugees) and other issues. However, after the signing of the agreement in February 2007, some observers say that former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Christopher Hill focused exclusively on a satisfactory settlement of the nuclear issue.

Passage of the legislation was driven by the argument that the United States has a moral responsibility to stand up for human rights for those suffering under repressive regimes. Advocates claim that, in addition to alleviating a major humanitarian crisis, the NKHRA will ultimately enhance stability in Northeast Asia by promoting international cooperation to deal with the problem of North Korean refugees. Critics say the legislation risks upsetting relations with South Korea and China, and ultimately the diplomatic unity necessary to make North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program through the Six-Party Talks.

He attended international conferences dedicated to raising awareness of human rights abuses in North Korea and testified at multiple congressional hearings. As the Korean-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was negotiated, he raised questions about labor practices at the Kaesong complex, an industrial park located in North Korea in which a consortium of South Korean firms employ North Korean labor.

State Department officials say that given the tight security in place at U.S. facilities abroad, unexpected stormings could result in injury or death for the refugees. Secondly, granting of asylum status to North Korean refugees involves a complex vetting process that is further complicated by the fact that the applicants originate from a state with which the United States does not have official relations.

In years past, South Korea had usually abstained from voting on United Nations resolutions calling for improvement in North Korea's human rights practices. At the U.N. Human Rights Council meeting in March 2008, however, South Korea voted for a similar resolution. Lee has also conditioned fertilizer and food aid on improved access to the North's distribution systems to ensure that such aid is not going only to Pyongyang's elite and military. This approach has contributed to a considerable chill in North-South relations since Lee took office.
