By law, the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries was to be graduallyreduced to 5% over the years 1994 through 2002; FEPCA requires that amounts payable may not beless than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5% in January 2004.

Thepayment recommended for the Washington, DC, pay area was 28.78%. Because the new localityrate replaces the existing locality rate, the change in locality rates is derived by comparing 2003locality payments with those recommended for 2004.

Under the law, the BLS conducts surveys that document non-federal rates of pay in each pay area. Currently, there are 32 pay areas nationwide. Until October 1996, the surveys were conducted underthe Occupational Compensation Survey Program (OCSP), which had been approved by the FederalSalary Council and the Pay Agent. Since then, the surveys had been conducted under the NationalCompensation Survey (NCS) program, which was not approved for use with the January 2000,January 2001, January 2002, and January 2003 locality payments. For the January 2004 localitypayments, a phase-in of NCS survey data was approved. The survey results are submitted to OPM,which serves as the staff to the Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent. OPM documents federalrates of pay in each of the pay areas and compares non-federal and GS salaries, by grade, for eachpay area. The average salaries at each grade, both federal and non-federal, are then aggregated andcompared to determine an overall average percentage pay gap for each area. By law, the disparitybetween non-federal and federal salaries is to be reduced to 5%. Therefore, the overall averagepercentage pay gap for each pay area is adjusted to this level each year by OPM. This adjusted gapis called the target gap.", "FEPCA also stipulates that a certain percentage of the target gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries in each pay area is to be closed each year. Twenty percent of thegap was closed in 1994, the first year of locality pay, as authorized by FEPCA. An additional 10%of the gap was to be closed each year thereafter, meaning that 30% of the gap was to be closed in1995, 40% in 1996, 50% in 1997, 60% in 1998, 70% in 1999, 80% in 2000, and 90% in 2001. Ineach of these years, the locality pay increase has been implemented at a much lower percentage,reducing the gap slowly; 23.5% of the gap was closed in 1995, 25.9% in 1996, 28.3% in 1997,29.2% in 1998, 31% in 1999, 33.5% in 2000, 38.1% in 2001, 42.3% in 2002, and 44% in 2003. These percentages represent the gap as recalculated after each adjustment. By January 2002, andcontinuing each year thereafter, FEPCA specified that amounts payable could not be less than thefull amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the target gap to 5%. This percentage is appliedto the target gap in each pay area to determine the locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent tothe President, after receiving advice from the Federal Salary Council. (23)", "The pay gaps on which the locality payments are based are 22 months old by the effective date of the adjustment; thus, March 2002 gaps determine the January 2004 locality payments. Due to thefact that the NCS surveys were not approved for use in determining the January 2000, January 2001,January 2002, and January 2003 locality payments, and that the NCS surveys are being phased in forthe January 2004 locality payments, the gaps were determined as follows. The March 2002 gapswere determined by using the most recent OCSP survey data and NCS survey data, which rangedfrom December 2000 through October 2001 for each pay area. Since the BLS had discontinued theOCSP program in October 1996, the OCSP pay survey data for some of the largest pay areas wereat least seven years old. Specifically, the New York data were as of July 1995; the Washington, DC,data were as of October 1995; and the Los Angeles data were as of November 1995. Survey datafor each of the other 28 pay areas varied from January 1996 to November 1996. The data for the\"Rest of the United States\" pay area were as of November 1995 and aged to November 1996. In itsreport to the Pay Agent on the 2004 locality payments, the Federal Salary Council explained howthe pay gaps were determined, stating that \"To ensure that local pay disparities are measured as ofone common date, it is necessary to 'age' the BLS survey data [using the ECI] to a commonreference date [March 2002] before comparing it to GS pay data of the same date.\" (24)", "Report of the Federal Salary Council. The council reported the following results from the application of this methodology. As of March 2002,the overall gap between GS average salaries (excluding existing locality payments, special rates, andcertain other payments) and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. The amount needed to reducethis disparity to 5%, as mandated by FEPCA, averaged 25.73% for 2004.", "In order to meet the target for closing the pay gap, the council recommended locality pay raises ranging from 19.45% in the \"Rest of the United States\" (RUS) pay area to 47.64% in the SanFrancisco pay area. The payment recommended for the Washington, DC, pay area was 28.78%. (25) Because the new locality rate replaces the existing locality rate, the change in locality rates is derivedby comparing 2003 locality payments with those recommended for 2004. This comparison resultedin recommended increases in locality rates from 2003 to 2004 of 11.90% in the RUS pay area to25.23% in the San Francisco pay area, and 17.31% in the Washington, DC, pay area. Thenationwide average net pay increase, if the ECI and locality-based comparability payments weregranted as required by law, would have been 15.15% in 2004.", "As in previous years, the council recommended that areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in RUS receive the same adjustment as RUS. Under the methodology which has been used sincelocality pay was first implemented in 1994, areas with low publishability (did not meet BLSstandards for publishing data) and pay gaps that were two-tenths of a percentage point (0.2%) ormore below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas, and theresources used to conduct these surveys were to be redirected to new survey locations. The council,as it has done the last four years, recommended that these pay areas again be included with RUS in2004.", "Since not all of the improvements have been completed in NCS and because the list of cities below RUS varies depending on whether we use OCSP or NCSdata, we recommend that none of these locations [Indianapolis, Kansas City, Orlando, St. Louis] bedropped as separate pay areas at this time. The Council plans to consider whether some of theseareas should be dropped and the resources used to increase the sample in other locations or used toadd a few new locality pay surveys. (26)", "Basic criteria used to determine whether a county or installation would be included as part of a pay area for purposes of applying locality pay were established by the council in 1993 and remainunchanged. In its report, the council notes that \"In 2000 and 2001, the Council concluded that itwould recommend no changes in locality pay area definitions until it had an opportunity to reviewnew commuting pattern and population data from the 2000 census and the new metropolitan areadefinitions to be produced by the Census Bureau and OMB in 2003.\" (27) Other criteria which wouldremain unchanged are that a county be contiguous to a pay area, contain at least 2,000 GSemployees, and demonstrate some economic linkage with the pay area. The council recommendedan exception, however, in the case of Barnstable County, MA, which was seeking to become an areaof application to the Boston pay area. According to the council, Barnstable County", "is the only county on the eastern seaboard from southern Maine to Delaware that is not in a separate locality pay area. It is also cut off from the remainderof the country by the Boston locality pay area and passes all our criteria except that it does not have2,000 GS employees. While we do not believe this is the time to make wholesale changes in localityarea boundaries, the Council concluded that something should be done for Barnstable County. Therefore, the Council as a whole voted at its October 1 meeting to recommend that the Pay Agentmake an exception and include Barnstable County, MA, in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 inorder to remedy what we consider to be an egregious situation. The Vice Chair of the Councildissented from this recommendation. (28)", "Since 1994, St. Mary's County, MD, has been included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD, pay area. It continues to meet the county criteria, and the council recommended that it be includedwith this pay area for 2004. Santa Barbara County, CA, has been included in the Los Angeles payarea since 1994, and New London, CT, has been included in the Hartford, CT, pay area since 1998. Employment in New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA, again has fallen below thethreshold of 2,000 employees that one criterion requires. The council recommended in 1997,however, \"that once an area of application has been approved, it should not be removed for theduration of FEPCA's nine-year phase-in for the locality pay program (1994 through 2002).\" (29) Therefore, the council recommended that New London and Santa Barbara continue to be areas ofapplication for their respective pay areas for 2004. The council noted that \"new census data willsoon be available that will affect locality pay area definitions in the future\" and \"the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) and the Census Bureau are revamping how metropolitan areas aredefined.\" According to the council, it \"plan[s] to conduct a major review of all aspects of the localitypay program [in 2003] when this new information is available. (30) (See the discussion under\"Definition of Metropolitan Areas\" below.) Monterey County, CA, which became an area ofapplication to the San Francisco pay area in 2001, meets the criteria and is recommended to beincluded with this pay area in 2004.", "The State of Rhode Island was designated as an area of application to the Boston pay area beginning in 2001. Because counties in Rhode Island are small in comparison to counties in otherstates, Rhode Island cannot meet the requirement that a county contain at least 2,000 GS employees. Therefore, the council recommended that \"Full State\" criteria be adopted in this case. Under therecommended criteria, \"States smaller than 115 percent of the average county size in square milesin the lower 48 states and Washington, DC, are treated as a single county for applying the countycriteria.\" Thus, Rhode Island is \"considered as a single county.\" (31) The state meets the criteria andis recommended for continued inclusion with the Boston pay area in 2004.", "As for the criteria for an installation, the portion of a federal facility that crosses pay area boundaries, and that is not in the pay area, must have at least 1,000 GS employees; the duty station(s)of the majority of GS employees must be within 10 miles of the prime-critical survey boundary area;and a significant number of the facility's employees must be commuting from the pay area. Since1994, a portion of Edwards Air Force Base has been included in the Los Angeles pay area. The baseno longer meets the employment criteria, but the council recommended that it continue to beincluded with the Los Angeles pay area in 2004 for the same reasons that New London and SantaBarbara were recommended to continue as areas of application.", "Methodology. (32) The council, in its report to the PayAgent on the 2001 locality payments, recommended that five improvements be made in the BLSNational Compensation Survey program. The council's memorandum to the Pay Agent on the 2004locality payments provided a progress report. Listed according to their levels of priority, theimprovements and progress to date are as follow.", "Use three-factors, rather than nine, to assign the correct federal grade level to the non-federal jobs surveyed, and provide grade level guides for occupational families. \"OPM hascompleted development of a four-factor evaluation system for use in the surveys, and BLS hassuccessfully used the new approach in field tests. BLS will begin to phase the new approach intoBLS surveys in December 2003.\"", "Develop a model to estimate missing data. \"BLS has designed and implemented an econometric model to estimate salaries for jobs not randomly selected in thesurveys.\"", "Improve the matching of federal survey jobs with non-federal survey jobs, and provide subcategories for occupations which are \"not elsewhere classified.\" \"OPM formed aninteragency working group that developed a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and thenew Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS used the new crosswalk and March 2001GS employment weights for data delivered this year ....

Adjust the grade level based on the level of supervision, instead of grading the supervisory job itself.\"BLS and Pay Agent staffs have designed a new approach based on grading the highest level of worksupervised and adding one, two, or three grades based on the level of supervision. Final tests of thenew approach are to be conducted this fall, and BLS hopes to be ready to implement the methodsin surveys conducted in December 2003.\"", "Develop criteria to identify and exclude jobs that would be classified above GS-15 in government. \"BLS has developed methods for identifying and excluding non-Federal jobsthat would be classified above GS-15. These data were excluded from the data delivered to the PayAgent this year.\" (33)", "The council's report on the 2004 locality payments stated that while it \"recommended the phase-in of NCS data beginning with locality payments in 2004, [it] continue[s] to have concernsabout the reliability of data produced by the NCS.\" The council recommended that", "[A]ny further implementation of (or additional weight given to) the NCS data must be expressly conditioned on action by BLS to implement the remainingtwo improvements identified by the Council.", "[A]dditional resources should be committed by BLS to increase the sample size of its surveys, particularly in those localities where the NCS data indicatea pay gap that is more than 5 percentage points below the gap measured using OCSP data, or, at aminimum, conducting \"augmentation surveys\" for areas under-represented in BLSsamples. (34)", "Definition of Metropolitan Areas. The component parts of the 32 locality pay areas are determined by using the OMB definitions of metropolitan areas.Whenever OMB revised the definitions, the locality pay areas changed automatically. On April 22,2003, OPM published final regulations which provide that locality pay areas no longer changeautomatically when the definitions of metropolitan areas change. (35) On June 6, 2003, OMB publishedrevised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) based on new criteria and 2000 censusdata. (36) At the time, OPM advised that the newdefinitions would", "have no immediate or automatic impact on the GeneralSchedule (GS) locality pay program. As a result of previous recommendations made by the FederalSalary Council, ... OPM recently modified the GS locality pay regulations to maintain themetropolitan area portion of each locality pay area consistent with the former OMB statistical areadefinitions. This will provide the Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent ... anopportunity to review the new statistical area definitions before making recommendations anddecisions later [in 2003]. (37)", "Some of the major changes that the council and the Pay Agent considered in autumn 2003 were these:", "The new statistical area definitions are different than the ones that have been used in [the] locality pay program since it was created in the early 1990s. The concept of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' which is used to define 18 locality payareas, is no longer used. New concepts -- 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined StatisticalAreas [CSAs] -- have been introduced. Population density is no longer a criterion for evaluatingoutlying counties and the threshold levels of commuting in or out of a core area have beenchanged. (38)", "A Federal Salary Council working group reviewed the new OMB definitions, commuting patterns, and other changes, and reports of the working group were discussed at two council meetingsthat were open to the public. At the first meeting conducted on September 3, 2003, the workinggroup presented its initial findings. According to the group's report, it \"recommends that theCouncil seriously consider using the new MSA definitions in some fashion for the locality payprogram\" and \"asks that no decisions be made until the next public meeting because additional studyis needed.\" (39) The report stated that, \"If the FederalSalary Council were to recommend that the newCSAs and MSAs be used for locality pay areas without any modifications, excluding the locality payareas in New England (Boston, Hartford, and part of New York), a total of 83 additional countieswould be added to existing metropolitan locality pay areas, and 10 counties currently in separatemetropolitan locality pay areas would be excluded (13 counties including pay areas in NewEngland).\" (40)", "At a second council meeting conducted on October 7, 2003, the working group recommended \"that the Council adopt the new MSA definitions as the basic definitions for locality pay areas,acknowledging that changes in MSAs are the result of both changes in demographics and changesin the criteria for establishing MSAs.\" (41) Withregard to the January 2005 pay adjustments, theworking group recommended that the largest defined areas, called Combined Statistical Areas(CSAs), be used; that the pay area definitions be revised (which in some pay areas expands thenumber of communities covered); and that three current discrete pay areas (Kansas City, Orlando,and St. Louis) with pay gaps below RUS be folded into RUS, and the resulting savings in resourcesbe used to survey other areas. (42) The counciladopted the working group recommendations in itsreport to the Pay Agent, which in turn tentatively approved the council's recommendations in itsreport to the President, on the January 2005 pay adjustments. (43) In 2004, OPM will publish theproposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register and solicit public comments on thosechanges.", "An amendment to H.R. 2989 , Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004, offered by Representative Sam Farr was agreedto by voice vote by the House of Representatives on September 4, 2003.

Earlier, during markupof the bill by the House Committee on Appropriations, a similar amendment proposed byRepresentative Sam Farr was withdrawn after the Committee chairman, Representative ErnestIstook, agreed to work with Representative Farr on the issue.

For about 85 percent of those federal employees their pay lagged behind private salaries by morethan 20 percent. By contrast, about 30 percent of federal employees in selected technical and clericaloccupations held jobs with salaries above those paid by private firms. In general, jobs in technicaland clerical occupations showed much smaller differences in pay between federal and privateworkers. About three-quarters of federal employees in this analysis held jobs in those occupationswith salaries that were within 10 percent, plus or minus, of privatelevels.

Thus, even if the currentsystem was fully implemented as envisioned in FEPCA, it would fail in its aim to provide federalpay that was comparable to pay for nonfederal jobs. Granting the same percentage raise to allworkers in an area will result in above-market salaries for some occupational groups andbelow-market salaries for others. Moreover, the jobs that show the greatest pay disadvantage forfederal workers make up an increasing share of the federal workforce.
