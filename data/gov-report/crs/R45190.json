The U.S. Code has its roots in an 1866 law that initiated a project to \"revise, simplify, arrange, and consolidate all statutes of the United States, general and permanent in their nature....\" This endeavor was not fully realized until 1874, when the Revised Statutes of 1874 became the first official codification of U.S. laws. A second edition making corrections and updates followed in 1878. However, despite numerous efforts to supplement and revise inaccuracies in the Revised Statutes , the publication contained errors. The Revised Statutes were also not updated regularly, making it difficult to know if a particular law had been amended. In 1919, work on a new codification project began, but it was not until 1926 that what is today known as the United States Code came to exist. ", "The U.S. Code has been published by the GPO every six years since its initial publication in 1926. The current edition of the U.S. Code was printed in 2012 and is updated annually with cumulative print supplements. In the U.S. C ode , statutes are grouped by subject matter into 54 titles and five appendices. Each title is organized into chapters and then sections, which is how a particular provision is cited (e.g., 27 U.S.C. \u00a7124 refers to Section 124 of Title 27). Source credits and historical notes at the end of each section provide additional information, including the statutory origin of the provision, its effective date, a brief citation, discussion of any amendments, and cross references to related provisions. It is important to note that generally, the U.S. Code is an unofficial restatement of the Statutes at Large organized by topic for ease of access. As discussed further below, the exception to this general rule is when a particular title of the U.S. Code has been enacted into positive law. ", "The Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC) of the U.S. House of Representatives is responsible for maintaining and publishing the U.S. Code . The OLRC oversees the organization of statutes by subject matter, assigning a statute to a U.S. Code section if the law has general applicability and permanence. If a provision is not intended to be permanent or does not have relevance to a wide audience, the OLRC may not include that language in the U.S. Code, or the OLRC may classify the provision as a statutory note or appendix to an existing U.S. Code section. Language enacted as part of government appropriations measures is a common instance of this; for example, provisions appropriating funds to the Office of Highway Administration each fiscal year are not likely to be codified because, by their own terms, they govern for only one year. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that whether a provision is codified or classified as a note or appendix in no way diminishes the statute's significance or authority. Provisions that are not codified in the U.S. Code are still acts of Congress. ", "The language of a law as set forth in the U.S. Code is not necessarily a literal duplication of the law as it was enacted. Because the U.S. Code is arranged by subject, a slip law is often divided up among titles, with different sections of a slip law being assigned to different volumes, chapters and sections of the U.S. Code . There may also be slight changes from the original statute, particularly with regard to section numbers and cross-references, corresponding to U.S. Code sections, not statute sections. The most notable difference between the U.S. Code and the Statutes at Large , however, is that language in the U.S. Code exists as amended to reflect subsequent changes made by later laws."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Amended Laws", "paragraphs": ["When a bill becomes a law, the OLRC will examine whether the law has any non-amendatory or \"freestanding\" provisions to introduce to the Code, or any language that revises, repeals, or adds to already existing statutes. Consider the following sequence of enactments.", "In 1952, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA generally consolidated and amended federal statutory law on the admission and removal of aliens in the United States and the terms under which they may become U.S. citizens. The INA was codified at 8 U.S.C . \u00a7\u00a71 et seq. In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA). Section 101 of IRCA amended the INA by adding new \u00a7274A to the statute. The amendment to the INA is reflected in 8 U.S.C. \u00a71324a, which was added in 1986. The amending action can be seen in the historical notes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a71324a, which read: \"June 27, 1952, ch. 477, Title II, Ch. 8, \u00a7274A, as added Nov. 6, 1986, P.L. 99-603 [...].\" The \"as added\" segment indicates that \u00a7274A did not originate in 1952, but was added to the INA on November 6, 1986. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). Section 412 of IIRIRA amended \u00a7274A of the INA. Section 412 of IIRIRA specifically amended 8 U.S.C . \u00a71324a(b)(1), by striking certain clauses, adding new language, and inserting additional subparagraphs to the existing statute.", "As the above sequence illustrates, the canvas upon which Congress typically works is the existing realm of federal statutes, and not a blank slate. To that end, it is usually more effective to consult the U.S. Code for the current language of a statute than it is to consult either the slip law or the Statutes at Large , both of which are essentially frozen in their respective times. ", "It can be difficult for a researcher to find amended public laws with up-to-date language, but there are resources available. The House of Representatives' Office of the Legislative Counsel assembles compilations of statutes that are not codified in the U.S. Code or are found in a title that has not been enacted into positive law. Congressional committees and federal agencies may periodically issue similar compilations of amended public laws, especially for statutes significant to their respective jurisdictions. For example, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice provides access to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, As Amended, which includes changes made by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 to the 1990 law. Additionally, commercial publishers may track changes to existing law by recently enacted legislation. For instance, the commercial database CQ LawTrack notes and lists changes made by each new law to prior laws, though it does not aggregate the text of the amended law itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Positive Versus Non-Positive Law Titles of the U.S. Code", "paragraphs": ["In 1947, Congress began enacting whole titles of the U.S. Code into law, generally repealing the underlying statutes. When Congress does this, the authoritative legal language is no longer the slip law that enacted it, but the language as presented in a U.S. Code title. This process is known as \"positive law codification\" and the titles that have been enacted are \"positive law titles.\" ", "Why would Congress go through the effort of reenacting laws already in force? According to the OLRC, the U.S. Code is an effective and valuable tool for researching and verifying general and permanent laws, and \"positive law codification improves the usefulness of the Code in a number of significant ways.\" These include", "improving the organization of a title; restating laws using consistent language and styles; eliminating obsolete provisions; resolving ambiguous language; correcting technical errors; and establishing titles as legal evidence of the law so that they are more authoritative in federal and state courts than the Statutes at Large . Non-positive law titles are considered prima facie evidence of the Statutes at Large and may be refuted by the underlying statute should there be a disparity between the two statutes.", "The process of positive law codification is a meticulous and time-consuming endeavor; consequently, not all titles have undergone the process. At present there are 27 positive law titles, which are identified with an asterisk on the OLRC's U.S. Code \"Search & Browse\" page.", "For a researcher, one of the most obvious differences between positive and non-positive law titles is the difference in the history of the enacting laws. In non-positive law titles, the first act listed in the history source credits is what the OLRC terms the \"base law,\" or the act that originated that particular U.S. Code section. For example, 2 U.S.C. \u00a71 reads,", "Time for election of Senators .", "At the regular election held in any State next preceding the expiration of the term for which any Senator was elected to represent such State in Congress, at which election a Representative to Congress is regularly by law to be chosen, a United States Senator from said State shall be elected by the people thereof for the term commencing on the 3d day of January next thereafter.", "(June 4, 1914, ch. 103, \u00a71, 38 Stat. 384; June 5, 1934, ch. 390, \u00a73, 48 Stat. 879.)", "The base law for 2 U.S.C. \u00a71 is the Act of June 4, 1914, ch. 103, 38 Stat. 384. In other words, the Act of June 4, 1914 created the language that currently occupies 2 U.S.C. \u00a71. The opening clause of the Act of June 4, 1914 reads, \"An act Providing a temporary method of conducting the nomination and election of United States Senators.\"", "However, in positive law titles, the history source credits convey different information. For example, 3 U.S.C. \u00a77 reads:", "Meeting and vote of electors .", "The electors of President and Vice President of each State shall meet and give their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December next following their appointment at such place in each State as the legislature of such State shall direct.", "(June 25, 1948, ch. 644, 62 Stat. 673.)", "Here, the Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 644, 62 Stat. 673 is not the base law for 3 U.S.C. \u00a77, because this Act did not create the language of Section 7. Rather, this Act codified and enacted the entirety of Title 3 into positive law. The opening clause of this Act reads, \"An Act To codify and enact into law Title 3 of the United States Code, entitled 'The President.'\" In other words, every section contained in Title 3 has \"Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 644\" as the enacting law in the source credits because the underlying statutes that individually created the whole of Title 3 have been repealed. Accordingly, for a researcher who needs to cite the authoritative language of a section, the words of the section itself will be sufficient. However, a researcher who is looking for the history of the language itself and is perhaps interested in the intent behind its enactment, must take additional steps to locate such information.", "A researcher seeking information on the history or intent of the language in positive law titles of the U.S. Code should examine the \"Front Matter\" located at the very beginning of the title, preceding the legal language. This preface includes a table showing the disposition of all sections of the former title, including where the new sections were previously located, and the original source credits. In the previous example, prior to the process of positive law codification, the language of 3 U.S.C. \u00a77 was located at 3 U.S.C. \u00a75, and the original base law was the Act of February 3, 1887, ch. 90, 24 Stat. 373.
