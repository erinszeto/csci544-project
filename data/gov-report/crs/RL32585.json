In statute, \"SAWs\" were defined in two ways. First, certain firearms were defined as SAWs by make and model. Second, other firearms were defined as SAWs, if they included specified features. For example, a rifle was defined as a SAW if it was able to accept a detachable magazine and included at least two of the following features: (1) a folding/telescoping stock; (2) a protruding pistol grip; (3) a bayonet mount; (4) a muzzle flash suppressor or threaded barrel capable of accepting such a device; or (5) a grenade launcher. There were similar definitions for pistols and shotguns. Bills were introduced to extend the ban (S. 2190, S. 2498), make it permanent (S. 1034), or expand it to include other \"military style\" firearms (H.R. 2038/S. 1431).", "A key consideration for Congress is whether violent gun crimes, particularly crimes involving multiple gunshot victims and gunshot wounds per victim, were reduced by the ban. Proponents of the ban maintain that firearm trace data strongly suggest that the use of SAWs in crime had declined since the ban took effect. Opponents of the ban contend that firearm trace data are unreliable indicators of criminal gun use based on statements by federal agencies and leading researchers. Proponents also cite data on law enforcement officers killed with firearms, which suggest that SAWs and other similar firearms have been used to kill a significant number of law enforcement officers. Opponents of the ban note that it is not possible to determine precisely whether these firearms were SAWs, nor is it known to what extent these firearms contributed to the ability of the criminals to outgun the police.", "Proponents of the ban argue that assault weapons should be prohibited, because they were designed for military purposes; are firearms of choice for criminals; and are not suitable for hunting, competitive shooting, or self-defense. They assert that these weapons include all the \"military features\" that increase capacity and ease of firing. They underscore that the impetus for the ban was several mass murders committed with SAWs, and that these firearms are disproportionately\u2014given their small numbers\u2014used in crimes involving multiple shots fired, multiple victims, multiple gunshot wounds per victim, and police officers as victims. They note that, despite several legal challenges, the ban was upheld as constitutional by federal courts.", "Opponents of the ban argue that SAWs were not designed for or used by military forces and that large numbers of law abiding gun owners use SAWs for self-defense, marksmanship, and hunting. They contend that SAWs are functionally no different from other semiautomatic firearms in that they fire only one round per pull of the trigger and that the statutorily defined features of a SAW were largely cosmetic. They also cite federal, state, and local data sources that suggest that SAWs have been used in a small fraction of violent crimes before and after the ban.

First, while all of these cities made efforts to include all firearm recoveries associated with murders or other serious crimes in their databases, a relatively small percentage of crime guns were recovered by law enforcement. Second, firearm recoveries may be affected by local and regional enforcement strategies that result in significant variation in recoveries from one locality to another.

They argue that the lethality of the firearms is constant no matter what largely aesthetic features are incorporated into their design. It is noteworthy that, for many years, the term \"assault weapon\" was a term of art, marketing attraction, and journalistic device. The 1994 legislation created a statutory definition for the term \"semiautomatic assault weapon,\" but the statutory definition expired with the ban. Moreover, firearm designs come in a very wide variety, and it is often difficult to categorize certain types of firearms according to traditional notions as to what constitutes a \"machine pistol,\" \"Carbine,\" \"battle rifle,\" or an \"assault weapon.\" As a result, some still debate the correct use of the term \"assault weapon.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Assault Rifles", "paragraphs": ["According to many firearms experts, \"assault rifles\" were developed during World War II to provide a lighter infantry weapon that could fire more rounds, more rapidly, and more easily. In other words, the design of these firearms included features that allowed for increased capacity and rate of fire, less weight, and less recoil. To increase capacity of fire, detachable, self-feeding magazines (introduced in the late 1880s) were incorporated into these rifles. To increase the rate of fire, assault rifles were designed to be fired in fully automatic mode (firing repeatedly), or with a \"select fire\" feature that allowed them to be fired in fully automatic mode, in short bursts (such as, three rounds per pull of the trigger), or in semiautomatic mode (one round per pull of the trigger). Mid-size rounds were developed, so infantrymen could carry more ammunition, and their rifles would be lighter when fully loaded. Also, mid-size rounds reduced the recoil or \"kick,\" making the rifles easier to handle and keep on target.", "The prototype assault rifle was developed by the Germans during World War II based on a Swiss design. This rifle\u2014the Maschinerkarabiner 42 (Mkb 42) \u2014was chambered to fire the 7.92x33 millimeter (mm) cartridge (a mid-size rifle cartridge). The Germans improved upon the Mkb 42's design and produced the first assault rifle, literally, dubbing it the Sturmgewehr (StG 43) , towards the end of the war. After the war, the StG 43 was the model for later generations of assault rifle designs, including the Spanish CETME, Belgique FN/FAL, and West German G-3. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, developed the Avtomat Kalashnikov of 1947 (AK-47), which was chambered to fire 7.62x39 mm cartridges.", "The United States was relatively late in developing a similar assault rifle. Between 1956 and 1959, Eugene Stoner designed an assault rifle later adopted by the U.S. Armed Forces as the M-16. It was chambered to fire Remington .223 cartridges (5.56x45 mm). The M-16 became the standard infantry rifle issued during the Southeast Asian conflict and remains the most widely issued firearm in the U.S. Armed Forces.", "Most military assault rifles were designed to be fully automatic, meaning they fire and reload continuously with a single pull of the trigger until all the rounds in the magazine are expended, or the trigger is released. Later generations of these weapons were outfitted with select fire features that allow them to be fired in multi-round bursts or in semiautomatic mode, in addition to fully automatic mode. Many assault rifle designs included features that were previously incorporated into submachine gun designs and handguns, such as pistol grips and barrel shrouds. Some ban supporters maintain that these features allow shooters to more easily stabilize and effectively fire these rifles in a low slung position in close quarters combat. Ban opponents maintain that the grips are shaped to conform with the relative position of the rifle's barrel and stock.

Semiautomatic firearms, including SAWs, fire one round per pull of the trigger like all other firearms other than fully automatics. The rate of fire of semiautomatics is equivalent to that of revolvers, in that both depend on how quickly a person can pull the trigger. Other commonplace firearms, such as bolt-action, lever-action, and pump-action firearms require a manual operation of the firearm's bolt to reload between shots.", "Many models of firearms that were originally designed for military purposes, most of which were originally designed to be fired in fully automatic mode or select fire, were later produced for civilian markets by modifying their design so that they could only be fired in semiautomatic mode.

Scarcity would be reflected in higher prices for pre-ban SAWs, which would have been available legally for transfer and possession. And, higher prices would discourage criminal use of SAWs, leading to a reduction in SAW-related crime.", "The researchers noted that the statutory schedule for the study constrained their findings to the short-term effects of the SAW ban.

In addition, law enforcement officers may be reluctant to request traces for firearms that would be difficult to trace because of missing identifying information, such as, the firearm's manufacturer and serial number. Therefore, newer guns for which such information may be more readily available are more likely to be traced than older guns. In addition, law enforcement agencies often conduct studies focused on specific categories of offenders and/or types of firearms in certain geographical areas.

For example, based on the firearm trace data presented in Table 2 above, the Brady Center \"concluded that the SAW ban has contributed to a substantial reduction in the use of assault weapons in crime...\" For FY1990-1994, the annual average number of SAW traces was 2,842 (or 14,209/5), and for FY1995-2001, the annual average was 2,811 (or 19,679/7), only 31 fewer traces on average annually for the five years before the ban compared to the seven years after the ban. While SAW traces as a share of total firearms decreased from FY1995 through FY2001, the annual average number of SAW traces declined by less than 10% after the ban.

To reinforce this point, the VPC has pointed to the \"time-to-crime\" phenomenon. Time-to-crime is the amount of time from the date of the firearm's first retail purchase to the date it was recovered by law enforcement. Analysis of ATF trace data for CY2000, as part of the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative (YCGII), showed that about a third of traced firearms for that year were traced within three years of their retail purchase. Nearly three-quarters of traced firearms were traced within 10 years of their first retail purchase. Hence, the likelihood that a firearm will be traced may diminish over time. As the SAW ban was expected to decrease, or at least hold constant, the population of legally available SAWs for FY1995-2004, the VPC contends that the annual number of SAW traces would have decreased over the decade, if they followed the general \"time-to-crime\" trend of other traced crime guns and there was a reduction in the criminal use of these firearms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SAW and Copycat Firearm Traces", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, since the ban went into effect, many firearm manufacturers have modified the design of firearms to either evade or comply with the ban, depending upon one's point of view.

Post-ban modified firearms that are similar to SAWs are often referred to as \"copycats\" (\"ccs\") by organizations seeking greater regulation of firearms like the VPC and Brady Center. Firearm manufacturers often refer to such firearms as having been \"sporterized.\" In their reports, both the Brady Center and the VPC included data on traces of certain CC firearms.
