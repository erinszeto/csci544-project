The Department of Justice and others have expressed concerns about whether the present subsection covers acts of mere trespass, i.e., unauthorized access, or whether it requires a further showing that the information perused was 'used, modified, destroyed, or disclosed.' To alleviate those concerns, the Committee wants to make clear that the new subsection will be a simple trespass offense, applicable to persons without authorized access to Federal computers.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Intent", "paragraphs": ["The paragraph only bans \"intentional\" trespassing. The reports are instructive here, for they make it apparent that the element cannot be satisfied by a mere inadvertent trespass and nothing more. It is intended, however, to cover anyone who purposefully accomplishes the proscribed unauthorized entry into a government computer, and, at least in the view of the House report, anyone \"whose initial access was inadvertent but who then deliberatively maintains access after a non-intentional initial contact.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unauthorized Access", "paragraphs": ["While the question of what constitutes \"access without authorization\" might seem fairly straightforward, Congress was willing to accept a certain degree of trespassing by government employees in order to protect whistleblowers:", "The Committee wishes to be very precise about who may be prosecuted under the new subsection (a)(3). The Committee was concerned that a Federal computer crime statute not be so broad as to create a risk that government employees and others who are authorized to use a Federal Government computer would not face prosecution for acts of computer access and use that, while technically wrong, should not rise to the level of criminal conduct. At the same time, the Committee was required to balance its concern for Federal employees and other authorized users against the legitimate need to protect Government computers against abuse by \"outsiders.\" The Committee struck that balance in the following manner.", "In the first place, the Committee has declined to criminalize acts in which the offending employee merely 'exceeds authorized access' to computers in his own department (\"department\"' is defined in [s]ection 2(g) of S. 2281 [now 18 U.S.C. 1030(e)(7)]). It is not difficult to envision an employee or other individual who, while authorized to use a particular computer in one department, briefly exceeds his authorized access and peruses data belonging to the department that he is not supposed to look at. This is especially true where the department in question lacks a clear method of delineating which individuals are authorized to access certain of its data. The Committee believes that administrative sanctions are more appropriate than criminal punishment in such a case. The Committee wishes to avoid the danger that every time an employee exceeds his authorized access to his department's computers\u2014no matter how slightly\u2014he could be prosecuted under this subsection. That danger will be prevented by not including \"exceeds authorized access\" as part of this subsection's offense.", "In the second place, the Committee has distinguished between acts of unauthorized access that occur within a department and those that involve trespasses into computers belonging to another department. The former are not covered by subsection (a)(3); the latter are. Again, it is not difficult to envision an individual who, while authorized to use certain computers in one department, is not authorized to use them all. The danger existed that S. 2281, as originally introduced, might cover every employee who happens to sit down, within his department, at a computer terminal which he is not officially authorized to use. These acts can also be best handled by administrative sanctions, rather than by criminal punishment. To that end, the Committee has constructed its amended version of (a)(3) to prevent prosecution of those who, while authorized to use some computers in their department, use others for which they lack the proper authorization. By precluding liability in purely 'insider' cases such as these, the Committee also seeks to alleviate concerns by Senators Mathias and Leahy that the existing statute cases a wide net over \"whistleblowers\"....", "The Committee has thus limited 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(3) to cases where the offender is completely outside the Government, and has no authority to access a computer of any agency or department of the United States, or where the offender's act of trespass is interdepartmental in nature. The Committee does not intend to preclude prosecution under this subsection if, for example, a Labor Department employee authorized to use Labor's computers accesses without authorization an FBI computer. An employee who uses his department's computer and, without authorization, forages into data belonging to another department is engaged in conduct directly analogous to an 'outsider' tampering with Government computers....", "The Committee acknowledges that in rare circumstances this may leave serious cases of intradepartmental trespass free from criminal prosecution under (a)(3). However, the Committee notes that such serious acts may be subject to other criminal penalties if, for example, they violate trade secrets laws or 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(1), (a)(4), (a)(5), or (a)(6), as proposed in this legislation.

Besides, at least for purposes of these trespassing offenses of paragraph 1030(a)(3), the statute itself addresses several of the potentially more nettlesome questions.", "First, the construction of the statute itself strongly suggests that it reaches only computers owned or leased by the federal government: \"whoever ... without authorization to access any nonpublic computer of a department or agency of the United States , accesses such a computer of that department or agency ....\"", "Second, the language of the statute indicates that \"nonpublic\" computers may nevertheless include government computers that the government allows to be used by nongovernmental purposes: \"in the case of a [government] computer not exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States ....\"", "Third, the statute covers government computers that are available to nongovernment users: \"accesses such a computer ... that ... in the case of a [government] computer not exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States, is used by or for the Government of the United States....\" The use of the term \"nonpublic,\" however, makes it clear that this shared access may not be so broad as to include the general public.", "Finally, the section supplies a definition of \"department of the United States\": \"[a]s used in this section ... the term 'department of the United States' means the legislative or judicial branch of the Government or one of the executive departments enumerated in [s]ection 101 of title 5\"; and the title supplies a definition of \"agency of the United States\": \"[a]s used in this title ...

Under what circumstances, if any, does the paragraph reach hacking initiated or occurring overseas? As a general rule, federal laws are presumed to apply within the United States and not overseas. In some instances, Congress explicitly negates the presumption. The treason statute, for example, outlaws the offense whether committed \"within the United States or elsewhere.\"", "In other instances, when the criminal statute is silent, the courts will conclude that Congress must have intended the statute to apply to overseas misconduct because of the nature of the offense and the circumstances under which it was committed. For example, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress must have intended the federal statute that prohibited fraud against the federal government to apply to fraud against the United States committed abroad, particularly when the\u00a0offenders were Americans. The Court later decided that a federal statute that outlawed conspiracy to violate federal law applied to an overseas conspiracy to smuggle liquor into this country.", "In the cybercrime context, at least one court determined that paragraph 1030(a)(4), which prohibits unauthorized computer access to defraud, applied to a hacker in Russia who gained unauthorized access to \"protected computers\" in this country. The court's conclusion was influenced by an amendment in which Congress had added computers used in \"foreign commerce or communications\" to the definition of \"protected computers\" and by the legislative history of why it did so. While the case was pending, Congress further amended the definition of \"protected computer\" to include \"a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States.\"", "Paragraph 1030(a)(3) does not cover \"protected computers\"; it covers nonpublic, federal government computers.

There is no general federal attempt statute, but Congress has elected to penalize attempts to commit many individual federal crimes. A body of case law has grown up around them that provides a common understanding of their general dimensions. Thus, as a general rule, in order to convict a defendant of attempt, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, acting with the intent required to commit the underlying offense, the defendant took some substantial step towards the commission of the underlying offense that strongly corroborates his criminal intent.

Section 371 punishes conspiracy to commit any federal felony with imprisonment for not more than 5 years, regardless of the maximum term of imprisonment that attends the underlying substantive offense. The section declares that the punishment for conspiracy to commit any federal misdemeanor may not exceed the maximum penalty for the underlying misdemeanor. Subsection 1030(b), on other hand, seems to contemplate punishing alike conspiracy and underlying violation of subsection 1030(a): \"Whoever conspires to commit or attempts to commit an offense under subsection (a) of this section shall be punished a provided in subsection (c) of this section [which establishes the punishment for violating the various paragraphs of subsection 1030(a)].\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accomplices as Principals", "paragraphs": ["Anyone who counsels, commands, aids or abets, or otherwise acts as an accessory before the fact with respect to any federal crime is liable as a principal for the underlying substantive offense to the same extent as the individual who actually commits the offense.

As a general rule, an accomplice may only be liable as a principal or accessory before the fact, for a completed crime; the aid must be given before the crime is committed, but liability as a principal will not attach until after the crime has been committed. This does not bar conviction of one who aids or abets the commission of a crime that never succeeds beyond the attempt phase, if, as in the case of paragraph 1030(a)(3), attempt to commit the offense has been made a separate crime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Application and State law", "paragraphs": ["Beyond these auxiliary offenses and bases for criminal liability, the simple trespassing crime created in paragraph 1030(a)(3) is the least likely of the seven crimes established in subsection 1030(a) to share coverage with other laws outside the section. Simply hacking into government computers\u2014without damage to the system, injury to the government, or gain by the hacker\u2014implicates only a few other laws. Computer trespassing in one form or another is an element of most of the offenses proscribed in 18 U.S.C. 1030. Moreover, hacking into someone else's e-mail stored in a government computer system is likely to offend the federal statute that protects e-mail and stored telephone company records, 18 U.S.C. 2701. Hackers who misidentify themselves in order to gain access to a federal computer may be guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 18 U.S.C. 912, in the view of at least one commentator. The case law may make the claim difficult to defend. The Supreme Court has suggested that \u00a71001 should be constructed narrowly, and the courts have consistently held that the false statement must somehow tend to adversely impact the functioning of a governmental agency or department to trigger coverage under \u00a71001. Cases in other\u00a0contexts demonstrate the difficulty of convincing the courts that simple trespassing in government cyberspace has an adverse impact upon the government.", "The difficulty with using the impersonation statute, 18 U.S.C. 912, is that it requires a showing of an official act or of a fraud, something that need not be proven for conviction under paragraph 1030(a)(3).

", "The section's legislative history provides some insight into why the damage thresholds are set as they are. In the case of damage in excess of $5,000, another earlier prohibition had spoken of intrusions that \"cause[d] loss or damage to one or more other persons of value aggregating $1,000 or more during any 1-year period.\" The Senate committee report accompanying the 1996 amendments observed that use of the term \"damage\" contemplated the inclusion of all economic harm attributable to the intrusion and that the increased dollar limitation was expected to restrict federal felony prosecutions to the more serious cases:", "The 1994 amendment required both 'damage' and 'loss,' but it is not always clear what constitutes 'damage.' For example, intruders often alter existing log-on programs so that user passwords are copied to a file which the hackers can retrieve later. After retrieving the newly created password file, the intruder restores the altered log-on file to its original condition. Arguably, in such a situation, neither the computer nor its information is damaged. Nonetheless, this conduct allows the intruder to accumulate valid user passwords to the system, requires all system users to change their passwords, and requires the system administrator to devote resources to resecuring the system. Thus, although there is arguably no 'damage,' the victim does suffer 'loss.' If the loss to the victim meets the required monetary threshold, the conduct should be criminal, and the victim should be entitled to relief. The bill therefore defines 'damage' in new subsection 1030(e)(8), with a focus on the harm that the law seeks to prevent. As in the past, the term 'damage' will require ... significant financial losses. S.Rept. 104-357 at 11 (1996).", "Ordinarily, the presence of a separate hacker prohibition with less severe penalties would argue against allowing \"damage assessment\" and \"security enhancement\" costs to be used to reach the\u00a0$5,000 threshold for the more severe penalty. The report language might be read to rebut such\u00a0a presumption, but it might also be characterized as asserting no more than that the cost of\u00a0new locks (\"resecuring the system\") can be considered damage when the keys (\"passwords\") are stolen.", "The USA PATRIOT Act reduced the prospect of misconception by supplying an explicit definition of \"loss\" as used here: \"the term 'loss' means any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service,\" 18 U.S.C. 1030(e)(11). Thus, the losses incurred by a contractor employed to manage the damaged computer system may properly be included to reach the $5,000 threshold.", "It also eliminated a second potential problem. The 1996 amendments, perhaps inadvertently, rephrased the aggregate $5,000 damage-loss threshold describing the victims as \"individuals\" rather than the term previously employed, \"persons.\" The change stimulated contentions that Congress intended to limit the cases where the threshold could be reached entirely to the damages and losses suffered by human beings without any reference to the damages and losses suffered by corporate or other legal entities. The USA PATRIOT Act negated the problem by describing the damage-loss victims as \"persons\" and by defining persons to include individuals and any \"legal or other entity.\" ", "The long-standing medical tampering element has no monetary threshold and has remained essentially unchanged since it was added in response to an incident in which juvenile hackers broke into the computer system of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.", "The inclusion of computer tampering that causes physical injuries or threatens public health or safety, on the other hand, is new with the 1996 amendments and is designed to reach more general threats:", "As the NII [National Information Infrastructure] and other network infrastructures continue to grow, computers will increasingly be used for access to critical services such as emergency response systems and air traffic control, and will be critical to other systems which we cannot yet anticipate.
