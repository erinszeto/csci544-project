Some research suggests that a greater number of children in foster care might be eligible for SSI benefits if this assistance was sought. SSI benefits are available under Title XVI of the Social Security Act for certain disabled children from families with low incomes and minimal assets. Other Social Security benefits may be paid under Title II of the act to the children of workers who have retired, become disabled, or died.", "Federal regulations require that in most cases the Social Security Administration (SSA) select and assign a representative payee\u2014an individual, organization, or government entity\u2014that manages SSI and Social Security payments for children, including those in foster care. Nearly all states designated as the representative payee for a foster child use the child's benefits to support the child in foster care. In Washington State Department of Social and Health Services v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler (hereinafter Keffeler), the Supreme Court held that the process used by the state of Washington to keep the Social Security benefits received as a child's representative payee was not prohibited by the Social Security Act. The Court also concluded that the use of funds for reimbursement for foster care services was consistent with the act's provisions that such funds be spent for the \"use and benefit of the beneficiary\" and within the regulatory definition of \"current maintenance\" (i.e., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and personal comfort items).", "Although the Keffeler decision supports states' practice of using SSI and other Social Security benefits for reimbursement of foster care, some child advocates assert that by using these benefits to reimburse the cost of foster care, the state agency denies the child beneficiaries funding that rightly belongs to them. Advocates also raise concern that child welfare agencies are often automatically assigned as the representative payee for foster children. On the other hand, child welfare agencies and advocates argue that if states were not able to use benefits to pay for a child's foster care, they would stop screening children to determine their eligibility for these Social Security programs. They further raise the concern that if a foster child's SSI benefits were allowed to accumulate in a savings account, the child would soon surpass the \"means test\" for SSI and would lose eligibility for the benefits.", "Changes governing how child welfare agencies are assigned as representative payees or how they use the Social Security benefits of foster children would require congressional action. For example, Congress could permit or require states that act as representative payees to \"pass through\" some or all benefits to eligible foster children and those children could receive a portion of the benefits while in care and/or upon leaving care. Congress could also make changes to the selection of representative payees so that certain individuals, such as the child's attorney, would have the opportunity to serve as the payee.", "Legislation has been introduced that would prohibit using SSI or Title II Social Security benefits to reimburse a state for foster care maintenance payments; require state child welfare agencies to screen foster children for benefits; and for any foster child already receiving benefits, it would also require the state to develop a plan to \"conserve benefits not necessary for the immediate needs of the child\" to enable the child to \"achieve self-support after leaving foster care.\""], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On any given day, more than 400,000 children are in foster care due to incidents of abuse, neglect, or other reasons that prevented them from remaining with their parents.

", "The Social Security Administration (SSA) may designate a government entity as the representative payee of a foster child if the child's custodial or non-custodial parents, guardians, relatives, stepparents, or a close friend are not available to serve in that role. As the representative payee, the state (like any other representative payee) is required to manage the child's benefits and to use the benefits for the current maintenance (food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and personal comfort items) of the child.

In FY2011, the most recent year for which these data are available, states made foster care maintenance payments on behalf of an average of 168,385 Title IV-E eligible children each month. Those payments cost about $2.406 billion and states claimed federal reimbursement of $1.169 billion. For FY2011 then, the average monthly maintenance payment cost per eligible foster care recipient was about $1,427 and of this amount, the federal government reimbursed states roughly $829 (about 60% of the total costs). This federal share of maintenance payment costs is higher than in previous years (when it stood at about 56%) because states received enhanced federal support for foster care maintenance payments under provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 111-5 , as amended by P.L. 111-226 ) for a part of FY2011.

Practically speaking, however, placing such a child in an out-of-home setting without providing some reimbursement for the cost of that child is difficult, and in many circumstances might be considered a questionable exercise of the state's responsibility for the child. Accordingly, all states are believed to provide payments on behalf of children who are placed out of the home and under the responsibility of the state, regardless of the child's Title IV-E eligibility status.

Thus if a child's total monthly foster care maintenance payment is $500\u2014and that maintenance payment is in part paid with federal Title IV-E dollars\u2014then the child's SSI benefit would be reduced by $500.", "If the amount of a child's foster care maintenance payment under Title IV-E exceeds the amount of a child's SSI benefit, then his or her benefit is reduced to zero and his or her SSI benefits are suspended for that month. For 2012, the federal SSI benefit is $698 per month before any income-related reductions. However, a majority of the states add a small supplement to this monthly benefit in some cases. Thus, a child's SSI benefits would be suspended when his or her Title IV-E foster care maintenance payment exceeds the amount of his or her federal SSI benefit plus any state supplement. An SSI recipient who has been suspended may begin receiving payments again if his or her countable income is reduced. However, after 12 consecutive months of suspension, a person is removed from the SSI program and must reapply to become eligible for benefits. ", "For children in foster care who do not qualify for Title IV-E foster care support, states must find other sources of funding to pay for that child. Most non-Title IV-E eligible children in foster care must be supported with state or local dollars. Such payments generally do not reduce an SSI-eligible foster child's federal SSI benefit because they are not counted as income. Typically, however, a state, acting as the child's representative payee, is believed to use SSI or Social Security benefits to provide a foster care maintenance payment to the child (or to reimburse itself for that payment).", "Addressing the question about whether to apply for either or both Title IV-E and SSI benefits, the Child Welfare Policy Manual counsels careful review of benefits available under each program \"so that an informed choice can be made in the child's best interest.\" It adds that \"to achieve this goal, Title IV-E agencies should exchange information regarding eligibility requirements and benefits with local Social Security district offices and establish formal procedures to refer clients and their representative to the local Social Security district office for consultation and/or application when appropriate.\" At the same time, even if the interaction of Title IV-E and SSI payments appears to negate the benefit of applying for SSI, establishing SSI eligibility for a child whose permanency plan is to reunite with his or her parents may help those parents (or other family members) better meet the child's needs when this goal is reached. Further, if the child was receiving benefits, SSA would automatically determine whether the child is eligible to continue to receive these benefits upon reaching age 18, and therefore the child would not need to reapply, where eligibility for a foster care maintenance payment ceases generally at, or soon after, a youth's 18 th birthday in most states. Further, most SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid. Foster youth are eligible for Medicaid until they age out of foster care, unless they live in a state that provides Medicaid to former foster youth until age 21; however, beginning on January 1, 2014, states must provide Medicaid to foster youth who age out of care until age 26, without regard to their income or assets.", "The eligibility for and amount of Title II benefits are not affected by receipt of foster care. Social Security benefits are paid under Title II to the children of workers who have retired, become disabled, or died. Their eligibility is determined by their parents' participation in the workforce. Because both SSI and Title IV-E foster care have income- and resources-related eligibility criteria, children who are recipients of Title II Social Security benefits may be less likely to qualify for either of the means-tested programs.", "Of the 43 states that responded to a 2011 survey about SSI and Title II benefits for children in foster care, nearly all reported that state child welfare agencies weigh the benefits of each funding stream and select funding based primarily on what will best meet the current and future needs of youth. The 43 states indicated that they use SSI and Title II funds primarily for foster payments, including food, shelter, and clothing. Most (42) states reported that they use these funds to meet other expenses, such as medical and mental health needs not covered by Medicaid, educational need (e.g., tutoring and tuition), and social needs (e.g., summer camps and sports); however, funds are rarely used for these purposes.

Instead, the question raised by the case, the Court stated, was \"whether the department's efforts to become a representative payee, or its use of respondents' Social Security benefits when it acts in that capacity amounts to employing an 'execution, levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal process',\" to gain control of the children's Social Security benefits. On the question of this alleged violation of what is commonly called the \"anti-attachment clause\"\u2014the Court held that neither the process used by Washington State to become a representative payee for children in foster care who were recipients of SSI or Social Security benefits, nor its use of those benefits to reimburse the cost of their foster care, violated the anti-attachment clause. The Court further noted that the use of funds to reimburse the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services for foster care was consistent with the regulatory requirement that such funds be spent for the \"use and benefit of the beneficiary\" and with the regulatory definition of \"current maintenance\" that includes \"costs incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items.\"", "The U.S. Supreme Court further asserted that the \"real basis\" of the respondent's objection in the case (and the previous Washington State Supreme Court's holding in the case) was the \"view that allowing a state agency to reimburse itself for the costs of foster care is antithetical to the best interest of the beneficiary foster child.\" Responding to this issue, the Court first relied on the settled principle of administrative law that an open-ended and potentially vague term, such as \"best interest\" is \"highly susceptible to administrative interpretation subject to judicial deference.\" Thus, it noted that SSA has the authority to determine, through regulation, how it will interpret this part of the law. The Court then concluded that SSA's regulations on this issue are consistent with the basic objectives of the law authorizing the SSI and Social Security programs. Specifically, those are to provide a minimum level of income, and the basic objective of the Social Security program is to provide income required for ordinary and necessary living expenses.

They point out that states lack a deliberative process to assess the individual needs of a child. As evidence of this, at least a few states and localities do not keep the funds for these children separate from other funds that are available to the child welfare agency.

Additionally, some advocates are concerned that child welfare agencies may be automatically assigned as the representative payee for children in foster care, even though (under SSA's own regulations) the agencies should be the least preferred representative payee.

Youth who leave foster care without a permanent home, typically at age 18, often have a difficult time securing housing and income sufficient to shelter and support themselves. SSI-eligible foster care youth who exit foster care would arguably have an even more difficult time and thus may need additional resources that SSI provides (albeit some youth may continue to be eligible for SSI at age 18 and beyond). Providing benefits to eligible youth upon leaving care could ease the transition to adulthood for these youth at a time when they are expected to become financially independent. According to advocates, the resource limits for SSI eligibility of $2,000 may discourage youth leaving foster care from accumulating income and assets to assist in this transition.

Some child welfare advocates argue that states have expended benefits for allowable purposes in good faith, just as a parent serving as a representative payee would. Thus, states should not be held to a different standard than parents or other representative payees.

Screenings by child welfare staff can help to determine an individual child's needs and to secure extra benefits and services not normally available in foster care, such as housing modifications. Eliminating these screenings would do a disservice to potentially qualified children, these advocates argue, because a child's eligibility for SSI or another Title II Social Security benefit may extend beyond his/her stay in foster care, and the benefit could provide crucial support for the child outside the system. (For instance, the benefit could offset the cost of therapeutic care to the families of children who leave care due to adoption or reunification.) The Keffeler Court relied on this argument in its decision, asserting that absent this state assistance, \"many eligible children would either obtain no Social Security benefits, or need some very good luck to get them.\"", "In addition, these advocates argue that if child SSI beneficiaries were given all of their benefits while in foster care, they might accumulate assets in the form of savings and could soon find themselves above the maximum SSI resource level of $2,000.

The Committee believes children in foster care should be allowed to accumulate a much higher level of assets to prepare for the day when they must support themselves. Thus, we are increasing the asset limit to $10,000.", "By contrast, under the SSI program individuals are generally no longer eligible once they attain $2,000 in countable resources. However, two current initiatives allow eligible recipients to accumulate assets above that limit. These are the SSI initiative Plans for Achieving Self Support (PASS) and Individual Development Accounts (IDAs). Either one of these might be modified to include provisions that target recipients in foster care."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Plans for Achieving Self-Support (PASS)", "paragraphs": ["A Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is an individual plan for employment designed by an SSI beneficiary with the assistance of a state vocational rehabilitation agency, disability service organization or Ticket to Work Employment Network and approved by the SSA. A PASS must include a specific goal for employment, such as a specific job type desired or a plan for setting up a small business and must include a time line for achieving the employment goal. The PASS must also include a list and cost of any goods, such as assistive devices or job-specific tools, or services, such as schooling, that will be needed by the beneficiary to achieve his or her goal.", "Resources included in an approved PASS are not counted against the SSI resource limits.
