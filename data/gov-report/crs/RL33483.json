Many reflect issues of long-standing interest, such as applying federal regulations on private lands, wetland loss rates, and restoration and creation accomplishments.", "The issue receiving the greatest attention recently has been determining which wetlands should be included and excluded from requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA), especially the Section 404 permit program that regulates waste discharges affecting wetlands, which is administered by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As a result of Supreme Court rulings in 2001 and 2006 that narrowed federal regulatory jurisdiction over certain isolated wetlands, the jurisdictional reach of the permit program has also been narrowed. In 2015, EPA and the Army Corps promulgated a rule to define the scope of waters protected by the CWA. The rule revises the existing administrative definition of \"waters of the United States\" consistent with the Supreme Court's rulings and consistent with science concerning the interconnectedness of tributaries, wetlands, and other waters and the effects of these connections on the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of downstream waters. The rule has been controversial with groups and many Members of Congress who contend that it would vastly increase federal assertion of jurisdiction that triggers CWA regulatory requirements.", "Wetland protection efforts continue to engender controversy over issues of science and policy. Topics include the rate and pattern of loss, whether all wetlands should be protected in a single fashion, the effectiveness of the current suite of laws in protecting them, and the fact that 75% of remaining U.S. wetlands are located on private lands.", "Many public and private efforts have sought to mitigate damage to wetlands and to protect them through acquisition, restoration, enhancement, and creation, particularly coastal wetlands. While recent data indicate success in some restoration efforts, leading to increases in some types of wetlands in some locations, many scientists question if restored or created wetlands provide equivalent replacement for natural wetlands that contribute multiple environmental services and values.", "One reason for controversies about wetlands is that they occur in a wide variety of physical forms, and the numerous values they provide, such as wildlife habitat, also vary widely. In addition, the total wetland acreage in the lower 48 states is estimated to have declined from more than 220 million acres three centuries ago to 110.1 million acres in 2009. The national policy goal of no net loss, endorsed by Administrations for the past two decades, had been reached by 2004, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service, as the rate of loss had been more than offset by net gains through expanded restoration efforts authorized in multiple laws. However, more recent data show wetlands losses of nearly 14,000 acres per year. Many protection advocates say that gains do not necessarily account for the changes in quality of the remaining wetlands, and many also view federal protection efforts as inadequate or uncoordinated. Others, who advocate the rights of property owners and development interests, characterize these efforts as too intrusive. Numerous state and local wetland programs add to the complexity of the protection effort."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Wetlands, with a variety of physical characteristics, are found throughout the country.

Some wetland areas may be continuously inundated by water, while other areas may not be flooded at all. In coastal areas, flooding may occur daily as tides rise and fall.", "Prior to the mid-1980s, federal laws and policies to protect wetlands were generally limited to providing habitat for migratory waterfowl, especially ducks and geese. Some laws encouraged destruction of wetland areas, including selected provisions in the federal tax code, public works legislation, and farm programs.", "Since the mid-1980s, the values of wetlands have been recognized in different ways in numerous national policies, and federal laws either encourage wetland protection, or prohibit or do not support their destruction. These laws, however, do not add up to a fully consistent or comprehensive national approach. The central federal regulatory program, found in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, requires permits for the discharge of dredged or fill materials into many but not all wetland areas. However, other activities that may adversely affect wetlands do not require permits, and some places that scientists define as wetlands are exempt from this permit program because of physical characteristics or the type of activity that takes place. One agricultural program, swampbuster, is a disincentive program that indirectly protects wetlands by making farmers who drain wetlands ineligible for federal farm program benefits; those who do not receive these benefits (62% of all farmers received no direct payments from the farm subsidy program in 2007) have no reason to observe the requirements of this program. Numerous other acquisition, protection, and restoration programs complete the current federal effort.", "Although numerous wetland protection bills have been introduced in recent Congresses, the most significant new wetlands legislation to be enacted has been in farm bills. Congress also has reauthorized several wetlands programs, mostly setting higher appropriations ceilings, without making significant shifts in policy. The George W. Bush Administration endorsed wetland protection in legislation, such as the farm bill and the North American Wetlands Conservation Act reauthorization, and at events, such as Earth Day presentations. The Bush Administration also issued rules on mitigation policies. In 2015 the Obama Administration promulgated controversial changes to regulatory program jurisdiction (see discussion below).", "Congress has provided a forum in numerous hearings where conflicting interests in wetland issues have been debated. These debates encompass disparate scientific and programmatic questions and conflicting views of the role of government where private property is involved.

They have been especially critical of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), asserting that they administer the Section 404 program in an overzealous and inflexible manner.", "Recent wetland legislative activity in Congress centered broadly on two issues. One was on wetlands conservation provisions in the farm bill. Provisions enacted in the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) repealed the wetlands reserve program, but it created a new conservation easement program, which continues voluntary efforts to protect and restore wetlands. The law also reauthorized the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the largest federal, private-land retirement program, but reduced the acreage enrollment cap by 25%. CRP compensates landowners who voluntarily remove land from agricultural production for the benefit of soil and water quality and wildlife habitat.", "The second major area of recent legislative interest has been proposals addressing the scope of geographic jurisdiction of wetlands regulations under the Clean Water Act. This interest arises because federal courts have played a key role in interpreting and clarifying the limits of federal jurisdiction to regulate activities that affect \"waters of the United States,\" including wetlands, especially since a 2001 Supreme Court ruling in the so-called SWANCC decision and another in 2006 in Rapanos v s .

This definition does not include more specific criteria, such as exactly what conditions must be present and for how long, thus leaving interpretation to scientists and regulators on a case-by-case basis.

This manual was prepared jointly and is used by all federal agencies to carry out their responsibilities under this program (the Corps, EPA, Fish and Wildlife Service [FWS], and the National Marine Fisheries Service [NMFS]). It provides guidance and field-level consistency for the agencies that have roles in wetland regulatory protection. (A second and slightly different manual, agreed to by the Corps and the Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS], is used for delineating wetlands on agricultural lands.)

Wetland values can include", "habitat for aquatic birds and other animals and plants, including numerous threatened and endangered species; production of fish and shellfish; water storage, including mitigating the effects of floods and droughts; water purification; recreation; timber production; food production; education and research; and open space and aesthetic values.", "Usually wetlands provide some combination of these values; single wetlands rarely provide all of these values. The composite value typically declines when wetlands are altered. In addition, the effects of alteration often extend well beyond the immediate area, because wetlands are usually part of a larger water system.

According to its most recent report of national trends, issued in 2011, total wetland acreage in 2009 was estimated to be 110.1 million acres. Until recently, NWI data had shown small annual gains overall in wetland acreage. However, the 2009 total was a slight decline in acreage over the previous five years (62,300 acres), or about 13,800 acres lost per year, reflecting a combination of some losses and some gains in acres and types of wetlands across the country. FWS also has published reports on wetland status and trends in several individual regions and states, such as Florida, Texas, Delaware, South Carolina, and Alaska.", "Of particular interest to scientists and natural resource managers are coastal wetlands, which provide important ecosystems services, because they serve as buffers to protect coastal areas from storm damage and sea level rise, while providing habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife that are commercially and recreationally important. Coastal watersheds, where these wetlands are located, are affected by population growth more than non-coastal areas, since 52% of the total U.S. population lives in counties that drain to coastal watersheds, although these counties are less than 20% of U.S. land area, excluding Alaska. Coastal wetlands are vulnerable to direct and indirect effects of residential and commercial development, pollutant discharges, and other human activities. A 2013 report by the FWS and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that in 2009 there were an estimated 41.1 million acres of wetlands in the coastal watersheds of the United States, representing 37.3% of total wetland area in the lower 48 states. The report also found that U.S. coastal wetlands are vanishing at a rate of more than 80,000 acres per year, about six times greater than the estimated rate of wetland loss for the entire United States. The increased loss, measured between 2004 and 2009, was attributed to severe weather in the Gulf of Mexico and urban and rural development in other areas, and the reported loss was 25% greater than the annual loss rate found in a previous report covering the years 1998 to 2004. The largest loss, according to the report, was in the Gulf of Mexico region, where 257,150 acres of coastal wetlands disappeared due to erosion and/or inundation. Throughout the Gulf region, saltwater wetlands have been adversely affected by the cumulative effect of oil and gas development that increased their vulnerability to intense storms.", "Over the last decade, working with states and tribes, EPA has conducted a series of national aquatic resource assessments, to gather information on the ecological condition of the nation's waters. A 2016 report under this effort evaluated the ecological condition of tidal and non-tidal wetlands. It found that nearly half of wetland area (48%) is in good condition, 32% is in poor condition, and the remaining 20% is in fair condition. Plant presence, abundance, and trait information are used to assess biological condition of wetlands, and EPA reported that less than half of wetland areas nationally have healthy plant communities. Physical disturbances to wetlands and surrounding habitat, such as surface hardening and vegetation removal or loss, are the most widespread problems, EPA said.", "In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration endorsed the concept of \"no-net-loss\" of wetlands\u2014a goal declared by President George H. W. Bush in 1988 and also embraced by President Clinton to balance wetlands losses and gains in the short term and achieve net gains in the long term. On Earth Day 2004, President Bush announced a new national goal, moving beyond no-net-loss to achieve an overall increase of wetlands. The goal was to create, improve, and protect at least 3 million wetland acres over the next five years in order to increase overall wetland acres and quality. (By comparison, the Clinton Administration in 1998 announced policies intended to achieve overall wetland increases of 200,000 acres per year by 2005.) The Bush strategy also called for better tracking of wetland programs and enhanced local and private sector collaboration.", "In April 2008, the Bush Administration issued a report saying that more than 3.6 million acres of wetlands had been restored, protected, or improved as part of the President's program to create, improve and protect wetlands, and that the number was expected to climb to 4.5 million acres by the original date set by that program\u2014Earth Day 2009. The report documented gains, but not offsetting loses. It summarized accomplishments for each federal wetland conservation program. Environmental groups criticized the report as presenting an incomplete picture, because it failed to mention wetlands lost to agriculture and development.", "Numerous shifts in federal policies since 1985 (and changes in economic conditions as well) strongly influence wetland loss patterns, but the composite effects remain unmeasured beyond these raw numbers. There usually is a large time lag between the announcement and implementation of changes in policy, and collection and release of data that measure how these changes affect loss rates. Also, it is often very difficult to distinguish the role that policy changes play from other factors, such as agricultural markets, development pressures, and land markets.", "Further, these data only measure acres. This may have been appropriate two or three decades ago when scientists knew less about how to measure the specific functions and values found in wetlands. By providing data limited to number of acres, these data provide few insights into changes in their quality, as measured by the values they provide, which is often determined by factors such as where a wetland is located in a watershed, and what are the surrounding land uses. Scientists caution that there are a number of questions about the qualitative and ecological integrity of existing wetlands. The wetlands trends data reported by FWS in 2011 show increases in certain types of freshwater wetlands since 2004, particularly freshwater ponds constructed to replace lost wetlands. However, FWS noted that there is no clear scientific consensus about the functional equivalency of replacement wetlands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wetlands and Climate Change", "paragraphs": ["As described above, coastal wetlands provide critical services such as absorbing energy from coastal storms, preserving shorelines, protecting human populations and infrastructure, absorbing pollutants, and serving as critical habitat for migratory species. Many scientists believe that these resources and services will be threatened as sea-level rise associated with a changing climate inundates wetlands. Due in part to their limited capacity for adaptation, wetlands have been considered among the ecosystems most vulnerable to a changing climate. Changes in climatic conditions that affect water conditions (e.g., wetter, drier, more saline) are predicted to have substantial impact on species that use wetlands and on ecosystem services provided by wetlands, or make efforts to reestablish wetlands more challenging. ", "In 2010, a group of international scientists published results of research modeling efforts to identify conditions under which coastal wetlands could survive rising sea level. Using a rapid sea-level rise scenario, the scientists estimated that most coastal wetlands worldwide will experience inundation that leads to rapid and irreversible conversion of marshland into unvegetated, subtidal surfaces and will disappear near the end of the 21 st century. Under moderate and slow sea-level rise scenarios, some coastal wetlands would be vulnerable to inundation, depending on amounts of sediment present: larger amounts of sediment would enable the wetland to adapt and modify naturally and thus be more likely to survive sea-level rise.", "Coastal wetlands also serve as a \"sink\" for absorbing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the most common greenhouse gas (GHG) that is associated with climate change. Scientists recognize that tidal wetlands hold large amounts of carbon, some within standing plant biomass, but most within deep organic-bearing soils. Carbon that is stored in soils has been built up over millennia and reflects pools of CO 2 that have been transferred from the atmosphere and sequestered within roots and other organic material. However, the loss of wetland areas, for example through inundation and erosion, eliminates its ongoing sequestration capacity, and draining wetlands for development releases within a few decades carbon that took centuries to accumulate. A 2011 World Bank report concluded that drainage and degradation of coastal wetlands has become a major cause of carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change, large enough globally that carbon dioxide emissions from drained coastal wetlands should be included in carbon accounting and emission inventories, and in policy frameworks to reduce emissions. Some policymakers concerned with mitigating climate change have begun to consider whether it is possible to halt the release of carbon from converted or eroded wetlands and reverse carbon losses through wetland restoration.

The Corps and EPA share responsibility for administering the Section 404 program. Other federal agencies, including NRCS, FWS, and NMFS, also have roles in this process. In the 1970s, legal decisions in key cases led the Corps to revise this program to incorporate broad jurisdictional definitions in terms of both regulated waters and adjacent wetlands. Section 404 was last amended in 1977.", "This judicial/regulatory/administrative evolution of the Section 404 program has generally pleased those who view it as a critical tool in wetland protection, but dismayed others who would prefer more limited Corps jurisdiction or who see the expanded regulatory program as intruding on private land-use decisions and treating wetlands of widely varying value similarly. Underlying this debate is the more general question of whether Section 404 is the best approach to federal wetland protection.", "Some wetland protection advocates have proposed that it be replaced or greatly altered. First, they point out that it governs only the discharge of dredged or fill material, while not regulating other acts that drain, flood, or otherwise reduce functional values. Second, because of exemptions provided in 1977 amendments to Section 404, major categories of activities are not required to obtain permits. These include normal, ongoing farming, ranching, and silvicultural (forestry) activities. Further, permits generally are not required for activities that drain wetlands (only for those that fill wetlands), which excludes a large number of actions with potential to alter wetlands.

Developers say that it is too complex and burdened with arbitrary restrictions. Environmentalists say that it does not adequately protect aquatic resources. At issue is whether the program has become so complex and expansive that it cannot either protect aquatic resources or provide for a fair regulatory system, which are its dual objectives.", "Less than 5% of all permits are required to go through the more detailed evaluation for a standard individual permit, which typically involves complex proposals or sensitive environmental issues. Regulatory procedures on individual permits allow for interagency review and public comment, a coordination process that can generate delays and an uncertain outcome, especially for environmentally controversial projects.

However, critics have charged that implied threats of delay by the FWS and others practically amount to the same thing. Reforms during the Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton Administrations streamlined certain of these procedures, with the intent of speeding up and clarifying the Corps' full regulatory program, but concerns continue over both process and program goals.", "Controversy also surrounded revised regulations issued by EPA and the Corps in 2002, which redefine two key terms in the 404 program: \"fill material\" and \"discharge of fill material.\" These definitions are important, because material defined as \"fill\" is regulated and permitted under Section 404 procedures, while other waste discharges are regulated under more stringent CWA rules and procedures. The agencies said that the revisions were intended to clarify certain confusion in their joint administration of the program due to previous differences in how the two agencies defined those terms. However, environmental groups contended that the changes allow for less restrictive and inadequate regulation of certain disposal activities, including disposal of coal mining waste, which could be harmful to aquatic life in streams. Legislation to reverse the agencies' action by clarifying in the law that fill material cannot be composed of waste has been introduced regularly since the 107 th Congress, including H.R. 6411 in the 114 th Congress.", "As previously described, three criteria\u2014hydrology, soil type, and plants\u2014are used in making wetlands delineations under several environmental laws and programs, including Section 404 permitting. Scientists generally agree that each of the three parameters must be met to identify an area as a wetland. Because growth of plants in wetland areas typically is contingent on the presence of hydric soils and the availability of sufficient water, the vegetation parameter often is determinative of whether an area qualifies as a wetland or not. ", "In 2012, the Corps revised the National Wetlands Plant List (NWPL), which is used by federal and state agencies for determining whether a particular area contains a prevalence of hydrophytic (i.e., wetland) vegetation.

The updated list contains 8,200 plant species, an increase of 1,472 species, or 22%, primarily as a result of new taxonomic interpretations. The Corps said it did not expect major changes to wetland delineations as a result of the updated list, but some commenters contend that the new list is likely to cause more areas to qualify as wetlands.", "Section 404 authorizes states to assume many of the Corps' permitting responsibilities. Two states have done this: Michigan (in 1984) and New Jersey (in 1992). Others reasons cited for not joining these two states include the complex process of assumption, the anticipated cost of running a program, and the continued involvement of federal agencies because of statutory limits on waters that states could regulate.

If a state or tribe is considering assuming such responsibilities, among the first questions that needs to be answered is\u00a0for which\u00a0waters will the state or tribe assume permitting responsibility and which waters will the Corps retain permitting authority. States have raised concerns that Section 404 and its implementing regulations lack sufficient clarity to enable states and tribes to estimate the extent of waters\u00a0for which they\u00a0could assume permitting responsibility and thus estimate the associated implementation costs. In 2015 EPA convened an advisory committee, consisting of states, tribes, industry, environmentalists, and others, to provide advice and recommendations\u00a0on how the EPA can\u00a0best clarify which waters a state or tribe may assume permitting responsibility.

", "However, this perception has led critics to focus on situations where a wetland has little apparent value, but the landowner's development proposal is not approved, or the landowner is penalized for altering a wetland without a federal permit. Critics believe that one possible solution may be to have a tiered approach for regulating wetlands. Legislation introduced in past Congresses proposed to establish multiple tiers (typically three)\u2014from highly valuable wetlands that should receive the greatest protection to the least valuable wetlands where alterations might usually be allowed.

(2) How clearly can a line separating each wetland category be defined? (3) Are there regions where wetlands should be treated differently? Regarding classification, even many wetland protection advocates acknowledge that there are some situations where a wetland designation with total protection is not appropriate. But they fear that classification for different degrees of protection could be a first step toward a major erosion in overall wetland protection. Also, these advocates would probably like to see almost all wetlands presumed to be in the highest protection category unless experts can prove an area should receive a lesser level of protection, while critics who view protection efforts as excessive would seek the reverse. In response to these concerns, Corps and EPA officials note that existing guidance and regulations already provide substantial flexibility to implement current programs, allowing, for example, less vigorous permit review to small projects with minor environmental impacts. Some types of wetlands are already treated differently\u2014for example, playas and prairie potholes, which have somewhat different definitions under swampbuster (discussed below). However, this differential treatment contributes to questions about federal regulatory consistency on private property.", "Locating the boundary line of a wetland can be controversial when the line encompasses areas that do not meet the image held by many. Controversy would likely grow if a tiered approach required that lines segment wetland areas. On the other hand, a consistent application of an agreed-on definition might lead to fewer disputes and result in more timely decisions.", "Some states have far more wetlands than others. Different treatment has been proposed for Alaska, because about one-third of the state is designated as wetlands, yet a very small portion has been converted.

The Court's 5-4 ruling in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County (SWANCC) v s .

It provided a legal interpretation essentially based on a narrow reading of the Court's decision, thus allowing federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue (in cases where factors other than the presence of migratory birds may exist, thus allowing for assertion of federal jurisdiction), but it called for more review by higher levels in the agencies in such cases. Administration press releases said that the guidance demonstrates the government's commitment to \"no-net-loss\" wetlands policy. However, it was apparent that the issues remained under discussion, because at the same time, the Administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking comment on how to define waters that are under the regulatory program's jurisdiction. The ANPRM did not actually propose rule changes, but it indicated possible ways that CWA rules might be modified to further limit federal jurisdiction, building on SWANCC and some of the subsequent legal decisions. The government received more than 133,000 comments on the ANPRM, most of them negative, according to EPA and the Corps. Environmentalists and many states opposed changing any rules, saying that the law and previous court rulings call for the broadest possible interpretation of the CWA (and narrow interpretation of SWANCC ), but developers sought changes to clarify interpretation of the SWANCC ruling.", "In December 2003, EPA and the Corps announced that the Administration would not pursue rule changes concerning federal regulatory jurisdiction over isolated wetlands. The EPA Administrator said that the Administration wanted to avoid a contentious and lengthy rulemaking debate over the issue. Nonetheless, interest groups on all sides have been critical of confusion in implementing the 2003 guidance, which constitutes the main tool for interpreting the reach of the SWANCC decision. Environmentalists remain concerned about diminished protection resulting from the guidance, while developers said that without a new rule, confusing and contradictory interpretations of wetland rules likely will continue. In that vein, a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report concluded that Corps districts differ in how they interpret and apply federal rules when determining which waters and wetlands are subject to federal jurisdiction, documenting enough differences that the Corps undertook a comprehensive survey of its district office practices to help promote greater consistency. Concerns over inconsistent or confusing regulation of wetlands also drew congressional interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rapanos-Carabell", "paragraphs": ["Federal courts continue to have a key role in interpreting and clarifying the SWANCC decision. In February 2006, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases brought by landowners ( Rapanos v s . United States ; Carabell v s . U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ) seeking to narrow the scope of the CWA permit program as it applies to development of wetlands. The issue in both cases had to do with the reach of the CWA to cover \"waters\" that were not navigable waters, in the traditional sense, but were connected somehow to navigable waters or \"adjacent\" to those waters. (The act requires a federal permit to discharge dredged or fill materials into \"navigable waters.\") Many legal and other observers hoped that the Court's ruling in these cases would bring greater clarity about the scope of federal regulatory jurisdiction.", "The Court's ruling was issued on June 19, 2006 ( Rapanos et al., v s . United States , 547 U.S. 715 (2006)). In a 5-4 decision, a plurality of the Court, led by Justice Scalia, held that the lower court had applied an incorrect standard to determine whether the wetlands at issue are covered by the CWA. Justice Kennedy joined this plurality to vacate the lower court decisions and remand the cases for further consideration, but he took different positions on most of the substantive issues raised by the cases, as did four other dissenting Justices. Legal observers suggested that the implications of the ruling (both short-term and long-term) are far from clear. Because the several opinions written by the Justices did not draw a clear line regarding what wetlands and other waters are subject to federal jurisdiction, one result has been more case-by-case determinations and continuing litigation. ", "In 2008, EPA and the Corps issued guidance to enable their field staffs to make CWA jurisdictional determinations in light of the decision. According to the nonbinding guidance, the agencies would assert regulatory jurisdiction over certain waters, such as traditional navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. Jurisdiction over others, such as non-navigable tributaries that do not typically flow year-round and wetlands adjacent to such tributaries, would be determined on a case-by-case basis, to determine if the waters in question have a significant nexus with a traditional navigable water. The guidance details how the agencies should evaluate whether there is a significant nexus. The guidance was not intended to increase or decrease CWA jurisdiction, and it did not supersede or nullify the 2003 guidance memorandum, discussed above, which addressed jurisdiction over isolated wetlands in light of SWANCC . The guidance said that waters are jurisdictional if they satisfy either the plurality or Kennedy tests in Rapanos . The 2008 guidance also provided detail for determining whether a wetland is adjacent to a traditional navigable water and whether a tributary of a navigable water is subject to the act\u2014key issues raised by the Rapanos decision.", "In 2011, the Obama Administration weighed into the CWA jurisdiction debate as EPA and the Corps proposed new joint agency guidance to clarify regulatory jurisdiction over U.S. waters and wetlands and to replace the agencies' 2008 guidance. Like the existing guidance, the proposed revisions would adopt the Kennedy-test-or-plurality-test view of interpreting Rapanos . However, the agencies believed that a wider evaluation of jurisdiction is possible than the existing guidance suggests, stating, \"after careful review of these opinions, the agencies concluded that previous guidance did not make full use of the authority provided by the CWA to include waters within the scope of the Act, as interpreted by the Court.\" ", "The 2011 proposed guidance quickly generated substantial controversy. Some critics argued that the guidance represented over-reaching by the agencies, beyond authority provided by Congress. Others faulted the continued reliance on federal guidance, which is not binding and lacks the force of law, yet can have significant impact on regulated entities. For various reasons, the 2011 draft guidance was not finalized, and in 2013, EPA and the Corps announced that the document had been withdrawn from interagency review and also announced that revised regulations to define \"waters of the United States\" were being developed. In March 2014, the agencies released a proposed rule that was intended to clarify CWA jurisdiction, but the proposal was extremely controversial. Groups representing property owners, land developers, and the agriculture sector contended that it was a massive federal overreach beyond the agencies' statutory authority. Most state and local officials are supportive of clarifying the extent of CWA-regulated waters, but some were concerned that the rule could impose costs on states and localities as their own actions (e.g., transportation or public infrastructure projects) become subject to new requirements.

Much of the controversy since the Court's rulings has centered on the many instances that have required applicants for CWA permits to seek a time-consuming case-specific evaluation to determine if CWA jurisdiction applies to their activity, due to uncertainty over the geographic scope of the act. In the rule, the Corps and EPA intended to clarify jurisdictional questions by clearly articulating categories of waters that are and are not protected by the CWA and thus limiting the types of waters that still require case-specific analysis. However, critical response to the proposal from industry, agriculture, many states, and some local governments was that the rule was vague and ambiguous and could be interpreted to enlarge the regulatory jurisdiction of the CWA beyond what the statute and the courts allow.", "Officials of the Corps and EPA vigorously defended the proposed rule. But they acknowledged that it raised questions that required clarification in the final rule. The 2015 final rule does reflect a number of changes from the proposal, especially to provide more bright line boundaries and simplify definitions that identify waters that are protected under the CWA.

Although efforts focused on preventing oil from reaching coastal shorelines, some oil escaped capture and was pushed by wind and tides toward land. The degrees of impacts of oil on wetland vegetation are variable and complex and can be both acute and chronic, ranging from short-term disruption of plant functioning to mortality. The primary acute damage to the marshes is that plants, which hold the soil in place and stabilize shoreline, suffocate and die, especially if multiple coatings of oil occur. Once vegetation dies, the soil collapses. Then the soil becomes flooded, and plants cannot regrow. If plants cannot reestablish, soil erosion is accelerated, giving rise to even more flooding and further wetland loss. If oil penetrates into the sediments, roots are continuously exposed to oil, with chronic toxicity making production of new shoots problematic. Consequently, plant recovery is diminished, and eventually land loss occurs. In addition to direct impacts on plants, oil that reaches wetlands also affects animals that use wetlands during their life cycle, especially benthic organisms that reside in the sediments and are a foundation of the food chain.", "Public and private efforts were taken to protect the wetlands from oil that moved through Gulf waters towards coastal areas, but scientists remained concerned that high tides and wind could push oil into the marshes, and that the grasses and other vegetation that provide habitat for fish and wildlife would likely be destroyed. Wetland plants can be affected both by oil that floats over the surface of the marsh and by oil that has been incorporated into sediment. While oil was still flowing from the Deepwater Horizon site, cleanup of marshes was limited to triage of heavily oiled marshes and wetlands, because experts were concerned that greater harm than good could be done to the sensitive environmental ecosystems. The well was capped, and oil stopped flowing from the well site in mid-July 2010. Experts say that spill response efforts succeeded in keeping large amounts of oil from reaching coastal marshes. Nevertheless, oil remains in the Gulf environment, and potential for re-oiling of coastal areas, for example as a result of storms, will remain a concern for some time.", "A recent federal report observes that Louisiana's Coast 2050 is a comprehensive plan to protect and restore the state's coastal wetlands, but that other Gulf of Mexico states are only beginning similar planning processes for restoration of the damage caused by the Deepwater Horizon spill."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wetland Restoration and Mitigation", "paragraphs": ["Mitigation has become an important cornerstone of the Section 404 program in recent years. A 1990 MOA signed by the agencies with principal regulatory responsibilities (EPA and the Corps) outlines a sequence of three steps leading to mitigation: first, activities in wetlands should be avoided when possible; second, when they cannot be avoided, impacts should be minimized; and third, where minimum impacts are still unacceptable, mitigation is appropriate. Therefore, to compensate for such impacts, mitigation may be required as a condition of a Section 404 permit. Compensatory mitigation is typically accomplished through one of three ways: a mitigation bank, in-lieu fee program, or permittee-responsible mitigation.", "Federal wetland policies during the past 30 years have increasingly emphasized restoration of wetland areas. Much of this restoration occurs as part of efforts to mitigate the loss of wetlands at other sites. The mitigation concept has broad appeal, but implementation has left a conflicting record. Examination of this record, presented in a 2001 report from the National Research Council, found it to be wanting. The NRC report said that mitigation projects called for in permits affecting wetlands were not meeting the federal government's \"no net loss\" policy goal for wetlands function. Likewise, a 2001 GAO report criticized the ability of the Corps to track the impact of projects under its current mitigation program that allows in-lieu-fee mitigation projects in exchange for issuing permits allowing wetlands development. Both scientists and policymakers debate whether it is possible to restore or create wetlands with ecological and other functions equivalent to or better than those of natural wetlands that have been lost over time. Results so far seem to vary, depending on the type of wetland and the level of commitment to monitoring and maintenance. ", "Some wetland protection advocates are critical of mitigation, which they view as justifying destruction of wetlands. They believe that the Section 404 permit program should be an inducement to avoid damaging wetland areas. These critics also contend that adverse impacts on wetland values are often not fully mitigated and that mitigation measures, even if well-designed, are not adequately monitored or maintained. Supporters of current efforts counter that they generally work as envisioned, but little data exist to support this view. Questions about implementation of the 1990 MOA and controversies over the feasibility of compensating for wetland losses further complicate the wetland protection debate.", "In response to criticism in the NRC and GAO reports on mitigation, in 2001, the Corps issued new guidance to strengthen the standards on compensating for wetlands lost to development. But the guidance was criticized by environmental groups and some Members of Congress for weakening rather than strengthening mitigation requirements and for the Corps' failure to consult with other federal agencies. In 2002, the Corps and EPA released an action plan including 17 items that both agencies believed would improve the effectiveness of wetlands restoration efforts.", "In Section 314 of the 2004 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, P.L. 108-136 ), Congress directed the Army Corps to develop regulations, consistent with CWA Section 404, that establish equivalent standards and criteria for mitigation banks, in-lieu fee programs, and permittee-responsible mitigation. ", "In 2008, in response to the NRC and GAO reports and the NDAA directive, the Corps and EPA promulgated a mitigation rule to replace the 1990 MOA with clearer requirements on what will be considered a successful project to compensate for wetlands lost to activities like construction, mining, and agriculture. The rule sets performance standards and criteria for three types of wetlands mitigation: mitigation banks, in-lieu programs, and permittee-responsible compensatory mitigation. It sets standards to mitigate the loss of wetlands and associated aquatic resources and is intended to improve the planning, implementation, and management of compensatory mitigation projects designed to restore aquatic resources that are affected by activities that disturb a half-acre or more of wetlands. It also is designed to help ensure no net loss of wetlands by addressing key recommendations raised in the 2001 NRC report. Under the rule, all compensation projects must have mitigation plans that include 12 fundamental components, such as objectives, site selection criteria, a mitigation work plan, and a maintenance plan. Mitigation banks are believed to be the most reliable form of compensatory mitigation, because the mitigation is undertaken before an activity that would affect aquatic resources is permitted, and thus are the preferred option under the 2008 rule. ", "In 2015, the Corps and EPA completed a retrospective review of the 2008 rule. Among its main findings was that, as a result of the rule, impacts to wetlands and waters covered by the CWA are avoided and minimized as much as possible. It also found that there has been an increased focus on stream mitigation since the rule's release and that the use of mitigation banking and ILF programs to meet compensatory mitigation requirements has reduced permitting times, while permit processing times for projects that utilize permittee-responsible mitigation have been increasing. For Corps-permitted authorizations between 2010 and 2014 that required compensatory mitigation, 41% of projects used mitigation bank credits, 11% used in-lieu fee program credits, and 48% did permittee-responsible mitigation.", "Numerous public and private banks have been established. In a study of mitigation, the Environmental Law Institute determined that as of 2005, there were 330 active banks. More recent data paint a larger picture. According to the Army Corps, as of September 2016, there are 1,521 approved and active mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs. ", "For permit applicants, obtaining compensatory mitigation credits for a planned project can be a challenge, and concerns about a mitigation bank program with available credits not being located sufficiently close to a project site are not unknown, as are concerns about the established price of credits. Mitigation banks are economics-driven, that is, if bankers do not see a potential market or potential development that will need credits and do not see a potential profit opportunity, banks will not be established. The market for mitigation bank credits depends upon the demand for credits, which, in turn, depends upon mandates for compensatory mitigation for unavoidable losses to aquatic resources. Potential bankers face market and regulatory risks. A sponsor's decision to establish a bank is likely influenced by many factors, including cost and demand. Under the 2008 rule, the Corps does not determine the price of compensatory mitigation credits, which is solely determined by the sponsor of the mitigation bank or ILF program.", "Congress has repeatedly endorsed mitigation through legislation. Provisions in several laws, such as the farm bill and the 1998 Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21), endorse the mitigation banking concept. In 2003, Congress enacted wetlands mitigation provisions as part of the FY2004 Department of Defense (DOD) authorization act ( P.L. 108-136 ). Section 314 of that act directed DOD to make payments to wetland mitigation banking programs in instances where military construction projects would result or could result in destruction of or impacts to wetlands. Further, the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2007 ( P.L. 110-114 ) identified mitigation banking as the preferred mechanism for offsetting unavoidable wetland impacts associated with Corps civil works projects."], "subsections": []}]}}
