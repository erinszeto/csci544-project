Following the attacks, this ceased to be the case as insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage. It was feared that a lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wider economic impact, particularly because insurance coverage can be a significant factor in lending decisions.", "Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA; P.L. 107-297). TRIA created a temporary program, expiring at the end of 2005, to calm the insurance markets through a government reinsurance backstop sharing in terrorism losses. The intent was that this would give the industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk. TRIA did not require premiums to be paid for the government coverage. Instead, TRIA required private insurers to offer commercial insurance for terrorism risk with the government then recouping some or all federal payments under the act in the years following government coverage of insurer losses.", "Under TRIA, terrorism insurance became widely available and largely affordable, and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity. There has been, however, little apparent success on developing a longer-term private solution, and fears have persisted about wider economic consequences if insurance were not available. Congress passed two extensions to the program, in 2005 (P.L. 109-144) and 2007 (P.L. 110-160). The 2005 extension was primarily focused on reducing the government's upfront financial exposure under the act, whereas the 2007 extension left most of the upfront aspect of the TRIA program unchanged, while accelerating the post-event recoupment provisions. The 2007 legislation also included the only expansion of the TRIA program since initial enactment; it extended the program to cover any acts of terrorism, as opposed to only foreign acts of terrorism.", "The current TRIA program expires at the end of 2014. Although insurance industry capacity has increased since 2002, terrorism is still seen by many as essentially uninsurable. Without TRIA, the insurance industry has indicated that terrorism insurance will again become unavailable or unaffordable and fears are again being expressed that lack of terrorism insurance may slow down other sectors of the economy. Several bills (H.R. 508, H.R. 1945, H.R. 2146, S. 2244, and H.R. 4871) were introduced to extend TRIA and change different aspects of the program. The House and the Senate adjourned on December 16, 2014, without passing legislation to extend TRIA.", "This report briefly outlines the issues involved with terrorism insurance, summarizes extension legislation in the 113th Congress, and includes a side-by-side of TRIA law and bills that were passed by the Senate (S. 2244), reported by the House Committee on Financial Services (H.R. 4871), and passed by the House (S. 2244 with a substitute amendment).

Following the attacks, both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage. Because insurance is required for a variety of economic transactions, particularly borrowing for commercial development, it was feared that a lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have a wider economic impact.", "Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). TRIA created a temporary three-year Terrorism Insurance Program to calm the insurance markets through a government reinsurance backstop sharing in terrorism losses. The idea was to give the private industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insurance to cover terrorism risk. TRIA requires insurers to offer terrorism coverage, but does not require commercial policyholders to purchase the coverage. This program was extended in 2005 and 2007. In 2005, the extension legislation focused on reducing the government's exposure from TRIA by increasing the minimum covered event size, increasing the insurer deductible, reducing the government share of losses, and increasing the post-event mandatory recoupment. In 2007, the primary change was to accelerate the after-the-fact recoupment. While the prospective government share of losses has been reduced over time, the 2007 reauthorization also expanded the program to cover losses from acts of domestic terrorism. The TRIA program expired at the end of 2014, as provided for in the 2007 extension.", "The initial thresholds of the current program are as follows: ", "1. A terrorist act must cause $5\u00a0million in insured losses to be certified for TRIA coverage. 2. The aggregate insured losses from a certified act of terrorism must be $100 million in a year for the government coverage to begin. 3. An individual insurer must meet a deductible of 20% of its annual premiums for the government coverage to begin. ", "Once these thresholds are passed, the government covers 85% of insured losses due to terrorism with the private insurers retaining 15% of the losses. No premiums are charged by the government for this coverage. Instead, if the insured losses are under $27.5 billion, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to recoup 133% of government outlays through a surcharge on commercial property/casualty insurance policies. As insured losses rise above $27.5 billion, the Secretary is required to recoup a reduced amount of the outlays. At some high insured loss level, which will depend on the exact distribution of losses, the Secretary would no longer be required to recoup outlays, but would retain the discretionary authority to do so. Under current law, all mandatory recoupment must be completed by the end of FY2017.", "Since TRIA's passage, private industry's willingness and ability to cover terrorism risk have increased. According to industry surveys, prices for terrorism coverage have generally trended downward, and approximately 60% of commercial policyholders have purchased coverage over the past few years. This relative market calm has been under the umbrella of TRIA coverage, and it is unclear how the insurance market may react to the expiration of the federal program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislation in the 113th Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 508)", "paragraphs": ["Representative Michael Grimm along with nine cosponsors introduced H.R. 508 on February 5, 2013.
