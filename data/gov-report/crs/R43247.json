{"id": "R43247", "title": "Disposal of Unneeded Federal Buildings: Legislative Proposals in the 113th Congress", "released_date": "2014-06-16T00:00:00", "summary": ["Real property disposal is the process by which federal agencies identify and then transfer, donate, or sell real property they no longer need. Disposition is an important asset management function because the costs of maintaining unneeded properties can be substantial, consuming financial resources that might be applied to long-standing real property needs, such as repairing existing facilities, or other pressing policy issues, such as reducing the national debt.", "Despite the expense, federal agencies hold thousands of unneeded and underutilized properties. Agencies have argued that they are unable to dispose of these properties for several reasons. First, there are statutorily prescribed steps in the disposal process that can take months to complete. Second, agencies are often required to complete major repairs or environmental remediation before properties are ready for disposal\u2014steps for which agencies lack funding. Third, key stakeholders in the disposal process\u2014including local governments, non-profit organizations, and businesses\u2014are often at odds over how to dispose of properties. In addition, Congress may be limited in its capacity to conduct oversight of the disposal process because it currently lacks access to reliable, comprehensive real property data.", "Four bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress that propose significant changes to the existing real property disposal system. The Federal Real Property Asset Management Reform Act of 2013 (S. 1398), would establish an expedited disposal program under which 200 properties would be exempt from time-consuming, statutory disposal requirements. In addition, S. 1398 would expand the role of an interagency workgroup, the Federal Real Property Council, to set disposal goals for agencies and monitor their progress in meeting those goals. The bill would also increase oversight of agency disposal activities by requiring the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to establish a real property database available to the public at no cost.", "The Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act of 2013 (H.R. 328) would establish an expedited disposal program under which the 15 unneeded federal properties with the highest fair market value would bypass statutory disposal requirements and be offered for sale immediately. H.R. 328 would also require the GSA Administrator to establish a real property database available to the public at no cost and provide a report to Congress on the progress each landholding agency has made in reducing its unneeded property.", "Two similar, but not identical, versions of the Civilian Property Realignment Act (H.R. 695, S. 1715) have been introduced. Both bills would have the same overarching structure. They would centralize the disposal process by establishing a Civilian Property Realignment Commission, which would work with agencies to develop a list of disposal recommendations to the President. If the President approved the recommendations, then they would be sent to Congress. If Congress passed a joint resolution of approval, then agencies would be required to implement the recommendations; if a joint resolution of approval was not passed, then the realignment process would end for the fiscal year."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Federal executive branch agencies hold an extensive real property portfolio that includes approximately 361,000 buildings. These assets have been acquired over a period of decades to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions. Agencies hold buildings with a range of uses, including offices, health clinics, warehouses, and laboratories. As agencies' missions change over time, so, too, do their real property needs, thereby rendering some assets less useful or unneeded altogether. Healthcare provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has shifted in recent decades from predominately hospital-based inpatient care to a greater reliance on clinics and outpatient care, with a resulting change in space needs. Similarly, the Department of Defense (DOD) reduced its force by 36% after the Cold War ended, and has engaged in several rounds of base realignments and installation closures.", "Agencies are required to dispose of real property that they no longer need, but many continue to hold onto unneeded building space. In FY2010, the government held 77,700 buildings it identified as either not utilized or underutilized and spent $1.67 billion operating and maintaining them. Federal agencies have indicated that their disposal efforts are often hampered by legal and budgetary disincentives, and competing stakeholder interests. ", "This report begins with an explanation of the real property disposal process and then discusses some of the factors that have made disposition relatively inefficient and costly. It then examines key provisions of four real property reform bills introduced in the 113 th Congress: the Federal Real Property Asset Management Reform Act of 2013 ( S. 1398 ); the Excess Federal Building and Property Disposal Act of 2013 ( H.R. 328 ); and two versions of the Civilian Property Realignment Act of 2013 ( H.R. 695 , S. 1715 ), which take similar, but not identical approaches to reforming the real property disposal process. This report concludes with a discussion of policy options for enhancing the disposal process, including the potential use of Public-Private Partnerships to generate revenue from underutilized properties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obstacles to Timely and Efficient Disposition", "paragraphs": ["As noted, the government maintains a large inventory of unneeded or underutilized properties. These properties not only incur costs to the government to operate and maintain, but could, in some instances, be utilized by nonfederal entities\u2014state and local governments, nonprofits, private sector businesses\u2014to accomplish a range of public purposes, such as providing services to the homeless, or facilitating economic development. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reports have consistently noted that efforts to dispose of unneeded and underutilized properties are hindered by statutory disposal requirements, the cost of preparing properties for disposal, conflicts with stakeholders, and a lack of accurate data. Each of these issues is discussed here."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Identifying Unneeded Space", "paragraphs": ["Agencies are required to continuously survey property under their control to identify any property that it no longer needs to carry out its mission\u2014excess property\u2014and to \"promptly\" report that property as excess to the General Services Administration (GSA). Agencies are then required to follow the regulations prescribed by GSA when disposing of unneeded property or to follow independent or delegated statutory authority. GSA's regulations, in turn, implement statutory disposal requirements, discussed below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutory Disposal Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The steps in the real property disposal process are set by statute. Agencies must first offer to transfer properties they do not need (excess properties) to other federal agencies, who generally pay market value for excess properties they wish to acquire. Unneeded properties that are not acquired by federal agencies (surplus properties) must then be offered to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for use in accomplishing public purposes specified in statute, such as use as public parks or for providing services to the homeless. Agencies may convey surplus properties to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for public benefit at less than fair market value\u2014even at no cost. Surplus properties not conveyed for public benefit are then available for sale at fair market value or are demolished if the property could not be sold due to the condition or location of the property.", "Agencies have consistently argued that these statutory requirements slow down the disposition process, compelling agencies to incur operating costs for months\u2014sometimes years\u2014while the properties are being screened. Real property officials at the VA have said the McKinney-Vento Act ( P.L. 100-77 )\u2014which mandates that all surplus property be screened for homeless use\u2014can add as much as two years to the disposal process. Because public benefit conveyance requirements are set in law, agencies do not have the authority to skip screening, even for surplus properties that could not be conveyed anyway. The Department of Energy (DOE), for example, told auditors that they had properties that they felt could be disposed of only by demolition, due to their condition or location, but that still had to go through the screening process, thereby forcing DOE to pay maintenance costs that could have been avoided.", "Statutes pertaining to environmental remediation or historic preservation also add time to the process. It may take agencies years of study to assess the potential environmental consequences of a proposed disposal and to develop and implement an abatement plan, as required by law. Similarly, the National Historic Preservation Act requires agencies to plan their disposal actions so as to minimize the harm they cause to historic properties, which may include additional procedures, such as consulting with historic preservation groups at the state, local, and federal level. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposal Costs", "paragraphs": ["Unneeded buildings are often among the older properties in an agency's portfolio. As a consequence, agencies sometimes find expensive repairs and renovations may be needed before the properties are fully functioning, meet health and safety standards, and comply with historic preservation requirements. It has been estimated, for example, that VA would need to spend about $3 billion to repair the buildings in its portfolio that it rated in \"poor\" or \"critical\" condition\u201456% of which were vacant or underutilized, and therefore might be candidates for disposal. The poor condition of these properties, however, may deter potential buyers or lessees, particularly if they must cover the cost of required improvements as a condition of acquiring the properties. Similarly, agencies that wish to demolish vacant buildings face deconstruction and cleanup costs that, at times, exceed the cost of maintaining the property\u2014at least in the short run\u2014which may encourage real property managers to retain a property rather than dispose of it. Federal agencies frequently cite the cost of complying with environmental regulations as a major disincentive to disposal. Generally speaking, agencies are required to assess and pay for any environmental cleanup that may be needed before disposing of a property. Identifying and addressing environmental hazards, such as lead paint, asbestos, medical waste, and soil contamination, prior to disposition can result in \"significant\" costs for agencies. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholder Conflict", "paragraphs": ["Some agencies have found their disposal efforts complicated by the involvement of stakeholders with competing agendas. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has said that it can be stymied by the competing concerns of local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and political factors, when attempting to dispose of some of its unneeded real property. Similarly, VA has found that communities sometimes oppose disposals that would result in new development, and veterans groups have opposed disposing of building space if that space would be used for purposes unrelated to the needs of veterans. The Department of State (DOS) has had difficulty in disposing of surplus real property overseas due to disputes with host governments that restrict property sales. These conflicts can result in delay, or even cancellation of proposed disposals, which, in turn, prevent agencies from reducing their inventories of unneeded properties. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Real Property Management and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the obstacles mentioned above, data about agency real property portfolios\u2014which might be useful for congressional oversight\u2014appear to be inaccurate, and government-wide data are accessible only to the agency that manages the database, the GSA. Moreover, agencies regularly enter into leases rather than seek funding for new construction when acquiring space, even when the leased space is more expensive over time. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Availability and Quality of Real Property Data", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) is the government's most comprehensive source of information about real property under the control of executive branch agencies. GSA manages the FRPP and collects real property data from 24 of the largest landholding agencies each year. Other agencies are encouraged, but not required, to report data to GSA. The data elements that participating agencies collect and report are determined by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), an interagency taskforce that is funded and chaired by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The other members of the FRPC are agency senior real property officers (SRPOs) and GSA.", "The FRPP contains data that could enhance congressional oversight of federal real property activities, such as the number of excess and surplus properties held by major landholding agencies, the annual costs of maintaining those properties, and agency disposition actions. GSA, however, does not permit direct access to the FRPP by Congress on the grounds that the data are proprietary. GSA does respond to requests for real property data from congressional offices, but GSA staff query the database and provide the results to the requestor.", "Some FRPP data are made public through an annual summary report posted on GSA's website, but the summary reports are of limited use for congressional oversight for several reasons. Most of the data are highly aggregated (e.g., the number of assets disposed of, government-wide, through public benefit conveyance), and very limited information is provided on an agency-by-agency basis. It is not possible, therefore, for Congress to monitor the performance of individual agencies through the summary reports. Basic questions, such as how many excess and surplus properties each agency holds or has disposed of in a given fiscal year, cannot be answered. Nor is it possible to compare the performance of agencies, which limits the ability of Congress to study the policies and practices at the most successful agencies and hold poorly performing agencies accountable. ", "The quality of the FRPP data has also been questioned. GAO audits have found, for example, that some real property data were incomplete or were not comparable across agencies, which limited the usefulness of those data for analysis. A recent GAO report declared that the FRPP had not been populated through sound data collection practices and key data elements\u2014such as a building's utilization, condition, annual operating costs, mission dependency, and value\u2014are not consistently and accurately captured in the database. The GAO report concluded that FRPP users \"cannot be sure that the data are sufficiently reliable to support sound management and decision making about excess and underutilized property.\"", "In addition, annual summary reports based on FRPP data may miscategorize important information on disposal methods. As discussed previously, agencies are statutorily required to dispose of properties through transfer, conveyance, sale, or demolition. Recently published FRPC summary reports, however, identify \"other\" as the largest or second largest category of property disposal, accounting for 46% of the total number of real property assets disposed by agencies in FY2007, nearly 73% of those disposed in FY2008, 41% in FY2009, and 33% in FY2010. Typically, the \"other\" data category is reserved for a relatively small number of cases that do not clearly fit into one of the major data categories, so it is unusual to see such a large number of \"other\" dispositions. In fact, the FRPP defines \"other\" disposals as those \"that cannot be classified in any of the other disposition methods.\" The annual reports, however, do not explain why so many disposals cannot be classified as transfer, conveyance, sale, or demolition. One explanation may be that agencies are misreporting their disposal data; another may be that some disposals are a combination of methods. If so, then the data reported for all types of dispositions may be of limited use, because thousands of properties may have been miscategorized.", "The annual summary reports also omit data that might enhance congressional oversight. The FRPP contains, for example, the number of excess and surplus properties held by each agency and the annual operating costs of those properties\u2014issues about which Congress has expressed ongoing interest\u2014but the summary report only provides the number and annual operating costs of disposed assets, thereby providing the \"good news\" of future costs avoided through disposition while omitting the \"bad news\" of the ongoing operating costs associated with excess and surplus properties the government maintained. In addition, agencies estimate a dollar amount for the repair needs of their buildings and structures as part of their FRPP reporting, but the estimate is then folded into a formula for calculating the condition of each building. Given that repair needs are an obstacle to disposing of some properties, Congress may find it useful to have the repair estimates reported separately to help inform funding decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overreliance on Leasing", "paragraphs": ["In a 2011 report, GAO wrote that it considers the government's \"overreliance on costly leased space\" to be one of the primary reasons federal real property continues to be designated as a \"high risk\" issue. The percentage of square feet leased by GSA\u2014which leases property for itself and on behalf of many agencies\u2014now exceeds the percentage of square feet it owns. According to GAO, leasing space is typically more expensive than owning space over the same time period. GAO cited, for example, a long-term operating lease that cost an estimated $40.3 million more than if the agency had purchased the same building. Similarly, in FY2010, the annual operating cost for a square foot of space in a building owned by the government was $5.30, but for leased space it was $15.00.", "GAO wrote that while the decision to lease rather than purchase space may be driven by operational requirements\u2014such as the United States Postal Service (USPS) leasing space in areas that it believes will optimize the efficiency of mail delivery\u2014agencies often choose to lease rather than purchase space because of budget scoring rules, even if the decision to lease is not the most cost-effective option. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, an agency must have budget authority up-front for the government's total legal commitment before acquiring space. Thus, if an agency were to construct or purchase a building, it would need up-front funding for the entire cost of the construction or acquisition, while leased space only requires the annual lease payment plus the cost of terminating the lease agreement.", "In addition to the budget scoring issue, some agencies have been granted independent leasing authority, which means they do not have to work with GSA to acquire leased space. Some agencies with independent leasing authority, such as the USPS and VA, have established in-house real property expertise, while other agencies with independent authority have not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, entered into a $557 million, 10-year lease for 900,000 square feet, which the SEC's inspector general (IG) called \"another in a long history of missteps and misguided leasing decisions made by the SEC since it was granted independent leasing authority.\" The IG found that \"inexperienced senior management\" at the SEC made poor decisions that led to acquiring three times the space needed\u2014the original estimate provided to Congress was for 300,000 square feet\u2014and bypassing other locations that were closer and less expensive."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "S. 1398: Federal Real Property Asset Management Reform Act of 2013", "paragraphs": ["S. 1398 was introduced on July 30, 2013, and referred to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Generally, each of the bills would apply net proceeds towards further real property disposals and reducing the federal deficit or debt. It is not clear, however, that much revenue might be generated under each bill, given the lack of even the most basic data needed for analysis. For example, it is not known how many excess, surplus, and underutilized properties are held by each agency, how much it would cost to bring each property to market, and the estimated fair market value of individual properties. FRPP data show that sales have not generated significant net proceeds\u2014the amount of revenue remaining after the cost of bringing the property to market is deducted\u2014in recent years. For example, in FY2010, the government sold 466 properties that generated in $57 million in net proceeds, and in FY2009 the government sold 2,228 properties that generated $50 million in net proceeds. The costs of bringing properties to market\u2014whether they are due to environmental remediation or historic preservation requirements\u2014or the undesirable location of unneeded properties are among reasons that so little profit is generated through sales. The proposed bills may increase sales revenue, however, by bringing properties to market that are in more desirable locations. H.R. 695 , for example, would both require the Civilian Property Realignment Commission to recommend at least five properties that are not identified as excess or surplus\u2014and therefore not subject to disposal requirements\u2014but which have relatively high fair market value ($500 million). Similarly, under S. 1398 the Director of OMB would have the authority to require agencies to sell properties that are not excess or surplus. If agencies are holding properties that are valuable, and which they have not declared excess\u2014the first step in the disposal process\u2014then these bills may provide a mechanism by which those properties may be brought to the market and possibly generate greater net proceeds than sales have in recent years. H.R. 328 would limit the scope of its real property disposal pilot program to properties that are declared excess or surplus, but it might also increase sales revenue and net proceeds by bringing the 15 properties most likely to sell at a high market value to be auctioned. If agencies invest their real property funds in bringing these properties to market as soon as possible, then valuable properties which might otherwise have been conveyed or slowly moving through the screening process would be up for sale weeks, months, or even years sooner than under the current process.", "FRPP data also show that the reduction of operating and maintenance costs has yielded greater annual savings to the government than net proceeds from sales have. In FY2010 the government reduced its annual operating costs by $274 million\u2014four times the amount of net proceeds from sales that same year. These figures do not include savings reported in the FRPP data that are the result of transferring properties between federal agencies, since the operating and maintenance costs have only been shifted from one agency to another, not eliminated.", "There are underutilized and vacant properties, perhaps thousands of them, which agencies cannot dispose of because they lack the funding to make needed repairs. The total cost of these repairs government-wide is not known, but several agencies have reported repair backlogs in excess of $1 billion. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) may be an option for funding some of these repairs. While PPPs may be structured in many different ways, they generally entail a contractual relationship between a non-federal entity\u2014defined here as a private sector entity or state or local government\u2014and a federal agency, in which the non-federal entity provides the capital to renovate or develop an underutilized property in return for a share of the revenue the improved property generates. Some agencies have the authority to enter into specific types of PPPs\u2014the Department of Veterans Affairs can enter into enhanced use leases, for example\u2014which has enabled them to generate positive cash flow from underutilized or vacant properties. Expanding PPP authorities, however, might come with risks to the government.
