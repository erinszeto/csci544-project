[A] person cannot be subjected to the sanctions [of RICO] simply for committing two widely separate and isolated criminal offenses. Instead, the term 'pattern' itself requires the showing of a relationship between the predicates and of the threat of continuing activity. It is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern.\"", "ii. Related predicates : The commission of predicate offenses forms the requisite related pattern if the \"criminal acts ... have the same or similar purposes, results, participants, victims, or methods of commission, or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events.\"", "iii. Continuity : The law recognizes continuity in two forms, pre-existing (\"closed-ended\") and anticipated (\"open-ended\"). The first is characterized by \"a series of related predicates, extending over a substantial period of time. Predicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement.\" The second exists when a series of related predicates has begun and, but for intervention, would be a threat to continue in the future. The Supreme Court has characterized a pattern extending over a period of time but which posed no threat of reoccurrence as a pattern with \"closed-ended\" continuity; and a pattern marked by a threat of reoccurrence as a pattern with \"open-ended continuity.\"", "In the case of a \"closed-ended\" pattern, the lower courts have been reluctant to find predicate activity extending over less than a year sufficient for the \"substantial period[s] of time\" required to demonstrate continuity. ", "Whether the threat of future predicate activity is sufficient to recognize an \"open-ended\" pattern of continuity depends upon the nature of the predicate offenses and the nature of the enterprise. \"Though the number of related predicates involved may be small and they may occur close together in time, the racketeering acts themselves include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future, and thus supply the requisite continuity.

Offenders sentenced to prison are also sentenced to a term of supervised release of not more than three years to be served following their release from incarceration.

If the underlying violation involves subsection 1962(d) (conspiracy to violate subsections 1962(a), (b), or (c)), the injury must follow from the conspiracy. Moreover, while a criminal conspiracy prosecution under subsection 1962(d) requires no overt act, RICO plaintiffs whose claim is based on a conspiracy under subsection 1962(d) must prove an overt act that is a predicate offense or one of the substantive RICO offenses, since a mere agreement cannot be the direct or proximate cause of an injury.

This authority has been invoked relatively infrequently, primarily to rid various unions of organized crime and other forms of corruption. There is some question whether private plaintiffs, in addition to the Attorney General, may seek injunctive and other forms of equitable relief.", "On the procedural side, RICO's long-arm jurisdictional provisions authorize nationwide service of process.

For it, the Supreme Court has long adhered to the so-called \" Blockburger \" test under which offenses are considered the same when they have the same elements, that is, unless each requires proof of an element not required of the other. In the RICO context, the courts have held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar successive RICO prosecutions of the same defendants on charges of involving different predicate offenses, enterprises, or patterns. They have been more receptive to double jeopardy concerns in the case of successive prosecutions of the same enterprise. There, they have invoked a totality of the circumstances test which asks: \"(1) the time of the various activities charged as parts of [the] separate patterns; (2) the identity of the persons involved in the activities under each charge; (3) the statutory offenses charged as racketeering activities in each charge; (4) the nature and scope of the activity the government seeks to punish under each charge; and (5) the places where the activities took place under each charge.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "3.
