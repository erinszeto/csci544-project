The two models collectively estimate the amount of budgetary resources VHA will need to meet the expected demand for most of the health care services it provides.

Each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of VA health care and the veterans who access VA's health care services. The EHCPM makes projections three or four years into the future. Each year, VHA updates the EHCPM estimates to \"incorporate the most recent data on health care utilization rates, actual program experience, and other factors, such as economic trends in unemployment and inflation.\" For instance, in 2014, VHA used data from FY2013 to develop its health care budget estimate for the FY2016 request, including the advance appropriations request for FY2017. ", "The CHAMPVA Model is a more recent model adopted by VHA in 2010. The CHAMPVA model projects the cost of providing medical coverage to CHAMPVA-eligible beneficiaries. The CHAMPVA Model is composed of two major components: the enrollment model and the claims cost model. The enrollment model projects the number of beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA, and the claims cost model projects expenditures for providing care to beneficiaries.
