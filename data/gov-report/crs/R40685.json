The ruling of the U.S. Court of Appeals could potentially apply to $23-$31 billion in future OCS royalties according to the MMS, but may not affect congressional efforts to impose new fees or establish new lease eligibility criteria. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates the range of royalty revenue loss to the Treasury at $21-$53 billion over 25 years. The ranges of MMS and GAO estimated losses are based on assumptions including future prices and production rates.

Most of the appropriations for federal acquisitions generally are specified for management units, such as a specific National Wildlife Refuge. The FY2010 appropriation for land acquisition was more than double the level of five years ago\u2014$111.9 million for FY2006. The variability of funding for this activity throughout history reflects a tension regarding the extent of federal land ownership.", "The conferees on the FY2010 bill expressed concern with the processes for acquiring lands, and provided several related directives to the agencies. Conferees directed the agencies to use funds for inholdings to acquire high-priority lands that are threatened by development, and address delays in conducting land appraisals, including by considering alternative organizational structures. The conferees expressed their intention that, to the maximum extent possible, there be a single set of policies among the four agencies for conducting land acquisitions. They directed the DOI and Agriculture Secretaries to jointly examine their acquisition policies and practices and to submit a report with findings and recommendations to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Further, the conferees expressed concern that lands acquired with LWCF funds are being used in ways inconsistent with the recreation, conservation, or public access uses for which they were purchased, and directed the DOI and Agriculture Secretaries to notify the Appropriations Committees before changing the use of the lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grants to States", "paragraphs": ["For stateside grants, the FY2010 appropriation was $40.0 million.
