The Clinton Administration essentially continued this isolationpolicy. The principal tool of policy remains comprehensive sanctions, which were made strongerwith the Cuban Democracy Act (CDA) in 1992 and the Cuban Liberty and Democratic SolidarityAct in 1996, often referred to as the Helms/Burton legislation. Another component of U.S. policyconsists of support measures for the people of Cuba. This includes private humanitarian donationsand U.S.-sponsored radio and television broadcasting to the island. Under this rubric of support forthe Cuban people, President Clinton announced several policy actions in March 1998. Theseincluded the resumption of direct charter flights and cash remittances to Cuba and the streamliningof licensing procedures for the sale of medicines. In January 1999, the President announcedadditional measures, including a broadening of permissible cash remittances, increasing directcharter flights, expanding people-to-people contact, and authorizing the sale of food and agriculturalinputs to independent entities in Cuba.", "Although U.S. policymakers agree on the overall objective of U.S. policy toward Cuba -- to help bring democracy and respect for human rights to the island -- there have been several schoolsof thought about how to achieve that objective. Some advocate a policy of keeping maximumpressure on the Cuban government until reforms are enacted, while continuing current U.S. effortsto support the Cuban people. Others argue for an approach, sometimes referred to as constructiveengagement, that would lift some U.S. sanctions that they believe are hurting the Cuban people andmove toward engaging Cuba in dialogue. Still others call for a swift normalization of U.S.-Cubanrelations by lifting the U.S. embargo.", "Numerous measures were introduced in the 106th Congress that reflected the range of views on U.S. policy toward Cuba. Legislative initiatives proposed both easing and increasing sanctions. Inthe end, legislation passed reflected both approaches: it allowed the export of food and medicine butprohibited any U.S. financing, both public and private, of such exports. Travel to Cuba for tourismwas also prohibited. Another law facilitated enforcement of anti-terrorism judgments in U.S. courtsto allow for the payment of a $187.6 million 1997 judgment against Cuba to be paid from Cuba'sfrozen assets in the United States to the families of three U.S. citizens killed when Cuba shot downtwo U.S. planes in 1996.

While the Cuban government originally was predictinga growth rate of 4-5% for 1997, growth for the year was just 2.5%, largely because of disappointingsugar production. For 1998, the government's goal was for a growth rate of 2.5-3.5%, but anotherpoor sugar harvest, a severe drought in eastern Cuba, and the effects of Hurricane Georges resultedin an estimated growth rate of just 1.2%.

Since 1993, Cubans have been allowed to own anduse U.S. dollars and to shop at dollar-only shops previously limited to tourists and diplomats. Self-employment was authorized in more than 100 occupations in 1993, most in the service sector,and by 1996 that figure had grown to more than 150 occupations.

InMay 1997, the government enacted legislation to reform the banking system and established a newCentral Bank (BCC) to operate as an autonomous and independent entity.", "Despite these measures, the quality of life for many Cubans remains difficult, characterized by low wages, high prices for many basic goods, shortages of medicines, and power outages. Moreover,some analysts fear that the government has begun to backtrack on its reform efforts. Regulationsand new taxes have made it extremely difficult for many of the nation's self-employed (at one pointestimated at more than 200,000, but now estimated at 160,000 or lower, out of a total labor force ofsome 4.5 million).

Castro soon laid the foundations for an authoritarian regime by consolidating power and forcingmoderates out of the government. In April 1961, Castro admitted that the Cuban Revolution wassocialist, and in December 1961, he proclaimed himself to be a Marxist-Leninist. From 1959 until1976, Castro ruled by decree. ", "A constitution was enacted in 1976 setting forth the Communist Party as the leading force in the state and in society (with power centered in a Politburo headed by Fidel Castro). Theconstitution also outlined national, provincial, and local governmental structures. Executive poweris vested in a Council of Ministers, headed by Fidel Castro as President. Legislative authority isvested in a National Assembly of People's Power, currently with 601 members, that meets twiceannually for brief periods. While Assembly members were directly elected for the first time inFebruary 1993, only a single slate of candidates was offered.

", "Pope John Paul II visited Cuba from January 21-25, 1998, and conducted a series of open-air masses across the country that were televised in Cuba. Numerous Catholic groups from the UnitedStates traveled to Cuba for the Pope's visit as did thousands of journalists from around the world. While much of his visit was spent on pastoral issues, such as encouraging Cubans to come back tothe Church, the Pope also made more political statements. He criticized the U.S. embargo as \"unjustand ethically unacceptable,\" but also criticized the Cuban government for denying freedom to theCuban people. He asked the government to release \"prisoners of conscience,\" and Vatican officialsgave Cuba a list of more than 200 prisoners. On February 12, 1998, the Vatican announced that Cubahad freed dozens of detainees, noting that this step represented a prospect of hope for the future.", "There was much speculation about what effect the Pope's trip to Cuba might have on the political situation. The trip did not spark unrest from those opposed to the regime, nor did thegovernment take any actions to loosen the tight political control of the state and party. Over thelonger-term, however, the Pope's visit could result in elevating the profile of the Catholic Churchin such a way that it emerges as an important actor in Cuba's civil society.

", "Tensions in South Florida heightened after a June 29, 1999 incident -- televised live by local news helicopters -- in which the U.S. Coast Guard used a water cannon and pepper spray to preventsix Cubans from reaching Surfside beach in Florida. The incident prompted outrage from the CubanAmerican community in Florida and several Members of Congress. President Clinton characterizedthe incident as \"outrageous,\" and stated that the treatment was not authorized (Associated Press, July1, 1999). Another incident occurred on July 9, 1999, when a boat being interdicted by the CoastGuard capsized and resulted in the drowning of a Cuban woman. The State Department expressedregret over the incident and noted that the Department of Justice and the Immigration andNaturalization Service would investigate whether this was a case of alien smuggling.", "The Cuban government has taken forceful action against individuals engaging in alien smuggling. Prison sentences of up to three years may be imposed against those engaging in aliensmuggling, and for incidents involving death or violence, a life sentence may be imposed. As of lateJuly 1999, 30 U.S. residents were being held by the Cuban government on charges of aliensmuggling, and Cuba has offered to return them to the United States to stand trial. In late September1999, a Cuban court convicted two U.S. residents to jail terms of life and 30 years, respectively, forthe smuggling of migrants.", "Elian Gonzalez Case. On November 25, 1999, a boat with 13 Cubans attempting to reach the United States capsized off the coast of Florida.Among the 3 survivors was a 5-year old boy, Elian Gonzalez, who was found clinging to an innertube off the coast of Fort Lauderdale. The boy's mother drowned in the incident. The Immigrationand Naturalization Service released the boy into the care of relatives in Florida, who said that theywould request political asylum for the child. The boy's father in Cuba called for his return. ", "After interviewing the boy's father in Cuba and the boy's great-uncle and lawyers in Miami, the INS ruled on January 4, 2000, that the boy's father \"has the sole legal authority to speak onbehalf of his son, Elian, regarding Elian's immigration status in the United States.\" According tothe INS ruling: \"Both U.S. and international law recognize the unique relationship between parentand child, and family reunification has long been a cornerstone of both immigration law and INSpractice.\" The INS decision called for Elian to be returned to his father by January 14, 2000. Subsequently, efforts by the boy's Miami relatives to challenge the ruling resulted in the AttorneyGeneral extending the January 14, 2000 deadline in order to accommodate any federal courtproceedings. On January 10, a Florida circuit court judge ruled that the boy's return to Cuba couldcause the child \"imminent harm\" and scheduled a hearing on the case for March 6. Meanwhile, theFlorida judge issued a temporary protective order for the child to keep him with his Miami relativesuntil the March hearing. However, on January 12, 2000. Attorney General Janet Reno reaffirmedthe INS January 4 ruling, and asserted that the Florida state court had no right to intervene in thecase. She maintained that Florida's court order has no force or effect with regard to the INS'sadministration of immigration laws and that any challenge must take place in federal court.", "On January 19, 2000, attorneys for the boy's Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit in Miami in an effort to block Elian's return to Cuba. The lawsuit contended that the boy's constitutionalrights were violated when petitions for political asylum filed on his behalf were not considered. OnMarch 21, federal district court judge Michael Moore dismissed the request to force the INS to grantElian an asylum hearing. On April 6, Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, traveled to Washingtonwith his wife and six-month old son, with the intention of reuniting with his son Elian and takinghim back to Cuba. On April 19, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta orderedthat Elian must stay in the United States for the duration of the Miami family's court appeal.", "On April 22, Attorney General Janet Reno ordered the forced removal of Elian from the home of the Miami relatives by INS agents, after which he was flown to Andrews Air Force Base in Marylandand reunited with his father. Critics of the boy's removal argued that the INS used excessive force,while supporters contended that the government was forced to act by the intransigence of the Miamirelatives. Elian Gonzalez and his father stayed at the secluded Wye River Plantation in Marylanduntil May 25, when they (along with other family members, a teacher, and classmates who joinedthem in late April) moved to a home in Washington, D.C. owned by the Youth for UnderstandingInternational Exchange.", "In the next legal phase of the case, on May 11, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta heard oral arguments on whether the INS should be instructed to consider the asylum request filed for ElianGonzalez by his Miami relatives. The three-judge panel ruled on June 1 that the INS acted withinthe law and its policy rights when it refused to consider the asylum request. On June 23, the fullAppeals court rejected another appeal by the Miami relatives and refused to reconsider its June 1ruling. On June 26, the Miami relatives petitioned the Supreme Court to block Elian's return toCuba. On June 28, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the Miami relatives to block Elian'sreturn to Cuba and to seek a political asylum hearing for him. The previous injunction of theAppeals Court for Elian to remain in the United States expired at 4:00 p.m. on June 28, and the boyand his father returned to Cuba the same day.", "In late January 2000, it appeared that Congress would consider legislative action on the issue. Some Members supported legislation granting U.S. citizenship or legal residency to the boy( S. 1999 , H.R. 3531 , H.R. 3532 , S. 2314 ). Thosesupporting citizenship argued that the case should have been considered in family court and that thelegislation would ensure this. In contrast, other Members, who believed that Congress should notintervene in the matter, maintained that the INS should proceed with its decision to return the boyto his father ( H.Con.Res. 240 and S.Con.Res. 79 ). Administration officialsmaintained that the issue should be resolved in federal court, not in Congress. The Senate JudiciaryCommittee held a hearing on the issue on March 1, 2000, and the Committee planned hearings toinvestigate the INS's armed removal from the home of the Miami relatives. ", "In Cuba, Fidel Castro demanded the return of the boy in early December 1999, and Cuba held numerous mass demonstrations until the boy's return in June 2000. While the Cuban governmentorganized the mass demonstrations and used the media to influence the Cuban population, the issuein itself generated an outpouring of emotion among the Cuban population as well as in south Florida."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Initiatives and Actions in the 106th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Any legislation passed by the 106th Congress is noted as Public Law (P.L.) at the top of eachsection.
