The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) allows state, federal, tribal, and federal governments to recover damages to natural resources in the public trust from the parties responsible for the oil spill. Under the public trust doctrine, natural resources are managed by the states for the benefit of all citizens, except where a statute vests such management in the federal government.", "In particular, OPA authorizes Trustees (representatives of federal, state, and local government entities with jurisdiction over the natural resources in question) to assess the damages to natural resources resulting from a spill, and to develop a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement or acquisition of the equivalent, of the natural resources. The types of damages that are recoverable include the cost of replacing or restoring the lost resource, the lost value of those resources if or until they are recovered, and any costs incurred in assessing the harm. OPA caps liability for offshore drilling units at $75 million for economic damages, but does not limit liability for the costs of containing and removing the oil.", "The process established by OPA for assessing the damages to natural resources is known as Natural Resources Damage Assessment (NRDA). In the three steps of the NRDA process, the Trustees are required to solicit the participation of the responsible parties and design a restoration plan. This plan is then paid for or implemented by the responsible parties. If the responsible parties refuse to pay or reach an agreement with the Trustees, the Trustees can sue the responsible party for those damages under OPA. In the alternative, the Trustees may seek compensation from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, but there is a cap of $500 million from the Fund for natural resources damages. The federal government may then seek restitution from the responsible parties for the sums taken from that Fund.", "The Trustees are not required to adhere to the NRDA process set forth in the OPA regulations. However, they are accorded a rebuttable presumption in court for any determination or assessment of damages conducted pursuant to the regulations. Of course, the Trustees and the responsible parties are permitted to enter into settlement agreements at any point throughout the NRDA process.", "The NRDA process in the Gulf is in the Restoration Planning Phase. The caps on the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund and on OPA liability have captured Congress's attention, as has Gulf restoration.

OPA amended the CWA and several other statutes imposing oil spill liability to create a unified oil spill liability regime, to expand the coverage of such statutes, increase liability, to strengthen federal response authority, and to establish a fund to ensure that claims are paid up to a stated amount. Several federal district courts have held that OPA preempts other general maritime remedies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Liability", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to OPA, the parties responsible for causing the oil spill are responsible for damages to natural resources. In the case of offshore drilling, a responsible party is the lessee or permittee of the area in which the facility is located.

Joint and several liability means that where there are multiple responsible parties, each is potentially liable for the whole amount of the damages, regardless of its share of blame. Responsible parties, however, can bring separate actions for subrogation to resolve reimbursement issues among themselves. Strict liability means liability is assigned regardless of fault or blame. There does not have to be a mistake, negligence, or a willful action for a party to be responsible.", "It is important to note that while OPA provides a federal remedy for natural resource damages, it does not preclude liability under other laws.

One of these categories is natural resource damages, which replaced the CWA natural resource damages provisions for oil spills.

OPA provides three factors for measuring natural resource damages. The first allows for \"the cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, or acquiring the equivalent of, the damaged natural resources.\" The second considers \"the diminution in value of those natural resources pending restoration.\" And the third allows for recovery of the reasonable costs incurred in \"assessing those damages.\"", "Damages are capped under OPA unless one of the enumerated statutory exceptions applies.

Significantly, OPA requires presenting NRDA claims to the responsible parties before any suit can be filed or other action taken to allow for pre-trial settlement. Under Section 1006(e)(2) of OPA, if the Trustees satisfy the NOAA's NRDA regulations in estimating damages, their assessment is treated as having a rebuttable presumption of accuracy in any judicial or administrative proceeding. This means that a responsible party would have the burden of proving that the assessment is wrong, rather than the Trustees having to show that the assessment is right.", "Typically, Trustees form a Trustee Council, to develop a restoration plan that addresses the damages to all of the Trustees' resources. These Trustees must reach consensus on the extent of damages and restoration when issuing a unified plan. When the goal is to have one plan to address all of the impacts, which is how NRDA generally operates, the Trustees must work cooperatively to determine the magnitude and extent of injury to natural resources and create a plan to restore those injured resources to baseline (pre-spill) levels. When more than one state's natural resources are involved, each state gets one vote on these issues, even if a state has multiple state agencies represented among the Trustees. Each federal department also gets one vote, despite the number of subagencies involved.", "Litigation may be avoided altogether if the responsible parties consent to the Trustees' restoration plan. Once money is recovered by a Trustee under OPA, including to cover the costs of assessing the damages, it is deposited in a special trust account in order \"to reimburse or pay costs by the trustee ... with respect to the damaged natural resource.\" By establishing a collaborative process for resolving liability issues, NRDA is thus designed to avoid litigation. According to discussion on the House floor about OPA, \"[OPA] is intended to allow for quick and complete payment of reasonable claims without resort to cumbersome litigation.\"", "OPA also includes a citizen suit provision for natural resource damages.

In particular, they must quantify the degree, and spatial and temporal injuries relative to the baseline. The baseline is the level the Trustees agree the resources were at prior to the injury and to which they will be restored under NRDA. The regulations allow the Trustees to use historical data, reference data, control data, and/or data on incremental changes to establish the baseline. Thus, the activities that occur in the Restoration Planning Phase may include field studies, data evaluation, modeling, injury assessment, and quantification of damage, either in terms of money needed to restore the resource or in terms of habitat or resource units.

This must include a natural recovery alternative, in which no intervention would be taken to restore injured natural resources and services to baseline.", "At the same time, the Trustees must consider compensatory restoration actions for the interim loss of natural resources or services pending recovery. For compensatory restoration, the Trustees are first directed to consider actions that would provide services of the same type and quality as the injured resources. If these cannot provide a reasonable range of alternatives, the Trustees should then identify actions that \"provide natural resources and services of comparable type and quality as those provided by the injured natural resources.\" According to the House Conference Report, the priority in planning restoration is \"to restore, rehabilitate and replace damaged resources. The alternative of acquiring equivalent resources should be chosen only when the other alternatives are not possible, or when the cost of those alternatives would, in the judgment of the trustee, be grossly disproportionate to the value of the resources involved.\"", "Once the range of alternatives is chosen, the Trustees evaluate the alternatives and choose one as the basis of the restoration plan.
