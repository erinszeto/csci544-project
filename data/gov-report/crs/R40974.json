Using the private sector in this way can help federal agencies meet the goals of EO 13514 while conserving financial resources to meet their primary missions. Two widely used contracts \u2500 Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and Utility Energy Savings Contracts (UESCs) \u2500 provide federal agencies with the means of improving energy efficiency through private sector financing. ", "Under an ESPC, a private-sector energy services company (ESCO) develops and installs energy improvements such as energy efficient lighting or heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC). The federal agency then repays the ESCO for the capital expenditure over a maximum of 25-year period from resultant energy savings. EPSCs, in particular, have gained widespread use throughout the federal sector. Federal agencies have invested approximately $2.3 billion through ESPCs, with more than 460 contracts awarded in 47 states. ESPCs come with an incentive that allows facility managers to apply the cash benefit of energy savings to other improvements or programs. ", "The Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) view of ESPCs is that they impose a future financial obligation on the federal government. CBO began scoring ESPCs as mandatory spending, coinciding with the expiration of the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules. The CBO scoring reflects how ESPCs create future commitments to appropriations. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) finds that the benefits of ESPCs could be achieved using upfront funds (that is, fully funded in advance) and with lower financing costs, but agencies generally do not receive sufficient funds upfront for doing so and see ESPCs as a necessary supplement to upfront funding in order to achieve the longer-term energy savings benefits.", "UESCs can accomplish the energy efficiency improvements similar to ESPCs. With a UESC, a utility finances the costs of capital improvements and recovers its investment over the contract term from the customer's utility rates. The utility benefits by reducing its customer's demand for energy, thus increasing its spare capacity for periods when energy demands peak. Unlike ESPCs, however, there are no statutory requirements that an agency realize savings from reduced energy consumption.

Given that the order has elevated sustainability to a high priority, a broader discussion would help clarify the concept and possibly promote better policy solutions. ", "Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is EO 13514's most significant requirement. Energy consumption, and thereby fossil fuels use, is arguably involved in almost every aspect and activity of all federal agencies. In establishing targets for reducing GHG emissions, agencies may need to weigh the potential impacts on their missions while also considering whether advances in technology are likely over the timeframe of compliance.", "The requirement for federal agencies to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions could have many implications, including the evaluation of telecommuting as an imperative for many federal employees to reduce gasoline consumption. Upgrading security for computer-based systems and adding equipment for communications could be major considerations on the cost side.", "This latest energy- and environment-related executive order requires federal agencies to recommend how they will achieve mandatory goals, but CEQ and OMB must approve and decide the federal actions that agencies may actually employ. CEQ and OMB may become arbiters of these recommendations, weighing the mission and criticality of agency activities, as solutions deemed appropriate in some circumstances may not be appropriate for others.", "Conflicts between priorities can emerge. For example, if more electricity is required to charge hybrid and electric vehicles and that electricity comes from traditional steam-electric power plants, water consumption could increase thus making water-use goals less achievable. Increased coal use to generate the electricity could exacerbate GHG emissions. Such potential conflicts and possible impacts on the priorities of other agencies are likely to be taken up by the Steering Committee. The development of a process for resolving such issues is likely be an area of considerable focus. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.

Section 11 of the order consolidated and strengthened the five executive orders and two memorandums of understanding (MOU) and established new and updated goals, practices, and reporting requirements for environmental, energy, and transportation performance and accountability. In some cases, the Bush order put in place replacement energy and environmental efficiency goals for previous goals with target dates that had passed.", "EO 13423 also implemented and supplemented provisions of the 2005 Energy Policy Act (EPACT; P.L. 110-140 ) dealing with energy and environmental management by federal agencies. The combination of EPACT (Title I, Part A) and EO 13423 defined the energy efficiency objectives for federal agencies under the Bush Administration. EO 13423 directed all federal agencies to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through reductions in energy intensity (3% annually through the end of FY2015, and 30% by the end of FY2015, relative to each agency's baseline energy use in FY2003). Agencies scored progress in reaching building energy-efficiency goals in terms of reductions in energy consumption versus gross building area. For the energy reduction goals of EPACT, EO 13423 excluded some inherently inefficient industrial types of buildings were from this scoring. ", "EO 13423 (Section 2f) mandated specific energy reduction targets for new construction and renovations. Further, it directed federal agencies to meet objectives set in the Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings Memorandum of Understanding (\"Sustainable Buildings MOU\"). The Sustainable Buildings MOU called for new buildings to be 30% more cost efficient than industry standards, and for buildings undergoing major renovations to be 20% more cost efficient than a pre-renovation, 2003 baseline. The order also encouraged federal agencies to incorporate sustainable practices into projects underway, and sell or dispose of unneeded assets.", "The revoked EO 13123 had directed improvements in building energy efficiency, promoted the use of renewable energy, and set goals for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with energy use in buildings, among other energy-related requirements. In contrast, Bush's EO 13423 had no specific GHG reduction target. However, Section 2.a of EO 13423 did include the goal of cutting GHG emissions by federal agencies through reductions in the energy intensity of agency operations, but does not specify a GHG reduction target. ", "EPACT only credited electricity from renewable energy sources in meeting federal purchase requirements. EO 13423 required that at least half of the EPACT renewable energy requirement comes from new (put in service after January 1, 1999) renewable energy sources. Agencies could also use new non-electric renewable energy sources to meet the requirement for new renewable energy. (Examples of non-electric renewable energy include thermal energy from solar ventilation pre-heat systems, solar heating and cooling systems, solar water heating, ground source heat pumps, biomass heating and cooling, thermal uses of geothermal and ocean resources.) However, these non-electric renewable energy sources could not apply toward meeting the EPACT renewable electricity requirement. In meeting EPACT's energy-intensity reduction goals (Btu/gsf), agency credits for renewable energy purchases started to phase out in FY2008 and reduce to zero by FY2011. ", "Finally, EO 13423 required each federal agency to annually report to the President. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided general reporting guidance in Circular No. A-11 (Section 55, Information on Energy Use, Costs, and Efficiency ). A 2008 DOE memorandum provided detailed reporting guidance in to federal agency energy coordinators."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
