ATF is also responsible for investigating arson cases with a federal nexus, as well as criminal violations of federal laws governing the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol and tobacco. Congress authorized appropriations for ATF in the Department of Justice Authorization Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-162) for FY2006 through FY2009; however, the 111th Congress did not consider legislation to reauthorize annual appropriations for DOJ or ATF.", "From FY2001 through FY2010, Congress increased direct appropriations for the ATF from $771.0 million to $1.158 billion. The FY2010 appropriation amount includes $37.5 million in supplemental appropriations for Project Gunrunner (P.L. 111-230). With this supplemental, Congress has provided ATF with $86.5 million in budget increases over three fiscal years, FY2008 through FY2010, to combat gun trafficking. Most of this funding has been allocated to Project Gunrunner, an ATF initiative to reduce gun trafficking across the Southwest border, or other projects to assist the government of Mexico.", "For FY2011, the Administration requested $1.163 billion for ATF, an increase of 3.8% over the agency's initial FY2010 appropriation ($1.121 billion), which included $1.115 billion for salaries and expenses and $6 million for construction. For Project Gunrunner, the request included $11.8 million to annualize 37 positions that were previously funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5). It also included $1.2 million to enable ATF to coordinate state and local law enforcement efforts in the event of a national emergency and, thus, fulfill the Attorney General's Emergency Support Function (ESF) #13 obligations under the National Response Framework (NRF). The FY2011 request assumed $35.2 million and 46 FTE positions in base adjustments, less offsets and other reductions. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill (S. 3636) that would have matched the FY2011 request, but no further action was taken on that bill. In the absence of an enacted FY2011 CJS appropriations bill, Congress passed a series of continuing resolutions (CRs) that temporarily funded ATF at its FY2010 enacted level.", "On April 14, 2011, Congress passed the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) and funded ATF for the rest of FY2011 at its FY2010 enacted level, reduced by two-tenths of a percent. Hence, ATF's FY2011 appropriation is $1.113 billion.

Most of this funding has been dedicated to ATF efforts to reduce firearms trafficking from the United States to Mexico. To these ends, under the M\u00e9rida Initiative ATF released a Spanish-language version of its firearms trace request software (e-Trace 4.0) to Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica and established a U.S.-Mexico ballistic evidence exchange capability under the National Integrated Ballistic Imaging Network (NIBIN) program.

The first examined Project Gunrunner, an ATF initiative to reduce illegal gun trafficking from the United States to Mexico. The second examined ATF's efforts to investigate contraband cigarette trafficking. The third examined ATF's concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for explosives-related investigations.

As a consequence, the amounts requested for decision units are binding in the sense that the appropriators are aware of the increases that were provided in the annual bureau appropriation and how those increases would affect the decision unit totals.

H.R. 6080 contains identical language to Senate-passed H.R. 5875 . Reportedly, the House took up the bill with a new number to avoid a dispute related to its constitutional obligation to originate all revenue measures. This dispute arose with the addition of funding provisions in Senate-passed H.R. 5875 that were not included in the House-passed version. On August 12, the Senate passed H.R. 6080 . On August 13, 2010, the President signed H.R. 6080 into law ( P.L. 111-230 ). It provided ATF with an additional $37.5 million for Project Gunrunner.

Nevertheless, even though a statistically valid percentage estimate of U.S.-sourced firearms used in crime in Mexico cannot be made based on trace data, criminal investigations have documented that there is great demand for certain firearms that are available in normal (non-military) commercial channels in the United States and that those firearms have been illegally trafficked to Mexico in large numbers.", "Moreover, successful firearm traces are instrumental in developing investigative leads in homicide and gun trafficking cases. According to ATF, some of those cases uncover corrupt FFLs who were involved in larger criminal conspiracies to smuggle firearms into Mexico. In January 2008, ATF announced that e-Trace technology would be deployed to an additional nine U.S. consulates in Mexico (M\u00e9rida, Juarez, Monterrey, Nogales, Hermosillo, Guadalajara, Tijuana, Matamoros, and Nuevo Laredo). The number of traces performed by ATF for Mexican authorities during FY2008 increased markedly. For FY2008, preliminary data showed that ATF had traced 7,743 firearms recovered by Mexican authorities, as compared with the 11,700 firearms traced over a three-year period, FY2005-FY2007. Of those firearms, 63.5% were determined to have been manufactured in the United States and 29.5% were determined to have been manufactured abroad, but imported into the United States. Consequently, 93% of firearms traced by ATF during FY2008 for Mexican authorities were either made in, or imported to, the United States. ", "In March 2010, ATF released eTrace 4.0, a Spanish language version of the software, to Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. ATF anticipates that trace requests from these countries will increase markedly in FY2010 and FY2011 with this new software. Also, as part of the National Integrated Ballistic Imaging Network (NIBIN) program, ATF is currently establishing a U.S.-Mexico ballistic information exchange capability that will allow firearms technicians to acquire and compare digital images of markings left on fired bullets and cartridges either gathered in test-firings or recovered at crime scenes.

For firearms traced between December 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009, and sold for the first time, OIG analysis showed that those firearms included 973 rifles (77%) and 279 handguns (23%). It also indicated that traced long guns had a shorter time-to-crime interval than handguns. ", "While the OIG was somewhat critical of ATF's eTrace progam for yielding little \"usable investigative leads,\" the OIG recommended that ATF work with DOJ to develop a reporting requirement for multiple long gun sales because Mexican DTOs have demonstrated a marked preference for military-style firearms capable of accepting high-capacity magazines. The IG also recommended that ATF focus its investigative efforts on more complex criminal conspiracies involving high-level traffickers rather than on low-level straw purchasers.", "On December 17, 2010, DOJ and ATF requested that the Office of Management and Budget approve on an expedited basis a \"60-day emergency notice of information collection\" by January 5, 2011. This expedited approval was requested under provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Under the proposal, ATF would require federal firearms licensees (FFLs) to report whenever they make multiple sales or other dispositions of more than one rifle within five consecutive business days to an unlicensed person. Such reporting would be limited to firearms that are (1) semiautomatic, (2) chambered for ammunition of greater than .22 caliber, and (3) capable of accepting a detachable magazine. On December 20, 2010, acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson later clarified that the proposed multiple rifle sales reporting requirement would be (1) limited to FFLs operating in Southwest border states (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California) and (2) confined initially to a one-year pilot project. ", "On February 4, 2011, OMB informed ATF that it would not grant the emergency approval. Nevertheless, the notice's 60-day comment period ran through February 16, 2011. When DOJ and ATF finished considering an initial round of comments, a subsequent 30-day comment period was initiated on April 29, 2011. Following this period, OMB will have up to 30 days (until the end of June 2011) to issue a decision on the ATF proposal. Several Members of Congress strongly oppose this proposal.

As a consequence, some of these firearms are alleged to have \"walked,\" meaning that they were trafficked to gunrunners and other criminals before ATF moved to arrest the suspects and seize all of their contraband firearms. Some of these firearms were possibly smuggled into Mexico.

This transfer, however, did little to ameliorate the perennial source of tension between the ATF and FBI over their concurrent jurisdiction over explosives. In March 2003, then Attorney General John Ashcroft convened an Explosives Review Group (ERG) to develop recommendations to improve coordination between the ATF and FBI. In August 2004, the Attorney General responded to the ERG's report and directed (1) the ATF and FBI to consolidate all of DOJ's arson and explosives incidents databases into a single database; (2) that all consolidated arson and explosives incident databases be maintained by the ATF; and (3) both agencies coordinate post-blast explosives training and explosives detection canine training. In response to this directive, ATF established the U.S. Bomb Data Center (USBDC) as the sole repository of arson and explosives related incident data. On the other hand, the Attorney General also directed the FBI to take the lead on any terrorism-related cases (domestic and international) that involved explosives, and directed ATF to take the lead on all other criminal cases involving explosives. ", "Notwithstanding the Attorney General's directives, the partnership on federal explosives-related investigations between the FBI and ATF continues to be marked by what has been described as an acrimonious rivalry and competition for mission share and resources. The FBI apparently had not transferred its bomb data to the ATF, arguing that such a transfer would be detrimental to the FBI's ability to conduct counterterrorism investigations. In response to this, the Senate Judiciary Committee chair, Senator Patrick Leahy, and ranking minority member of that committee, Senator Arlen Specter, wrote a letter to the then Attorney General, Michael Mukasey, urging that an end be brought to this inter-agency rivalry. Meanwhile, FBI and ATF officials at the headquarters level have maintained that their partnership produces examples of interagency cooperation on a daily basis. They point to their jointly administered Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), which is based at the FBI laboratory in Quantico, VA. This center was established to process and evaluate evidence from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that have been recovered in Iraq and Afghanistan. ", "In October 2009, the DOJ OIG found that ATF and FBI are not adequately coordinating explosives investigations and related operations and that the two agencies have developed parallel capabilities to respond to explosives incidents. As noted above, both agencies maintain separate explosives-related databases, despite the Attorney General's May 2004 directives. Nor have the agencies coordinated post-blast explosives training and explosives detection canine training, despite a directive from the Attorney General to do so. The OIG also observed that investigative jurisdictional disputes, lack of information sharing, and lack of coordination between the two agencies hinders DOJ's ability to effectively respond, investigate, and prevent explosives crimes. The OIG underscored that these circumstances could increase the risk that DOJ would not meet the requirements set out by then President George W. Bush in Homeland Security Directive (HSPD)-19, which envisions a comprehensive U.S. government strategy to mitigate the threat, and prevent the use, of explosives by terrorists.

The proposed FY2011 allocation accompanying the Administration's budget request is $23.3 million, or again about 2% of the request ($1.163 billion).

In this report, the Inspector General found that tobacco diversion investigations, along with alcohol diversion investigations, are accorded a low priority at ATF, as compared to its other mission areas, such as investigating firearms- and explosives-related crime, particularly violent crime, and arson. This low priority is partly the result of the view that tobacco diversion is largely a nonviolent crime, despite its connections with terrorist financing and organized crime. Between FY2004 and FY2008, ATF conducted 645 alcohol and tobacco diversion investigations, or about 1% of ATF's investigative caseload. Of these cases, 566 investigations (88%) involved tobacco and 79 (12%) involved alcohol. With regard to the greater number of tobacco cases than alcohol cases, ATF observed that tobacco diversion is much more lucrative to criminal enterprises than is alcohol, as the latter is much more difficult to transport in large quantities. Alcohol diversion, moreover, is also limited to certain geographic areas and generally such cases today are handled by state and local authorities.
