Federal wildland fire management includes activities such as preparedness, suppression, fuel reduction, and site rehabilitation, among others. Approximately 10.1 million acres burned during the 2015 wildfire season, which was more than the acreage burned in 2014 (3.6 million acres) and 2013 (4.3 million acres) combined and represents the largest acreage burned since modern record-keeping began in 1960.", "There are several ongoing concerns regarding wildfire management. These concerns include the total federal costs of wildfire management, the strategies and resources used for wildfire management, and the impact of wildfire on both the quality of life and the economy of communities surrounding wildfire activity. Many of these issues are of perennial interest to Congress, with annual wildfire management appropriations being one indicator of how Congress prioritizes and addresses certain wildfire management concerns.", "Annual federal funding for wildland fire management is provided in the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Congress appropriated $4.9 billion combined to both FS and DOI in FY2016, which included a $700 million appropriation for FS to reimburse transfers that occurred in FY2015 to pay for wildfire costs. The combined FY2015 appropriation was $3.5 billion. Federal wildfire spending has increased significantly over the last two decades, driven largely by the rising cost to suppress wildfires. In FY1995, FS spent just over $500 million in constant dollars to suppress wildfires; in FY2001, FS spent $898 million. In FY2015, FS spent $1.7 billion on suppression operations. Appropriations for wildfire management have similarly increased. In FY1995, appropriations for wildland fire management were $1.6 billion in constant dollars, $3 billion less than the FY2016 appropriation.", "Congress is debating several issues related to federal funding for wildfire management. Issues under debate include the level and direction of federal spending on wildland fire management as well as the effectiveness of that spending (e.g., whether the funding is allowing agencies to meet wildfire management targets and the adequacy of those targets). Congress also faces requests from the agencies for additional appropriations during severe fire activity (e.g., justification for additional funding and the impact on non-fire programs without the additional funding). Congress has provided additional funding for wildfire management above the level provided in the Interior appropriations bill\u2014usually for wildfire suppression\u2014for 6 of the last 10 years, including FY2013, FY2014, and FY2016. The additional funding is typically provided through a supplemental appropriation. The frequent need for additional funds raises questions about the structure of wildfire funding and how the agencies estimate wildfire suppression funding requirements, among other things.", "Proposals to create alternative mechanisms for funding wildfire suppression have been introduced in the 114th Congress and proposed by the Administration. The proposals generally would create a budgetary adjustment mechanism to fund a portion of the wildfire suppression appropriation outside of statutory discretionary spending limits.", "This report provides wildfire management appropriations data over the past 10 years, information on the President's FY2017 budget request, and information on FY2017 appropriations for wildland fire management."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["W ildfire (or wildland fire), an unplanned and unwanted fire, can have beneficial and harmful impacts on human, historical, cultural, and ecological resources.

", "Although acreage burned is one indicator of the annual level of wildfire activity, it may also be misleading, since many of these fires may have occurred in areas that are large and relatively undeveloped, with very little impact on human development or communities. Acreage burned also does not indicate the severity of the wildfire or the degree of damage caused to the ecosystem. Thus, other indicators of wildfire activity should also be considered in conjunction with acreage burned, such as the severity of each wildfire or the cumulative number of severe wildfires in a year. In 2015, 1.5% (1,052) of the wildfires were classified as large or significant wildfires. Another statistic used to examine annual wildfire severity is the number of days spent at the highest national preparedness levels. The National Fire Preparedness Levels (PLs) are indicative of the level of nationwide mobilization of resources, with higher numbers indicating higher levels of response. For the six-year period of 2009 through 2014, the PL was at the highest level (PL5) for a total of 7 days; in 2015, the PL was at PL5 for 24 days.

", "Wildfire management activities are generally categorized as fuel reduction, preparedness, suppression, or site rehabilitation. ", "Fuel reduction is manipulation (including combustion) or removal of fuels to reduce the likelihood of ignition and/or to lessen potential damage and resistance to control. Preparedness is any activity that leads to safe, efficient, and cost-effective fire management. Preparedness includes the range of tasks necessary to build, sustain, and improve the capability to protect against, respond to, and recover from incidents. Suppression is the work associated with extinguishing or confining a fire. Site rehabilitation includes efforts undertaken, generally within three years of a wildfire, to repair or improve fire-damaged lands unlikely to recover to a management-approved condition within a specified time frame or actions taken to repair or replace minor facilities damaged by fire. ", "A number of federal, state, and local agencies can and do respond to wildfires. States are responsible for responding to wildfires that begin on nonfederal (state, local, and private) lands, except for lands protected by the federal agencies under cooperative agreements. The federal government is responsible for responding to wildfires that begin on federal lands. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service (FS) carries out wildfire response and management across the 193 million acres of national forests and national grasslands. The Department of the Interior (DOI) carries out wildfire management and response for more than 400 million acres of national parks, wildlife refuges and preserves, Indian reservations, and other public lands. Sometimes more than one agency may respond, depending on where the fire occurs, the potential threats, and the expertise required.

Congress also provides funding for wildfire-related activities through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, such as emergency financial assistance for some nonfederal wildfires through Fire Management Assistance Grants and the Disaster Relief Fund; those funds and activities are discussed in other CRS products.", "DOI and FS each have two accounts for wildfire: a Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account and a Federal Land Assistance, Management, and Enhancement Act (FLAME) account. FLAME is a reserve fund for wildfire suppression that requires certain conditions be met to transfer funding from FLAME to the WFM account. The WFM appropriation is distributed among two programs: F ire O perations and O ther F ire O perations . The F ire O perations program receives the bulk of the WFM appropriation and funds two activities: preparedness and suppression. Appropriations for preparedness are used to support efforts that assist with fire prevention and detection, equipment, training, and baseline personnel. Suppression appropriations are used primarily for wildfire response. The O ther F ire O perations program funds hazardous fuels reduction activities, such as restoring forest vegetation type and structure to improve a forest's resilience and resistance to catastrophic wildfires.

This fact may lead to questions regarding the structure of wildfire funding and wildfire suppression funding estimation methods, among other things. Wildfire suppression funding estimates depend on multiple factors (e.g., weather, fuel load, nearby dwellings, access to wildfire site), and numerous reasons have been given as to why suppression estimates have at times not accurately forecast suppression expenses, with estimates typically underestimating suppression spending. Wildfire suppression is complicated, and both the efficiency of resources used for wildfire suppression and the federal protocol for wildfire management have an impact on wildfire suppression costs. ", "Analyzing trends in wildfire management could provide insights useful for Congress during these debates. However, analyzing wildfire funding trends over time\u2014particularly prior to FY2001\u2014is challenging for many reasons. The agencies' account structures have changed over time, with different activities funded through different programs. Additional accounts and programs have been created. For example, the FLAME account was established in FY2010, with appropriations that previously had gone entirely to WFM suppression then being allocated between two different accounts. A further complication is that costs for one wildfire season (using a calendar year) often are covered by appropriations for two fiscal years, and sometimes appropriations are enacted in one fiscal year to cover costs incurred in previous fiscal years.
