The purpose of the measure was to \"help control the increasing costs of major defense systems.\" In arguing for the amendment, Senator Nunn raised a number of issues, including the need to ensure that DOD's \"spending priorities are being established within the context of a coherent national strategy.\" He argued that \"the unit costs of major defense weapon systems are increasing at rates far beyond the rate of inflation, adding billions to the budget just to buy the same quantities of weapons that were planned before.\" Senator Nunn believed that the amendment \"holds the appropriate Pentagon officials and defense contractors publicly accountable and responsible for managing costs.\" But ultimately, the amendment was intended to inform Congress whether DOD's acquisition process is working effectively. In arguing in support of the amendment, Senator Nunn concluded", "If the system works, if the cost estimates and the inflation estimates are anywhere near accurate, giving a 15% margin on R. & D., a 10% margin on inflation in the procurement accounts, then the reports will not be necessary. If the system does not work, then, of course, we should know and we should be alerted.

According to the act, a significant breach occurred when the Program Acquisition Unit Cost (PAUC\u2014total cost of development, procurement, and construction divided by the number of units) or the Procurement Unit Cost (PUC\u2014total procurement funds appropriated in a fiscal year divided by the number of end units to be procured with such funds in the same fiscal year) for an MDAP increased by more than 15%. A \"critical\" breach occurs when the PAUC or PUC increased by more than 25%. Inflation costs were included in the cost growth analysis.", "Under the act, a program manager was required to submit a quarterly unit cost report to the appropriate secretary within seven days of the end of the quarter. However if a program manager had \"reasonable cause\" to believe that a program had a breach, the program manager was required to immediately submit a report to the service secretary concerned.
