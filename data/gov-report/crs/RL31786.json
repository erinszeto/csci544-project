This system wouldintegrate a number of ongoing R&D efforts, referred to in this paper as Total Information Awarenessprograms. While concern has centered primarily on privacy issues, accounts of the program'sfunding have also differed.

In FY2003, DARPA is dedicating $10 million to integrate variousR&D efforts into a prototype TIA system, and $137.5 million for the various R&D programs thatcould make up that system and that are managed by the Information Awareness Office (IAO) headedby Poindexter. Funding for these programs total $137.5 million in FY2003 and $317.0 million forFY2001-FY2003.

Funding for TIAprograms that are managed by the Information Awareness Office includes R&D efforts to developtechnologies to improve data mining so as to allow DOD to sift through and analyze patterns in vastamounts of information, to translate large volumes of foreign language materials electronically, tostrengthen DOD's information infrastructure, and to devise new tools for high-level decision makerstrying to anticipate, train, and respond to terrorist attacks.

Previous examples of DARPA-developed technologywith wide-ranging implications include stealth technology, Global PositioningSystem (GPS), and development of the Internet. (29) Based on recent testimony byAssistant Secretary of Defense Paul McHale emphasizing that DOD did not expectto use a TIA system but would turn the system over to civilian law enforcementagencies, TIA may not have a defense mission. (30) In describing plans for the TIAsystem, DARPA's Director, Dr. Tony Tether, cited collaboration with potential usersin other federal agencies as a key part of their approach. (31)", "Yet that collaboration -- between the law enforcement community and the intelligence community, for example -- has raised concerns among some observersabout the roles of different agencies in gathering and sharing intelligence on potentialthreats from terrorists located in the United States. Those concerns reflect theexperiences of the 1960s and 1970s when the FBI's counterintelligence programtargeted civil rights and anti-war organizations as part of its efforts to pursuedomestic terrorists. (32)", "DARPA's efforts at collaboration reflect the fact that there are potentially many users of any tools that DARPA develops to predict terrorist threats. Currently,several agencies are or will be collecting or analyzing intelligence on potentialterrorist threats, including the Counterterrorist Center under the CIA, the FBI's JointTerrorist Task Forces, the new Department of Homeland Security. Another new userwould be President Bush's proposed new Terrorist Threat Integration Center to beestablished May 1, 2003 with the mission of integrating all of U.S. governmentinformation and analysis about potential terrorist threats. (33) DARPA envisionsworking with potential users in the design of its tools for decision makers, a practice,that could be difficult with restrictions on transfer of TIA components.", "Sharing information among several users makes it more difficult to protect both intelligence sources and the privacy of individuals. For that reason, DARPA issponsoring some research on developing 'fire walls' that would protect the sourcesof intelligence gatherers and prevent potential leakage among users. The distributedtype of system that DARPA envisions could make those challenges greater. Earlycollaboration with potential users, for which DARPA has been praised, could alsocreate problems with ensuring privacy and preventing misuse of intelligence sourcesand data on individuals, particularly if DARPA tries to exploit multiple data basesand to share data across agencies. (34)", "Developing tools to ensure that the privacy of both sources and individuals is both a technical challenge and a policy issue. DARPA's Genisys program, a TIAcomponent intended to integrate and query large data bases that has raised privacyconcerns, also includes R&D on tools to ensure privacy. These tools may include\"partitioning,\" which segregates transactions from the identity of the individual,filters to limit access to information and software agents that would delete unrelatedinformation. According to a technical group tasked by DARPA to look intotechnological solutions to privacy issues, the Information Science and Technologypanel (ISAT), there are significant difficulties in developing tools and protocols toprotect privacy. This group called on DARPA to devote significant researchresources in this area, and to establish a citizen advisory board to privacy policystandards. (35)", "On February 7, 2003, the Department of Defense established two boards to monitor TIA programs. (36) Made up of high-levelDOD officials, the internal TIAoversight board is tasked with setting policies and procedures for use of TIA toolswithin DOD and establishing protocols for transferring TIA capabilities outside ofDOD to ensure consistency with privacy laws and policies. DOD also established anoutside advisory board including experts in privacy issues, to advise the Secretaryof Defense on policy and legal issues raised by using advanced technology to identifyand predict terrorists threats.

Under P.L. 108-7 , testing outside of DOD mayalso be subject to rigorous oversight. In its current research, DARPA has beencareful to use 'dummy' or fictitious data on individuals to test the effectiveness ofvarious models for detecting potential terrorists, or to use only data that is currentlylegally permissible for intelligence gathering purposes (see discussion of ongoingDARPA collaboration above). If DARPA's technology efforts - in data mining ormodel development - are to be fully tested, however, real data, with all its flaws, mayneed to be used, and using real data may raise privacy issues.

DARPA'sdescription suggests that the TIA system will be developed using a variety of datamining techniques coupled with models developed by analysts.

(40) In addition, anydata base includes a significantnumber of errors -- a problem routinely discussed by data mining experts -- and itis not clear that there are adequate methods for catching errors. Linking large anddisparate data bases is not only a challenging task in itself but could compound thenumber of errors.", "Searching large data bases with large numbers of errors could both reduce the likelihood that terrorists would be identified and magnify the possibility thatindividuals who are not terrorists would be tagged.

The quality of the data could be diluted further if disparatedata bases are linked. ", "Developing Ways To Identify Terrorists. DARPA plans to use both quantitative and qualitativedata mining techniques to develop tools to identify terrorists. Data miningtechniques are currently widely used for commercial purposes, ranging from targetedmarketing to detecting credit card fraud, as well as for law-enforcement (e.g., to catchdrug smugglers). In these cases, however, analysts and statisticians develop, test andre-test algorithms or quantitative relationships in order to hone formulas and improvetheir accuracy in detecting patterns. In the case of credit card fraud, for example,statistical algorithms or pattern identifying techniques can be refined with follow-upchecks of billing records.", "According to DARPA's descriptions, TIA components would develop technologies using both statistically-based algorithms to detect patterns in multipledata sources from a wide range of sources -- financial, telephonic, foreign messages,intelligence traffic -- and models of terrorist behavior based on analysis of historicalexperiences and scenarios developed by analysts. DARPA anticipates that byspeculating, analysts will develop scenarios of particular terrorist attacks and thenback into the types of activities that would be necessary to carry out those attacks. Some observers have suggested that it could be difficult to anticipate terrorist acts,and our success in anticipating previous terrorist attacks has been limited. With theenormous increases in the speed of processing information and the proliferation ofdata mining techniques, DARPA sees new opportunities for exploiting a variety ofinformation sources using quantitative techniques like data mining. ", "Technology experts and others, however, have questioned whether the problem of detecting potential terrorists is susceptible to the data mining techniques routinelydone by commercial companies in light of the difficulty in predicting terroristbehavior. The problem is made all the more difficult by the likelihood that thenumber of Al Qaeda members in the U.S. is small; a widely-quoted FBI estimate of5,000 was later dismissed as too high, a small number compared to the large numberof transactions that are analyzed in commercial data mining applications. (41)", "In response, DARPA suggests that its research would not simply search data bases for potential terrorists but instead would develop templates, based on studiesof past attacks and captured terrorists documents, that would be used to focussearches of databases more narrowly. In addition, the process would be iterative, inother words, analysts would use a variety of techniques, sequentially, to identifypotential terrorists. (42)", "The Problem of False Leads. A key element in assessing the viability of the TIA system is whether the technologiesdeveloped will be sufficiently accurate to limit the number of potential suspects andminimize the number of false leads so as to avoid misidentifying individuals assuspects. (43) If the number of potential suspectsor false leads proves to be large, thetimeliness of warnings, as well as the cost of conducting followup checks, could alsomake a TIA system problematic. Some observers are also concerned that if DOD orintelligence agencies identified significant numbers of false leads, the pressures oftime and urgency could lead to violations of the rights of individuals.", "DARPA contends that concerns about false leads (called false alarms or \"false positives\" by statisticians) are exaggerated. In credit card fraud, for example, a falsealarm or false positive would mistakenly identify a transaction as fraudulent. Toavoid false alarms, DARPA argues that a TIA system would use multiple means toidentify suspects, ranging from models developed by \"Red Teams\" envisioningterrorist scenarios to patterns detected by linking intelligence data with commerciallydeveloped data mining techniques. Using such a tiered approach, DARPA contendsthat suspects would only be tagged after multiple checks. ", "Some observers have questioned whether these techniques could successfully cull the number of suspects. But assuming that DARPA's approach could reduce thenumber, capturing a certain number of false leads is inherent in statistical techniques. For example, consider the extensive work of the credit card industry in developingtechniques to identify credit card fraud. In a controlled trial, researchers tested theeffectiveness of combining several statistical tools to identify credit card fraud usinga large, real testing sample of 500,000 transactions, deliberately seeded with 100,000fraudulent transactions in order to refine statistical algorithms.

In other words, while 50,000 of the fraudulent cases were identified, (50% of100,000), another 80,000 cases were mistakenly tagged as fraudulent (20% of400,000 legitimate transactions) at the same time. Investigators therefore would needto investigate 130,000 cases to catch 50,000 wrongdoers, or about 2.6 cases for every1 wrongdoer. In the case of credit card fraud, algorithms have been extensivelyrefined using large amounts of real data, and followup checks on leads are routine asanyone who has received a phone call after making an unusually large charge knows.", "Even in the case of credit card fraud, however, the incidence of wrongdoers is likely to be below 20%. (The actual fraud rate is a closely-guarded industry secret.)", "When the incidence of fraud is lower, the chances of identifying wrongdoersdecreases. (45) Press reports last summer cited anFBI estimate of 5,000 Al Qaedaoperatives in the U.S., but that estimate was later dismissed by the government, andexperts suggested that hundreds rather than thousands was the more likely number. (46) In light of the relatively small number of terrorists, the likelihood of catching them,even with targeted data bases, could be far lower. The chance, as well as the cost toindividuals of mis-identifying suspects, could also be far greater.", "An illustrative case using statistical algorithms to identify terrorists that would increase the chances that a TIA system would work could be based on the followingassumptions:", "the database would be limited to 1,000,000 transactions because DARPA had successfully culled the number of suspects; and", "there are 5,000 terrorists in the data base, an incidence rate of1/2 %.", "The number of terrorists to be identified would then be 5,000 (1/2% of 1,000,000). ", "At the same time, assume optimistically that a combination of data mining and modeling tools could identify 30% or 1,500 of the 5,000 terrorists but that the falsealarm rate was 30% because the difficulty of identifying terrorists is greater thandetecting credit card fraud. In this case, investigators would need to check a total of300,000 cases to catch the 1,500 terrorists (30% of 5,000 terrorists + 30% of 995,000other suspects). For every terrorist identified, some 200 other suspects would haveto be investigated.", "Some computer experts think that even this case is optimistic. If DARPA's data base was larger, the number of false alarms could be far greater, even with a highaccuracy rate. In examples proposed by computer experts that assumed a highlyaccurate TIA system was applied to the entire U.S. population, the number of falsealarms could be 3 million people annually. (47) Either case would pose considerablechallenges to investigators, particularly in cases where a threat was consideredimminent. If the number of potential suspects identified was significant, the cost ofimplementing the system could also grow, as substantial personnel would be neededto investigate potential leads and ensure that false leads were eliminated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix: Description of R&D Efforts Managed by the Information Awareness Office By Category", "paragraphs": ["Data Mining Technologies.", "Human Identification at a Distance (HumanID).* This project aims to use information from sensors about human characteristics such as gaitor face, to identify individuals at any time of the day or night and in all weatherconditions, for instance, within a large crowd.", "Evidence Extraction and Link Discovery (EELD).* This project is an effort to identify terrorist groups by developing a suite of technologiesto detect patterns between people, organizations, places and things from intelligencemessages and law enforcement records, and then use those patterns or links to gatheradditional information from vast amounts of textual or transactional data including web sites, sensor data, and news reports.", "Genisys.* This project is a new effort in 2003 to put together old and new databases so that they can be readily queried.
