EPA most recently revised the particulates NAAQS in October 2006, but is due to propose revised standards in February 2011 and promulgate them by October 2011.While currently much of the interest in the particulates NAAQS is focused on reviewing the NAAQS and speculation as to the degree of stringency of any new standards, implementing revised standards can take many years. EPA and states are in the early stages of implementing the 2006 revised standards, and have not finalized implementation of the standards promulgated in 1997 after years of litigation and other delays. This report outlines the implementation process for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS and describes issues raised as EPA and states developed and employed implementation strategies for achieving attainment.", "The EPA's final designation of 39 areas, consisting of 205 counties in 20 states and the District of Columbia, as \"nonattainment\" (out of compliance) areas for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS became effective in April 2005. A combined population of almost 90 million resides in these areas. States with PM2.5 nonattainment areas are required to develop comprehensive implementation plans, referred to as State Implementation Plans (SIPs), demonstrating how attainment will be reached by a designated deadline. SIPs include pollution control measures that rely on models of the impact on air quality of projected emission reductions to demonstrate attainment. States were required to submit SIPs for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS by April 2008, but EPA did not begin receiving most submissions until July 2008. On November 27, 2009, EPA published its findings that three states failed to meet the deadline for submitting complete SIPs. For the remaining designated areas, states either submitted a complete SIP or EPA made a final approval that the area attained the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS based on 2006-2008 air quality data. States must be in compliance by 2010, unless they are granted an extension.", "A number of issues will continue to be debated as the implementation of the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS progresses. Notably, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's July 11, 2008, decision (North Carolina v. EPA) to vacate the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) introduced new concerns and disruptions with respect to the implementation of the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. Implementation of CAIR would have assisted states in addressing the interstate transport (upwind state) emission contributions in achieving attainment. The court's December 23, 2008, modified decision allows CAIR to remain in effect, but only temporarily until EPA promulgates a replacement rule, which could have future implications for implementing the PM2.5 NAAQS. On August 2, 2010, EPA published a proposed \"Transport Rule\" intended to supersede the current CAIR. In addition, other promulgated and proposed EPA rulemakings that influence various aspects of regulating air quality, including EPA's 2006 changes to the particulates NAAQS, continue to impact the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS implementation process.", "EPA and states have encountered similar issues in implementing the 2006 revised particulates NAAQS.

The EPA's May 2005 final rule, the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), was expected to serve as the primary tool to assist downwind states in meeting the PM 2.5 (and eight-hour ozone) NAAQS by mitigating interstate transport of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from electric generating units that contribute to the formation of PM 2.5 . CAIR covered 28 states in the eastern United States and the District of Columbia, including 26 jurisdictions in the PM 2.5 nonattainment region.

Most of the 1997 PM 2.5 nonattainment areas were only exceeding the annual standard; only 12 counties were exceeding both the 24-hour and the annual standards.

Using funding specifically authorized for this purpose in FY1998-FY2000 EPA appropriations, the agency worked closely with states and tribes to initiate the deployment of a portion of the network of 1,200 monitors in January 1999. The majority of the monitors were not in place until January 2000. States and tribes were expected to rely on data collected during 2000-2002 for their recommendations. The EPA considered the 2001-2003 data to make the final PM 2.5 designations published in January 2005.", "In its guidance document, EPA identified several factors that would be considered in determining attainment with the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS and specified data and conditions that would not be acceptable. The EPA's guidance also included a recommendation that states and tribes consider using the same boundaries for nonattainment for both the PM 2.5 and eight-hour ozone standards, to facilitate consistency in future implementation plans. The EPA expected that many of the PM 2.5 nonattainment areas would overlap with the eight-hour ozone designations.", "However, PM 2.5 designations do not include nonattainment classifications based on severity as specified by statute for PM 10 and ozone, which have two and seven classifications, respectively. PM 2.5 is governed by the general nonattainment planning requirements of Title I (Part A and Part D, subpart 1) of the act.", "The EPA recognized that determining the geographic extent of nearby source areas that contribute to nonattainment would be complicated. The CAA does not specifically require combining neighboring counties within the same nonattainment area, but it does require the use of metropolitan statistical area boundaries in the more severely polluted areas (Section 107(d)(4)(A)(iv)). Echoing this requirement, and similar to the eight-hour ozone approach, EPA recommended that Metropolitan Statistical Areas or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas serve as the \"presumptive boundary\" for nonattainment areas under the 1997 PM 2.5 standards.", "Metropolitan areas are generally treated as units, even when part of the area lies in a separate state or does not have readings exceeding the standards. In the latter case, even though a specific county may not exceed the standards, the pollution generated there is likely to influence PM 2.5 levels elsewhere in the metropolitan area. In addition, including the entire metropolitan area avoids the creation of additional incentives for sprawl development on the fringes of urban areas. For rural areas in violation of the 1997 PM 2.5 standards, EPA's guidance presumed that the full county would be designated a nonattainment area.", "The EPA has generally used its discretion to expand the size of nonattainment areas or to combine areas that a state listed as separate areas into a single larger unit. As it did in implementing other NAAQS, EPA also combined nonattainment counties across state lines into the same nonattainment area, if the counties are part of the same metropolitan area.

Primarily, 19 counties were removed from the list of nonattainment areas, and other counties were redefined by designating only specified locations (\"partial\") within the county as nonattainment. In some cases, when considering factors defined in its guidance in conjunction with the additional information provided by the states and tribes, EPA determined that only those portions of a county that contained the significant sources of emissions should be considered as contributing to the violations. In other cases, the agency determined that if emissions from a large identifiable source in a county contribute to the violations in a nearby area, the portion of the county where the source is located would be designated nonattainment, even if it is not contiguous with the remainder of the designated area. The boundaries for these \"noncontiguous\" portions are based on legally recognized government boundaries, such as townships, tax districts, and census blocks.", "Some states and stakeholders continued to contend that several counties should not be designated nonattainment, particularly when taking into account 2004 PM 2.5 monitoring data. The EPA's final designations were based on monitoring data for the three-year period from 2001-2003. Monitoring data for 2004 were not available in time for EPA to meet its statutory deadline for PM 2.5 geographical area designations (see timeline and discussion later in this report). The final PM 2.5 designation rule, published on January 5, 2005, included provisions allowing states to submit no later than February 22, 2005, certified, quality-assured 2004 monitoring data that suggest a change in designation is appropriate for consideration (70 Federal Register 948).

The EPA also changed four of the five areas designated as \"unclassifiable\" to \"attainment,\" based on 2002-2004 data.

In the August 25, 2008, Federal Register , EPA announced its determination that a three-county (Harrisburg, Lebanon, Carlisle ) Pennsylvania nonattainment area for the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS was in attainment.

The court did not impose a specific deadline on EPA's development of the replacement rule, but it did say that it was not granting an indefinite stay of its July 2008 decision.

On the other hand, the EPA analyses recognized that as many as 19 of the areas would remain in nonattainment, highlighting the importance of local and state emission reduction efforts.

As litigation regarding certain aspects of CAIR was pending, EPA reported that its implementation was continuing. According to EPA, all the states covered under CAIR chose to participate in the trading programs for SO 2 and NOx (or acknowledged an EPA Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) as a default); some also have established direct control programs complementing the trading programs.

These attainment demonstration components of the SIPs will likely need to be revised to show how the states will achieve the emission reductions previously required by CAIR.", "Current and pending SIPs from downwind states would have potentially been inadequate because they assumed the CAIR reductions in interstate transport of pollutants. SIPS from upwind states, on the other hand, could be inadequate if they do not prevent downwind nonattainment: the CAA makes clear that states are to impose controls on stationary sources of pollution that contribute significantly to downwind nonattainment or interfere with the maintenance of air quality standards in other states (\u00a7 110(a)(2)(D)). This provision of the statute has been widely disregarded in the past, with little EPA effort (other than regional cap-and-trade programs) to address it. This reluctance to act can be challenged through CAA \u00a7 126 petitions, and the court's decision puts the focus on these petitions as the available means of addressing interstate transport of air pollutants in the immediate future.

Granting reconsideration or a rehearing en banc is unusual, and success is especially unlikely given that the initial North Carolina v.

As requested by the court, a new round of legal briefings was filed in early November 2008. In a brief submitted on behalf of EPA November 17, 2008, the U.S. Department of Justice continued to support the request in the petition for a rehearing, but said that a stay of the decision long enough to allow implementation of a replacement regulatory regime would be preferable to complete vacatur.", "On December 23, 2008, the D.C.

The court's decision stated that there is no simple \"fix\" that would make CAIR acceptable to the court. It is also unclear whether the agency can salvage the regional cap-and-trade approach, which lies at the heart of CAIR, or if cap-and-trade on a smaller scale, whether intrastate or intra-company, would face better odds. In its July 2008 decision, the court found \"more than several fatal flaws\" in the rule, and concluded, \"No amount of tinkering will transform CAIR, as written, into an acceptable rule.\" The D.C.

In light of these expired deadlines and given the many issues surrounding the particulates NAAQS in general, the final phase of implementing the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS will likely remain an issue of considerable debate for many stakeholders and interest groups, as well as Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Implementation of the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS: Timeline and Delays", "paragraphs": ["Because of legal challenges, the lack of a national monitoring network, and other factors, implementation of the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS has been delayed repeatedly since it was promulgated. The timeline presented in Table A-1 below reflects the most recent key milestone dates for implementing the 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS, including actual completions. These milestones are driven primarily by statutory requirements. It follows an EPA milestone schedule outlined in an April 21, 2003, memorandum to EPA regional administrators that also provided the nonbinding guidance for implementation of the PM 2.5 area designations. Recognizing potential efficiencies associated with states and tribes being able to harmonize control strategies, the initial PM 2.5 schedule was intended to be similar to that for the eight-hour ozone program.", "The PM 2.5 NAAQS requirement for three years of monitoring data to determine whether areas were meeting the established limits was one factor responsible for delaying implementation. Comprehensive monitoring data sufficient to make this determination and the attainment designations were not available in 1997. Recognizing this dilemma, in the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178 , Title VI), Congress revised the statutory deadline requirements for the new NAAQS, predicated on a previously released EPA Interim Implementation Policy. TEA-21 required states to submit designation recommendations within one year after receipt of three years of data meeting defined federal protocols, and required EPA to promulgate designations within one year after state recommendations were due, but not later than December 31, 2005.", "As discussed earlier in this report, operation of the network of monitors was phased in from 1999 through 2000, making three-year monitoring data available at different points, depending on area location. Rather than a staggered designation schedule, which would likely have hampered cross-coordination of implementation plans, EPA proposed a single date for state and tribal recommendations and final EPA designations. The deadlines of February 15, 2004, for governors to submit their PM 2.5 designation recommendations and December 31, 2004, for EPA to promulgate designations for each state, were the result of Congress amending the CAA in the FY2004 omnibus appropriations ( P.L. 108-199 ).", "In addition to the delay in establishing a monitoring network, the 1997 NAAQS standards were challenged in District Court by the American Trucking Associations, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and several other state and business groups. An initial May 1999 opinion by the District Court partially in favor of the plaintiffs was reversed by the Supreme Court in February 2001."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
