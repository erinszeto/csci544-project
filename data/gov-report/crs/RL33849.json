{"id": "RL33849", "title": "Climate Change: Science and Policy Implications", "released_date": "2007-05-02T00:00:00", "summary": ["Almost all scientists agree that the Earth's climate is changing, having warmed by 0.6 to 0.9o Celsius (1.1 to 1.6o Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. Science indicates that the Earth's global average temperature is now approaching, or possibly has passed, the warmest experienced since human civilizations began to flourish about 12,000 years ago. During the 20th Century, some areas became wetter while others experienced more drought. Most climate scientists conclude that humans have induced a large part of the climate change since the 1970s. Although natural forces such as solar irradiance and volcanoes contribute to variability, scientists cannot explain the climate changes of the past few decades without including the effects of elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations resulting from fossil fuel use, land clearing, and industrial and agricultural emissions. Over the past 150 years, measured carbon dioxide concentrations have risen by more than one-third, from about 280 parts per million (ppm) to about 380 ppm. The United States contributes almost one-fifth of net global greenhouse gas emissions. Some impacts of climate change are expected to be beneficial (e.g., increased agricultural productivity in some regions), whereas others are expected to be adverse (e.g., drought in some regions, rising sea levels in some coastal areas).", "Forecasting future climate conditions is challenging, and some major processes remain poorly understood. However, methods are improving to characterize the risks. Scientists have found it is very likely that rising greenhouse gas concentrations, if they continue unabated, will raise the global average temperature above natural variability by at least 1.5o Celsius (2.7o Fahrenheit) during the 21st Century (above 1990 temperatures), with a small likelihood that the temperature rise may exceed 5oC (9oF). The projections thought most likely by many climate modelers are for a greenhouse gas-induced temperature rise of approximately 2.5 to 3.5oC (4.5 to 6.3oF) by 2100. However, the magnitude, rapidity, and details of the change are likely to remain unclear for some time. Future climate change may advance smoothly or sporadically, with some regions experiencing more fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, and frequency or intensity of extreme events than others. Some scientists emphasize potential beneficial effects of climate change, or count on the ability of humans to adapt their behaviors and technologies to manage climate change in the future; other scientists argue that the benefits of climate change may be limited, even accounting for probable adaptation and its costs, and that there are risks of abrupt, surprising change with accompanying dislocations.", "The continuing scientific process has resulted in a better understanding of climate change and generally confirms the broad conclusions made in previous decades by the preponderance of scientists: that human activities emit greenhouse gases that influence the climate, with potentially serious effects. Details have been revised or refined, but the basic conclusion of the risks persists. The principal questions remaining for the majority of scientists concern not whether greenhouse gases will result in climate change, but the magnitude, speed, geographic details, and likelihood of surprises, and the appropriate timing and options involved in addressing the human components of climate change."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["CLIMATIC EFFECTS OF POLLUTION: Carbon dioxide is being added to the earth's atmosphere by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas at the rate of 6 billion tons a year.

This will modify the heat balance of the atmosphere to such an extent that marked changes in climate, not controllable through local or even national efforts, could occur.

The frequency of floods exceeding the 200-year flood levels also increased significantly, while the frequency of floods having return periods shorter than 100 years did not increase significantly. In most regions, insufficient data remain a challenge for assessing trends in climate variability, because of the infrequency of events (by definition) and their spatial variability.

Only in the extra-tropical Atlantic basin has research established a positive relationship between sea surface temperatures and increased number and severity of hurricanes or cyclones. Since the mid-1980s, satellite data reveal a distinct increase in tropical cyclone activity associated with higher eastern Atlantic sea surface temperatures, as well as other factors. Much longer series of high-quality observations and improved understanding of tropical cyclones are needed to provide definitive attribution of changes in hurricane activity to natural variability, greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, or other processes.

From 1979 to 2003, the rate of warming in the United States, at 0.33 o C (0.6 o F) per decade, has been about twice the rate of the global average. Two regional exceptions to this overall warming were (1) cooler winters and springs in the Southeast from 1901 to 1978, which reversed to warming after 1979 (except in Florida), and (2) generally stable or cooler summer and autumn months in the South and central United States. The warmest year for the United States in the 20 th Century was 1998 (with temperatures boosted by El Nino ), followed by 1934; 2006 was the third-warmest year in the U.S. record, about 1.1 o C (2 o F) above the 20 th Century average.", "U.S. average precipitation has increased 6.1% since 1895, but with more variability and a less distinct pattern than temperature ( Table 2 ).

First, modern human civilizations have developed and thrived in the stable and relatively temperate climate of the past 12,000 years, a period called the Holocene period . Global average temperatures have varied fairly narrowly during the past 10,000 years, within about 2 o C, with the maxima around the current global mean temperature and the minimum temperatures occurring in the 16 th and 17 th centuries, during the Little Ice Age, about 1 o C cooler than current temperatures. According to NOAA, no evidence demonstrates that global annual temperatures at any time during the Holocene were warmer than today.", "Second, some climate shifts can be rapid, occurring on time scales of only years to decades. Paleoclimatological records show abrupt shifts that have included changes in hurricane frequency, flooding, drying of lakes, and several mega-droughts lasting decades to centuries. Recently, evidence shows that the main warming events ending the last ice age (about 15,000 years ago) took place in less than a decade.

A number of studies have found that major ecological restructuring has accompanied major climatic shifts in the past.

The glacial ice sheets of Greenland are melting overall, with an apparent acceleration in the period 2003 to 2005. In western Antarctica, accelerated ice melting and loss contrasts with accumulating ice in East Antarctica because of increased precipitation. With loss of buttressing sea ice, glacial flows have sped up in the past decade in parts of western Antarctica. Record low Arctic sea ice extent in 2005, at 5.6 million square kilometers, was 20% less than the 1970 to 2000 median. Polar bears, which rely on sea ice to access food, have experienced a significant decrease in cub survival rates from 2001 to 2006 in the Beaufort Sea area.

The more active the Sun, the closer the Earth to the Sun, or the greater the ability for the Sun's energy to penetrate the atmosphere and be absorbed by the Earth, the greater will be the warming tendency on Earth. On the other hand, the less active the Sun, the farther the Earth is from the Sun, the more the Earth's atmosphere or surface reflect the radiation back out to space, the greater the cooling tendency. The tilt of the Earth's axis in its orbit around the Sun, making one or the other hemisphere closer to the Sun most of the year, drives the heating and cooling of the seasons outside of the tropics. Scientists understand well the fundamental drivers of the Earth's climate through geologic time; for example, how the pattern of an irregular orbit around the Sun has led to regular climate swings in and out of ice ages, or how massive volcanic eruptions can spew particles into the atmosphere that block incoming radiation and cause temporary cooling.", "Until human populations grew to large numbers\u2014from a population of about 5 million around 10,000 years ago to over 6 billion today\u2014the global climate was almost certainly not influenced by human activities.

Black carbon aerosols are thought primarily to warm the atmosphere; organic carbon aerosols (emitted largely by forest fires) are thought to have mostly a cooling effect.", "Sulfur aerosols (sulfates) scatter incoming solar radiation and have consequent cooling influence on climate. This has been well known for decades but only included in climate modeling since the early 1990s. Sulfate aerosols are a by-product of sulfur emissions, largely from the burning of coal and oil, as well as some industrial processes. Sulfur emissions and their aerosols have increased dramatically over the past century.", "Aerosol effects on temperature are both regional and short-lived (as particles typically remain suspended in the atmosphere for days to weeks). Aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere fluctuate greatly, are difficult to measure, and consequently are uncertain by a factor of two or more. Aerosols are also understood to affect precipitation patterns downwind of their emissions, although research is just beginning to reveal the processes involved; they may influence monsoon water cycles as well. Aerosols may having amplifying or dampening effects when interacting with such factors as sea surface temperatures and snow cover.

They also affect the vertical distribution of temperatures in the atmosphere. More complex, the emissions of small particles and water vapor form ice crystals in aviation contrails that can produce more clouds in the upper troposphere.

The United States, like many other countries, cleared land decades ago but abandoned some of it with industrialization and migration to more fertile lands; regrowth of forests on abandoned lands is, in net, estimated to be removing CO 2 from the atmosphere. In other words, U.S. forests overall are a net sink for carbon, not a source at this time, on the order of 780 million metric tonnes of CO 2 per year.

To the degree that vines and other weedy plants thrive better in higher CO 2 and warmer temperatures than woody trees, the enhanced carbon uptake may be short-lived. Moreover, warmer temperatures and greater moisture will tend to speed up decomposition, and even potentially cause die-back at high levels, generating a positive feedback to climate warming.

In places covered with snow or ice, the surface has very high albedo; as the extent of snow and ice diminishes with climate warming, the reflectivity decreases and creates a positive feedback to climate, leading to more warming. Land cleared of its vegetation may reflect light more than the dark leaves that previously shaded it, increasing reflection of solar energy, and having a cooling impact.

Additional factors also contribute, including solar variability, volcanoes, and natural variability.", "The simplest method of analyzing the role of greenhouse gases in climate change is to compare CO 2 concentrations in the atmosphere with surface temperatures. Through the past million years or more, CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations have been tightly correlated with global temperatures in the paleologic records. This correlation may be insufficient to discern the triggering cause of the changes, but most scientists are confident that once warming has been initiated, there are strong positive feedbacks to CO 2 levels and again to climate warming, leading to a strongly amplifying effect of the initial cause. This would explain instances of timing mismatches, where rising CO 2 concentrations lag behind rising temperatures, evidenced in the paleoclimatological record. However, some scientists also raise problems in the proxy records, pointing to time lags among the complex interactions within the climate system, and to additional drivers of change that, at times, may exceed the forcing of CO 2 in the atmosphere.", "Another method scientists use to attribute climate change to various sources, or to project future changes, relates to the concept of causative radiative forcing. Figure 6 shows an estimation of the relative contributions of GHG and other agents to radiative forcing from 1950 to 2000. The apparent strength of greenhouse gas forcing has steadily grown and seems to dominate other known forcings in its effects on warming the Earth's climate. Volcanic emissions of stratospheric aerosols are also major but episodic and short-lived drivers. Tropospheric aerosols, including sulfates, black carbon, and organic carbon have had a much smaller but growing cooling effect. From these data, the effect of solar variability on recent temperature change is apparent, but small. Some scientists, however, contend that solar variability has a larger role.", "A third method scientists have developed, especially since 2000, is the concept of fingerprinting the patterns of radiative forcing and observed change, and comparing them. Different forcing agents produce different patterns of climate change over time and space, and even vertically in the atmosphere. For example, volcanoes spew aerosols that persist only a few years in the atmosphere, creating a temporary cooling effect over both land and oceans. Reductions in solar irradiance can last decades and affect land temperatures more than oceans. These patterns are very different from, for example, the influence of long-lived greenhouse gases that are expected to exert long-lived, global influence.", "The observed warming of the climate, described above in \" Changes Observed in the Earth's Climate ,\" corresponds to expected greenhouse gas-induced patterns of warming greater in winter than summer, more at night than daytime, and of generally increasing precipitation, and more warming at high latitudes than low latitudes. Another piece of evidence is the observed cooling, as expected, at 50 km and higher in the atmosphere, which cannot be explained by seasonal or solar cycles. Also, the increasing heat content of the oceans cannot be explained by urban heat islands or other placement-related problems with measurement stations.

The close linkage, over hundreds of thousand of years, between past temperature swings and carbon dioxide and methane concentrations in the atmosphere strongly suggests that temperature change can trigger strong positive amplifications through the carbon cycle and water vapor feedbacks. Current models include such feedbacks, but they are very uncertain. The most important and uncertain feedbacks affecting future climate projections include water vapor feedback, cloud feedbacks, vegetation feedbacks, and albedo.", "Thus, while most climate scientists conclude with high confidence that future climate change, forced by greenhouse gases, land use change, and natural factors, is probable, the magnitude, rapidity, and details of the changes are likely to remain unclear for many years, or even decades.

On long time scales, solar variability could have a large influence, as on the cold temperatures of the Little Ice Age , but quantification of the solar role in climate variability over periods of centuries to millenia is poor. For example, while some scientists have found evidence that the Sun's activity may have been relatively high during the Medieval Warm Period, other scientists have found no evidence that estimated variability of Sun's total irradiance has been sufficient to drive climate variations over the past 1,000 years. For example, one study of recent climate, using a very simple model, found that solar variability may have accounted for approximately 40% of climatic variability over the past 140 years, in addition to internal (unexplained) variability, greenhouse gas forcing,\u00a0and other geophysical factors. Satellite measurements from 1978 dramatically improved the measurement of solar activity; while there is a clear correlation between solar sunspots and an 11-year radiation cycle, some scientists conclude that variations in solar output have been too small since 1978 to have significantly induced the observed global warming of the past three decades.", "Solar output of ultraviolet light has been postulated as causing the Maunder Minimum (around 1650 to 1710) of the Northern Hemisphere's Little Ice Age, when scientists believe that the Sun was relatively quiet and emitted less ultraviolet light. This, in turn, may have reduced the ozone in the Stratosphere. Ozone is a greenhouse gas that warms the Earth, so the reduction of ozone in the stratosphere due to less ultraviolet light may have cooled the Northern Hemisphere on average by a few tenths of a degree centigrade.

Some hypothesize that the sudden release of methane clathrates may have been implicated in the Earth's most severe extinction event, which occurred suddenly about 252 million years ago, resulting in a 5 o C temperature increase globally, and with an estimated loss of about 96% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. Another rapid warming, thought by some to have been caused by massive releases of methane clathrates or carbon dioxide, and accompanied by major extinctions, occurred at the beginning of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum or the Initial Eocene Thermal Maximum .

There is corroborating evidence in a rapid color change of ocean sediments that normal deposition of white calcite shells of ocean animals stopped for some 50 thousand years, which may have occurred with accompanying ocean acidification. (See \"Carbon Dioxide and Ocean Acidification\" above .)", "Water Vapor", "Water vapor exists naturally in the Earth's atmosphere and is the most important greenhouse gas (see \" Greenhouse Gases \" section), accounting for around two-thirds of the 33 o C of additional warming our planet receives because of the presence of its atmosphere. However, a change in water vapor content of the atmosphere can have warming or cooling effects, depending on where it is in the atmosphere, in latitude and altitude. Warmer temperatures globally will tend to increase the water vapor in the atmosphere, a positive feedback that tends to amplify the warming. To the degree that certain clouds increase, especially low clouds, with increased water vapor, a negative feedback may result, reducing the warming. Much of the warming predicted by climate models in response to GHG results from amplification by increased water vapor in the atmosphere from the initial increase in GHG-forced temperature. Feedbacks to clouds are among the least understood processes and account for large differences among climate model results. Although significant scientific advances in understanding clouds have been made since the year 2000, it will be at least several years before these are fully incorporated into scientific assessments, and no doubt considerable uncertainty will remain for decades.", "Chaotic Variability", "Climate scientists say that there is natural or \"chaotic\" variability in the climate system, meaning that there is a certain amount of random or unexplained behavior of the climate. To some degree, this natural variability reflects what science has not identified, cannot explain, or does not find a regular statistical pattern to describe. The presence of unexplained variability does not mean that scientists cannot make meaningful and useful statements about the past or future; it means that there is an amount of uncertainty, resulting from unidentified or poorly understood factors or randomness, that will remain in forecasts of the future."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
