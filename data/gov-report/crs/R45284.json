Title X grants enable grantees to establish and operate family planning projects. A family planning project refers to a set of activities that a Title X grantee undertakes under its grant agreement to provide a broad range of family planning methods and services to Title X clients. (In 2016, Title X-funded clinics served 4 million clients.) Examples of Title X activities include provider-to-patient counseling, dissemination of educational materials, and the delivery of clinical services. Clinical services provided through Title X projects include contraceptive services and supplies, sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment, and preconception health care services. All services are confidential.", "Title X is administered through the Office of Population Affairs (OPA) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The program was appropriated $286.5 million for FY2018.

Under current program guidance, the abortion prohibition does not apply to all Title X grantees' activities; instead, the prohibition applies only to activities that are part of the Title X project. A grantee's abortion activities must be \"separate and distinct\" from the Title X project activities.", "On June 1, 2018, OPA published a proposed rule in the Federal Register, \"Compliance with Statutory Program Integrity Requirements,\" that would make several changes to federal Title X family planning regulations, including the following:", "Title X projects would no longer be required to offer pregnant clients the opportunity to receive abortion information, counseling, and referral upon request. Title X projects would be prohibited from referring patients to abortion services. Title X projects would be required to maintain physical and financial separation between their Title X projects and abortion-related activities. Several terms, including \"family planning\" and \"low-income family,\" would have new definitions. Criteria for awarding Title X Family Planning Services grants would be revised. Title X grant applicants and grantees would be subject to new reporting requirements.", "This proposed rule has sparked a congressional debate about the scope of Title X. The 115th Congress is debating the scope of Title X to determine whether providing an abortion-related service, such as referring a pregnant client to an abortion provider, should be a family planning service under Title X.

On June 1, 2018, HHS published a proposed rule in the Federal Register that would change OPA's administration of the grant program. HHS contends that the program has not been properly administered in accordance with Sections 300 to 300a-6 of title 42 of the U.S. Code (U.S.C). HHS states that the goal of the rule is to ensure that Title X funds are used within the limits set by Congress.", "According to HHS, family planning projects that receive Title X funds are closely monitored to ensure that federal funds are used appropriately and are not used for prohibited activities, such as for performing surgical abortion procedures. HHS states that the agency has concerns about whether Title X projects that operate in a health care facility where abortions are provided are unintentionally crossing federal funds with funds used to cover the facility's abortion-related expenses. Furthermore, according to the proposed rule's preamble, OPA had previously misinterpreted current law by requiring Title X providers to provide abortion-related services such as counseling and referrals to their patients upon request. ", "The 115 th Congress is debating the scope of the program to determine whether providing an abortion-related service such as an abortion referral should be a family planning service under Title X. For example, some Members of Congress have stated that the service of providing abortion referrals is a family planning service that Title X providers should continue to provide Title X clients upon request. According to some Members of Congress, the proposed rule is a gag rule that \"would bar patients from receiving information to support their ability to make informed decisions about their own reproductive health.\" These Members of Congress are referring to a policy originally put in place by President Reagan in 1988 that was challenged in court but upheld by the Supreme Court in 1991. The court case, Rust v. Sullivan , narrowed the scope of permissible abortion-related activities that are linked to federal funding. Congress subsequently voted to repeal the gag rule but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to override a President George H.W. Bush veto in 1992. The Clinton Administration suspended the gag rule in January 1993. According to the Clinton Administration, ", "During the first 18 years of the [Title X] program, medical professionals at Title X clinics provided complete, uncensored information, including nondirective abortion counseling. In February 1988, [HHS] adopted regulations, which have become known as the \"Gag Rule,\" prohibiting Title X recipients from providing their patients with information, counseling, or referrals concerning abortion. Subsequent attempts by the [George H.W.] Bush Administration to modify the Gag Rule and ensuing litigation have created confusion and uncertainty about the current legal status of the regulations.", "Other Members of Congress state that Title X providers should not provide abortion referrals as a method of family planning. According to these Members, current regulations on abortion referrals \"undermine\" the statutory requirement that no Title X funds shall be used in projects \"where abortion is a method of family planning.\" The Trump Administration has stated that \"[c]ontrary to recent media reports, HHS's proposal does not include the so-called 'gag rule' on counseling about abortion that was part of the Reagan Administration's Title X rule.\" Members on both sides of the issue agree, however, that the proposed rule would make it harder for Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) to receive Title X funds.

An informed consent conversation refers to a patient's access to medical information that would enable the patient to make medical decisions and ask questions about his or her care. The American Medical Association (AMA)'s Code of Medical Ethics states that \"withholding medical information from patients without their knowledge or consent is ethically unacceptable.\" During an optimal informed consent conversation, according to AMA, health care providers should \"assess the patient's ability to understand relevant medical information and the implications of treatment alternatives and to make an independent, voluntary decision.\" ", "Under the proposed rule, Title X physicians would be permitted, but not required, to provide nondirective abortion counseling.

According to the preamble, some of these benefits would stem from the conscience-related provisions: ", "For providers, the proposed regulation is expected to create benefits through respect for conscience. It would do so by better aligning the Title X regulations with the statutory prohibitions on discrimination against health care entities, including individual health care providers, who refuse to participate in abortion\u2013related activity such as counseling and referrals. Potential grantees, and subrecipients that refuse to provide abortion counseling and referrals may now be eligible and interested in applying to provide family planning services under the current Title X regulations. ", "Current Title X regulations might discourage some potential Title X grantees from applying. Some potential Title X grantees might not apply because current grantees must provide abortion referrals upon request. This requirement may clash with the religious and moral beliefs held by some potential grantees. For that reason, the finalization of this proposed rule might encourage more potential Title X grantees that hold such beliefs to apply.\u00a0 ", "The preamble further states that \"the expansion of provider and family planning options would have salutary benefits for patients, including for patients who seek providers who share their religious or moral convictions.\" A study of 1,430 religious reproductive-aged women (18-45 years old) found that 34.5% of the women felt that it was somewhat or very important to know about a hospital's religious affiliation. That same study also found that 80.7% of the religious women felt that it was somewhat or very important to know about a hospital's religious restrictions on reproductive care, prior to seeking the care.
