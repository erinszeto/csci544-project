It is the largest of the eight health-related agencies that make up the Public Health Service (PHS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). NIH consists of the Office of the Director (OD) and 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) that focus on aspects of health, human development, and biomedical science. The OD sets overall policy for NIH and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. ", "NIH activities cover a wide range of basic, clinical, and translational research, focused on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or more fundamental aspects of biology and behavior. Its mission also includes research training and health information collection and dissemination. More than 80% of the NIH budget funds extramural research (i.e., external) through grants, contracts, and other awards. This funding supports research performed by more than 300,000 individuals who work at over 2,500 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions around the country. About 10% of the agency's budget supports intramural research (i.e., internal) conducted by nearly 6,000 NIH physicians and scientists, most of whom are located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.

Authorized by Section 241 of the Public Health Service Act, the evaluation tap allows the Secretary of HHS, with the approval of appropriators, to redistribute a portion of eligible PHS agency appropriations across HHS for program evaluation and implementation purposes. The PHSA section limits the set-aside to not less than 0.2% and not more than 1% of eligible program appropriations. However, LHHS Appropriations Acts have commonly established a higher maximum percentage for the set-aside and have distributed specific amounts of \"tap\" funding to selected HHS programs. Since FY2010, and including in FY2020, this higher maximum set-aside level has been 2.5% of eligible appropriations. Readers should note that totals in this report and NIH source documents include amounts \"transferred in\" pursuant to PHS tap but do not include any amounts \"transferred out\" under this same authority.", "NIH also receives funding through LHHS appropriations, subject to different budget enforcement rules than the rest of the NIH funding in the act\u00e2\u0080\u0094appropriations to the NIH Innovation Account created by The 21 st Century Cures Act (\"the Cures Act,\" P.L. 114-255 ) to fund programs authorized by the act.

The NIH Director may transfer these amounts from the NIH Innovation Account to other NIH accounts, but only for the purposes specified in the Cures Act. If the NIH Director determines that the funds for any of the four Innovation Projects are not necessary, the amounts may be transferred back to the NIH Innovation Account. All amounts authorized by the Cures Act have been fully appropriated to the Innovation Account from FY2017 to FY2020, including $492 million for FY2020.
