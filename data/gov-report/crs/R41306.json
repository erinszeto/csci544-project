{"id": "R41306", "title": "Trade Law: An Introduction to Selected International Agreements and U.S. Laws", "released_date": "2012-04-03T00:00:00", "summary": ["The United States has trade obligations under multilateral trade agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the other World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, as well as bilateral and regional trade agreements. A variety of domestic laws implement these agreements, prescribe U.S. trade policy goals, or regulate international trade to achieve specific foreign policy objectives. This report provides an overview of both international and domestic trade law, focusing on a select group of international agreements and statutes that are most commonly implicated by U.S. trade interests and policy.", "Historically, parties to international trade agreements were obligated to reduce two kinds of trade barriers: tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers. Whereas the former may hinder an imported product's ability to compete in a foreign market by imposing an additional cost on the product's entry into the market, the latter has the potential to bar an import from entering that market altogether by, for example, restricting the number of such imports that can enter the market or imposing prohibitively strict packaging and labeling requirements. Consequently, at their most basic, international trade agreements obligate their parties to convert at least some of their non-tariff trade barriers into tariffs, set a ceiling on the tariff rates for particular products, and then progressively reduce those rates over time. However, over time, U.S. trade agreements have become increasingly complex. The U.S. model free trade agreement now targets not only tariffs and non-tariff barriers, but also domestic policies in areas such as labor, environmental law, and electronic commerce that U.S. policymakers consider unfair trade practices. Trade agreements have also evolved to include elaborate trade dispute settlement mechanisms. As illustrated in this report, the typical international trade agreement today disciplines its parties' use of tariffs and trade barriers, authorizes its parties to use discriminatory trade measures to remedy certain unfair trade practices, and establishes a dispute settlement body.", "Domestic trade laws, meanwhile, can broadly be classified as laws (1) authorizing trade remedies, including remedies for violations of trade agreements, countervailing duties for subsidized imports, and antidumping duties for imports sold at less than their normal value, (2) setting domestic tariff rates and providing special duty-free or preferential tariff treatment for certain products, and (3) authorizing the imposition of trade sanctions to protect U.S. security or achieve foreign policy goals. In addition to describing these domestic laws, this report summarizes the constitutional authorities of Congress and the executive branch over international trade. Finally, the report identifies many of the federal agencies and entities charged with overseeing the development of new trade agreements and the administration and enforcement of federal trade laws. Among the federal agencies and entities discussed are the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the International Trade Administration (ITA), the International Trade Commission (ITC), the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the United States Court of International Trade (CIT).", "This report is not intended as a comprehensive review of trade law. It is an introductory overview of the legal framework governing trade-related measures.

In particular, the trade agreements of the last half-century can be seen as adopting the view that government bodies need a global legal framework to ensure that they effectively conform their countries' policies and laws with their citizens' interests. Legal theorists posit that trade policy failure, in both the global and domestic arenas, as well as inequitable power dynamics among countries engaged in trade negotiations, are the products of a legal architecture that does not sufficiently discipline how governments represent their citizens' interests. In this vein, the international trade law regime has attempted to strengthen its enforcement mechanism over time to ensure that national governments comply with trade law despite shifting domestic pressures.", "As international trade law has developed, there has been interplay between domestic and global trade law. Initially, international trade agreements focused on tariffs, but, over time, they have broadened to encompass aspects of domestic policymaking and establish fairly stringent dispute settlement mechanisms. This interplay, however, has led to criticism that trade agreements infringe national sovereignty and autonomy by (1) limiting the kinds of policy decisions a country can make and (2) giving international trade dispute settlement bodies too much power to shape and constrain domestic law.", "This report provides an overview of the legal framework that governs trade-related measures. This framework is composed of both international agreements and domestic laws.

The scope of this report, however, is limited to obligations incurred under agreements that seek to liberalize international trade. In the WTO context, trade agreements are categorized as either multilateral (accepted by all WTO Members as a condition of membership) or plurilateral (accepted by only some WTO Members). Other free trade agreements may be classified as bilateral agreements (which bind only two countries) and regional agreements (which bind countries within a discrete region of the world). No matter their classification, most trade agreements have a corresponding body of domestic law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Uruguay Round, Marrakesh Agreement, and World Trade Organization", "paragraphs": ["After World War II, developed nations sought to establish an open trade network to facilitate the recovery of the global economy. These negotiations yielded a proposal for an International Trade Organization (ITO), and, as a temporary fix until the ITO Charter could be negotiated, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs 1947 (GATT 1947). The expectation was that the GATT 1947 would expire once a more comprehensive trade agreement, the ITO Charter, was developed and ratified. Then the ITO would interpret and administer the ITO Charter. ", "However, the ITO never materialized, and, therefore, despite its provisional nature, the GATT 1947 became a permanent fixture in international trade. Nevertheless, to dispel any concern that an international organization had been established, the GATT 1947 signatories continued to be called \"Contracting Parties\" rather than \"Members.\" Moreover, the GATT 1947 was not considered a comprehensive trade agreement because it consisted mainly of the commercial policy provisions of the ITO charter.", "Partly as a response to concerns about the GATT 1947's strength and breadth, Contracting Parties engaged in a series of \"rounds\" of multilateral trade negotiations over the ensuing decades: the Dillon Round (1960-1962), the Kennedy Round (1964-1967), the Tokyo Round (1973-1979), the Uruguay Round (1986-1994), and the ongoing Doha Development Round. Each round of talks sought to liberalize new markets, lower tariffs, and identify solutions to different kinds of trade barriers. It was not until the Uruguay Round that the Contracting Parties finally reached an agreement on a charter for an international trade organization: the WTO. ", "The agreements completed in the Uruguay Round are detailed in the Marrakesh Agreement. Part of this Agreement is the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (the WTO Agreement). The other texts negotiated during the Uruguay Round are annexed to the WTO Agreement. Annex 1 contains 13 multilateral agreements on trade in goods as well as the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Annex 2 contains the Dispute Settlement Understanding, which sets out the process by which WTO Members may resolve disputes over the meaning or application of a WTO agreement. Annex 3 contains a Trade Policy Review mechanism, providing for periodic review of a WTO Member's trade laws and policies. Annexes 1 through 3, and the agreements therein, must be accepted by a country as a condition of its membership in the WTO. Accordingly, all of these agreements, along with the other provisions of the Marrakesh Agreement, were approved and implemented in U.S. law through the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA, P.L. 103-465 , 19 U.S.C. \u00a73501 et seq. ), which then-President Bill Clinton signed into law on December 8, 1994.

At its most general, the GATT sets the maximum tariffs for particular goods and countries and disciplines certain trade-restricting measures adopted by WTO Members. This report surveys many of the articles of the GATT that are considered fundamental as well as those that are frequently raised in WTO consultations or disputes over a WTO Member's domestic trade measures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Nondiscrimination Provisions of the GATT", "paragraphs": ["The GATT seeks to prohibit WTO Members from discriminating between \"like products\" on the basis of their origins. More specifically, the GATT bars WTO Members from discriminating between like products because they originated in different WTO Members or because they originated in a WTO Member's territory rather than domestically. The GATT articles that lay out this prohibition, Article I and Article III, are therefore known as the nondiscrimination provisions. Although \"like product\" is used in both provisions, the GATT does not offer a single precise and absolute definition of the term. Consequently, to determine whether two products are \"like,\" WTO panels and the Appellate Body engage in a case-by-case analysis to discern whether the two products are in a competitive relationship given the products' properties and end uses, consumer preferences, and tariff classification.", "Article I: Most Favored Nation Treatment", "Article I of the GATT requires WTO Members to grant immediate and unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment to the products of other Members. This means that any \"advantage\" that a WTO Member grants in the context of customs duties or rules regarding importation or exportation to any product imported from one country, whether a WTO Member or not, must also be granted to any \"like\" product imported from all WTO Members. ", "The term \"advantage\" in Article I:1 has been given a very broad definition to encompass any more favorable competitive opportunity or commercial status relative to those of like products destined to different WTO Members. It can include, for example, variations in both the procedural and administrative requirements for imports. As a result, variations in the licensing requirements for imports can constitute an advantage under Article I:1. In EC \u2013 Bananas III , for example, a WTO panel ruled that the European Union had accorded an origin-discriminatory advantage to the products of some WTO Members by imposing additional licensing requirements on imports from other WTO Members. Notably, a measure may be deemed to accord an advantage even if it is written in origin neutral terms.", "Similarly, two products may be deemed \"like\" under Article I:1 even if they are subject to different tariff classifications or, for other reasons, are not exact duplicates. WTO panels and the Appellate Body assess the \"likeness\" of two products by examining their characteristics, their end-uses, their tariff classification, and consumers' tastes and habits. Where a complaining Member demonstrates that the difference in treatment between imported products is based exclusively on the products' different origins, a WTO panel will presume that there can or will be discrimination between imported products that are \"like.\" Although it is often difficult in other cases to predict whether a given measure would affect \"like\" products from WTO Members, a measure that affects a broad range of products may be likely to result in discrimination between at least some \"like\" imports. ", "Once a measure is found to have conferred a trade advantage that affects \"like\" products, that measure will be deemed inconsistent with Article I:1 if it fails to accord the advantage \"unconditionally.\" WTO panels have adopted different interpretations of the term \"unconditionally, \" but their decisions suggest that conditions may be attached to an advantage only if they do not discriminate, either on their face or as applied, between \"like\" products on the basis of their countries of origin or destination. For example, an advantage is not accorded \"unconditionally\" if some countries have to do or pay something to receive it. Similarly, an advantage is not accorded \"unconditionally\" if some countries have to take a particular action, such as adopt a specified policy, in order for exports to their territories to be eligible to receive it. ", "Notably, a measure framed in origin neutral terms so as to appear facially consistent with Article I:1 violates the MFN principle if it has a discriminatory impact on imports of like products from some WTO Members relative to others. In Canada \u2013 Autos , for example, a WTO panel examined a Canadian measure that exempted car imports from a customs duty if their manufacturers satisfied certain requirements, including establishment in Canada and the use of Canadian materials in production. The panel found that the duty exemption was an \"advantage\" and that, although the exemption was origin neutral on its face, the structure and characteristics of the global automotive industry meant that the criteria for the exemption created origin-based discrimination among auto imports from WTO Members. The panel buttressed this finding with the measure's legislative history, which suggested that the exemption was part of a scheme intended to rationalize production in the North American automotive market and encourage U.S.-owned car manufacturers to expand their production operations to Canada. In other words, the panel ruled that Canada's import duty exemption was a de facto violation of Article I:1 because it was designed to benefit auto imports from particular sources, namely those in the United States and North America, and had the discriminatory effect it intended.", "Similarly, in Indonesia \u2013 Autos , a WTO panel found that an Indonesian measure exempting certain cars from import duties and sales taxes was also inconsistent with Article I:1. In that case, an import's eligibility for the exemptions depended on facially origin-neutral factors, such as the domestic car company's relationship with the foreign importer, the use of local content, and the use of the imported car parts in the assembly in Indonesia of a domestic car. While these criteria, like those in Canada \u2013 Autos , were framed in origin neutral terms, the panel found that in practice only car imports from Korea could satisfy them. Therefore, the panel ruled that the tax advantages, as applied, were accorded in a fashion that discriminated against products from WTO Members on the basis of their origin.", "Article III: National Treatment", "Article III articulates the basic principle of \"national treatment\": Members must treat products from other Members no less favorably than they treat their own \"like\" domestic products. Accordingly, Article III reflects concern that WTO Members could use internal taxation schemes, regulations, and other domestic measures to protect their domestic industries. As written, Article III forbids Members from using internal taxes, charges, and regulations that affect the \"internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use of products,\" as well as internal quantitative regulations, so as to \"afford protection to domestic production.\"", "However, Article III prescribes different standards for national treatment depending on whether the particular measure is a tax or regulation. When a measure is an internal tax or charge, Article III:2 forbids its application if it either (1) is in excess of those taxes or charges applied to like domestic products or (2) dissimilarly taxes imports and domestic products so as to afford protection to a domestic product that is directly competitive with, or substitutable for, the imported product. However, when the measure in question is a \"law, regulation, or requirement affecting their internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, or use,\" Article III:4 proscribes its application if it treats foreign products less favorably than like domestic products. ", "A wide variety of measures fit the definition of a \"law, regulation, or requirement\" affecting \"internal\" transactions, and, as a result, are subject to Article III:4. Examples include local content requirements, advertising bans, and labeling requirements. WTO and GATT panels have also found that, while measures that tax particular products, such as sales taxes, are governed by Article III:2, measures that tax taxpayers for engaging in particular behavior, such as tax credits for specified taxpayer purchases, are assessed under Article III:4. Even border measures\u2014measures that affect importation or exportation\u2014governed by Article XI:1 can be subject to Article III:4. Ultimately, whether a \"law, regulation or requirement\" is covered by Article III:4 typically depends on whether it might modify the conditions of competition between domestic and imported products in the internal market. Significantly, WTO panels have found that these conditions can be modified not only by measures that regulate the products but also by measures that regulate their manufacturers or producers.", "In Thailand \u2013 Cigarettes , a WTO panel considered the Article III:4 consistency of Thai measures that imposed more reporting, registration, and recordkeeping requirements on resellers of imported cigarettes than were imposed on resellers of domestic cigarettes. Thailand argued, inter alia , that the reason for the difference was to ensure that the sale of domestic products and the sale of imports were both subject to the same regulatory regime and legal liabilities. Thailand alleged that because cigarette importers are not legally responsible for paying the taxes on their cigarettes, resellers of imported cigarettes presented a risk of tax evasion in the absence of measures subjecting the sale of imported cigarettes to reporting, collection, and enforcement mechanisms that mirrored those in place for the sale of domestic cigarettes. Therefore, Thailand contended that the measures merely imposed requirements on resellers of imported cigarettes for which there were already \"equivalent\" requirements imposed on resellers of domestic cigarettes. However, the WTO panel found that the Thai measures were inconsistent with Article III:4 because they could prejudice cigarette suppliers against importing and selling foreign-made cigarettes by raising the operating costs associated with selling imported cigarettes in the Thai market. The panel cited evidence that administrative burdens can and do affect business decisions and that the Thai measures at issue were enforced through penalties and other sanctions, including the denial of tax credits. Accordingly, the WTO panel and Appellate Body agreed that the Thai measures subjected imported cigarettes to less favorable treatment in violation of Article III:4.", "Article II: Tariffs", "The original goal of the GATT was to move countries toward imposing tariffs, rather than non-tariff trade barriers, that could then be reduced over time. Article II of the GATT embodies this goal by requiring each WTO Member to abide by the tariff schedule that it has submitted to the WTO. The goods that are subject to the negotiated tariff rates are called \"bound\" items. ", "Article II forbids Members from imposing tariffs on goods from other Members that are less favorable than the tariff rates listed in the applicable schedule. Furthermore, Members may not impose any other duty or charge on a product's importation that exceeds the duties that existed at the date the Members entered the WTO. There are, however, exceptions to Article II. Under Article II:2, tariff concessions do not prevent Members from levying internal taxes consistent with Article III:2 (these are often called \"border tax adjustments\"), antidumping or countervailing duties consistent with the GATT and other relevant agreements, and fees or other charges commensurate with the cost of services rendered.", "Despite Article II's importance to the GATT, its enforcement can be difficult because WTO Members frequently disagree about which duty applies to a particular good. A country's tariff schedules address categories and sub-categories of products but do not expressly identify and provide a tariff rate for every potential product variation and nuance. Despite these problems, a country's customs agency must rely on the tariff schedules as written to identify the kind of product under consideration and apply a tariff rate. This leads to problems like the one encountered in EC \u2013 Chicken Classification , in which Brazil complained that the European Union incorrectly classified fresh chicken packed in salt as fresh chicken cuts rather than salted chicken cuts. At issue was an EU regulation that provided the customs agency with guidance on the distinction between salted and fresh chicken cuts, stating that chicken must be \"deeply and homogenously impregnated with salt in all parts\" to be subject to the ad valorem duty that was more favorable to foreign imports than the duty that was applied to fresh chicken. ", "Article VIII: Fees and Formalities ", "Article VIII:1 of the GATT requires that all fees and charges imposed in connection with importation or exportation be (1) limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered, and (2) not represent an indirect protection to domestic products or a taxation of imports or exports for fiscal purposes. The first prong (limiting the amount to the cost of services rendered) is actually a dual requirement as it requires (a) that a service was rendered, and (b) that the level of the charge does not exceed the approximate cost of that service. Moreover, the term \"services rendered\" means services rendered to the individual importer in question.", "One of the early disputes involving Article VIII was US \u2013 Customs User Fee , which was heard by a GATT panel in 1987. In that case, the European Union and Canada challenged the GATT-consistency of an ad valorem processing fee charged by the U.S. Customs Service on all commercial merchandise entering the United States. The amount of the fee charged varied depended only on the appraised value of the merchandise, not on the costs incurred by the Customs Service of processing the merchandise. The United States argued that the fee was commensurate with the services rendered because it was commensurate with the sum costs of the Customs Service's commercial operations. The panel disagreed, finding that if the \"cost of services rendered\" referred to the total cost of the relevant government activities, rather than to the actual cost of the services rendered to the individual importers charged, Article VIII:1 would not provide an objective standard by which the equitable apportionment of these fees could be ascertained. Accordingly, it ruled that it the U.S. processing fee was inconsistent with Article VIII:1 to the extent that it caused fees to be levied in excess of the approximate cost of the services provided to each individual importer. ", "Similarly, in Argentina \u2013 Textiles , the panel found that Article VIII:1 forbade Argentina from imposing an ad valorem duty with no fixed fee on textile and footwear imports. In that case, Argentina was calculating an average import price for each tariff line of textiles, apparels, and footwear to determine what the specific minimum duty was for products in that category. Upon the importation of an article within that tariff line, Argentina then applied either the specific minimum duty or an ad valorem duty with no fixed fee depending which duty was higher. While Argentina claimed that it applied the higher ad valorem duty only to recoup the costs of the \"statistical services\" involved in calculating the average import price for tariff line, the panel ruled that because the ad valorem duty had no fixed maximum fee, it was inherently not limited to the approximate cost of the services rendered and therefore inconsistent with Article VIII:1. ", "In addition, in U.S. \u2013 Certain EC Products , a WTO panel ruled that Article VIII barred the United States from increasing bonding requirements on imports from the European Communities in order to secure the collection of future additional import duties that it was going to impose, once authorized by the DSB, for the European Communities' non-compliance with a WTO decision. The United States argued that the increased bonding requirements were a fee for the \"early release of merchandise,\" but the panel found that the United States failed to provide any evidence that the bonding requirements represented any approximate costs of such services.", "Article IX: Marks of Origin", "Article IX of the GATT disciplines marks of origin laws, that is, laws setting requirements for the labeling of certain products with their country or region of origin. Under Article IX:1, WTO Members may not accord to the products of other Members \"treatment with regard to marking requirements\" that is \"less favorable than the treatment accorded to like products of any third country.\" Article IX thus requires most favored nation treatment in marks of origin laws just as Article I requires most-favored nation treatment in the broader context of tariffs, other charges, and all rules and formalities connected to importation and exportation. In addition, while Article IX:2 recognizes that origin marking is important for protecting consumers against fraudulent or misleading labels, it calls on WTO Members to reduce the trade barriers that may result from domestic origin marking requirements. ", "Article IX is not so broad, however, as to govern measures requiring the labeling of process and production methods, even when the measure requires this labeling based on the location where the good was produced or harvested. In US \u2013 Tuna/Dolphin I , an unadopted report, a GATT panel rejected Mexico's allegations that provisions of the U.S. Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (DPCIA) were inconsistent with Article IX. The challenged provisions created civil penalties for selling tuna products with labels or other indications that the tuna was harvested in a manner not harmful to dolphins if the tuna was caught in particular locations by certain methods. The GATT panel agreed with the United States that these labeling provisions were subject to the nondiscrimination rules set by Article I and Article III:4, not the marks of origin rules set by Article IX. The panel reasoned that because Article IX does not entail a national treatment requirement, but only a most favored nation requirement, it was intended to regulate the marking of origin of imported products, but not the marking of products or their process and production methods generally. ", "Article XI: General Elimination of Quantitative Restrictions", "Article XI:1 of the GATT bars the institution or maintenance of quantitative restrictions on exports to, and imports from, any WTO Member's territory. Quantitative restrictions limit the amount of a product that may be imported or exported. Unlike internal regulations enforced at the border, quantitative restrictions hinder the opportunity for a product to enter into, rather than simply compete in, the enforcing country's market. Common examples of quantitative restrictions include embargoes, quotas, minimum import or export prices, and certain import or export licensing requirements. Only duties, taxes, and other charges are Article XI:1 consistent methods of restricting imports or exports. ", "By barring WTO Members from placing quantitative prohibitions or restrictions on the importation or exportation of products, Article XI illustrates the strong preference of GATT and Uruguay Round negotiators for tariffs as opposed to non-tariff border restrictions. These negotiators intentionally made tariffs the border protection of choice because they are more transparent and easily satisfied without bringing trade to a halt unlike quantitative restrictions, and, perhaps most importantly, they are capable of definitive reduction over time.", "Although Article XI:1 is a cornerstone GATT obligation, import and export restrictions are the frequent subject of WTO dispute settlement proceedings. In U.S. \u2013 Shrimp , for example, several WTO Members requested that a panel examine a U.S. ban on shrimp imports from nations whose trawling procedures the United States had not certified as sufficiently protecting sea turtles. The panel wrote that the express prohibition on imported shrimp from non-certified countries was inconsistent with Article XI:1, raising doubts about the WTO consistency of similar measures that ban imports or exports that do not meet certain criteria. ", "While an import ban can be readily identified as a quantitative restriction, WTO panels have also characterized \"discretionary\" or \"non-automatic\" licensing requirements as prohibited quantitative restrictions. As a result, a system under which the licensing authority has universally granted licenses to applicants who satisfy the prerequisites may still violate Article XI:1 if those prerequisites give the licensing authority unfettered discretion to deny a license. In addition, an early GATT case, Japan \u2013 Semi-Conductors , held that a lengthy license approval process also has a limiting effect on exportation in violation of Article XI:1. In that case, the GATT panel held that three-month delays in an agency's export licensing process restrained exports even though the delays did not result from any \"mandatory\" law, regulation, or requirement. Japan had required exporters to obtain licenses before exporting certain quantities of semi-conductors, and, after several years, lowered the threshold level of semi-conductors that could be shipped without a license. As a result of this change in policy, the number of license applications almost doubled. The licensing agency found itself unprepared for the sudden increase of applications, and, due to the back-up, applications often could not be processed for several months. The panel held that the practices resulting in the three-month delays in licensing had a limiting effect on exportation and were, therefore, de facto quantitative restrictions prohibited by Article XI:1. ", "Despite the strong policy choice behind it, Article XI does provide exceptions to its rule, including (1) export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent or relieve critical shortages facing the exporting Party; (2) quantitative restrictions that are \"necessary\" for the application of standards or regulations for the classification, grading, or marketing of commodities in international trade; and (3) import restrictions designed to remove a temporary surplus of the like domestic product.", "Other GATT articles may be implicated by the imposition of quantitative restrictions. Under Article XIII, for example, quantitative restrictions must be applied in accordance with most favored nation treatment. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Article XX: General Exceptions to the GATT and \"the Chapeau\"", "paragraphs": ["Article XX identifies 10 policy-related exceptions to the provisions of the GATT that may justify a GATT-inconsistent measure. To qualify for an exception, the violative measure must: (1) fall within the scope of one of the 10 exceptions; and (2) be applied in a manner that does not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on international trade. This second condition is referred to as \"the chapeau\" of Article XX because it is contained in the introductory clause, or the \"hat,\" of Article XX.", "The Article XX Exceptions ", "Among the 10 measures excepted from the GATT's provisions are those measures (1) necessary to protect public morals; (2) necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life and health; (3) relating to products of prison labor; (4) imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historic, or archaeological value; or (5) relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources which operate in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption.", "Article XX operates as an affirmative defense in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding. Consequently, Article XX is raised after a Member's measures are deemed inconsistent with the GATT and is invoked by the defending Member who bears the burden of proving that Article XX exempts the measures concerned from the provisions of the GATT. The defending Member must first show that the measure fits within one of the exceptions covered by Article XX. For Article XX exceptions that require the defending Member to prove that the measure is \"necessary\" to achieve an identified goal (e.g., to protect human, animal, or plant health), this means that the defending Member must make a prima facie case that (1) the common interests or values protected by the measure are important, (2) the measure materially contributes to the realization of the ends it pursues, and (3) the restrictive impact of the measure on international commerce is outweighed by its contribution to the stated values or interests. The complaining Member may then rebut the defending Member's arguments by showing that there are less restrictive alternatives available. Then the defending Member must show that these alternatives would not be effective or feasible. ", "The Article XX Chapeau", "If the defending Member is successful in showing that the measure fits into one of the stated Article XX exceptions, it must next show that the measure satisfies the \"chapeau.\" Specifically, the defending Member must establish that, as applied, the measure neither (1) creates arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail nor (2) constitutes a disguised restriction on international trade. The chapeau is intended to strictly discipline the use of the Article XX exceptions so as to distinguish measures intended to protect legitimate interests from measures intended to circumvent a Member's WTO obligations. Accordingly, the chapeau imposes requirements that are more difficult to satisfy than the requirements of any one of the 10 policy exceptions. ", "Relatively few panel or Appellate Body reports have articulated the standards for determining that a measure is a disguised restriction on international trade. Ostensibly, this analysis involves a heightened analysis of the intent behind the measure's application to discern whether the defending Member's true motive was protectionism. Because the intent behind a measure \"may not be easily ascertained,\" panels may scrutinize the \"design, architecture, and revealing structure\" for signs of knowing or willful \"protective application.\" A WTO panel may also consider the extent to which the measure's application has a discriminatory effect, such as benefiting a domestic industry to the detriment of a foreign one. Given the rudimentary nature of WTO jurisprudence in this area, it can be difficult to predict whether a given measure would be indefensible under Article XX because its application constituted a disguised restriction on trade. ", "In contrast to the jurisprudence on \"disguised restrictions,\" a host of WTO panels and Appellate Body reports have declared measures inconsistent with the Article XX chapeau because their application constituted arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination. These decisions express a strong preference for measures applied after international negotiations or pursuant to an international agreement. The seeming corollary of this preference, moreover, is the distaste that panels and the Appellate Body have shown for measures with a unilateral or coercive character. As discussed below, these preferences are expressed both in the Appellate Body's interpretation of the term \"discrimination\" and its interpretation of the phrase \"arbitrary or unjustifiable.\" ", "According to the Appellate Body, \"discrimination,\" for the purposes of the Article XX chapeau, occurs when a measure is applied without regard for the similarity of\u2014or differences between\u2014the conditions in either the importing and exporting countries or two importing countries. In other words, both the differential treatment of countries in which the same conditions prevail as well as the uniform treatment of countries where different conditions prevail constitute discrimination. Once a measure's application is deemed discriminatory, a WTO panel will assess the nature of the discrimination to determine whether it is \"arbitrary or unjustifiable.\" This analysis depends on whether the discrimination has a \"a legitimate cause or rationale in light of the [Article XX] objectives,\" and often requires an assessment of the actions, if any, that the defending Member took to prevent foreseeable discrimination. ", "For example, in U.S. \u2013 Shrimp , the Appellate Body examined the GATT consistency of a U.S. measure prohibiting the importation of shrimp from countries not certified by the United States as maintaining a regulatory program or fishing environment that satisfied the U.S. standards for sea turtle protection. After determining that the shrimp import ban created discrimination because it was \"coercive,\" the Appellate Body assessed whether this discrimination was \"arbitrary or unjustifiable.\" It described its approach to this question as \"heavily\" influenced by the U.S. failure to engage all shrimp exporting Members in negotiations before enforcing the ban. Indeed, the Appellate Body ultimately found that the discrimination was unjustifiable because (1) the import ban reflected U.S. negotiations with some, but not all, WTO Members that export shrimp; and (2) the United States had not even attempted to use existing international mechanisms to achieve international cooperation. As a result, the Appellate Body wrote, the ban had a \"unilateral character\" that heightened both its discriminatory nature and its \"unjustifiability.\"", "In a subsequent decision, U.S. \u2013 Shrimp (Article 21.5) , the Appellate Body clarified what it meant by international cooperation. In that case, Malaysia challenged the adequacy of the measures the United States imposed to implement the Appellate Body's decision in U.S. \u2013 Shrimp . Specifically, the Department of State had revised its guidelines so that countries could be certified for shrimp imports once they demonstrated either that their shrimp fishing environments did not pose a threat of incidental sea turtle capture or that they had implemented, and were enforcing, a \"comparably effective\" regulatory program. In determining whether a country's regulatory program was \"comparably effective\" to U.S. standards, the guidelines stated that the Department of State would \"take fully into account any demonstrated differences between the shrimp fishing conditions in the United States and those in other nations.\" In addition, the United States commenced international negotiations with Malaysia, the complaining Member, as well as other countries. Although these negotiations did not yield an agreement between the United States and Malaysia, the discrimination caused by the U.S. embargo and shrimp import certification procedures was not \"arbitrary or unjustifiable\" because the United States had undertaken \"serious, good faith efforts\" to avoid it.", "Article XXI: National S ecurity Exceptions to the GATT", "Article XXI lists three very specific occasions when international or domestic security interests trump a Member's obligations under the GATT. In any one of these three situations, a Member's noncompliance with the GATT will not be considered a violation of its provisions. These occasions occur when: ", "(1) the Member's noncompliance is the refusal to disclose information and the Member considers the disclosure contrary to its essential security interests; ", "(2) the Member considers noncompliance necessary to protect its essential security interests relating to fissionable materials, the traffic in arms or other materials for the purpose of supplying a military establishment, or a time of a war or emergency in international relations, or ", "(3) the Member's noncompliance occurs in its pursuit of its obligations under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.", "In general, Article XXI is understood as intending to remove legitimate national security matters from the scope of GATT obligations and to discourage use of the exception for measures with commercially inspired goals. Moreover, some countries, including the United States, have taken the position that the Article is \"self-judging,\" that is, that each WTO Member may determine whether a particular matter is contrary to or necessary for the protection of its essential security interests and that determination cannot be reviewed by WTO panels or the Appellate Body. While this position raises questions about the proper role of dispute settlement proceedings in this area, to date there is no WTO case law on the application of Article XXI. ", "Despite the absence of case law, Article XXI has played a role in the diplomatic discourse that precedes, and in some cases eliminates the need for, a request for consultations. For example, when WTO Members have threatened to request consultations over the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 (\"Helms-Burton Act,\" P.L. 104-114 , 22 U.S.C. 6021 et seq. ), the United States responded with claims that the measure was justified under Article XXI. The goal behind the LIBERTAD Act was to dissuade other countries from investing in Cuba and to generally undercut the Fidel Castro regime. To achieve this goal, the law codified and strengthened the long-standing embargo against Cuba, making parties liable under U.S. law for trafficking in property expropriated by Cuba from U.S. citizens without compensation and requiring the U.S. State Department to deny visas to officials of companies that had trafficked in such property. The European Union asked for WTO consultations, stating that the LIBERTAD Act would violate both the GATT and the GATS by, inter alia, restraining E.U. companies who export goods to Cuba or trade in goods from Cuba and excluding E.U. citizens from entering the United States. During the ensuing meetings and negotiations between the United States and the European Union, the United States contended that, if the LIBERTAD Act was indeed inconsistent with the WTO agreements, it was justified under Article XXI. Moreover, because, in its view, it is up to the country invoking Article XXI to determine when a particular trade measure is justified by national security concerns, the United States argued that any WTO panel would lack competence to assess the use of Article XXI and, consequently, there could be no WTO proceedings on any dispute resulting out of the consultations on this issue. This dispute never actually came before a panel because the two governments reached a diplomatic solution in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding, and the European Union requested that the panel suspend its work. ", "Article XXIII: The Basis for WTO Dispute Settlement", "Article XXIII provides the basis for dispute settlement under both the GATT and under the other WTO agreements. Article XXIII entitles any WTO Member who considers that a benefit granted by the GATT is being \"nullified or impaired or that the attainment of any objective of the Agreement is being impeded\" to have recourse to WTO dispute settlement procedures. Most often, the nullification or impairment of a benefit (or the impeding of the realization of an objective) results from a violation of an obligation prescribed by a WTO agreement, but Article XXIII states that it could also result from a Member's application of a measure that does not conflict with the provisions of a WTO agreement or from \"any other situation.\" However, disputes alleging nullification and impairment of trade benefits from non-violative actions occur much less frequently than disputes alleging violations of WTO agreements.", "In general, proving nullification or impairment requires showing that the affected imports are subject to and benefiting from a WTO agreement market access concession (e.g., a tariff) and their competitive position is being upset by the challenged measure. However, when the complaining Member demonstrates that the challenged measure violates an obligation prescribed by a WTO agreement, the measure is considered prima facie to constitute a case of nullification or impairment. In other words, there is a presumption that a breach of the rules adversely affects other Members, and, consequently, it shifts the burden to the defending Member to disprove the presumed nullification or impairment. To date, very few Members have tried to rebut this presumption, and it appears that none have succeeded, which has led some to suggest that the presumption may be rebuttable only in theory.", "Article XXIV: Customs Unions and Free Trade Areas", "WTO Members' participation in free trade agreements and customs unions is facially inconsistent with the MFN obligation because parties to these arrangements may grant lower tariff rates and more favorable treatment to each other's goods without granting those benefits to the goods of other WTO Members. However, these arrangements are permitted under Article XXIV as vehicles of trade liberalization. ", "Like Articles XX and XXI, Article XXIV operates as a defense to justify an otherwise GATT-inconsistent measure, namely a measure related to the formation of customs unions or free trade areas. Article XXIV justifies these measures only if the formation of the customs union or free trade area in question would be made impossible if the measure concerned was not allowed. It is unclear at this time, however, how a WTO panel or the Appellate Body would determine whether a measure satisfies this standard.", "Under Article XXIV:8(a), the members of both customs unions and free trade areas are required to eliminate \"duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce\" with respect to \"substantially all\" trade between them. The \"substantially all\" standard offers customs unions and free trade areas some flexibility in the degree to which they liberalize the trade between them. Furthermore, in Argentina \u2013 Footwear , the Appellate Body found that Article XXIV:8(a)'s requirement to eliminate all tariffs and commerce-restricting regulations on trade among customs union members did not prohibit Argentina's imposition of safeguard measures on countries who were part of a customs union (MERCOSUR) with Argentina.

The Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 (the Antidumping, or AD, Agreement) provides substantive and procedural requirements for WTO Members to follow in conducting antidumping investigations and imposing antidumping duties, which supplement existing tariffs. No action against the dumping of exports from another Member can be taken except in accordance with the provisions of the GATT, as interpreted by the Antidumping Agreement.", "Under the Antidumping Agreement, a domestic investigation of dumping by a WTO Member must be triggered by a written application by or on behalf of a domestic industry. An application meets this standard if domestic producers expressing support for the application produce both a greater percentage of \"like products\" than the domestic industry opposed to the application and no less than 25% of total production of \"like products.\" All WTO Members must inform the Committee on Antidumping Practices when they initiate anti-dumping actions and provide reports on all ongoing investigations. ", "The AD Agreement defines dumping as introducing a product into a foreign country's market at an export price lower than the product's \"normal value\"\u2014that is, its \"comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting country.\" Accordingly, the first step in assessing a dumping margin is calculating the normal value and the export price of the product. Although the normal value is ordinarily the market price in the country of export, Article 2.2 of the AD Agreement permits WTO Members to use a different methodology for calculating the normal value in certain circumstances. In addition, by incorporating an interpretative note to Article VI of the GATT, Article 2.7 of the AD Agreement permits WTO Members to use surrogate country data to make price comparisons about the normal value of products allegedly dumped by a government-controlled, i.e., nonmarket, economy (NME). Once the normal value is determined, the investigating authorities must calculate the dumping margin by comparing the product's export price with its normal value. Article 2.4 of the Antidumping Agreement requires this comparison be fair, made at the same level of trade (i.e., ex-factory, wholesale, or retail), and made with sales that occurred, as nearly as possible, at the same time. If the dumping margin is de minimis , the investigating Member may not impose anti-dumping duties. Many WTO disputes center around the methodology that a WTO Member uses to calculate the dumping margin. In particular, the practice of using \"zeroing\" to assess a country's dumping margin has been a frequent subject of WTO dispute settlement proceedings and is discussed later in this report.", "To form the basis for anti-dumping duties, dumping must cause or threaten injury to the domestic industry or materially retard its establishment. The presence of injury is determined by examining the import volume of the dumped product, its effect on the prices in the domestic market for a like product, and the resulting impact on domestic producers of the like product. Several additional factors are relevant when the WTO Member is investigating allegations that the dumping causes a threat of injury, rather than actual injury. For the purposes of these injury and threat determinations, the term \"domestic industry\" generally refers to the domestic producers as a whole of a like product or the domestic producers of a major proportion of the total domestic production of a like product. Only in exceptional circumstances may a WTO Member use a narrower regional definition.", "Finally, the AD Agreement requires a WTO Member to determine that the dumping causes the injury to the domestic industry. Article 3.5 of the Agreement contains a non-attribution requirement: investigating authorities must separate and distinguish the injurious effect of other factors from the injuries effects of the dumped imports to ensure that the imposition of an antidumping duty on the imports at issue would, in fact, be justified. ", "Ultimately, WTO Members must limit the amount of any antidumping duty imposed to the amount \"adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry,\" and the duty must be lifted as soon as it is no longer necessary to counteract the dumping causing the injury. The AD Agreement requires WTO Members to review the need for the continued imposition of any antidumping duty when requested by an interested party. Members must also \"terminate\" an antidumping duty five years after its imposition unless, after review, the authorities determine that lifting the duty would lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures", "paragraphs": ["Like the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement) is an agreement meant to expand, clarify, and implement some of the original provisions of the GATT. One of these provisions, Article VI addresses measures taken to offset any subsidy granted to an imported product. The second, Article XVI, requires Members to notify subsidies and be prepared to discuss limiting those subsidies if they cause serious damage to other Members. However, neither Article VI nor Article XVI defines the term \"subsidy\" or provides clear and comprehensive rules for governments who are either offering, or responding to, subsidies. Consequently, these provisions were deemed vague and inconsistently applied, and support developed for a new, clearer, and more comprehensive agreement on subsidies. Accordingly, the SCM Agreement was developed to discipline Members' use of subsidies and their responses to countering the effects of certain subsidies. ", "Among the advantages that the SCM Agreement provides over the subsidy provisions of Articles VI and XVI of the GATT is a more precise definition of subsidy. The SCM Agreement defines \"subsidy\" as a financial contribution by a government or public body within a WTO Member's territory that confers a benefit. A financial contribution may take the form of (1) a direct transfer of funds, such as a grant, loan, or loan guarantee; (2) government revenue (i.e., a tax) \"otherwise due\" but foregone or not collected; (3) governmental provision of goods or services other than general infrastructure; (4) governmental payments to a funding mechanism or the government's entrusting a private body to carry out at least one of the functions described above. In addition, WTO panels and the Appellate Body have interpreted the word \"benefit\" broadly to include receipt of a financial contribution on terms that are more favorable than those available to the recipient in the marketplace.", "The SCM Agreement entitles a WTO Member to respond to subsidized imports in two ways. One authorized response is to use the WTO dispute settlement process to seek withdrawal of the subsidy or the removal of its adverse effects. The second authorized response is to launch a domestic investigation and ultimately charge an extra duty, known as a countervailing duty, on subsidized imports that are injuring domestic producers. For a subsidy to be remedied under either procedure, it must be specific in law or fact to an enterprise, industry, or group thereof. Prohibited subsidies, as described below, are considered specific per se .", "The SCM Agreement divides subsidies into two categories: prohibited and actionable. Prohibited subsidies are contingent upon either export performance or the use of domestic over imported products. If a subsidy is deemed prohibited, the WTO dispute settlement body will recommend that the subsidizing Member withdraw the subsidy without delay and specify a time-period in which the measure should be withdrawn. ", "All other subsidies are actionable, meaning they may be subject to dispute settlement or domestic remedies if they are used in a way that causes adverse effects to the interests of the complaining Member. There are three types of adverse effects: (1) material injury to the domestic industry of the complaining member; (2) nullification or impairment of the Member's WTO benefits (such as tariff concessions on a particular product); and, (3) serious prejudice to the Member's interests.", "Regardless of whether the subsidies are prohibited or actionable, if the defending Member does not remove a subsidy or its adverse effects within a set compliance period, the WTO dispute settlement body may, upon request, authorize the complaining Member to impose new or additional tariffs, known as countervailing duties, against the subsidizing Member's exports. The goal of these countervailing duties is to effectively restore the benefits that are supposed to accrue to the complaining Member under the WTO agreements. As discussed in the later section on domestic investigations of foreign subsidies, Members may also impose countervailing duties against subsidized imports without first requesting consultations and bringing the dispute before a WTO panel. However, when a Member imposes countervailing duties without first litigating the dispute, it may do so only if it initiates and conducts its investigation of the foreign subsidies in accordance with the provisions of the SCM Agreement.", "The interpretation of the SCM Agreement was at issue in the \"Boeing-Airbus cases\" between the United States and the European Union. The United States first requested dispute settlement proceedings in 2004, alleging that several European Union countries provided a variety of actionable and prohibited subsidies to Airbus, including, inter alia , \"launch aid,\" grants and loans for research and development, and the governmental provision of infrastructure goods and services to develop and upgrade Airbus manufacturing sites. The European Union filed a countersuit, alleging that the U.S. provided actionable and prohibited subsidies to Boeing, including, inter alia , state and federal tax incentives, access to NASA and Department of Defense (DOD) facilities and equipment for corporate research and development, and payments by both agencies to Boeing pursuant to contracts for research and development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreement on Safeguards", "paragraphs": ["A safeguard measure is a temporary restriction imposed on imports to allow a domestic industry time to adjust to import surges.

Because safeguard measures disturb the balance of rights and obligations, the Members affected by a safeguard are entitled to appropriate trade compensation.", "The foundation for both domestic and international safeguard law is Article XIX of the GATT, which permits Members to apply safeguards where two conditions are met: (1) imports are increasing as a result of both unforeseen developments and the effect of obligations incurred by Members under GATT, and (2) imports are increasing in such quantities as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.

The Appellate Body has clarified the \"increased imports\" requirement to mean an increase that is \"recent, sudden, sharp, and significant.\" This means that the legality of a safeguard hinges in part on the rate and amount of the increase in the recent past. Import trends that precede the recent past (e.g., import trends over the previous five years rather than the previous two) are not grounds for imposing a safeguard measure, and, if older data and more recent data show conflicting trends, the most recent data on imports takes precedence in a determination of a safeguard measure's legality.

For example, preferential rules of origin determine whether a product originated in a country that participates in a reciprocal trade agreement with, or benefits from a tariff preference program administered by, the importing country. Nonpreferential rules of origin determine a product's country of origin for all other purposes, including application of most favored nation treatment, quantitative restrictions, imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties, and government procurement requirements.", "There is no international consensus on how countries should formulate their rules of origin. The United States and many WTO Members apply the \"substantial transformation\" standard under which the source of a given import is the country in which the last \"substantial transformation\" occurred. However, other countries may identify a product's country of origin as the country in which (1) a certain percentage of value was added to the good; (2) the activity resulting in a particular change in the product's tariff classification occurred; or (3) a specified production process occurred.", "By agreeing to the WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin (RO Agreement), WTO Members agreed to a negotiate a uniform set of nonpreferential rules of origin.

Among Article 2's lengthy list of directives is both a national treatment and an MFN requirement, a prohibition on the use of rules of origin as a primary means of protecting domestic industries or favoring a particular Member's imports, and a requirement that rules of origin not themselves create restrictive, distorting, or disruptive effects on trade.

Determining that the phrase \"contingent on exports\" has the same meaning it is given under the SCM Agreement, the Panel found that the Step 2 payments were export subsidies under the AA because, to receive them, exporters had to prove that they had exported U.S. cotton.

Characteristics that are related to the product include their identification, presentation, and appearance. In EC \u2013 Sardines , for example, Peru challenged an EU regulation prescribing common marketing standards for preserved sardines. The EU regulation required that all fish labeled and marketed as \"preserved sardines\" belong to one species of fish, Sardina pilchardus , effectively prohibiting all other fish species from being sold as \"preserved sardines\" in the EU market. Because the regulation conditioned the \"naming\" of preserved sardines on product characteristics, the WTO Appellate Body held that it prescribed product related characteristics.

In that case, Canada challenged a French decree that criminalized, inter alia , the sale, import, and placing on the domestic market of asbestos fibers and materials, products, or devices containing those fibers. Although the French measure mandated that all products not contain asbestos, it had the same effect, in the Appellate Body's view, as requiring all products to have a shared characteristic because it effectively required all products to be asbestos-free.

Technical regulations are documents that prescribe product characteristics or their related processes and production methods with which compliance is mandatory . Technical regulations can include import bans and prohibitions that are related to product characteristics or PPMs. Standards are documents that have been approved by a recognized body and prescribe product characteristics or their related processes and production methods with which compliance is voluntary . Conformity assessment procedures (CAPs) are procedures, such as those related to testing, verification, inspection, or certification, that are used to ensure that the requirements prescribed by a given standard and/or technical regulation are satisfied.

WTO panels have suggested that the analysis of whether a technical regulation is, in fact, \"more trade-restrictive than necessary\" is an inquiry into whether the measure's trade-restrictiveness is required to achieve the Member's chosen level of protection. Accordingly, WTO panels have compared the extent to which a given technical regulation contributes to the achievement of the Member's policy goal with \"a potential less trade restrictive alternative measure\" to determine whether the latter would similarly fulfill the Member's objective at the chosen level of protection.

", "SPS measures covered by the SPS Agreement are those that \"may, directly or indirectly, affect international trade.\" The Agreement defines an SPS measure to include four types of protective or preventative measures: (1) measures to protect animal or plant life or health arising from the entry, establishment, or spread of pests or diseases; (2) measures to protect human or animal life or health from risks arising from additives, contaminants, toxins, or disease-causing organisms in foods, beverages, or feedstuffs; (3) measures to protect human life or health from risks arising from diseases carried by animals, plants, or products, or from the entry, establishment, or spread of pests; and (4) measures to prevent or limit other damage from the entry, establishment, or spread of pests. ", "Articles 2 and 5 of the SPS Agreement set out Members' basic rights and obligations. Article 2.2 requires WTO Members to ensure that any covered SPS measure is (1) applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; (2) based on scientific principles; and (3) not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence, unless it is provisionally adopted and maintained in conformity with Article 5.7. Article 2.3 requires WTO Members to further ensure that their SPS measures neither \"arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between Members where identical or similar conditions prevail, including between their own territory and that of other Members\" nor are applied \"in a manner which would constitute a disguised restriction on international trade.\" This language prohibiting arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination and disguised restrictions on trade is also in Article XX of the GATT. ", "Article 5.3 obligates WTO Members \"to avoid arbitrary or unjustifiable distinctions\" in the levels of sanitary or phytosanitary protection \"if such distinctions result in discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.\" Article 5.6 obligates WTO Members to ensure that their sanitary or phytosanitary measures \"are not more trade-restrictive than required to achieve their appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection.\" Notably, a measure will not be deemed to be more trade restrictive than required unless there is a feasible alternative that would achieve the \"appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection\" and be \"significantly less restrictive to trade.\"", "Like the TBT Agreement, the SPS Agreement requires Members to base their SPS measures on international standards, guidelines, or recommendations where they exist. The three sources of international standards for SPS measures are: the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX), the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), and the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO). SPS measures that conform to these organizations' international standards or guidelines are deemed necessary and presumed consistent with both the SPS Agreement and the GATT. If there is not a relevant international standard, Members may still apply SPS measures to imports so long as the measures are based on \"sufficient scientific evidence.\" If the scientific evidence is insufficient, Members may provisionally adopt SPS measures on the basis of the available information but must seek additional information for a more objective assessment of the risk and review the SPS measure within a reasonable period of time. ", "Another core provision of the SPS Agreement requires Members to \"base\" their SPS measures on \"an assessment, as appropriate to the circumstances, of the risks to human, animal, or plant life or health, taking into account risk assessment techniques developed by relevant international organizations.\" In EC \u2013 Biotech Products , the WTO panel wrote that a Member satisfies this obligation when (1) an evaluation that meets the SPS Agreement's definition of a \"risk assessment\" is conducted, and (2) the measure at issue is \"based\" on that assessment. Notably, the Member imposing the measure at issue need not perform the risk assessment itself so long as a risk assessment that meets the criteria in Annex A of the SPS Agreement was performed. ", "The type of risk assessment required depends on the purpose of the SPS measure at stake. In the case of measures concerned with pests or disease, the term \"risk assessment\" means an \"evaluation of the likelihood entry, establishment, or spread of a pest or disease... according to the sanitary or phytosanitary measures which might be applied, and of the associated potential biological and ecological consequences.\" In the case of measures concerned with food additives, a risk assessment is defined as an \"evaluation of the potential for adverse effects on human or animal health arising from the presence of additives, contaminants, toxins, or disease-causing organisms in food, beverages or feedstuffs.\" ", "Assuming that a WTO panel finds that an SPS measure was imposed after the requisite risk assessment, it will then determine whether the measure was, in fact, \"based\" on that assessment. According to the WTO Appellate Body's decision in EC \u2013 Hormones , a measure is based on a risk assessment if the results of the risk assessment \"reasonably support\" the measure at stake. A measure meets this test if (1) it has a scientific basis, even if it reflects \"divergent or minority views\"; (2) the defending Member's interpretation and application of that evidence is \"objective and coherent\"; and (3) there is a scientific basis for determining that the results of the risk assessment warrant the imposition of the SPS measure at issue. Although a WTO panel will determine whether a Member conformed with these requirements, the panel may not substitute its own judgment for that of the risk assessor. ", "Notably, however, some measures that meet the SPS Agreement's general definition of an SPS measure may be imposed without a risk assessment. For example, in EC \u2013 Biotech Products , a WTO panel found that although the European Union's regulatory regime for the approval and marketing of biotech products was designed to protect the lives and health of humans and plants, the SPS Agreement permitted the EU to temporarily place a moratorium on the approval of applications to market new genetically modified organisms without first conducting the risk assessment described in Article 5.1. The panel stated that SPS measures have both the objective of protecting animal, plant, or human life or health and the \"nature\" of \"requirements and procedures,\" and the moratorium was a decision to delay final substantive approval decisions\u2014not a requirement or a procedure subject to Article 5. Nevertheless, the panel found that, while the moratorium was exempt from the risk assessment requirement, it was subject to and in violation of other provisions of the SPS Agreement.", "Finally, in addition to restraining the preparation and adoption of SPS measures that interfere with international trade, the SPS Agreement established processes and mechanisms that enhance the transparency of countries' SPS measures and a forum for Members to resolve concerns relating to SPS measures without resorting to formal dispute settlement. To those ends, the Agreement requires each Member to notify other Members of new or changed SPS regulations when the regulation will significantly affect trade and either no relevant international standard exists or the new regulation differs from the relevant international standard. It also establishes the Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures to, inter alia , facilitate ad hoc consultations and negotiations among Members on specific sanitary and phytosanitary issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Agreement on Trade in Services", "paragraphs": ["The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is designed to liberalize trade in services. Unlike international trade in goods, which is largely governed by measures imposed at countries' borders, trade in services tends to be governed mostly by internal regulations. Internal regulations might, for example, restrict the number of drugstores allowed within a geographical area, define technical safety requirements for airline companies, or prohibit banks from selling certain financial products. As this list suggests, the GATS disciplines a wide range of domestic measures, but some of its provisions, including those on market access and national treatment, are limited by the scope of each country's commitments, which are defined in the national schedules and subject to progressive reduction. The GATS also contains a number of annexes addressing specific individual service sectors.", "The GATS does not define the term \"service\" except to exclude \"services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority\" from its definition. Instead, the GATS purports to regulate measures affecting the supply of a service in four \"modes\": (1) from a service supplier in one Member to a consumer in another Member without travel (e.g., an architecture firm mails blueprints to a consumer overseas), (2) in the territory of one Member to a consumer of any other Member (e.g., in the U.S. to a foreign tourist), (3) by a service supplier of one Member with a commercial presence in the territory of any other member (e.g., by a commercial bank with branches in a foreign country), and (4) by a service supplier of one Member travelling temporarily to provide services in another Member (e.g., by a consultant on an overseas business trip).", "Notably, a service supplier under the GATS includes entities engaged in \"the production, distribution, marketing, sale and delivery of a service.\" Measures \"affecting trade in services\" include any measure \"in respect of,\" inter alia , \"the purchase, payment or use of a service\" or \"the presence, including commercial presence, of persons of a Member for the supply of a service in the territory of another Member.\" Because the GATS defines both \"service suppliers\" and \"measures affecting trade in services\" broadly, the GATS applies not only to measures directly regulating the supply of a service, but also a wide range of other measures that affect the service sector. ", "Because the GATS permits Members to specify how they will reduce market access barriers to trade in services, whether a particular measure is GATS-inconsistent generally hinges on the scope of the national schedules of commitments of the Member imposing the measure. Unlike the GATT, under which the nondiscrimination provisions apply to goods from all Members, the GATS permits Members to schedule (1) exemptions from the Most Favored Nation (MFN) treatment obligation, and (2) specific service sector commitments to the national treatment obligation. As a result, each Member limits the scope of its obligations not to discriminate between services provided by firms from different Members and between services provided by foreign, rather than domestic, firms. Article XXI of the GATS allows a WTO Member to modify or withdraw any of its scheduled commitments once three years have elapsed from the date the commitment entered into force, subject to certain conditions, including possible compensation to Members affected by the change. ", "The GATS does not compel a government to privatize services industries or outlaw government or private monopolies. However, the GATS is, like the TBT and SPS Agreements discussed above, concerned with increasing transparency. Article III of the GATS requires governments to publish all relevant laws and regulations and to set enquiry points that can provide foreign companies and governments with information about entering and competing in a service sector. This is particularly important because service sectors may be regulated by multiple government entities at both the national and local levels. Consequently, service providers seeking to do business internationally may be stymied by a lack of transparency in how a country licenses its service providers or regulates service delivery. U.S. service providers continue to cite the lack of transparency in the development and implementation of foreign countries' regulations as a primary obstacle to increasing foreign trade in services. If the policy goals behind the GATS are achieved, Members' will presumably have an improved understanding of all other Members' services regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights", "paragraphs": ["The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) sets minimum standards for the intellectual property rights that WTO Members must offer their nationals and the enforcement of those rights. Developing countries, however, have delayed compliance periods.

Consequently, any advantage in IPR protection granted to nationals of one WTO Member must be granted to nationals of all other WTO Members, and Members must treat nationals of other WTO Members no less favorably in terms of IPR protection than they treat their own nationals. The term \"nationals\" in the TRIPS Agreement refers to natural or legal persons that are either domiciled in a particular country or have a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment there.", "Prior to the TRIPS Agreement, intellectual property rights were primarily regulated at the international level by treaties administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Most of the obligations of the WIPO treaties are now incorporated by reference into Articles 2.1 and 9.1 of the TRIPS Agreement so that compliance with the WIPO treaties remains the baseline for compliance with the TRIPS Agreement. However, the TRIPS Agreement also builds on WIPO treaties by establishing additional minimum obligations, most notably in the areas of copyright, trademarks, geographical indications, patents, and undisclosed information (i.e., trade secrets). The TRIPS Agreement also has \"exception clauses,\" which permit WTO Members to pass measures that authorize particular forms of IPR \"infringement\" without running afoul of TRIPS Agreement obligations.

The U.S. argued that these exceptions were permissible under the TRIPS Agreement because they were covered by Article 13, which permits WTO Members to create limited exceptions to the exclusive rights of copyright holders. The panel found that Article 13 permits a WTO Member to provide exceptions to the exclusive rights of copyright holders only if (1) those exceptions are clearly defined, (2) when utilized, those exceptions do not create economic competition with the ways that right holders normally extract economic value from copyrights and thereby deprive them of significant or tangible commercial gains, and (3) when utilized, those exceptions do not cause or have the potential to cause an unreasonable loss of income to the copyright owner. ", "Applying this standard, the panel found that one, but not both, of the exceptions contained in Section 110(5) were covered by Article 13. Specifically, the panel stated that the \"homestyle\" exception, which allows small restaurants and retail outlets to amplify music broadcasts with equipment commonly used in private homes without authorization or payment of a royalty to the copyright holder, met the requirements of Article 13. In reaching this conclusion, it noted that only a small percentage of all eating, drinking, and retail establishments in the U.S. was eligible to use the exception and this small group was further narrowed by the additional requirement that they use \"homestyle\" equipment (i.e., commonly available stereo systems). In contrast, the \"business\" exception, which allowed food service, drinking, and small retail establishments to amplify copyrighted music without authorization or payment of a fee, did not meet the requirements of Article 13 because a substantial majority of U.S. eating and drinking establishments and close to half of all U.S. retail establishments could make use of the exception."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Dispute Settlement Understanding", "paragraphs": ["The WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (Dispute Settlement Understanding or DSU) significantly strengthened the earlier GATT dispute settlement mechanism.

To achieve this goal, the AGP is designed to both reduce laws and regulations that discriminate against foreign products or services and increase the transparency of government procurement procedures.", "The general obligations of the AGP only apply to government contracts that meet four criteria. First, the AGP does not apply to government contracts below the monetary threshold for the procuring entity. These thresholds are identified in the five annexes contained in Appendix I so that Annex 1 contains the threshold for central government entities, Annex 2 contains the threshold for sub-central government entities, etc. Secondly, the AGP does not apply to procurements by, or necessary for fulfilling a contract with, the government. To determine whether a procurement meets this test, WTO panels may consider whether the government is paying for the good at issue; whether the government will use or benefit from its use; whether the government will possess it; whether the government controls its acquisition process; and whether the procuring entity had a commercial interest in the transaction. In addition, AGP parties have negotiated exceptions for some of their government entities so that their procurements are exempt from the AGP. Third, the AGP only applies to procurements between two parties to the AGP. Consequently, if the U.S. government is procuring a good from a non-party, the United States is not obligated to comply with the provisions of the AGP. Fourth, the object of the procurement must be a covered good or, alternatively, a party not exempted by the party's schedule.

Furthermore, each party must ensure that its entities do not treat locally established suppliers less favorably on the basis of foreign affiliation or ownership, and parties may not discriminate against locally established suppliers on the basis of the country of production of the good or service in question. For the purposes of applying these obligations, Article IV mandates that the rules of origin applied in the normal course of trade also apply to transactions covered by the AGP.", "However, as under the GATT, there are affirmative defenses to violations of the AGP. Article XXII of the AGP authorizes each party to take action, or not disclose information, regarding procurement that \"it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests relating to the procurement of arms, ammunition or war materials, or to procurement for indispensable for national security or for national defense purposes.\" The United States identifies several government agencies and types of procurements that it considers are exempt from the AGP by virtue of this national security exception.

Under the current model, the United States pursues trade liberalization in trade in goods through provisions on nondiscrimination, tariff reduction, rules of origin, sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, trade remedies, and other obligations that resemble those found in the GATT and WTO agreements on trade in goods. In addition, the model FTA covers trade in services, with specialized provisions on telecommunications and financial services, investment, government procurement, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement. Although provisions on labor rights and environmental protection were not a part of earlier U.S. trade agreements, they are now standard and increasingly enforceable. Most recently, the model FTA has evolved to include electronic commerce obligations. While the texts of the free trade agreements generally establish each country's obligations, the contracting countries reserve exceptions to these obligations in the annexes. Consequently, a full understanding of each country's obligations under a free trade agreement comes from reading both the body and the annexes to each agreement.", "Congress has played a significant role in the evolution of the model FTA. First and foremost, the Trade Promotion Authority statutes, which authorize the Executive to negotiate and enter into trade agreements with foreign countries, set the U.S. negotiating objectives. In addition, in 2007 Congress and the George W. Bush Administration negotiated the \"Bipartisan Trade Deal\" or \"May 10\" understanding. This trade deal required the incorporation of certain provisions into the Peru, South Korea, Panama, and Colombia trade agreements in the areas of labor, environment, intellectual property, foreign investors' rights, and port security. Essentially, the Bipartisan Trade Deal modified the model FTA, and, consequently, countries that had already passed domestic legislation regarding pending free trade agreements with the United States incorporated the changes.

The core investment provisions of NAFTA have, in turn, been renegotiated and redrafted to incorporate the NAFTA parties' understanding of the concepts. In the case of intellectual property rights, the model FTA has increasingly expanded the rights of intellectual property holders beyond those required by the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement and NAFTA.

As to the former, CAFTA-DR clarifies that the concept of \"fair and equitable treatment\" does not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by customary international law and includes the obligation to accord \"due process\" in adjudicatory proceedings. This language reflects U.S. experience with NAFTA's \"fair and equitable treatment\" provision, which was originally interpreted by a tribunal as requiring fair and equitable treatment in addition to the treatment required under international law. In terms of the expropriation provisions, CAFTA-DR establishes the presumption that a group of regulatory actions designed to protect \"legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment\" cannot be treated as compensable indirect expropriation. There is no such exception from NAFTA's expropriation provisions, and its inclusion in CAFTA-DR seems to reflect heightened concern for parties' regulatory sovereignty in the environmental and public health spheres.", "As under NAFTA, investors from, and in the territories of, CAFTA-DR parties may enforce the protections accorded them by Chapter 10 through investor-state arbitration.

Notably, CAFTA-DR provides a broader definition of an \"investment\" than NAFTA. Unlike NAFTA, which provides a positive list of property and interests that qualify as investment, Article 10.28 of CAFTA-DR states that \"investment means every asset than an investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment\" and provides an illustrative and non-exhaustive list of possible investments that meet this definition.

However, other countries quickly responded by closing off their markets, offsetting any new jobs resulting from the Tariff Act. In part because of this international response to the Tariff Act, Congress was persuaded that the U.S. needed international agreements that reduced tariffs. Accordingly, Congress passed the Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (\"1934 Trade Act,\" Pub.

In turn, the fast track procedures promote timely committee and floor action of the legislation at issue by entitling the legislation to receive, for example, an up-or-down vote in Congress without amendment and with limited debate.", "TPA was last granted by the Bipartisan Trade Promotion Act of 2002, which expired at the end of June 2007.

Over time, this countervailing duty law was amended and incorporated into Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930.", "U.S. antidumping law followed a similar path of development. In the early 20 th century, Congress became concerned with foreign companies selling their products in the U.S. at a price less than that which they charged in their home market.

The procedures for assessing and collecting antidumping (AD) duties are prescribed in Title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930. Any interested party may petition the Department of Commerce to investigate allegations of dumping, and these investigations may also be self-initiated by Commerce. The petitions must be filed \"by or on behalf of the industry.\" Like CVD investigations, AD investigations are jointly administered over the course of two rounds by the Department of Commerce and the ITC. ", "Like countervailable subsidy investigations, the first round of an antidumping investigation requires preliminary determinations by the ITA and the ITC. If the ITC determines that there is a reasonable indication of material injury, the ITA assesses whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold, or is likely to be sold, at less than its fair value. Predictably, the second round is the round in which the ITA and ITC make their final determinations on these same questions. ", "As under CVD law, if both the ITA and ITC make affirmative determinations on these questions, then the ITA issues an order instructing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits of the AD duties on the merchandise in question when it enters the United States. Antidumping duties are based on the \"weighted average dumping margin\" as determined by the ITA under 19 U.S.C. Section 1677f-1. In determining the size of a dumping margin for a particular product, the Department of Commerce has historically used a practice known as \"zeroing\" in its administrative reviews. Zeroing entails aggregating the dumping margins for all of the sub-products but assigning the value of zero to a sub-product's dumping margin when its export price exceeds its normal (home market) value. ", "The Department of Commerce's practice of using zeroing to calculate dumping margins generated complaints from other WTO Members. While the Court of International Trade found that Commerce's decision to use \"zeroing\" to calculate the dumping margin is a reasonable and permissible interpretation of the law, the WTO consistently ruled against the U.S. practice\u2014declaring it a violation of U.S. obligations under the WTO Antidumping Agreement. In February 2012, the United States announced that it had reached agreements with the European Union and Japan to end \"zeroing.\" Pursuant to those agreements, the U.S. Department of Commerce published a final rule in the Federal Register pursuant to which the Department will abandon zeroing in administrative review, new shipper review, and expedited antidumping reviews of AD orders except, perhaps, where it determines that zeroing would be appropriate. Under this new rule, the Department will calculate weighted-average margins of dumping and antidumping duty assessments in a manner that provides offsets for non-dumped comparisons. The Department also adopted a timetable for modifying its practice in five-year \"sunset\" reviews of AD orders so that it will no longer rely on weighted-average dumping margins that were calculated using methodology deemed WTO-inconsistent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Safeguards", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Section 201", "paragraphs": ["Sections 201 through 204 of the Trade Act of 1974 provide the authority and procedures for the President to take action, including import relief, to facilitate a domestic industry's adjustment to import competition.
