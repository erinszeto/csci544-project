Often, such \"miscellaneous\" provisions as food safety, marketing orders, animal health and welfare, and energy are added. This omnibus nature of the farm bill creates a broad coalition of support among sometimes conflicting interests for policies that, individually, might not survive the legislative process.", "The scope and direction of a new farm bill may be shaped by such factors as financial conditions in the agricultural economy, competition among various interests, international trade obligations, and\u2014possibly most important\u2014a tight limit on federal funds. Among the thorniest issues may be future farm income and commodity price support. Questions of equity (who should get aid and how much), program cost, conformance with WTO trade obligations, effects on U.S. competitiveness in the global marketplace, and the unintended impacts of agricultural activities on the environment are among the considerations.", "The economic prosperity of the U.S. farm sector is heavily dependent upon exports, so the provisions of a new bill reauthorizing farm export and foreign food aid programs also will be of keen interest. Moreover, the agricultural credit, research, conservation, domestic nutrition assistance, and rural development titles bring an array of interests into the debate, and their issues and concerns could prove equally contentious.", "Several farm groups have strongly endorsed a continuation of current policies and programs. However, agriculture and rural interests not receiving much benefit from current programs oppose a simple extension and would like some of the spending to be aimed at solving their problems.

However, many of these laws periodically are evaluated, revised, and renewed through an omnibus, multi-year farm bill. These policies can be, and sometimes are, modified or overhauled as freestanding authorizing legislation, or as part of other laws.

Without new legislation, notably in the area of farm commodity and income support programs, permanent statutes will take effect. Most of these statutes were enacted decades ago and are no longer compatible with current national economic objectives, global trading rules, and federal budgetary or regulatory policies. These largely outdated permanent laws have been kept on the books by Congress in part to compel increasingly urban and suburban future Congresses to pay attention to national agricultural policy.

Among the groups lobbying Congress will be farm and commodity organizations; input suppliers; commodity handlers, processors, exporters, retailers, foreign customers, and competitors; universities and scientific organizations; domestic consumers and food assistance advocates; environmentalists; and rural communities. So, for example, farm state lawmakers may seek urban legislators' backing for commodity price supports in exchange for votes on domestic food aid\u2014and vice versa.", "Farm bills and the programs they encompass are complex and intensely interactive. Changes to one program often have intended and more often unintended consequences for others. For example, a legislative change that raises corn prices is typically examined for how it might change the planting decisions of those who grow other crops such as soybeans, and, in turn, the cost of the support program for soybeans. Likewise, a change in the corn program can have major implications for producers who feed corn to dairy cows, beef cattle, and other animals; for sugar producers and food manufacturers who can use corn syrup in place of sugar for many products; for consumers, including those on limited food budgets; and for exporters and foreign competitors. The level and type of support provided also can affect farm equipment companies, agricultural investors and rural financial institutions, fertilizer and pesticide suppliers, and farm-dependent rural communities.", "Farm bill titles also are growing increasingly integrated. The conservation title, for example, includes provisions that affect commodity programs, and some of the commodity provisions likewise affect conservation. This integration means that one cannot simply look in a single title for all provisions that affect the topic of the title.

The 1996 farm bill was intended to guide agricultural support through 2002. But an unanticipated drop in commodity prices prompted Congress to begin the \"next\" farm bill debate in 1998, when it considered and passed the first of a series of ad hoc emergency assistance measures that pumped $20 billion in supplemental payments (called market loss payments) to farmers over three years (FY1999-FY2001), and ultimately led to the adoption of \"counter-cyclical payments\" in the 2002 farm bill.", "In July 2005, Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns began a series of \"Farm Bill Forums\" held throughout the country. The public was invited to provide comments on six specific questions:", "1. How should farm policy be designed to maximize U.S. competitiveness and our country's ability to effectively compete in global markets?", "2. How should farm policy address any unintended consequences and ensure that such consequences do not discourage new farmers and the next generation of farmers from entering production agriculture?", "3. How should farm policy be designed to effectively and fairly distribute assistance to\u00a0producers?", "4. How can farm policy best achieve conservation and environmental goals?", "5. How can federal rural and farm programs provide effective assistance in rural areas?", "6. How should agricultural product development, marketing, and research-related issues be addressed in the next farm bill?", "Following the forum series, Secretary Johanns has repeatedly stated the USDA's goal for a new farm bill is that it be \"equitable, predictable and beyond challenge\" in the WTO. Equitable relates to the distribution of benefits among farmers and commodities. Predictable relates to dependably providing assistance, particularly disaster assistance, which has been ad hoc over the past 20 years. Beyond challenge relates to full compliance with the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules agreed to by the United States and the entire 149-country membership of the organization.", "On January 23, 2006, then House Agriculture Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Minority Member Collin Peterson announced the beginning of a series of field hearings to review the 2002 farm bill with an eye to designing the next farm bill.", "With the 110 th Congress, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees face the challenge of enacting a 2007 farm bill before the year's end. The change in partisan control of the House and Senate has put Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa in charge of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees (see Appendix B ). The Democratic party leadership has talked about adopting a pay-go budget policy, requiring any areas of increased spending to be offset by reduced spending in other areas. Adding to the committees' budget challenges is the likelihood of a somewhat lower spending baseline as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the future cost of current commodity programs under the scenario of current and projected high commodity prices.", "Several interest groups have already taken public positions on farm bill topics, especially related to commodity provisions and conservation. Both the American Farm Bureau Federation and National Farmers Union have strongly endorsed a continuation into the future of current commodity support programs. In contrast, the National Corn Growers Association wants to replace some commodity support provisions and crop insurance with crop revenue insurance plans. The American Farmland Trust put itself in a high-profile position with a proposal, addressing risk protection and conservation, endorsed by three former Secretaries of Agriculture from both political parties. Additional proposals can be expected, and Congress faces the need to adjudicate among interest groups competing for parts of an increasingly tight spending package that could be less than under current law and will certainly be less than what the stakeholders in combination would like to receive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "General Policy Considerations4", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic Situation", "paragraphs": ["For the last four years, including the forecast for 2006, crop and livestock marketing receipts generally have been strong, and in cases where prices have declined, government payments have largely made up the difference. Examples include large milk and cotton payments in FY2004, and large corn and cotton payments in FY2005. The result has been record high levels of net farm income and record low levels of farm debt compared to assets. Contributing substantially to the strong domestic farm sector was a rapid rise in the value of agricultural exports, from $53 billion in FY2002 to a forecast $77 billion in FY2007, a record high.", "The trade outlook is important to farmers because exports account for about 25% of the value of agricultural production, and about one-third of harvested acreage is exported. Farm income also is affected by other factors, not least government subsidies. USDA forecast data show 2006 net cash farm income of $66.6 billion. Though cash receipts in 2006 from the sale of crops increase, livestock receipts decline, and all production expenses increase. This leaves total net cash farm income 18% lower in 2006 than in 2005. Included in 2006 net cash income is $16.5 billion in direct government payments. These payments help to undergird the value of agricultural land and other assets, keep farm debt at favorably low levels, and stabilize farm operator incomes. While USDA has not published a farm income forecast for 2007, it will be influenced by expected high prices for several of the major commodities.", "Changes in farm revenues have impacts on rural communities and businesses that depend on the\u00a0agricultural sector. Similarly, rural non-farm employment is important to the household income of many farms, particularly smaller farms. Food stamp program spending is largely related to general employment, and competes with agriculture programs in the allocation of funds available\u00a0to the Agriculture Committees for the farm bill. Hence, food stamps could be prominent in the next farm bill, especially if there is a threat to commodity program spending under a tight budget rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agriculture Budget", "paragraphs": ["As with all areas of the federal budget, agriculture faces spending constraints. In FY2006, budget\u00a0reconciliation trimmed $2.7 billion over five years (FY2006-FY2010) from USDA mandatory programs. For the 2007 farm bill, these constraints will begin to take shape with the\u00a0start of the annual congressional budget process, when the House and Senate Budget Committees\u00a0recommend spending levels for broad \"functional\" categories. Recent federal deficits\u00a0have raised concern over the ability or willingness of Congress to fund farm programs at levels being requested by stakeholders or even at levels approved in the last farm bill. Once the limits are approved by Congress via the annual budget resolution, program spending cannot be increased to levels that will breach these limits, unless either (1) they are offset by increased revenue or cuts in other programs, a tradeoff process known as \"pay-go\" (short for pay-as-you-go), or (2) Congress and the President declare the extra spending to be an \"emergency,\" thus precluding the need for offsets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Budget Categories", "paragraphs": ["The USDA carries out a wide array of responsibilities through about 30 separate internal agencies and offices staffed by some 100,000 employees.

Therefore, spending by USDA is not synonymous with spending for farmers, with the farm bill, or with agriculture appropriations bills. Most of the major programs that assist production agriculture, including commodity price and income supports, crop insurance, farm credit, marketing, and agricultural research, fall within function 350, the agriculture function of the federal budget. Some other functional areas of spending administered by USDA include food stamps (in function 600, income security); conservation programs (function 300, the natural resources and environment category); foreign food aid (function 150, the international affairs category); meat inspection (function 550, health); rural electric and communication loans (function 270, energy); rural community and business grants and loans (function 450, community and regional development); and rural housing loans (function 370, commerce and housing credit).

Congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility, benefit formulas, and other parameters rather than approving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year. Funding for mandatory programs is determined indirectly in the Agriculture Committees when they write, directly into the authorizing laws, the eligibility standards and benefits for these programs. Any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law.", "Examples of mandatory spending are the major farm commodity price support programs and the food stamp program. The Appropriations Committees generally are expected to provide the necessary year-to-year funding in the annual USDA appropriation to maintain these programs. However, for certain mandatory programs in the 2002 farm bill, such as conservation, rural development, and research, appropriators have limited authorized mandatory outlays. The savings achieved by limiting mandatory programs has been used to boost discretionary programs. In FY2006, about $1.5 billion in mandatory programs was prohibited from being spent.", "While discretionary programs also are designed and authorized in the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, their annual funding levels are determined by the agriculture subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees as part of the annual agriculture appropriations bill. Examples of discretionary spending are agricultural research and extension, agricultural credit, animal and plant health protection, farm marketing services, and most rural development programs. (Of course, both mandatory and discretionary program authorizations and spending still ultimately must be approved by the full House and Senate after they are reported by the relevant committees.)", "Before either the Agriculture Committees or the Appropriations Committees make these decisions by drafting the appropriate measure\u2014whether it is a new farm bill, an annual USDA appropriation, or some other measure\u2014the panels must know how much spending room they have been allocated under the congressional budget resolution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Baseline", "paragraphs": ["The opening stages of debate over a new farm bill usually occur in the House and Senate Budget Committees. The debate focuses on whether the multi-year \"baseline\" projection (which assumes the current farm bill continues under expected economic conditions) is appropriate or whether more (or, possibly, less) spending should be \"built into the baseline.\"", "Each year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issues a baseline budget for all federal spending under current law over a 10-year period. Projected spending in the baseline budget represents CBO's estimate at a particular point in time of what federal spending and revenues would likely be under current law if no policy changes were made over the projected period.", "The CBO baseline serves as a benchmark or starting point for future budget analyses. Whenever any new legislation is introduced that affects federal mandatory spending, such as a farm bill, its impact is measured by CBO as a difference from the baseline.", "For farm commodity and income support and related programs, CBO estimated in August 2006 that, under current law, total spending would average about $12 billion annually over the FY2006 through FY2016 period. Due to rapid increases in the futures market price of corn and other commodities since the summer of 2006, the baseline of government spending for the commodity programs is decreasing. The CBO baseline published in early 2007, in conjunction with the FY2008 budget resolution, largely will determine the size of the pie to be divided among commodities and competing interest groups.

Although the United States is party to a number of trade agreements, it is primarily the agricultural agreement in the World Trade Organization (WTO), with rules governing the use of agricultural subsidies, both domestic and export, that constrains domestic policy choices. Membership in the WTO opens the United States to three avenues of influence that could change the direction of future domestic agricultural policy: (1) existing trade commitments, (2) trade disputes, and (3) trade negotiations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Existing Trade Commitments", "paragraphs": ["Under the most recently completed round of WTO trade negotiations\u2014the 1995 Uruguay Round\u2014the United States agreed to abide by a set of disciplines that govern not only export subsidies and import tariffs and quotas for agricultural products, but also domestic farm program design and spending.", "Under the WTO, domestic farm support programs are categorized into boxes (amber, blue, or green) according to their relative likelihood to distort trade. Amber box policies (the most trade-distorting) are subject to total annual spending limits. The United States, like virtually all other countries, has been reporting that its amber box spending has been below its allowable annual level of $19.1 billion. Farm bill programs that generally are included in the amber box include dairy and sugar price supports, crop marketing loans, loan deficiency payments, and other direct payments linked to per-unit levels of production; counter-cyclical payments; storage payments; and crop insurance and loan interest subsidies, among others. In contrast, blue box policies are narrowly defined to include only a specific subset of production-limiting programs that have no spending limit. (The United States has not used the blue box exemption since 1995.) Finally, green box policies\u2014i.e., the least trade-distorting policies\u2014are exempt from spending limits. Green box programs include conservation and environmental activities, such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) or the Conservation Security Program (CSP); farm disaster relief payments; domestic food aid such as food stamps; and income supports not linked to current production or prices, such as the direct payments enacted in the 2002 farm bill. A final WTO agricultural subsidy category that is exempt from spending limits under certain conditions is known as de minimis exempted outlays. De minimis exemptions encompass domestic support outlays that do not exceed 5% of the value of production, calculated both on a product-specific and non-product-specific basis. Countries report to the WTO on their domestic farm spending by category for each year.", "The WTO's system of policy categorization has provided latitude to U.S. policymakers in developing domestic support measures that can provide significant aid to producers but at the same time comply with WTO obligations. For example, on average during 1999-2001, the United States provided $50 billion in green box payments and $16 billion in amber box or restricted spending. During that period, U.S. amber box spending was about 85% of its permitted WTO ceiling. A narrowing gap between the ceiling and spending could limit U.S. flexibility in choosing ways to support farmers as a new farm bill is considered. Furthermore, because U.S. amber box payments are geared to price variations (when prices decline, amber box outlays rise), the United States risks exceeding its $19.1 billion amber box ceiling. These factors could encourage a policy shift to green box programs, such as conservation, rural development, and/or resource retirement payments, or to payments to producers that are not linked to current production or prices. Conversely, when commodity prices are high, as they are currently, amber box outlays decline. Even in situations like this, some farm groups advocate a shift to green box programs to make up for forgone subsidy payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade Litigation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to trade negotiations, litigation of disputes in the WTO Dispute Settlement Body\u00a0(DSB) can be a means of achieving trade policy objectives.

As a result, USDA announced that it would make a number of administrative changes in its export credit guarantee programs to comply with the WTO ruling, including removal of a 1% cap on fees charged under the GSM-102 (short term) export credit guarantee program and termination of the GSM-103 (intermediate term) guarantee program. In addition, Congress repealed the Step 2 cotton program (Deficit Reduction Act of 2005; P.L. 109-171 ). The Step 2 program subsidized U.S. cotton users and exporters so that U.S. rather than foreign cotton would be utilized, even when U.S. cotton was higher-priced.", "Brazil's success in challenging U.S. farm subsidies in WTO litigation could encourage other countries to attempt similar challenges. Uruguay, for example, has indicated that it might challenge the U.S. rice program in WTO dispute settlement.

Negotiations have been aimed at further expanding market access for agricultural products, making further reductions in trade-distorting domestic farm subsidies, and ending all forms of export subsidies. If completed, a WTO trade agreement could produce new agricultural trade rules that might further tighten U.S. commitments to alter farm programs or limit spending. The U.S. negotiating position in the Doha Round has been that\u00a0further limits on domestic support or reduced export subsidies depend on a substantial expansion of market access for U.S. agricultural products around the world, including in developing countries.", "Doha Round negotiations, launched in 2001 and plagued by delays and missed deadlines, were suspended indefinitely in July 2006. The principal cause of the suspension was that a core group of WTO member countries\u2014the United States, the European Union (EU), Brazil, India, Australia, and Japan\u2014known as the G-6 had reached an impasse over specific methods to achieve the broad aims of the round for agricultural trade: substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic subsidies, elimination of export subsidies, and substantially increased market access for agricultural products. The United States maintained that it had made an ambitious offer of reductions in trade distorting domestic support that had not been matched by agricultural tariff reductions by the EU, or by market opening for agricultural and industrial products by Brazil and India (both large developing countries). The EU and Brazil argued that the U.S. offer on domestic support did not go far enough in reducing trade-distorting support and would in fact leave the United States in a position to spend more on such subsidies than under the current WTO (Uruguay Round) Agreement on Agriculture.", "Doha Round negotiators have been operating under a deadline effectively imposed by the expiration of U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which permits the President to negotiate trade deals and present them to Congress for an up or down vote without amendment. TPA legislation expires on June 30, 2007, and most trade experts think that Congress will not renew the authority. Some, however, think that Congress might extend TPA temporarily if a Doha Round\u00a0agreement seems imminent, as was the case in 1994 for the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Agreements.", "A number of agreements, which would have entailed substantial change in some U.S. farm bill programs, had already been reached in the Doha Round agricultural negotiations, but they are contingent on reaching a comprehensive agreement and now will be put on hold. Those include an agreement to eliminate all agricultural export subsidies by the end of 2013; an agreement to eliminate food aid that displaces commercial sales and to operate export credit guarantee programs in a manner that covers their costs; and an agreement to classify the United States' counter-cyclical payments as blue box (and thus not subject to reduction commitments). An agreement to provide early and ambitious subsidy reductions for cotton also is dependent on a comprehensive Doha Round agreement.", "Proponents of changes in U.S. domestic farm policy were looking to a Doha Round agreement to make the most trade-distorting provisions of the subsidies more compatible with a new set of world trade rules. As a result of the suspension of the negotiations, however, a major source of pressure for U.S. farm policy change has dissipated. The option of extending the current farm law, proposed by some, appears strengthened by the indefinite suspension of the Doha talks. Legislation ( H.R. 4332 , H.R. 4775 , and S. 2696 ) was introduced in the 109 th Congress to extend the 2002 farm bill by one year, but committee leadership seems intent on a new long-term authorization."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Farm Income and Commodity Price Support13", "paragraphs": ["The economic argument for federal support of farms, in contrast to nonfarm businesses, is that markets do not efficiently balance commodity supply with demand. Imbalances in agricultural markets develop because consumers do not respond to price changes by buying proportionally smaller or larger quantities (demand is price-inelastic) and, similarly, farmers do not respond to price changes by proportionally reducing or increasing production (supply is price inelastic). The imbalances then often result in inadequate or exaggerated resource adjustments by farmers. The imbalances are further exacerbated by the long time lag between crop planting (or livestock breeding) and harvest, during which economic and yield conditions may dramatically change.", "The objectives of federal commodity programs are to stabilize and support farm incomes by shifting some of the risks of short term market price instability and longer-term capacity adjustments to the federal government. The goals are to maintain the economic health of the farm sector so that it can utilize the nation's comparative advantages in natural, infrastructure, and technology resources to be globally competitive.", "The law mandates federal support for a specific list of commodities. For most of these commodities, support began during 1930s Depression era efforts to generally raise farm household income when commodity prices were low because of prolonged weak consumer demand. While initially intended to be a temporary effort, the commodity support programs survived, but have been modified away from supply control and commodity stocks management to direct income support payments.", "Critics of commodity programs agree on the underlying fundamental economic conditions that make stability more difficult to achieve for agriculture than for some other sectors. However, they argue that (1) current programs are highly distorting of world production and trade, (2) the levels of subsidies are high and have become capitalized into land prices and rents that raise the cost of production and make the United States less competitive in global markets, and (3) the benefits are concentrated among a comparatively small number of commodities produced on a small number of large farms.", "Supporters of commodity subsidy programs may not contradict the critics, but do point out that other nations have distorting subsidy programs and/or trade barriers that should be eliminated if the United States is to make reforms. Landowners are concerned about a loss of rents and wealth if land prices drop in response to a reduction in the subsidies. Similarly, rural communities are concerned about any large decline in the real estate tax base that supports local schools, roads, and other community services. While large farms do receive most of the production-linked subsidy payments, recipients argue that lower input costs and marketing efficiencies make large farms efficient and small farms uneconomic in the production of bulk commodities.

Sugar support was modified to include domestic production controls, in addition to import quotas,\u00a0as a price-boosting mechanism. For milk, the farm bill added direct income support payments to the already existing practice of purchasing and disposing of surplus stocks through nonmarket channels.", "Commodity support programs are financed through the USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). Table 1 shows spending by commodity and year. The cost of commodity support programs over the six-year life of the 2002 farm bill is expected to total about $78.8 billion, or about $13.1 billion annually. Eighty-two percent of spending is for five crops (corn, 34%; cotton, 23%; wheat, 9%; soybeans, 10%; rice, 6%).", "Two developments have occurred since enactment of the 2002 farm bill that could substantially reshape domestic support policy. These include (1) the movement from a federal budget surplus to record annual deficits and the expectation of continuing large deficits for the foreseeable future, and (2) the WTO dispute settlement ruling against the United States in a case brought by Brazil concerning U.S. cotton subsidies.", "The federal deficit situation likely will constrain farm bill legislation more than was the case for the 2002 farm bill. Furthermore, even if current law is extended intact, a forecast for high commodity prices likely will result in a CBO budget baseline for commodity support that is lower than spending levels reached over the past five years. In addition, some Democratic leaders have stated an intention to follow a pay-as-you-go policy with regard to new legislation.", "The WTO ruled on March 3, 2005, that certain aspects of U.S. cotton support\u2014Step 2 marketing provisions and export credit guarantees\u2014functioned as illegal subsidies and must be removed. As a result of these developments, a key question likely to be asked of virtually every new U.S. farm policy proposal is how it will affect U.S. trade commitments to the WTO. In addition to the existing commitments, the Doha Round negotiations, before they collapsed in July 2006, anticipated that the domestic amber box spending ceiling would be subject to a new 20% initial cut from its current $19.1 billion level with further cuts to follow.

Also, dairy farms benefit from direct payments when\u00a0market prices fall below a mandated target price under the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program; from established minimum farm prices for fluid-grade milk under federal milk\u00a0marketing orders; and from dairy export subsidies through the Dairy Export Incentives Program (DEIP).", "At issue for Congress is whether to continue programs that potentially raise market prices, which critics contend are the most market-distorting because they encourage excess production.

However, no change was made to the support price for milk. Consequently, after its first two years of operation, the MILC program paid out over $2 billion, and CCC dairy acquisitions cost $600-$700 million in FY2002 and FY2003.

Peanut producers now receive the benefit of direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and marketing assistance loans and loan deficiency payments. Tobacco marketing quotas on some 57,000 farms were terminated after the 2004 crop, and $9.6 billion will be paid out over 10 years as buyout compensation (the equivalent of a lump sum payment of $102,000 per farm using a 5% discount rate).

For example, generally poor weather, such as a widespread drought, may drive crop prices up and marketing loan and counter-cyclical payments down. At the same time, yield losses may not be sufficiently catastrophic to trigger crop insurance indemnity payments or to prompt congressional adoption of disaster payments. Similarly, there are years when low prices are offset by high yields so that farm income is adequate to cover expenses, yet on top of that there are substantial price-linked support payments to further boost income.", "For about the last decade, several federally subsidized revenue insurance products have been offered to producers as part of the federal crop insurance program.

Policies covering both subsidized and unsubsidized crops more comprehensively\u2014such as providing more assistance through trade promotion, conservation, credit, marketing programs, domestic food assistance, and research\u2014could provide a way to address those pressures while increasing U.S. competitiveness, they argue."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Design and Operation", "paragraphs": ["Although USDA traditionally has not subsidized specialty crops as it has bulk commodities, over the decades Congress has authorized a wide range of programs that facilitate the growth and benefit the economic health of the specialty crop sector, as well as other sectors of U.S. agriculture. Among the programs of particular importance to specialty crops are:", "Marketing orders and agreements \u2014Marketing orders and agreements are sets of rules intended to enhance the marketing of a commodity. The rules apply to the handlers within a defined geographic region and may (1) establish quality standards for the commodity; (2) standardize packages and containers; (3) regulate the flow of product to market; (4) establish reserve pools for storable commodities; and (5) authorize production research, marketing research and development, and advertising. Currently there are 30 active marketing orders and agreements covering specified fruit, vegetable, and tree nut crops. The activities are financed by assessment fees (commonly called \"check-off\" fees) collected from handlers, usually at the time of sale. The Agriculture Marketing Service (AMS) oversees the programs to make sure the orders and agreements operate in the public interest and within legal bounds authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (as amended). (Separately, USDA offers user fee grading and quality certification services, organic standards and certification, and market economic information and analysis that also are important to the specialty crop sector.) Qualified Through Verification program \u2014The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to regulate the fresh and processed produce industries to ensure that products are safe and accurately labeled. However, since 1996, AMS has offered a voluntary, fee-for-service pilot program to assist produce packers in adopting science-based, preventive measures against food contamination in their plants. The Qualified Through Verification program is similar in approach to the preventive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system used since 1996 by USDA's meat and poultry regulatory agency, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The FDA has been encouraging the fresh and processed produce industries to adopt this preventive approach throughout the marketing chain. Block grants to states \u2014The 108 th Congress passed legislation that is widely regarded as a precursor to discussion of specialty crop issues in the 2007 farm bill. The Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-465 ) authorizes an annual appropriation of $44.5 million in fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for block grants to states for them to award to research and marketing projects that promote the advancement of each state's specialty crops. From the annual appropriation for this program, each state receives $100,000 and the balance is distributed based on the ratio of the value of each state's specialty crop production to the total value of U.S. specialty crop production. In the majority of cases, the state Department of Agriculture administers the program and uses the funds to support marketing, education, research, pest and disease management, production, and food safety projects. Export promotion \u2014The USDA administers several export promotion programs that cover all commodities, but some are particularly import to specialty crops. The Market Access Program (MAP) shares the costs of marketing and promoting U.S. agricultural products overseas. The Quality Samples Program (QSP) helps create export sales of commodities, including fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts, by providing samples to foreign importers, thus paving the way for new partnerships between importers and U.S. exporters. The Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops (TASC) program funds competitive grants to eligible public and private organizations (i.e., federal and state agencies, trade associations, universities, cooperatives, and private companies) to conduct projects that address trade barriers (projects have included seminars, study tours, field surveys, and pre-export clearance programs, among other activities). Crop loss assistance \u2014As with the major field crops, specialty crop producers receive benefits from several programs that compensate for yield losses if they are substantial. Federally subsidized crop insurance (administered by the Risk Management Agency but sold and serviced by private companies) is available for some 50 specialty crops in limited locations. When insurance is not offered, producers of some commercial specialty crops may be eligible for indemnification under USDA's Noninsured Assistance Program (NAP) for the cost of an administrative fee. In addition, for almost every year since 1988 Congress has authorized ad hoc disaster assistance that has covered losses of specialty crops as well as the major field crops. Disease and pest protection \u2014Although the Department of Homeland Security conducts agricultural inspections of passengers and cargo at U.S. ports of entry, USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the primary agency charged with protecting U.S. agriculture from the introduction, establishment, and reemergence of plant pests and diseases that could harm production or damage export markets. Of particular importance to specialty crop producers are APHIS emergency control and eradication programs\u2014supported wholly or in part with mandatory funds\u2014for pests and diseases that appear suddenly and threaten significant economic damage. Managing trade-related pest and disease issues \u2014APHIS officials are heavily\u00a0involved in decisions related to U.S. exports and imports of fruits and vegetables. APHIS attach\u00e9s work abroad with host country officials to establish and oversee foreign-based inspection programs to ensure that products designated for export are pest-free and that inspectors at U.S. ports of entry are aware of emerging problems. APHIS officials also participate on USDA trade agreement negotiation teams to solve sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues so that the agreements can move forward. In addition, APHIS is in charge of certifying that U.S. specialty crop exports meet other countries' phytosanitary regulations before they are shipped. APHIS's import and export activities are based on scientific risk assessments. Fruit and vegetable purchases through child nutrition programs \u2014Federal cash assistance to schools, child care centers, and summer food program operators (among others) represents an important source of federal support for fruit and vegetable purchases. Providers use this aid to buy food items for use in the meals they serve. USDA estimates that fruit and vegetable purchases account for about 20% of the total. A separate program exists to give a limited number of schools funding to provide free fresh fruit and vegetables to students (the Department of Defense (DoD) Fresh program). This program has used supply chains for military bases to make smaller-sized deliveries of locally produced fresh fruit and vegetables to schools. Research \u2014The large number of specialty crops and the dispersed nature of production throughout the nation discourage private sector research. This makes federally sponsored research critical to the future productivity of the industry. Publicly funded research to gain minor use pesticide approvals is a case in point. The 2004 Specialty Crops Competitiveness Act added specialty crop research to USDA's list of high priority research and extension activities, and established a permanent specialty crops subcommittee under an existing board to study the research needs of the sector and make recommendations. The Agriculture Research Service (ARS) is USDA's own research agency. The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) administers funds to the stateside components of the agricultural research network, which include the land grant colleges of agriculture, the state agricultural experiment stations, and the state cooperative extension services (providing research-based information and outreach). Annual CSREES block grants comprise only a small portion of their total funding (state, local, and private funds constitute the majority), but they are important to sustaining the core, ongoing research and extension programs at the state level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prospective Issues and Options", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the program of block grants to states to support projects to increase the competitiveness of each state's specialty crops, P.L. 108-465 also contains provisions intended to facilitate exports, protect U.S. specialty crops from invasive pests and diseases, and increase agricultural research of importance to fruit and vegetable crop production.

Supporters of the title cited statistics about the growing proportion of cattle and hogs being slaughtered and processed by the top four firms (which they believe limit their opportunities for selling animals), and expressed concerns about increased livestock and meat imports.

Moreover, proponents argue that U.S. consumers have a right to know the origin of their food, particularly at a time when U.S. food imports are increasing, and whenever particular health and safety problems arise. They cite as one prominent example concerns about the safety of some foreign beef arising from the discoveries of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease) in a number of Canadian-born cows (and two U.S. cows) since 2003. Supporters of the COOL law argue that it is unfair to exempt meats and produce from the longstanding country labeling already required of almost all other imported consumer products, from automobiles to most other foods.

Opponents argue that all food imports already must meet equivalent U.S. safety standards, which are enforced by U.S. officials at the border and overseas; scientific principles, not geography, must be the arbiter of safety. Industry implementation and recordkeeping costs, estimated by USDA to be as high as $3.9 billion in the first year and $458 million per year after that, would far outweigh any economic benefits, critics add.

In addition to the increased livestock production costs associated with corn feeding, protein-meal markets are likely to experience further distortions associated with expanded production of the main ethanol by-product\u2014distillers dried grains (DDG)\u2014which can be used as a relatively high (30%) protein meal. Dairy and other cattle are better able to increase DDG in rations than are poultry and pork.

Poultry and pork operations, on the other hand, are likely to see their feed costs increase with rising corn prices because of their limited ability to switch to the less expensive DDG. Expanding the national ethanol use mandate based on midwestern ethanol production implies increased pressure on the nation's transportation infrastructure to assist in delivering ethanol to non-producing regions, or to assist in delivering corn to ethanol plants in corn-deficit regions.

Technology-based development could require different kinds of public support than many rural businesses have traditionally needed. Improving Workplace Skills. Worker training is too often independent of economic development initiatives.

Emergency commodity shipments from the United States for emergencies can take three to five months to arrive and often are no longer needed when they do arrive. Also, transportation costs currently account for about half the money appropriated to finance P.L. 480 commodity donations for humanitarian response to emergencies.

Major programs and issue areas are outlined below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Food Stamps74", "paragraphs": ["The Food Stamp program is the largest of all the nutrition assistance programs and accounts for 95% of the spending in the nutrition title of the farm bill. It is the foundation for the federal effort to give low-income households the chance to obtain at least a minimally adequate diet, and is a major factor in overall federal policy of support for the poor.", "The purpose (and structure) of the program has evolved over time. It is meant to play a role in three areas of federal public policy:", "First, food stamps originated as a way of providing an outlet for surplus agricultural production, with the notable side benefit of supporting poor families. However, its goals and role in the country's support system for the low-income population have shifted and expanded greatly. It continues to pay for significant new food purchasing power, thereby helping the agriculture sector. Second, it now also is seen as the government's primary response to important concerns about the overall \"food security\" status of the low-income population, although only an estimated 60% of eligible individuals choose to participate by the most recent count (2004). A 2006 USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) study reports that, in 2005, 11% of U.S. households were \"food insecure,\" and that the prevalence of \"very low food security\" (previously denominated as \"food insecure with hunger\") was 3.9%. Third, the Food Stamp program has become an integral part of the overall \"safety net\" for the needy. It now ranks as the fourth largest needs-tested program and is the only nationally standard program aiding low-income households. According to ERS, when its benefits are added to other income, food stamps are estimated to move almost 10% of recipients out of poverty, and, for a typical low-income recipient family with children, food stamps can provide some 25% of their purchasing power."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Design and Operation", "paragraphs": ["The regular Food Stamp program provides inflation-indexed monthly benefits to low-income households that supplement their own spending on food; benefits vary by income, household expenses (like shelter costs), and household size, but generally not by state or region. They are delivered through electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards that are used like debit cards. Eligibility for food stamps is primarily based on a household's financial status. Monthly gross income must be below 130% of the inflation-indexed federal poverty income guideline for the household's size (e.g., $1,800 for a three-person household), and liquid assets must be under $2,000 ($3,000 for those households with elderly/disabled members). However, some households can be \"categorically eligible\" if they participate in another income-tested program like cash welfare. And certain categories are barred irrespective of their financial need (e.g., many noncitizens, able-bodied adults without dependents not meeting a work test).", "Program costs are shared with the states, which administer the program under generally uniform federal rules. The federal government pays the full cost of benefits and about half the cost of administration, operating work/training programs for recipients, and outreach and nutrition education efforts. States pay the remainder.", "The level of food stamp spending varies with participation, which is closely linked to economic conditions and eligibility rules, and benefit levels, which are indexed to food costs and also reflect recipients' income and non-food expenses. Since the 2002 farm bill, participation has increased substantially, from some 19 million persons per month in FY2002 to 26.1 million (August 2006), and the average monthly benefit level has jumped from $80 a person in FY2002 to $94 in August 2005. Costs have grown from $20.6 billion in FY2002 to more than $33 billion estimated for FY2006.", "Finally, the Food Stamp program has a \"quality control\" system that measures the degree to which eligibility and benefit decisions are erroneously made. The most recent national quality control statistics (for 2005) show historically low error rates (e.g., 4.5% of benefits over-issued). States with persistently high error rates can be assessed financial sanctions; those with very low rates can receive bonus payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prospective Issues and Options", "paragraphs": ["The 2002 farm bill greatly expanded eligibility for noncitizens, raised benefits modestly for larger households (by counting less of their income), and allowed states to provide \"transitional\" food stamps for families leaving the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. In addition, the 2002 bill set up a number of state options to ease access to the program and administrative burdens on applicants/recipients and program operators and revamped the quality control system to reduce the number of states subject to financial sanctions and grant bonus payments to states demonstrating exemplary administrative performance. Virtually no program cuts were made.", "A preliminary list of major potential issue areas that have emerged at this time includes the\u00a0following.", "Eligibility . Proposals to both loosen and tighten current rules governing the eligibility of noncitizens are likely. The House version of the bill implementing spending reductions to comply with the FY2006 budget reconciliation measure would have further limited eligibility for noncitizens. Moreover, any changes made in immigration law may call for revision of food stamp eligibility rules. Currently, states may make households participating in states' Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs categorically eligible (automatically eligible) for food stamps. The Administration contends that states have taken advantage of this rule to make those with financial resources well above normal food stamp standards eligible, simply by providing some minimal TANF-linked services. Various limits on categorical eligibility have been advanced. Opponents of the current restrictions on participation by able-bodied adults without children (ABAWDs), which bar eligibility after three months unless the individual meets a work-related test, contend that they should either be abolished as too punitive (and administratively complex) or eased. These restrictions were put in place in the 1996 welfare reform law. Assets . Current policy excludes most, but not all, retirement savings from consideration as assets when testing for food stamp eligibility. The Administration and others have supported disregarding all retirement savings to avoid penalizing those who have saved for retirement, but are temporarily in need. The Food Stamp program's dollar asset limits have not been significantly changed in over 25 years. A number of critics argue that they should be raised, or abolished, to encourage saving and simplify administration. Use of Benefits . Food stamp benefits can be used for virtually any food purchase; they cannot be used for alcohol, tobacco, hot prepared food, or dietary supplements. Food choice has been a recurring theme in food stamp policy debates. Critics argue that nutrition-related limits should be placed on the types of food that can be bought with food stamps or that incentives be provided to purchase nutritional food items. In addition, another group of critics has proposed an expansion to allow food stamps to be used for dietary supplements, as in the Senate version of the 2002 farm bill. Benefit Levels . Food stamp benefits are increased for those with high shelter costs in relation to their income, but there are significant limits to this rule. As in earlier farm bill debates, program advocates would like to see these limits removed. Again, as in earlier farm bills, there are long-standing calls to increase or index the minimum benefit; it has not been changed since the 1970s and is seen as so low that it discourages participation. Arguing that the value of food stamp benefits has been eroded, some advocates would ask that either the maximum benefit be raised or that the standard amount of income disregarded for\u00a0all households be increased\u2014effectively providing an across-the-board benefit increase. Administration . A number of states have taken, or are taking, major steps to revamp the way they administer food stamps, Medicaid, and the TANF program. While food stamp law requires that final eligibility/benefit decisions be made by government employees, these initiatives can involve privatizing (contracting out) many back-office administrative tasks and modernizing/streamlining administration through efforts like performing program intake by computer application\u2014in both cases resulting in cost savings from fewer staff and offices and, it is hoped, better client service. There are no federal standards for these types of initiatives (e.g., with respect to client service/access, pilot testing), and many of those watching the current initiatives argue that some minimum standards should be set legislatively. As the result of experiences related to Hurricane Katrina, some have proposed allowing or requiring the federal government to increase its share of food stamp administrative costs (above the normal 50%) in the case of major disasters. Program Access . Although the participation rate among food stamp eligibles has increased noticeably since 2002 (when a number of changes were put in place to encourage this), it still is only 60%, and program advocates argue that further steps need to be taken. Procedural rules governing how applicants and recipients are treated, as well as rules relating to eligibility for applicants participating in other public assistance programs, could be changed to ease access to food stamp benefits for eligible households."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP)76", "paragraphs": ["TEFAP was begun in 1981-1982 as a temporary expedient designed, at least initially, to dispose of huge stocks of government-held food commodities and to address legislatively mandated reductions in food assistance programs, an economic recession, and concern over \"hunger\" and homelessness among the needy.
