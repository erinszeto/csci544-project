The requirements are detailed, especially when the regulatory interpretations are considered. The major principles include the following requirements:", "States and school districts make available a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all children with disabilities, generally between the ages of 3 and 21. States and school districts identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, regardless of the severity of their disability, to determine which children are eligible for special education and related services. Each child receiving services has an individual education program (IEP) spelling out the specific special education and related services to be provided to meet his or her needs. The parent must be a partner in planning and overseeing the child's special education and related services as a member of the IEP team. \"To the maximum extent appropriate,\" children with disabilities must be educated with children who are not disabled; and states and school districts provide procedural safeguards to children with disabilities and their parents, including a right to a due process hearing, the right to appeal to federal district court, and, in some cases, the right to receive attorneys' fees.", "IDEA was originally enacted in 1975 in response to judicial decisions holding that when states provide an education for children without disabilities, they must also provide an education for children with disabilities. IDEA has been the subject of numerous reauthorizations; the most recent reauthorization was P.L. 108-446 in 2004. P.L. 108-446 included specific authorizations for appropriations through 2011. Congress is currently beginning the process of identifying potential issues for the next reauthorization. This report examines the Supreme Court decisions, and selected lower court decisions since July 1, 2005, the effective date of P.L. 108-446 . "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Definition of Disability", "paragraphs": ["A key component of IDEA is the definition of a child with a disability. Unlike the definitions of disability in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the IDEA definition is categorical, not functional, and contains a requirement that the child needs special education and related services. The IDEA definition states the following:", "CHILD WITH A DISABILITY.\u2014''(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The term 'child with a disability' means a child\u2014''(i) with mental retardation, hearing impairments (including deafness), speech or language impairments, visual impairments (including blindness), serious emotional disturbance (referred to in this title as 'emotional disturbance'), orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or specific learning disabilities; and ''(ii) who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.", "In Hansen v. Republic R-III School District , the court examined whether a child who had been diagnosed with conduct disorder, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was a child with a disability under IDEA. Finding that the child met the IDEA definitional categories of serious emotional disturbance and other health impairments, the court noted that the child was not \"merely socially maladjusted\" but struggled to pass his classes and standardized tests. Similarly, the child was found to have a diagnosis of ADHD and his educational performance was affected by the condition. ", "The need for special education and related services was key in other court decisions. Several courts of appeal decisions have examined whether a child who falls within one of the categories of disabilities but whose disability may have a minimal effect on education is a child with a disability and thus covered by IDEA. In L.I. v. Maine School Administrative District No. 55 , the First Circuit Court of Appeals found that a child with Asperger's Syndrome and an adjustment disorder with depressed mood was a child with a disability under IDEA even though she had high grades, generally non-disruptive behavior, and \"undisputed intellectual ability.\" The court rejected the argument that IDEA is limited to children whose disabilities \"significantly impact educational performance,\" noting that neither the statute nor its regulations contain this limiting language. Similarly, in Board of Education of Montgomery County v. S.G. the school argued that a child with schizophrenia was not a child with a disability because the disability did not adversely affect her school performance. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument after finding that the child had missed a substantial amount of school due to hospitalizations, failed to complete many of her assignments, and, if returned to the public school environment, would most likely be hearing voices again. ", "On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District held that a child with ADHD, depression, reactive attachment disorder, and post traumatic stress disorder who exhibited violent tendencies was not eligible for IDEA services since her inappropriate behavior did not adversely affect her educational performance. The fact that the child received a Section 504 plan and behavioral supports did not make her eligible under IDEA. In Alvin Independent School District v. AD , the Fifth Circuit also found no adverse educational effect from the child's ADHD. Mr. and Mrs. N.C. v. Bedford Central School District examined whether a child with dysthymic disorder met the requirements of the IDEA regulations for seriously emotionally disturbed and found that the child's behavior fell short of the requirements for seriously emotionally disturbed. The Second Circuit also noted that even if the child qualified as seriously emotionally disturbed, there was insufficient evidence that his educational performance was adversely affected.

Among these is the requirement that all children with disabilities and who are in need of special education, are identified, located, and evaluated. This requirement is referred to as child find. Although this requirement has not been heavily litigated, the ninth circuit held in Compton Unified School District v. Addison that a school district who failed to evaluate a ninth grader who failed all her classes, colored with crayons and played with dolls in class failed to meet IDEA's child find requirement and that such a failure could be the subject of a due process complaint. Although the Supreme Court has not yet made a determination regarding whether the case will be heard, the Court did ask the Department of Justice for its views on the issue. The issue as presented to the Court is whether the parent of a child with a disability has a right to a due process hearing alleging negligence because of school officials' failure to arrange an educational program for the child, or if due process suits are only allowed when the school district makes an intentional decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Provision", "paragraphs": ["The core requirement of IDEA is that a state must provide children with disabilities a free appropriate public education in order to receive federal funding under the act. FAPE is defined in the statute as meaning \"special education and related services that\u2014(A) have been provided at public expense, under public supervision and direction, and without charge; (B) meet the standards of the State educational agency; (C) include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education in the State involved; and (D) are provided in conformity with the individualized education program required under section 614(d).\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supreme Court Decision in Rowley", "paragraphs": ["A seminal decision on the requirements of FAPE , Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley , decided in 1982, was the first IDEA case to reach the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court noted that there was no substantive language in IDEA regarding the level of education to be accorded to children with disabilities and observed that \"(i)mplicit in the congressional purpose of providing access to a 'free appropriate public education' is the requirement that the education to which access is provided be sufficient to confer some educational benefit upon the handicapped child.\" The Court concluded that \"the 'basic floor of opportunity' provided by the Act consists of access to specialized instruction and related services which are individually designed to provide educational benefit to the handicapped child.\" The Court held that the requirement of FAPE is met when a child is provided with personalized instruction with sufficient support services to benefit educationally from that instruction. This instruction must be provided at public expense, meet the state's educational standards, must approximate the grade levels used in the state's regular education, and must comport with the child's IEP. The Court found that when a child with a disability is mainstreamed, \"the system itself monitors the educational progress of the child.... The grading and advancement system thus constitutes an important factor in determining educational benefit.\" Therefore, the IEP \"should be formulated in accordance with the requirements of the Act and, if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system, should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\" However, the states are not required to \"maximize\" each child's potential. If the child is progressing from grade to grade and making measurable and adequate gains, the FAPE requirement is met.", "The Supreme Court also stated that in ensuring that the requirements of the statute have been met, courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the states. The primary responsibility for formulating the education provided was left by IDEA to state and local educational agencies. As the Court noted, determining when children with disabilities are \"receiving sufficient educational benefits to satisfy the requirements of the Act presents a more difficult problem\" than complying with requirements for access to education. Because of the wide spectrum of disabilities, the Court did not attempt to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits and confined its analysis to the facts of the case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lower Court Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Rowley remains a key decision under IDEA and is often cited by courts attempting to determine the parameters of a free appropriate public education. However, the lower courts have varied in how expansively they have interpreted Rowley , with some courts interpreting Rowley to support schools' IEPs if the procedural requirements have been met, even if the educational progress is minimal. For example, in Fort Zumwalt School District v. Clynes , the Eighth Circuit emphasized Rowley's \"access to education\" requirement and held that the IEP was adequate. The court noted that the child was making progress, earning passing marks and advancing to the next grade, despite reading proficiency scores in the second to ninth percentile. However, the dissenting opinion described the child's achievement as \"trivial\" and argued that \"(t)his cannot be the sort of education Congress had in mind when it enacted IDEA.\" Some courts have emphasized that IDEA requires the provision of educational services and medical services, particularly mental health needs, are not covered.", "Other courts have read Rowley more expansively. For example, in Polk v. Cent. Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16 , the Third Circuit examined the \"some educational benefit\" language in Rowley and held that it required an IEP to provide more than de minimis educational benefit. Similarly, the Fifth Circuit, in Cypress-Fairbanks Indep. School District v. Michael F ., quoted from Rowley and concluded that \"the educational benefit that an IEP is designed to achieve must be meaningful.\" In order to determine whether an IEP meets this standard, the Cypress-Fairbanks court identified four factors: (1) the program is individualized; (2) the program is administered in the least restrictive environment; (3) the services are provided in a coordinated and collaborative manner; and (4) positive academic and nonacademic benefits are demonstrated. Other courts have looked at academic achievement testing, as well as grades, to measure educational benefit. For example, in Falzett v. Pocono Mountain School District, the court found that, despite allegations of missed days and limited curriculum, a student whose SAT scores improved and who received excellent grades, qualifying him for the Junior National Honor Society, had received FAPE under IDEA. However, in Ringwood Board of Education v. K.H.J. , the Third Circuit found that when a child has above average intellectual ability IDEA requires more than a negligible benefit, and noted that \"expecting a child with 'above average' intelligence to perform in the 'average' range hardly qualifies as 'maximizing' that child's potential.\"", "Procedural or other violations do not always give rise to a violation of FAPE. Generally, procedural violations must affect the child's substantive rights. For example, FAPE has been found to require that services mandated by an IEP be implemented as soon as possible after the IEP development, not immediately or within 30 days. Similarly, inaccessible facilities do not necessarily violate FAPE if there is general program accessibility. In addition, FAPE has been found not to be violated when a resolution session is improperly convened if there was not substantial effect on the child's educational opportunities. However, certain procedural violations may be significant enough to be a denial of FAPE. In N.B. and C.B. v. Hellgate Elementary School District, the Ninth Circuit held that the school's failure to evaluate a child in all areas of suspected disability was a procedural error that denied FAPE. A denial of FAPE was also found when the LEA unilaterally scheduled an IEP meeting without attempting to reach a mutually agreed upon time with the parents. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Educational Standards and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA)", "paragraphs": ["The application of the Supreme Court's analysis in Rowley to current controversies is somewhat confused by the change in the usage of the term \"educational standards.\" Although the Supreme Court in Rowley required that the instruction given to a child with a disability meet the state's educational standards, the term \"educational standards\" has taken on a different meaning in recent years. Currently, the term \"educational standards\" is likely to refer to specific content-based standards that delineate what a child should know and be able to perform at various points in his or her educational career.", "The 1997 Amendments to IDEA reflected the standards-based education movement. P.L. 105-17 significantly changed the IEP requirements and required that the IEP include, among others, a statement of the child's present levels of educational performance, including the effect of the child's disability on the child's involvement and progress in the general curriculum, and a statement of measurable annual goals designed to enable the child to progress in the general curriculum. In addition, in the statement of findings for the 2004 reauthorization, P.L. 108-446 states that \"[a]lmost 30 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities can be made more effective by\u2014(A) having high expectations for such children and ensuring their access to the general curriculum in the regular classroom to the maximum extent possible.\"", "Given the fact that the standards-based education movement, as reflected in IDEA and the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA), has changed the standards from what was required in the version of the law the Supreme Court interpreted in Rowley , questions have been raised concerning the current application of Rowley . Parents of students with disabilities have argued that FAPE requirements have been changed by NCLBA in several cases but have not been successful. Similarly, an unsuccessful argument has been made that there is an inherent conflict between IDEA and NCLBA. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peer-Reviewed Research", "paragraphs": ["The 2004 Amendments to IDEA include a requirement that specially designed instruction and related services be \"based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable.\" Commentary to the final regulations indicates that peer-reviewed research \"generally refers to research that is reviewed by qualified and independent reviewers to ensure that the quality of the information meets the standards of the field before the research is published.\" Similar to the educational standards issue discussed above, it could be argued that the peer-reviewed research requirement is difficult to reconcile with Rowley's some educational benefit requirement. ", "At least one court of appeals has addressed this issue. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin U nified School District, the student argued that his IEP violated IDEA because it was not based on peer-reviewed research. The court rejected this argument finding that the school's \"eclectic approach\" was sufficient and noted that \"[w]e need not decide whether District made the best decision or a correct decision, only whether its decision satisfied the requirements of the IDEA.\" The court also emphasized that courts must be careful to avoid imposing their view of preferable educational methods upon the states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Individualized Education Program (IEP)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Provisions", "paragraphs": ["After a child has been identified as a child with a disability under IDEA, an Individualized Education Team is formed to write an individualized education program for the child. IDEA contains detailed requirements for the IEP. The IEP must include a statement of the child's present levels of academic achievement and functional performance; a statement of measurable annual goals; a description of how these goals are to be met; a statement of the special education and related services to be provided; and an explanation of the extent to which the child is to be educated with children without disabilities. Since the IEP is the way FAPE is implemented, it is a key component of IDEA and has been the subject of numerous judicial decisions. Generally, these cases have adopted the Rowley two-part inquiry: first, the court determines whether IDEA's procedures have been complied with; second, the court determines whether the IEP is reasonably calculated to provide the child with educational benefits. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lower Court Decisions", "paragraphs": ["The exact parameters of an IEP have been the subject of several decisions. Generally, an IEP does not have to be \"perfect\" to be in compliance with IDEA, but must be \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\" In School Board of Independent School District No. 11 v. Joshua Renollett, the Eighth Circuit court of appeals found that although there were some flaws in the child's IEP, since these flaws did not compromise his right to an appropriate education or deprive him of educational benefits, there was no violation of IDEA. Similarly, the Second Circuit in Cabouli v. Chappaqua Central School District found that the evidence supporting the adequacy of the IEP, including the child's recent social progress, indicated that the child would likely make educational progress under the IEP and, therefore, there was no violation of IDEA. The lack of a functional behavioral assessment in an IEP does not necessarily mean that the IEP is invalid. The Sixth Circuit in Nack v. Orange City School District found that procedural violations that did not cause the student any substantive harm were not a violation of IDEA. In addition, the court in Nack also held that a lack of progress during one school year does not necessarily indicate an IDEA violation since IDEA does not guarantee success, but requires that a student receive sufficient specialized services to benefit from his or her education. ", "On the other hand, courts have found that an IEP which does not provide the child with educational benefits violates IDEA. In A.K. v. Alexandria City School Board, the Fourth Circuit held that an IEP which stated that the child should be placed at an unidentified private day school was not reasonably calculated to provide educational benefits and, therefore, was a violation of IDEA. And in M.L. v. Federal Way School District , the Ninth Circuit found that not including a regular education teacher on the IEP team resulted in a \"loss of educational opportunity\" that amounted to a denial of FAPE. However, in R.B. v. Napa Valley Unified School District , the Ninth Circuit held that IDEA did not require the participation of the child's current special education teacher as long as a special education teacher who has actually taught the child was present.", "The input of parents in an IEP has been the subject of several recent decisions. Generally, courts have held that \"the right of parents to control the content of the IEP is limited.\" For example, in Shelby S. v. Conroe Independent School District , the Fifth Circuit found that in order to develop an appropriate IEP, the school could perform an independent medical evaluation despite a lack of parental consent. And in Lessard and Lessard v. Wilton-Lyndeborough Cooperative School District and New Hampshire Department of Education, the First Circuit held that an IEP was not procedurally deficient due to incompleteness and noted, \"[l]ine-drawing is often difficult, and in the IEP context it is impossible to draw a precise line separating healthy requests for parental input from impermissible demands that parents do the school system's work.\" ", "Despite the limited control of parents over the IEP, courts have found for the parents in IEP cases. For example, in County School Board of York County v. A.L. , the Fourth Circuit found that a lack of prior notice to a proposed IEP change and a failure to inform the parents of their due process rights violated IDEA. Similarly, a finding that the school district determined the child's placement before the IEP meeting was found to violate IDEA's procedural requirements. A school's scheduling of an IEP meeting without first inquiring about the parents' availability and the school's denial of the parents' request to reschedule was found to deny the student FAPE. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related Services", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, IDEA's requirement of a free appropriate public education is the cornerstone of the act. FAPE is defined in part as requiring \"special education and related services.\" Related services are defined as meaning", "transportation, and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including speech-language pathology and audiology services, interpreting services, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation, including therapeutic recreation, social work services, school nurse services designed to enable a child with a disability to receive a free appropriate public education as described in the individualized education program of the child, counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services, except that such medical services shall be for diagnostic and evaluation purposed only) as may be required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education, and includes the early identification and assessment of disabling conditions in children.", "Two Supreme Court decisions under IDEA have involved the concept of related services, and both have involved the issue of what is a medical service. In Irving Independent School District v. Tatro , the Court examined the case of an eight-year-old girl with spina bifida who required clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and held that the school must provide the service. The Court held that services affecting both the medical and educational needs of a child must be provided under IDEA if (1) the child has a disability so as to require special education; (2) the service is necessary to help a child with a disability benefit from special education; and (3) a nurse or other qualified person who is not a physician can provide the service. Services that could be provided outside the school day would not need to be provided. Tatro drew a bright line between services that had to be provided by a doctor and those that could be provided by a person who was not a physician. However, after Tatro , some courts of appeal did not apply this bright line but used other factors, such as the nature and extent of services. This set the stage for another Supreme Court decision in 1999, Cedar Rapids Community School District v. Garret F .", "Garret F. involved a child who was paralyzed from the neck down as a result of a motorcycle accident when he was four years old. Since the child was ventilator dependent, he required substantial services including providing suction on his tracheotomy tube and manually pumping air through an air bag when suction is being provided. The school denied the parents' request for services, and proposed a test for related services in which the outcome would depend on a series of factors, such as whether the care was continuous and the cost of the services. The Court rejected this proposed test and used the same reasoning it had used in Tatro, finding that the medical services exclusion from the definition was limited to the services of physician or a hospital. This holding, the Court stated, was in keeping with the overarching purpose of IDEA \"to open the door of public education to all qualified children.\"", "The 2004 reauthorization dealt with this issue by establishing risk pools for high-need children with disabilities. States are permitted to reserve 10% of the funds reserved for other state activities (or 1% to 1.05% of the overall state grant) to establish and maintain a risk pool to assist LEAs serving high-need children with disabilities. Related services have not given rise to a large number of recent IDEA cases. Generally, the cases have emphasized the broad discretion of a federal court to define what services are required to enable a child with a disability to benefit from special education, and have applied the Tatro analysis. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Least Restrictive Environment", "paragraphs": ["IDEA requires that children with disabilities, to the maximum extent appropriate, be educated with children who are not disabled and that separate schooling or special classes occur only when the nature or severity of the disability is such that \"education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.\" ", "Several recent courts of appeal decisions have followed a two-pronged approach, first enunciated in Daniel R.R. v. State Board of Education , to determine whether an IEP places a student in the least restrictive environment. First, a court must consider whether education in the regular classroom with the use of supplementary services can be achieved satisfactorily. Second, if such placement cannot be achieved satisfactorily, the court must consider whether the school has mainstreamed the child to the maximum extent appropriate. The first prong includes several factors: whether the school district has made reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in the regular classroom; the educational benefits available to the child in the regular classroom as compared to those in a special education classroom; and the possible negative effects of the inclusion of the child on other students in the regular classroom. In A.G. v. Durtan, the Third Circuit examined the effect of the child with a disability on other students, noting the student's frequent, loud vocalizations, combined with removal of shoes and socks, inappropriately clapping and grinding her teeth, having difficulty toileting, and inappropriately touching other students. Although these disruptions were not considered dispositive, the court considered them notable and upheld the district court decision that the student could not be satisfactorily educated full time in a regular classroom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stay Put", "paragraphs": ["In enacting P.L. 94-142 , the original version of IDEA, Congress provided grants to the states to help pay for education for children with disabilities, and also delineated specific requirements the states must follow to receive these federal funds. This public law contained a requirement that if there is a dispute between the school and the parents of a child with a disability, the child \"stays put\" in his or her current educational placement until the dispute is resolved using the due process procedures set forth in the statute. The concept of \"stay put\" was placed in the statute to help eliminate the then common discriminatory practice of expelling children with disabilities from school. A revised \"stay put\" provision remains as law in the current version of IDEA.", "In 1988, the question of whether there was an implied exception to the \"stay put\" rule was presented to the Supreme Court in Honig v. Doe . Honig involved emotionally disturbed children, one of whom had choked another student with sufficient force to leave abrasions on the child's neck and who had kicked out a window while he was being escorted to the principal's office. The other child in the Honig case had been involved in stealing, extorting money, and making lewd comments. The school had sought expulsion, but the Supreme Court disagreed finding that \"Congress very much meant to strip schools of the unilateral authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed students, from school.\" However, the Court observed that this holding did \"not leave educators hamstrung.... Where a student poses an immediate threat to the safety of others, officials may temporarily suspend him or her for up to 10 school days.... And in those cases in which the parents of a truly dangerous child adamantly refuse to permit any change in placement, the 10-day respite gives school officials an opportunity to invoke the aid of the courts under section 1415(e)(2), which empowers courts to grant any appropriate relief.\" This statement about the school's right to seek judicial relief has come to be know as a Honig injunction.", "The Supreme Court's interpretation of IDEA in Honig did not quell all concerns about discipline and children with disabilities. In 1994, Congress amended IDEA's \"stay put\" provision to give schools the unilateral authority to remove a child with a disability to an interim alternative educational setting if the child was determined to have brought a firearm to school. This provision was expanded in the IDEA Amendments of 1997 to include weapons (not just firearms) and drugs, and was further expanded in the 2004 reauthorization to include situations where a student has inflicted serious bodily injury upon another person while at school. ", "Not all issues regarding the stay put provisions have involved disciplinary actions. Several courts have addressed the issue of whether the stay put requirement applies when a child is transitioning from Part C of IDEA to Part B. Part B of IDEA applies to school-aged children and requires the provision of FAPE as delineated in an IEP; Part C of IDEA applies to infants and toddlers and requires the provision of appropriate early intervention services as set forth in an individualized family service plan (IFSP). Rejecting an opinion by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) of the Department of Education, the Third Circuit in Pardini v. Allegheny Intermediate Unit held that the stay put provision requires the child \"to continue to receive conductive education until the dispute over its appropriateness for inclusion in her IEP was resolved.\" However, the Eleventh Circuit in D.P. v. School Board of Broward County disagreed, finding that the children in that case were applying for initial admission to a public school program and that they were not entitled to continue to receive services pursuant to their IFSPs. ", "Other issues regarding the stay put provision have involved mediation, private school placement, a move from a resource room to a classroom, and the appeals process in the courts. Sammons v. Polk C ounty School Board raised the issue of whether a request for mediation invokes the stay put provision. The Eleventh Circuit held that the IDEA regulations limited the application of the stay put provision to the pendency of administrative or judicial proceedings and, therefore, it was not applicable to a request for mediation. In L.M. v. Capistrano Unified School District , the Ninth Circuit held that a child who had not had an implemented IEP, and had never been placed in a public school, but was unilaterally placed in a private school by his parents, could not use the stay put provision to continue private school placement. Similarly, although the IEP team recommended that a child be placed in a private school in the fall, when the district contested the IEP teams recommendation, the court in E.Y. v. Elysian Charter School of Hoboken held that the placement where the child was to \"stay put\" was the placement for the preceding school year. A child's relocation from a resource room to an inclusion classroom was not found to constitute a change in placement within the meaning of the stay put provision. In Joshua A. v. Rocklin Unified School District , the Ninth Circuit held that the stay put provision applied throughout the appeals process in the courts.", "An attempt to apply a novel application of the stay put provision failed in N.D. v. State of Hawaii . Due to major fiscal concerns, the state of Hawaii decided to furlough teachers and shut down the public schools for 17 Fridays in the 2009-2010 school year. Since this meant an approximate reduction of 10% in instruction days, plaintiffs filed suit, alleging that this reduction violated the stay put provision of IDEA. The Ninth Circuit found no violation, holding that the stay put provision was not intended to cover system-wide changes in public schools that affect children with and without disabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seclusion and Restraints", "paragraphs": ["The use of seclusion and restraints has been the subject of increased congressional interest, and on March 3, 2010, the House passed H.R. 4247 , the \"Keeping all Students Safe Act.\" A similar bill, S. 2860 , was introduced in the Senate. IDEA provides that when the behavior of a child with a disability impedes the child's learning or the learning of others, the IEP team must consider \"the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior.\" Nothing in IDEA specifically addresses the use of seclusion and restraints, and the Department of Education has stated that \"[w]hile IDEA emphasizes the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports to address behavior that impedes learning, IDEA does not flatly prohibit the use of mechanical restraints or other aversive behavioral techniques for children with disabilities.\" The Department also noted that state law may address whether restraints may be used and, if restraints are allowed, the \"critical inquiry is whether the use of such restraints or techniques can be implemented consistent with the child's IEP and the requirement that IEP Teams consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports when the child's behavior impedes the child's learning or that of others.\" ", "The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA; however, in Honig v.

Similarly, the Court found that the establishment of procedural rights was required \"to ensure that the rights of children with disabilities and parents of such children are protected.\" These provisions were found to support the finding that the parents of a child with a disability have \"a particular and personal interest\" in the goals of IDEA and that \"IDEA includes provisions conveying rights to parents as well as to children.\"", "The rights that IDEA provides for parents were found to encompass not only procedural but also substantive rights. Justice Kennedy observed, \"IDEA does not differentiate, through isolated references to various procedures and remedies, between the rights accorded to children and the rights accorded to parents.\" It was argued that granting these rights would increase the costs to the states because parents may bring more lawsuits if they do not have the financial constraint of paying for an attorney. However, the Court found that these concerns were not sufficient to support an argument under the Constitution's Spending Clause that IDEA failed to provide clear notice before a new condition or obligation was placed on a recipient of funds. In addition, Justice Kennedy observed that IDEA specifically allows courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing educational agency when a parent has brought an action for an \"improper purpose, such as to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, or to needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\"", "The Supreme Court's emphasis on a parent's own rights has led courts to conclude that, although a non-attorney parent cannot pursue claims on behalf of his child, he may amend the complaint to assert his own claims.

In the 2007 decision Board of Education of the City School District of the City of New York v. Tom F. , the Court, dividing 4-4, allowed an appeals court ruling on private school reimbursement to stand. The court of appeals had held that parents of a child with a disability are entitled to private school reimbursement even though the student had never received special education services from the school district. The Court's per curiam decision did not set a precedent for lower courts, and therefore the issue about whether reimbursement for private school tuition may be made when the child has not received public special education services remained unsettled. On October 15, 2007, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in another case presenting the same issue. However, on June 22, 2009, the Supreme Court held in Forest Grove School District v. T.A . that IDEA authorized reimbursement for private special-education services when a public school fails to provide a FAPE and the private-school placement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special-education services through the public school.", "Recent lower court decisions have held that if the child is making some educational progress and the public school has provided an IEP calculated to provide for continued progress, the requirements of FAPE are met and the child is not entitled to a private school placement. For example, in M .H. and J.H. v. Monroe-Woodbury Central School District , the court found that the child's IEP was adequate and, therefore, the parents were not entitled to tuition reimbursement for a private school placement. These same standards have been applied when parents seek to place their child in a private school different from the private school where the school district has placed the child. In addition, if a private school does not adequately address the child's educational needs, the court may not require private school tuition reimbursement. However, the mere fact that the private school contains a large percentage of children with disabilities does not make it an inappropriate placement despite IDEA's preference for educating children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment.", "Courts have held that reimbursement for private school tuition is barred if parents arrange for private school educational services without notifying the LEA of their problems with their child's IDEA services.
