Mandatory funding typically accounts for around half of the THUD appropriation.", "The Obama Administration requested net budget authority of $134.5 billion (after scorekeeping adjustments) for FY2017, $20.6 billion (18%) over the FY2016 level. Most of this increase was for highway, transit, and passenger rail programs.", "On May 19, 2016, the Senate approved $114.2 billion in net budget authority ($121.2 billion in new budget authority before scorekeeping adjustments), an increase of $244 million (less than 1%) over FY2016, for THUD for FY2017 as part of a substitute amendment to H.R. 2577 that incorporated both the Senate-reported THUD bill (S. 2844) and the Senate-reported Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies bill. On May 24, 2016, the House Committee on Appropriations ordered to be reported H.R. 5394, an FY2017 THUD bill recommending $115.9 billion in net budget authority ($120.8 billion in new budget authority before scorekeeping adjustments). Congress passed two continuing appropriations resolutions to fund THUD and other federal agencies in FY2017; the current funding bill runs through April 28, 2017. The House and Senate THUD bills expired with the end of the 114th Congress.", "DOT: The Obama Administration requested a $96.9 billion budget for DOT for FY2017. That was about $22 billion more than FY2016, with significant increases requested for highway, transit, and rail programs. Both the Senate and House bills largely rejected the proposed increases and recommended $76.9 billion in new budget authority for DOT, $1.8 billion more than the comparable figure in FY2016. Both bills would increase funding for federal highway and transit programs and would fund new grant programs for intercity passenger rail.", "HUD: The Obama Administration requested $39.6 billion in net new budget authority for HUD for FY2017, $1.3 billion more than FY2016. The Senate bill recommended $39.2 billion in net new budget authority, representing $1.5 billion more than FY2016 and $600 million more in savings from offsets. Most of the increase is to maintain current services in HUD's primary rental assistance programs, the project-based Section 8 rental assistance program and Housing Choice Voucher program. The House committee bill also proposed increases relative to FY2016, but less than proposed by the Senate.", "Related Agencies: The Obama Administration requested $350 million for the agencies in Title III (the Related Agencies).

The major change in funding from FY2016 levels in the request was a cut of $35 million (20%) for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC).

Its programs are organized roughly by mode of transportation, providing grants to state and local government agencies to support the construction of highways, transit, and intercity passenger rail infrastructure, while overseeing safety in the rail, public transportation, commercial trucking and intercity bus, and maritime industries. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is exceptional among DOT's large sub-agencies in that the largest portion of its budget is not for grants but for operating the U.S. air traffic control system. In support of that task, it employs over 80% of DOT's total workforce, roughly 46,000 of DOT's approximately 56,000 employees.", "Title II of the annual THUD appropriations bill funds HUD.

These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the department's funding.

For some accounts, the appropriations committees provide advance appropriations , or regular appropriations that are not available until the next fiscal year.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters. These funds are sometimes provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills. Although emergency appropriations typically come from the general fund, they may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total reported for an agency.", "Most of DOT's budget is in the form of contract authority . Contract authority is a form of mandatory budget authority based on federal trust fund resources, in contrast to discretionary budget authority, which is based on resources in the general fund. Contract authority controls spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Total annual discretionary budget authority for THUD is typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of DOT's mandatory contract authority.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new nonemergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriations act. Another way is to find ways to offset a higher level of discretionary funding. A portion of the cost of regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees collected by federal agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "THUD Funding Trends", "paragraphs": [" Table 1 shows funding trends for DOT and HUD over the period FY2010-FY2016, omitting emergency funding and other supplemental funding.

It sets forth spending and revenue levels, including spending allocations to House and Senate committees. These levels are enforceable by a point of order. After the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees receive their discretionary spending allocations from the budget resolution (referred to as 302(a) allocations), they divide their allocations among their 12 subcommittees (referred to as the 302(b) allocations). Each subcommittee is responsible for one of the 12 regular appropriations bills. While a budget resolution and subcommittee allocations alone cannot be used to determine how much funding any individual account or program will receive, they do set the parameters within which decisions about funding for individual accounts and programs can be made.

In its absence, the Senate Budget Committee chair filed budgetary levels in the Congressional Record that are enforceable in the Senate as if they had been included in a budget resolution for FY2017.

They included $56.474 billion for the THUD subcommittee, which is approximately $1 billion less than the comparable FY2016 level ($57.301 billion). In the absence of a budget resolution in the House, the House Appropriations Committee adopted \"interim 302(b) suballocations\" for the appropriations bills as they were marked up in full committee.

Each dollar available to the subcommittees in rescissions and offsets enables the subcommittee to provide funding that does not count against the 302(b) level. As shown in Table 5 , in FY2016, due to rescissions and offsets, the THUD subcommittees were able to provide $8.7 billion in discretionary appropriations to THUD agencies above the net discretionary budget authority level.", "The amount of these \"budget savings\" can vary from year to year, meaning that the \"cost\" in terms of 302(b) allocation of providing the appropriation may vary as well.
