The country's king stepped down in 2006, and two years later Nepal declared itself a republic, electing a Constituent Assembly in 2008 to write a new constitution, which is currently being drafted. Though the process of democratization has had setbacks and been marked by violence at times, Nepal has conducted reasonably peaceful elections, brought former insurgents into the political system, and in a broad sense, taken several large steps towards entrenching a functioning democracy.", "This still-unfolding democratization process makes Nepal of interest to Congress and to U.S. foreign policymakers. A Congressional Nepal caucus has been newly formed, which should help further strengthen relations between the two countries, which have traditionally been friendly. U.S. policy objectives toward Nepal include supporting democratic institutions and economic liberalization, promoting peace and stability in South Asia, supporting Nepalese territorial integrity, and alleviating poverty and promoting development.", "Nepal's status as a small, landlocked state situated between India and China also makes it important to foreign policymakers. Nepal's reliance on these two giant neighbors leads it to seek amicable relations with both, though ties with India have historically been closer. Some believe India is concerned a Maoist regime in Nepal could lend support to Maoist rebels in India. China, meanwhile, has taken several steps to pressure Nepal to repatriate, or at least constrain the activities of, refugees crossing the border from Tibet.", "The place of Nepal's Maoists remains a delicate question that will do much to determine the fate of the nation's democracy. The group surprised many by peacefully challenging, and winning, the April 10, 2008, Constituent Assembly elections. During the civil war, the Maoists' stated aim had been to establish a peasant-led revolutionary communist regime, but once part of the political process, their objectives appear to have moderated. They have since lost control over government, and then returned as part of a coalition led by the Communist Party of Nepal United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML).", "Two key challenges presently face Nepal. The first is to complete the peace process, which would require a resolution of the difficult issue of how to integrate former Maoist fighters into the army, or into society. The second key challenge is completing the drafting of a constitution. This raises the question of establishing a new federal structure that would address grievances of groups that feel they have been underrepresented in the key institutions of the state, particularly in the Terai region bordering India."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nepal: Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["Nepal has undergone a radical transformation in recent years as the nation ended its civil war, abolished the monarchy, and established a multi-party democratic republic.

While trends are positive at present, significant challenges remain to be overcome.

However, enormous challenges remain as the new government of Prime Minister Jhala Nath Khanal, of the Communist Party of Nepal United Marxist-Leninists (CPN UML), seeks to draft a constitution before a May 2011 deadline.", "Before February 2011, Nepal had been in a political vacuum for seven months due to a deadlock in the Constituent Assembly, where no party or coalition was able to attain majority support. That logjam was loosened when Maoist candidate Prachanda withdrew from consideration for prime minister, and the Constituent Assembly (CA) first formed in 2008 to create a new government. They elected Khanal as prime minister, with backing from the Maoists, though the Maoists remained outside the government until March 2011. ", "Details of a \"secret\" deal between the CPN UML and the Maoists, which broke the political stalemate that had prevented the forming of a new government, have now emerged. Disagreements over the interpretation of the seven-point deal hindered the beginning of the new government in February 2011, but the entry of several Maoists into the government in March 2011 appears to indicate that another impasse has been averted. While Maoists have taken up several ministries including Peace and Reconstruction, they have not been given the Home Ministry. The Maoists will reportedly be given 11 ministries in total as part of the power sharing deal with the CPN-UML. Prime Minister Khanal also reportedly agreed to consider all options with regard to the future disposition of the 19,000 former Maoist combatants. This potentially signals less resistance to the integration of Maoist forces into the army by the CPN-UML than they demonstrated before. It has also been reported that the two parties have agreed to lead the government by turns. The agreement between the two parties was a positive step, but analysts note that the stability of the government will likely be tested by upcoming decisions that could expose widely differing interests between the two parties.", "The government faces the challenge of completing the peace process that began in 2006 by drafting a constitution before a May 2011 deadline. The government may not meet that deadline, as it faces two large challenges as the deadline approaches: completion of the peace process and crafting a new federal structure as part of the new constitution. The CA may well decide to extend the deadline once again should the government not finish its work in time.

The Maoists made a deal with the Communist Party of Nepal Marxist Leninists (CPN UML) to do this and support the CPN UML candidate Prime Minister Khanal. As a result, Khanal received 368 votes out of 601 in the CA to defeat the Nepali Congress candidate. The Nepali Congress candidate, Ram Chandra Poudel, received 122 votes while Deputy Prime Minister Gachedar, representing a Madhes coalition, received 67 votes.

The departure of the United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) monitoring group in January 2011, which was overseeing caches of arms and the cantonments of former Maoist fighters, led the former caretaker government to set up the Special Committee for the Supervision, Integration, and Rehabilitation of Maoist Fighters to take over the U.N.'s oversight function. UNMIN had been monitoring the situation since January 2007. A key positive development came in January 2011, when Maoist leaders formally relinquished control of their 19,000-member army to a government committee. Despite this, details of how the fighters will be reintegrated into society or integrated into the army of Nepal, and in what numbers, remain to be resolved. The Maoists have held to the view that all former combatants should be integrated into the Army of Nepal. Other political parties have held the view that Maoist numbers should be kept to 6,000 to 8,000 and that the rest should be assisted in their reintegration into private life. It is estimated that about 13,000 to 14,000 of the 19,000 combatants are still in the cantonments. Just how this will be resolved remains to be seen.

The main regionally based socio-political cleavage in Nepali society is between the Madhes people of the Terai and \"hill\" people. The Madhes of the Terai region that spans the southern border with India are not pleased with the political status quo, which divides their region and, from their perspective, gives the \"hill people\" a disproportionate say in government. One of the key cleavages in Nepali society is between the lowlanders of the Terai plain and the hill people of higher elevations and, in general, higher caste status. Any redistricting that does not unify the Terai into one administrative unit, where the Madhes would clearly dominate, is not likely to be well received by Madhes groups. The Madhes are reportedly displeased by their marginalization from the ruling coalition and have warned that there would be \"fire in the plains and the hills\" if the new constitution fails to address their aspirations. There are several Madhes political parties as well as armed groups in the Terai that have resorted to violence to promote their cause in the past. The Tharu group, which is also located predominantly in the Terai, opposes its inclusion within \"One Madhes\" where it would be a minority relative to the Madhes, and instead favors its own administrative district.

Prachanda, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M), sought the dismissal of Katawal, who has since retired over the issue of integrating former Maoist fighters into the Army of Nepal, which Katawal resisted. At the core of the political crisis of May 2009 was the dispute between the Maoists and the Army over the integration of some 19,000 Maoist fighters into the Army of Nepal. Debate on this has focused on the numbers of fighters to be integrated (with the Maoists wanting all fighters integrated and the other political parties favoring far fewer), and whether Maoist forces will be integrated as whole units or attached to existing Army of Nepal units. The Nepali Congress (NC) has opposed Maoist plans to integrate their forces into the Nepali Army. Instead, the NC advocates that they should be placed into an industrial security force, the police, or other sectors. Some estimates place the number of former Maoist fighters in cantonment at 19,000 or more.

This loose coalition has proven unwieldy in the actual functioning of government. The CPN-M also obstructed the sitting of parliament, held general strikes, and threatened to launch a popular movement against the government. The Maoists created a crisis by preventing the passage of the national budget, introduced to parliament in July 2009, although it was passed in late November 2009.

A transition from strict rule by the king to constitutional monarchy began in 1959, when then-King Mahendra issued a new constitution and held the country's first democratic elections. In 1960, however, the king declared the parliamentary system a failure, dismissed the fledgling government, suspended the constitution, and established a partyless system of rule under the monarchy. Although officially banned, political parties continued to exist and to agitate for a return to constitutional democracy.", "In February 1990, student groups and the major political parties launched the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy. The centrist Nepali Congress (NC) party joined with the leftist parties to hold peaceful demonstrations in Nepal's urban centers. In April 1990, after more than 50 people were killed when police fired on a crowd of demonstrators, then-King Birendra turned power over to an interim government. This government drafted a constitution in November 1990 establishing Nepal as a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarch as head of state. The king at that time retained limited powers, including the right to declare a state of emergency with the approval of a two-thirds majority of parliament.", "In February 1996, the leaders of the underground CPN-M launched a \"People's War\" in the mid-western region of Nepal, with the aim of replacing the constitutional monarchy with a one-party communist regime. The uprising appears to have been fueled by widespread perceptions of government corruption and failure to improve the quality of life of citizens, including providing access to cultivable land. The Maoists ran a parallel government, established their own tax system, burned land records, and redistributed seized property and food to the poor, in 45 districts. The insurgency was waged, in part, through torture, killings, and bombings targeting police, the military, and public officials. A number of bank robberies, combined with \"revolutionary tax\" revenue, made the Nepali Maoists one of the wealthiest rebel groups in Asia.", "The Kathmandu government faced additional turmoil in June 2001, when Crown Prince Dipendra shot and killed his parents, King Birendra and Queen Aishwarya; seven other members of the royal family; and himself, reportedly after a disagreement over whom he should marry. This incident did much to undermine the legitimacy of the monarchy. King Gyanendra, the former king's brother, was crowned on June 4, 2001, and he appointed a commission to investigate the assassinations. By mid-June, the country began returning to normal following rioting and widespread refusal to believe official accounts of the massacre. In July 2001, Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala stepped down amid fears of continuing instability and his government's failure to deal with the growing Maoist insurgency.

The prime minister, who also scheduled early elections for November 2002, reportedly took such action after his centrist Nepali Congress party refused to support his plan to extend emergency rule. Following the prime minister's actions, 56 former members of parliament filed a lawsuit against him, claiming there was no constitutional precedent for the dissolution of parliament during emergency rule. In August 2002, the Supreme Court rejected this lawsuit.

The government discussed imposing a partial state of emergency in areas most affected by the insurgency. However, opposition parties, which urged the government to open a dialogue with the Maoists, argued that by curbing civil liberties, emergency rule would inhibit free and fair elections. As an alternative, the government announced in September 2002 that it would hold the elections in six stages over two months, starting in mid-November, so that government troops could be transferred around the country to protect voters and candidates. After further deliberation, however, Nepal's cabinet concluded that the security situation was too risky to hold elections.

Moreover, the Himalayan mountain range along Nepal's northern border limits access to China, whereas the 500-mile southern border with India is relatively open. India has considered Nepal a strategic link in its northern border defenses. New Delhi has viewed Nepali instability as a potential catalyst for the destabilization of India's own troubled northeastern states. It is feared by some that Maoist success in Nepal may have a negative impact on India's own Maoist problem, which has increased in recent years. ", "Some sectors of the Nepali leadership have long resented Indian economic influence and have sought to establish a more independent foreign policy, which could draw Nepal closer to China. Kathmandu has at times \"played the China card\" in seeking to counterbalance what it considers undue pressure from India. Beijing has contributed economic aid to Nepal. Nepal borders Tibet, whose spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, has sought a degree of autonomy from Beijing for the Tibetan regions within China. 56 Contrary to historical precedent, former Prime Minister Prachanda made his first trip abroad as prime minister to China. Observers in India believe that China targeted the Maoists as the political faction with whom China can best gain political favor. That said, China appears to still be pressing the CPN-UML government to reach agreement on issues related to Tibetan refugees and border management.

The election of a Maoist-backed government may be viewed by Delhi as something of a setback given the sometimes tense relations between the Maoists and the government of India. During her January 2011 visit to Nepal, Indian Foreign Secretary Nirumpama Rao met with leaders of all the main political parties, including the Maoists. It was reported that she asked Maoist leader Prachanda about the Maoists' \"anti-India\" stance and that she was told that the Maoists believe that it is time to look at \"certain historical issues like treaties [the 1950 India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship] \u2026 in a new manner.\" Some in Nepal view the treaty as granting India a disproportionate say in Nepalese affairs. Just how far the Maoists' desire to revisit the 1950 treaty will go as a partner in the CPN-UML government remains to be seen. During a recent visit to Nepal, Rao stated after a meeting with Prime Minister Madhav Kumar that India would give priority to implementing a 34-point agreement with Nepal that includes enhanced cooperation between the two nations' security agencies and border security.

China has an interest in keeping Nepal from becoming a location from which Tibetan activists can promote the cause of Tibet. China has become more successful in recent years in convincing Nepal to restrict the exile Tibetan community there. Reportedly responding to Chinese pressure, the government of Nepal in March 2011 prevented the estimated 20,000 Tibetans in exile in Nepal from voting for a new political head of the exiled Tibetan community. China has in recent years made significant inroads in developing ties with South Asian states. Some view this as predominantly economically driven while others, particularly in strategic circles in New Delhi, increasingly view Chinese activity with geopolitical concern. There have been reports of Chinese agents crossing the porous India-Nepal border for the purpose of infiltrating Tibetan exile groups in India and monitoring the activities of the Dalai Lama and his associates. In March 2011, China announced that it will seek to further strengthen its relations with the South Asia Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

The government of Bhutan has been experiencing problems with Bhutanese of Nepali background, many of whom it views as having settled in Bhutan illegally. This Nepali minority group is known as the Lhotshampa. They are a Nepali-speaking Hindu people that inhabit Bhutan's southwest. Many Lhotshampa left Bhutan as a result of attempts over recent decades to integrate them into mainstream Bhutanese culture. Such attempts at assimilation have been viewed as a threat to the ethnic Nepalis' own culture. The program was aimed at assimilating the Lhotshampa by having them adopt the Bhutanese language, Dzongkha, as well as Bhutan's Buddhist religion and its cultural dress.
