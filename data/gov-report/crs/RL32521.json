The response to the threat of agroterrorism has come to be called \"food defense.\"", "An agroterrorist event would usually involve bioterrorism, since likely vectors include pathogens such as a viruses, bacteria, or fungi. People more generally associate bioterrorism with outbreaks of human illness (e.g., anthrax or smallpox), rather than diseases affecting animals or plants.", "The goal of agroterrorism is not killing cows or plants. These are the means to the end of causing economic crises in the agricultural and food industries, social unrest, and loss of confidence in government. Human health could be at risk through contaminated food or if an animal pathogen is transmissible to humans (zoonotic).", "While agriculture may not be a terrorist's first choice because it lacks the \"shock factor\" of more\u00a0traditional terrorist targets, an increasing number of terrorism analysts consider it a viable secondary target. Agroterrorism could be a low-cost but highly effective means toward an al-Qaeda goal of destroying the United States' economy. Evidence that agriculture and food are\u00a0potential al Qaeda targets came in 2002 when terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan were found\u00a0containing agricultural documents and manuals describing ways to make animal and plant\u00a0poisons.", "Agriculture has several characteristics that pose unique problems:", "Farms are geographically disbursed in unsecured environments (e.g., open fields and pastures throughout the countryside). While some livestock are housed in facilities that can be secured, agriculture generally requires large expanses of land that are difficult to secure. Livestock frequently are concentrated in confined locations (e.g., feedlots with thousands of cattle in open-air pens, farms with tens of thousands of pigs, or barns with hundreds of thousands of poultry) allowing diseases to infect more animals quickly. Concentration in slaughter, processing also makes large scale contamination possible. The number of lethal and contagious biological agents is greater for plants and animals than for humans. Most of these diseases are environmentally resilient, endemic in foreign countries, and not harmful to humans\u2014making it easier for terrorists to acquire, handle, and deploy the pathogens. Live animals, grain, and processed food products are routinely transported and commingled in the production and processing system. These factors circumvent natural barriers that could slow pathogenic dissemination. International trade in livestock, grains, and food products is often tied to disease-free status. The presence (or rumor ) of certain pests or diseases in a country can quickly stop exports of a commodity, cause domestic consumption to drop, disrupt commodities markets, and can take months or years to recover. The past success of keeping many diseases out of the U.S. means that many veterinarians and scientists lack direct experience with foreign diseases. This may delay recognition of symptoms in case of an outbreak, and the ability to respond to an outbreak.", "Thus, the general susceptibility of the agriculture and food industry to bioterrorism is difficult to address in a systematic way due to the geographically dispersed, yet industrially concentrated nature of the industry, and the inherent biology of growing plants and raising animals.", "In an attack, the agricultural sector would suffer economically from plant and animal health losses, and the supply of food and fiber may be reduced. The demand for foods targeted in an attack may decline (e.g., dairy, beef, pork, poultry, grains, fruit, or vegetables), while demand for substitute foods may rise.", "Economic losses would accrue to individuals, businesses, and governments through costs to contain and eradicate the disease, and to dispose of contaminated products. More losses would\u00a0accumulate as the supply chain is disrupted from farm-to-fork. Domestic markets for food\u00a0may drop, and trade restrictions could be imposed on U.S. exports. The economic impact would range from farmers to input suppliers, food processors, transportation, retailers, and food service providers.", "Significant threats to the currently-held notion of food security could affect our social order.

Another example is the concern over misuse of small aircraft, particularly crop-dusters, to spread biological weapons.", "This report focuses primarily on biological weapons (rather than chemical weapons) because biological weapons generally are considered the more potent agroterrorism threat.

A Presidential directive in 1998 on protecting critical infrastructure did not include agriculture and food. Agriculture was added to this list only in December 2003. Thus, after what many observers claim to be a slow start after September 11, 2001, agriculture now is garnering more attention in the expanding field of terrorism studies and policies.", "Agroterrorism received heightened national attention in December 2004 when then-Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson said in his resignation speech, \"For the life of me,\u00a0I cannot understand why the terrorists have not attacked our food supply because it is so easy to do.\"", "Congress has held hearings on agroterrorism and, while addressing terrorism more broadly, has implemented laws and appropriations with provisions important to agriculture.

Although farming employs less than 2% of the of the country's workforce, 16% of the workforce is involved in the food and fiber sector, ranging from farmers and input suppliers, to processors, shippers, grocers, and restaurateurs. In 2002, the food and fiber sector contributed $1.2 trillion, or 11% to the gross domestic product (GDP), even though the farm sector itself contributed less than 1%. Gross farm sales exceeded $200 billion, and are relatively concentrated throughout the Midwest, parts of the East Coast, and California ( Figure 1 ). Production is split nearly evenly between crops and livestock. In 2002, livestock inventories included 95 million cattle, and 60 million hogs. Farm sales of broilers and other meat-type chickens exceeded 8.5 billion birds.", "Agriculture in the U.S. is technologically advanced and efficient. This productivity allows Americans to spend only about 10% of their disposable income on food (both at home and away from home). Productivity increases over time have allowed the share of disposable income spent on food in the U.S. to fall from 23% in 1929 to 10% in 2003. The United States has the lowest spending on food prepared at home (6.5%) compared to the rest of the world, which ranges from 10%-15% for most developed countries and 30% or higher for some developing countries.", "The U.S. produces and exports a large share the world's grain. In 2003, the U.S. share of world production was 42% for corn, 35% for soybeans, and 12% for wheat. Of global exports, the U.S. accounted for 65% for corn, 40% for soybeans, and 32% for wheat. If export markets were to decline following an agroterrorism event, U.S. markets could be severely disrupted since 21% of U.S. agricultural production is exported (10.5% of livestock, and 22% of crops). The U.S. exported nearly $60 billion of agricultural products (8% of all U.S. exports), and imported $47 billion of agricultural products (4% of all U.S. imports), making agriculture a positive contributor to the country's balance of trade.", "The price of land is directly correlated to the productivity and marketability of agricultural products, and the level of federal farm income support payments. In 2003, farm assets exceeded $1.3 trillion, with $1.1 trillion in equity. Land and other real estate accounts for 80% of those assets. Of the 938 million acres of farm land in the U.S., 46% are in crop land, 42% are pasture and range land, and 8% are wood land.", "Agricultural production in the U.S. is concentrated geographically and on a subset of large farms. Although the number of farms in the 2002 Census of Agriculture totaled 2.1 million, 75% of the value of production occurs on just 6.7%, or 143,500, of these farms. This subset of farms has average sales of $1 million annually, and averages 2,000 acres in size.", "Livestock and poultry production are concentrated in different regions of the country, and in large numbers. Cattle are the least concentrated of the major types of livestock, given the prevalence of small cow-calf herds throughout the country and pockets of dairy on the West Coast, upper Midwest, and Northeast. However, beef cattle feedlots are particularly concentrated in a swath from northern Texas through Kansas, Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and western Iowa. The top five cattle-producing states (Texas, California, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Nebraska) produce 35% of U.S. cattle ( Figure 2 ).", "Hog inventories are concentrated in the Midwest, especially Iowa and southern Minnesota, and in North Carolina. The top three hog-producing states (Iowa, North Carolina, and Minnesota) produce 53% of U.S. hogs ( Figure 3 ). The production of broilers for poultry meat is concentrated throughout the Southeast, ranging from the Oklahoma-Arkansas border up to the Delmarva peninsula (Delaware-Maryland-Virginia). The top three chicken-producing states (Georgia, Arkansas, and Alabama) produce 41% of U.S. chickens ( Figure 4 ).", "Grain production is concentrated in the Midwest, although other states may contribute significant shares for particular commodities.

Second, export markets could be lost if importing countries place restrictions on U.S. products to prevent possibilities of the disease spreading. Sanitary and phytosanitary rules in international trade agreements would be important for maintaining export markets. Third, multiplier effects could ripple through the economy due to decreased sales by agriculturally dependent businesses (farm input suppliers, food manufacturing, transportation, retail grocery, and food service). Tourism can be affected of access to certain destinations within the country is limited or perceptions of food or personal safety falter. Fourth, federal and state governments could bear significant costs, including\u00a0eradication and containment costs, and compensation to producers for\u00a0destroyed animals.", "Depending on the erosion of consumer confidence and export sales, market prices of the affected\u00a0commodities may drop. This would affect producers whose herds or crops were not directly infected, making the event national in scale even if the disease itself were contained to a\u00a0small region.", "For food types or product lines that are not contaminated, however, demand may become stronger, and market prices could rise for those products. Such goods may include substitutes for the food that was the target of the attack (e.g., chicken instead of beef), or product that can be certified to originate from outside a contaminated area (e.g., beef from another region of the country, or imported beef). For example, when Canada announced the discovery of mad cow disease (BSE, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in May 2003, farm-level prices of beef in Canada dropped by nearly half, while beef prices in the United States remained very strong at record or near record levels. When a cow with BSE was discovered in the United States in December 2003, U.S. beef prices fell, but less dramatically than in Canada.", "Consumer confidence in government may also be tested depending on the scale of the eradication effort and means of destroying animals or crops. The need to slaughter perhaps hundreds of thousands of cattle (or tens of millions of poultry) could generate public criticism if depopulation methods are considered inhumane or the destruction of carcasses is questioned environmentally. For example, during the United Kingdom's foot-and-mouth (FMD) outbreak in 2001, euthanizing thousands of cattle and incinerating the carcasses in huge open air pyres provided poignant television images and difficult public relations situations for the agriculture ministry. Dealing with these concerns can add to the cost for both government and industry.", "Depending on the disease and means of transmission, the potential for economic damage depends on a number of factors such as the disease agent, location of the attack, rate of transmission, geographical dispersion, how long it remains undetected, availability of countermeasures or quarantines, and incident response plans. Potential costs are difficult to estimate and can vary widely based on compounding assumptions.", "Drawing on the FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001, Price Waterhouse Coopers estimated that the economic impact was $1,389 to $4,477 for each of the 2.6 million head of livestock (cattle, sheep, and hogs) on which indemnities were paid in the U.K. These impacts exceed the value of the animals because of the number of industries affected by the outbreak, ranging from feed suppliers to tourism. Applying the loss ratios from the U.K. incident to the larger U.S. livestock industry, Price Waterhouse Coopers estimates that 7.5 million animals (5.3 million cattle, 1.4 million hogs, and 800,000 sheep) might be destroyed in a similar scale outbreak in the United States. The resulting economic impact could range from $10.4 billion to $33.6 billion, using the range of impacts estimated from the U.K.", "A 2002 National Defense University study estimates that a limited outbreak of FMD on just 10 farms could have a $2 billion financial impact. A study by the USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) outlines the wide-ranging implications of a FMD outbreak in the U.S., assigning probabilities for animal losses but not estimating a dollar loss. A 1994 study by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on African swine fever suggested that if the disease were to become entrenched in the U.S., the 10-year impact would be at least $5.4 billion. The impact in today's dollars could be much higher.", "However, not all assessments agree that the economic consequences of an agroterrorist attack would be large and widespread. A December 2004 report by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) concludes that the nation's economic loss from an agroterrorist attack", "\"would probably be small, primarily because the food and agriculture industry is well\u00a0adapted to the prospect of disruptions from weather, pests, and occasional health\u00a0incidents.\"", "The CBO report also suggests that the food industry's experience recalling contaminated lots and the existence of commodity support programs \"to sustain the incomes of some agricultural producers\" might keep economic losses \"within the realm of industry experience and current public plans for detection and response.\"", "Such a conclusion likely overstates the capacity of traditional farm commodity programs to respond to the scale devastation possible in agroterrorism. The purpose of farm commodity programs is to support farm income when prices and production vary within normal year-to-year cycles. They were never envisioned to compensate for losses due to agroterrorism or even widespread pest and disease outbreaks.", "The federal farm commodity support programs subsidize about 25 agricultural commodities (such as corn, wheat, soybeans, rice, and cotton). These supported commodities represent about one-third of gross farm sales. The list of commodities that normally do not receive direct support includes meats, poultry, fruits, vegetables, nuts, hay, and nursery products. These non-supported commodities account for about two-thirds of gross farm sales and are possibly more likely to be the targets of an agroterrorist attack.", "Thus, the food products more vulnerable to attack (meats, fruits, and vegetables) do not have existing federal farm income support programs. Food processors or retailers beyond the farm gate do not receive any commodity support payments. Any federal assistance to producers or processors stemming from an agroterrorist attack would likely come from the emergency transfer authority available to the Secretary of Agriculture (for producers) and through supplemental emergency appropriations enacted by Congress (for producers, and possibly processors). Making disaster payments to individuals who do not normally receive commodity payments is technically more difficult than supplementing regular program payments.", "In the end, despite the CBO suggestion that the economic effects of agroterrorism might fall within the realm of normal experience, numerous federal agencies, state agencies, and private corporations continue to prepare for agroterrorism based on the assumption that an attack could exceed the typical experience with naturally or accidentally occurring outbreaks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Brief History of Agricultural Bioweapons", "paragraphs": ["Attacks against agricultural production are not new, and have been conducted both by nation-states and by substate organizations throughout history. At least nine countries had documented agricultural bioweapons programs during some part of the 20 th century (Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States, and the former USSR). Four other countries are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programs (Egypt, North Korea, Rhodesia, and Syria).", "Despite extensive research on the issue, however, biological weapons have been used rarely against crops or livestock, especially by state actors. Examples of state actors using biological weapons against agriculture include Germany's use of glanders against Allied horses and mules in World War I, the alleged use of anthrax and rinderpest by Japan in World War II, and the alleged use of glanders by Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Thus, in recent decades, using biological weapons against agricultural targets has remained mostly a theoretical consideration. With the ratification of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in 1972, many countries, including the United States, stopped military development of biological weapons and destroyed their stockpiles.", "Although individuals or substate groups have used bioweapons against agricultural or food targets, only a few can be considered terrorist in nature. In 1952, the Mau Mau (an insurgent organization in Kenya) killed 33 head of cattle at a mission station using African milk bush (a local plant toxin). In 1984, the Rajneeshee cult spread salmonella in salad bars at Oregon restaurants to influence a local election.", "Chemical weapons have been used somewhat more commonly against agricultural targets. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. used agent orange to destroy foliage, affecting some crops. Among possible terrorist events, chemical attacks against agricultural targets include a 1997 attack by Israeli settlers who sprayed pesticides on grapevines in two Palestinian villages, destroying up to 17,000 metric tons of grapes.
