(WAP, the \"program\").

During the debate over FY2011 funding, the House Republican Study Committee called for program funding to be eliminated. In April 2011, Congress approved $171 million for the program in the final continuing resolution for FY2011 (P.L. 112-10). For FY2012, DOE requested $320 million, the House approved $30 million, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $171 million, and the Conference Committee approved $68 million. The budget debate provides the context for this report, but details of the current debate are beyond the scope of this report, which is focused on evaluations of program cost-effectiveness.", "WAP is a formula grant program: funding flows from DOE to state governments and then to local governments and weatherization agencies. Over the 32 years from the program's start-up in FY1977 through FY2008, Congress appropriated about $8.7 billion (in constant FY2010 dollars). The $5 billion provided by the Recovery Act added more than 50% to the previous spending total.", "Over the program's history, DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and the Office of Management and Budget have used process and impact evaluation research methods to assess WAP operations and estimate cost-effectiveness. Virtually all the studies conducted through 2005 showed that the program was moderately cost effective. The studies included measures of operational effectiveness, energy savings, and non-energy benefits. The timing of past studies was a bit sporadic, driven mainly by new statutory requirements and program audits. Performance assessments have alternately identified improvements in program operations or identified operational problems that subsequently stimulated program improvements. Only the intensive evaluation study of program year 1989 (published in 1993) was designed to directly draw a national sample to produce empirical data on program cost-effectiveness. Such in-depth evaluations are costly and time-consuming. Most other \"metaevaluations\" were much less costly, using available state-level evaluation studies as the basis to infer national-level program impacts.", "The large infusion of Recovery Act funding\u2014and attendant changes in program structure\u2014heightened interest in conducting a fresh assessment of operations and new scientifically based evaluations of program impacts. Unforeseen recession-driven events delayed use of Recovery Act funding. For example, the DOE Inspector General (DOE IG) found that recession-driven budget shortfalls, state hiring freezes, and state-wide planned furloughs delayed program implementation\u2014and created barriers to meeting spending and home weatherization targets. In December 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a performance audit which found that the Recovery Act phase of the program was successfully addressing most goals and the challenges identified by the DOE IG. Recently-launched evaluation studies by DOE aim to determine whether Recovery Act funding was used cost-effectively and whether it fulfilled goals for job creation.", "The report concludes by reviewing the debate over the use of \"outside\" contractors to improve the objectivity and independence of weatherization program evaluations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The DOE Weatherization Assistance Program enables low-income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their households more energy efficient.

For example, data reported by some states related strictly to the number of homes weatherized using Department funds. Other states, however, combined the results of weatherization efforts funded by the HHS LIHEAP with those completed with Departmental funds. Merging performance data for such states distorts program results and could make it appear program efficiencies and energy savings are greater than that actually achieved with available funding.", "A recent OMB program assessment found that DOE had addressed the IG's concern about distorted efficiency (benefit-cost) measures:", "Average cost per home employed in the calculation of benefit/cost ratios now reflects total costs (including non-DOE funds) expended per unit in the states whose evaluations were used in the energy savings estimates.

ORNL found that this approach increased sample size, improved the ability to cover all major U.S. climate regions, and added to the statistical rigor of the results. 2. States as the Unit of Analysis. ORNL aggregated data from the 38 studies by state. This aspect contrasts with previous metaevaluations, which had treated multiple studies of the same state as separate empirical observations. 3. Studies Combined into a Single State Value. For each relevant variable (e.g., energy savings per gas-heated household), a single average value was used to represent the entire state. ORNL says this procedure prevents overall study results from being skewed due to the presence of multiple studies with similar results in a single state. 4. Weighted Average Used to Account for Multiple Studies. Where there were multiple studies, the average values computed in each study were used to determine a weighted average for each variable, with the weighting done by sample size.

The similarity among the values is not surprising because those meta analyses used data from many of the same state-level studies.", "ORNL states that all three of the metaevaluations, including the 2005 study, focused primarily on energy savings in homes heated by natural gas because the large majority of state-level studies addressed that fuel. ORNL found a statistically significant difference between the natural gas savings per household in the 2005 metaevaluation and the savings reported in the 1993 national evaluation. However, the 2005 study noted that the other two-thirds of the states were not included in the metaevaluation, and thus did not provide data for the study, which raises the possibility that the sample examined may not fully represent the nation as a whole.", "ORNL found that actual benefit-cost values are likely to be higher than those reported for natural gas savings, as shown in Table 3 . This was due to the fact that reported expenditures also included the cost of installing measures to reduce baseload electricity use, but only the benefits of natural gas savings were used in those benefit-cost calculations.", "Overall, the study found significant program improvements since 1989 (as reported in the 1993 national evaluation) and a generally higher benefit-cost ratio. However, it also acknowledged the shortcomings of the metaevaluation method and called for a new national evaluation:", "While the metaevaluations performed over the last decade have consistently shown higher natural gas savings per household than those reported in the national evaluation, there is a need to corroborate those findings through a rigorous examination of Weatherization Program efforts nationwide. Even the current metaevaluation is based on studies performed in only a third of the states, and those may not be fully representative of the entire Weatherization Program. Also, the value for preweatherization energy consumption, which is a major input for the calculation of national savings, is based on 1989 data. In addition, while state-level evaluations have put a strong emphasis on gas-heated houses, few studies have been conducted on electrically heated dwellings. And it is important to note that the biggest recent change to the Weatherization Program \u2013 the addition of baseload measures such as highly efficient refrigerators, water heaters, and light bulbs \u2013 has barely been addressed by state-level studies. For all these reasons, there is a strong need for a new national evaluation to thoroughly explore the current operations and achievements of the Weatherization Program across the entire nation.", "DOE has engaged APPRISE, a nonprofit analytical organization, to conduct the second national evaluation.

", "ORNL projected a 2010 benefit-cost ratio of 1.80 (from the program perspective). Most of the increase relative to the 2005 benefit-cost ratio of 1.54 was attributed to the change in energy prices from 2003 to 2010. Costs were based on the Recovery Act ceiling of $6,500 for average costs. However, the ceiling for cost-effective expenditures varied from state to state, based on the requirement that the savings-to-investment ratio (SIR) reach one (1.0) or greater for each of three factors: the last measure installed, energy intensity, and local energy prices.", "Traditionally, the program benefit-cost ratio has been expressed in terms of estimated national energy cost savings per dollar of investment for homes heated with natural gas, with cost savings based on national average residential natural gas prices. ORNL's estimates in the memo differ somewhat, due to reliance on state-by-state energy savings and investment numbers used to generate the energy savings estimates. This aspect allowed the dollar savings estimates to vary by region, by fuel type, by housing type, and with the adjusted average cost ceiling provided under the Recovery Act. The projected 2010 societal benefit/cost ratio (all benefits divided by all costs) is 2.51. This is almost identical to the societal benefit/cost ratio of 2.53 computed in the 2005 metaevaluation.", "ONRL reflected on the limits of the data used to make estimates, noting again the need for a new national evaluation:", "The methods used here are more complex and hopefully better at reflecting current reality than those used in previous years. Nonetheless, one needs to keep in mind the limitations of available input data that constrain an analysis such as this. There is no nationally available data on energy-related housing characteristics of weatherized households, nor is there data on the variations in the cost of measures installed from one locale to another. There is also no way of knowing at this point the exact characteristics of the housing stock and housing types that will actually get weatherized with the greatly expanded revenues available. Making these estimates more precise requires populating the methodology with more accurate data that will flow from the National Evaluation effort.", "ONRL noted that the memo's estimates were derived from a different methodology than that used in the metaevaluations. There are several reasons that a change in method was needed. First, the metaevaluation estimates are dated and do not reflect recent changes in program operations that materially impact household savings. These include a major change in the program's average cost ceiling, from $2,500 to $6,500, an expansion in allowable measures to include electricity measures such as refrigerator replacement and lighting changeout, and a major increase in program funding impacting the allocation of resources among different regions and climate zones.", "Second, the 2005 metaevaluation results describe only homes heated with natural gas and do not reflect the diversity of heating fuels used in treated homes nor do the results reflect potential cooling savings. The method used for the metaevaluations reflected only savings in single-family homes and those savings were never adjusted for variations in the treated housing stock. Finally, the estimates in the metaevaluations were based on national average energy prices and were not varied to reflect the diversity of energy prices weighted by the location of the weatherization work being performed.", "ONRL states that the methodology used to prepare statistics for the memo corrects for many of the above-noted deficiencies. However, it acknowledges that the findings do not present a statistically valid representation of the program's performance and results:", "There are too many assumptions and uncertainties incorporated in it to allow that to be the case. Much of this is the result of a lack of up-to-date information on program operations, particularly regarding measures installed and their cost as well as the energy-related characteristics of the homes weatherized.

In particular, he contends that client (agency/program staff) authority to accept or reject the evaluation findings and report\u2014and to time its release\u2014can give it significant control over evaluation content. Metcalf argues that the independence and objectivity of contractor evaluations are promoted by four main conditions: maturity of the contractor organization, contractor reputation and longevity, formal agency-contractor agreements, and research transparency.", "First, he claims that, over the past 40 years, the methods and practices of federal program evaluation have matured to the point where major evaluation contractor organizations have become generally objective and independent:", "Mathematica Policy Research (MPR), and others such as Abt Associates, MDRC, and RAND ... have established objectivity and independence as core values, and by and large have successfully defended these values in their conduct with funding organizations. Our track record establishes that government supported policy research can be and is independent, with proper safeguards.", "Second, Metcalf claims that the ability of a contractor organization to establish a reputation for objectivity enables it to enjoy longevity. In turn, this longevity helps the contractor to be independent from any single administration:", "If we define the client to be the current administration, the contractor and often the contract outlive the current client. For contract research institutions that regard themselves as doing policy research for a sequence of clients with differing policy agendas, the institutions' reputation for objectivity (as well as the quality of their work) is their primary currency in maintaining their longevity.", "Third, Metcalf argues that the agency's ability to influence content is largely constrained by the evaluation contract:", "For contract research, the researcher and his or her employing institution are collecting data and conducting research on an issue defined and paid for by a client. In this environment, two questions must be answered: (1) Who owns the research product? and (2) Who controls the content and the dissemination of the research product? These questions are typically defined by the contract, and the rights no longer lie intrinsically with the institution nor, by extension, with the researchers it employs to conduct the research.", "Further, he claims that there is an increased tendency for researchers and clients to agree explicitly, in advance, on the research methodology and the scope of reports. This process tends to protect the client (agency) from unexpected surprises, and protects the researcher (contractor) by allowing less \"wiggle room\" for the client to reinterpret results.", "Fourth, Metcalf contends that research transparency is a key factor for contract evaluation independence. In this regard, he draws a parallel to academic research:", "[T]he basic guardian of both quality and objectivity in the conventional world of scholarly research is the required openness to the examination of others. If you don't adhere to this rule, your research is presumptively not credible.", "Metcalf argues that openness in the various phases of federal program evaluations is guaranteed by the government's competitive procurement process and by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In procurement, the agency makes the request for proposals (RFP) publicly available. After the contract is awarded, the public can submit a FOIA request to obtain both the contract document (including the statement of the work) and the winning proposal:", "Regardless of internal contract restrictions, the contractor has the implicit nonexclusive right to request its own report under the FOIA, and to release it freely without restriction. Thus, while the government owns the research products it purchases through contract, the FOIA protects the researcher's right to disseminate his or her results\u2014and, indeed, the right of anyone else to disseminate the results.", "Metcalf further claims that, in practice, the right of evaluation contractors to disseminate research results through conference participation and publication parallels the rights of researchers in academic institutions. Also, in parallel to academic peer review, he notes that third parties often have a role in evaluations:", "First, we have already stressed the importance of the ultimate availability of research reports to the public, time delays notwithstanding. Second, most large-scale studies engage advisory panels and other forms of peer review at both the design and report stages.", "Thus, he observes that third party involvement is an integral aspect of transparency.", "While acknowledging that threats to independence persist, Metcalf contends that the contracting environment has had a positive effect on evaluation.

For many organizations that purchase evaluation services, independence is established by selecting someone who is external to the organization or program being evaluated and who is free from financial self-interest or ideology that may bias the evaluation to produce a desired outcome, and where the evaluator has control (or ownership) over the evaluation design and its intellectual property (data and findings).", "Reingold argues that all of the \"safeguards\" to independence that Metcalf identified are overwhelmed by three main factors: (1) agency funding control gives it influence over evaluation content, (2) contractor organizations have financial self-interests in accommodating agency wishes, and (3) their mutual self-interests undermine the competitiveness of the selection process.", "First, Reingold argues that an agency's control over evaluation funding allows it to retain a strong influence over evaluation content:", "[W]hen purchasing evaluation services via contracts, the purchasing agency has total control over all aspects of the services to be provided ...

This is code for selecting a firm that will tailor and implement an evaluation design that will likely provide positive findings for the program under study.", "Over time, this threat to independence can deepen. Ultimately, he says, the complementary self-interests of agency and contractor may undermine the competitive foundation of the selection process:", "When a firm has established itself as a reliable partner that will cooperate with the demands of a particular client, the selection process has virtually eliminated any real competition that would allow for a truly independent evaluation.", "In sum, Reingold argues that threats to independence and objectivity can enter from both sides\u2014a program's interest in self-protective control and a contractor's interest in preserving a business relationship. He concludes that:", "Unfortunately, there are signs this arrangement [the effort to achieve greater independence through external contracting] is not working.", "To address the problem, Reingold suggests two policy options to improve the independence of evaluation contracting. One option is to substitute grants for contracts, as the grants confer greater independence to the recipient. However, grants typically allow less oversight than contacts, which means that quality could suffer. Another option is to expand third party involvement. This option is described in the last section of the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Klerman Contributes to the Debate", "paragraphs": ["Since the Metcalf-Reingold debate, there has continued to be a focus on means to reduce threats to evaluation independence.

Klerman stresses two key threats to independence: the mutually reinforcing self-interests of funder and contractor and the self-interests of third parties. Also, he offers two ways to improve independence by modifying formal contract agreements. ", "First, Klerman characterizes the main threat to independence as an \"inherent tension\" between funder and contractor. Beyond stated goals for quality and objectivity, he claims that both parties bring \"unstated goals\" involving pre-set policy opinions and organizational survival interests that can color an evaluation project's process and findings. He echoes Reingold's argument that self-interests pose a key threat to independence:", "[E]valuation is sometimes politics (or business) by other means. For the funder, showing that the current administration's programs \"work\" (and those of the previous administration did not \"work\") yields political benefits. Sometimes the concerns are quite direct. A negative evaluation result might cause shrinking of a program, loss of budget for the funder's organization, in the extreme even loss of jobs for the funder's lead evaluation staff. For the contractor, this is a business. The \"right answer\"\u2014that is, the answer that the funder \"wants to hear\"\u2014now is likely to lead to more evaluation business in the future; the \"wrong answer\" now is likely to lead to less evaluation business in the future.", "Second, Klerman proposes that when seeking a balance point between funder and contractor over evaluation content, one option is to involve a third party. However, \"[e]ven nominating some third party leaves open the question of the third party's policy and organizational goals.\" From his perspective, all three parties to an evaluation\u2014funder, contractor, and third party\u2014are propelled by self-interests that pose threats to independence. However, Klerman raises the question of whether there may be an \"appropriate balance\" of these interests that could actually reinforce independence. ", "In conclusion, Klerman\u2014like Metcalf\u2014claims that independence may be improved by augmenting, or otherwise improving, formal contract agreements. He describes one strategy for improvement: ", "The challenge is to devise contractual mechanisms that assure satisfaction of the stated goal\u2014a high-quality and independent evaluation. Ideally, a contract would give the funder enough authority to handle standard contractual issues while preventing either side from deviating from the stated goals to further policy or organizational goals.", "As a starting point for this strategy, Klerman suggests that a clear separation be established between an official evaluation report and a contractor's own publication of analysis from the underlying evaluation. He recommends that:", "The funder would retain almost unfettered rights to the official contract report. Those rights would include the right never to officially release the document but not the right to change the contractor's text while continuing to list the contractor and its individual staff members as authors. The contractor would retain clearly defined rights to publish any findings from the evaluation.", "Klerman's main strategy for improving independence encompasses 19 approaches to modify evaluation contracts, which are grouped into three categories: (1) approaches applied when a funder retains the right to specify the final report text, specify the report release, and control discussion of the process; (2) approaches that limit the funder's right to specify the final text, and (3) approaches that limit the funder's right to specify report release.", " Table 5 summarizes the main points of the Metcalf-Reingold debate, including the points contributed by Klerman."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Limits of Independence: Is There an Optimum?", "paragraphs": ["Agencies of other national governments are also concerned about program evaluation independence.

Indeed, evaluation quality without independence does not assure credibility. Furthermore, in open and accountable working environments, evaluation independence induces credibility, protects the learning process and induces program managers and stakeholders to focus on results. Thus, evaluation independence, quality and credibility are complementary characteristics that together contribute to evaluation excellence.", "The DFID assessment of evaluation function suggests that the quest for independence\u2014if taken too far\u2014could lead to dysfunction. The report suggests that there may be limits to evaluation independence:", "Optimum independence is not maximum independence. Accurate and fair evaluations combine intellectual detachment with empathy and understanding. The ability to engage with diverse stakeholders and secure their trust while maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process is the acid test of evaluation professionalism. This is why diminishing returns set in when evaluation independence assumes extreme forms of disengagement and distance. Independence combined with disengagement increases information asymmetry, ruptures contacts with decision makers and restricts access to relevant sources of information. It leads to isolation, a lack of leverage over operational decision making and a chilling effect on learning.
