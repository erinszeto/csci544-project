The exact number and total amount of the Pell awards cannot be determined until all students have claimed an award. Generally, the number of recipients and the amount of the Pell awards are not reconciled until the end of the program year, which occurs after the following year's appropriations have been enacted. Appropriations for Pell Grants make funds available for two full fiscal years to provide administrative flexibility regarding potential shortfalls and surpluses. If the costs of the Pell Grant program exceed the current fiscal year's appropriation, the shortfall is covered by using appropriated monies from the next fiscal year. Similarly, a surplus can be carried forward and used in the following year.

For example, many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on July 1 of the same year as the appropriations, and remain available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year. That is, FY2005 appropriations for some programs will became available for obligation to the states on July 1, 2005, and will remain available until September 30, 2006. This budgetary procedure is popularly known as \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding, and is accomplished through funding provisions in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill.", "Forward funding in the case of elementary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year. For Pell Grants for undergraduates, however, aggregate program costs for individual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time. Appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support Pell Grants during the following academic year, that is, the FY2005 appropriations would be used primarily to support the 2005-2006 academic year. Unlike elementary and secondary education programs, however, the funds for Pell Grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years, as discussed above.", "An advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for a fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted. In the case of FY2005 appropriations, funds normally would become available October 1, 2004, under regular funding provisions, but will not become available until July 1, 2005, under the forward funding provisions discussed above. However, if the July 1, 2005 forward funding date were to be postponed for obligation by three months\u2014until October 1, 2005\u2014the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in a subsequent fiscal year, FY2006. For example, the FY2005 budget request for Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs for the Education of the Disadvantaged was $13.3 billion. This amount includes not only forward funding of $6.1\u00a0billion (to become available July 1, 2005), but also an advance appropriation of $7.2 billion (to become available October 1, 2005). Like forward funding provisions, these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appropriations bill.", "What is the impact of these changes in funding provisions? At the program or service level, relatively little is changed by the three-month delay in the availability of funds, since most expenditures for a standard school year occur after October 1. At the appropriations level, however, a significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year, and is therefore fully included in the current 302(b) allocation for discretionary appropriations. Under federal budget scorekeeping rules, an advance appropriation is not counted in the 302(b) allocation until the following year. In essence, a three-month change from forward funding to an advance appropriation for a given program allows a one-time shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations.

These provisions were specified in P.L. 108-199 , Division H, \"Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets,\" Section 168. The defense reduction required a rescission of $1.8 billion from unobligated balances that remain available from the FY2001 anti-terrorism supplemental, P.L. 107-38 ; the FY2002 anti-terrorism supplemental, P.L. 107-117 ; and unobligated balances from any appropriations for the Department of Defense.", "The non-defense reduction required a decrease of 0.59% from most domestic discretionary appropriations found in P.L. 108-199 , as well as from certain FY2004 appropriations enacted separately and advance appropriations for FY2004 enacted in previous years. This reduction yielded an estimated $2.8 billion (please see Congressional Record , daily edition, December 12, 2003, p. H12812; also see CRS Report RS21684, FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act: Reference Guide ). For the specified appropriations, the 0.59% reduction must be applied to \"each discretionary account and each item of budget authority\" and to each program, project, and activity within each such account or item. FY2004 supplemental appropriation acts and discretionary amounts from FY2004 Defense and Military Construction Appropriations Acts were excluded, as were advance appropriations for FY2005 or later that were enacted through P.L. 108-199 .", "Although the exact percentage of the non-defense reduction procedures was specified, the actual reductions for each account or line item were left for the determination of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the individual agencies. Within 30 days of enactment of the bill, OMB was required to report the amount of each rescission. In addition, Section 515 of the FY2004 L-HHS-ED bill required a $50 million reduction of funds otherwise provided for L-HHS-ED administrative and related expenses on a pro rata basis; these reductions were required to be reported by OMB within 15 days of enactment. As a result, the tables in the H.R. 2673 conference report, H.Rept. 108-401 , show pre-reduction levels, whereas the final post-reduction amounts, as approved by OMB, are incorporated into the tables shown in this report .", "Appendix A.

Major types of appropriations are regular, supplemental, and continuing.", "Budget authority is legal authority to incur financial obligations that normally result in the outlay of federal government funds. Major types of budget authority are appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. Budget authority also includes the subsidy cost to the federal government of direct loans and loan guarantees, estimated on a net present value basis.", "Budget resolution is a concurrent resolution passed by both Houses of Congress, but not requiring the signature of the President, setting forth the congressional budget for at least five fiscal years.

Context of L-HHS-ED Appropriations", "Budget authority for all federal programs has been estimated to be $2,345.3 billion for FY2004. Budget authority for all L-HHS-ED departments and related agencies has been estimated at $1,213.4 billion, or slightly more than half\u201451.7%\u2014of the federal total.

What accounts for the remaining $1,074.2 billion of L-HHS-ED funds?", "First, funding for mandatory programs accounts for more than two-thirds of the L-HHS-ED bill\u2014$331.9 billion, or 14.2% of the FY2004 federal total. Although appropriations are enacted for these mandatory activities annually\u2014these are sometimes called \"appropriated entitlements\"\u2014in general the amounts provided must be sufficient to cover program obligations and entitlements to beneficiaries. For these programs, as well as the programs funded through trust funds and permanent authorities, most changes in funding levels are made through amendments to authorizing legislation rather than through annual appropriations bills. Federal administrative costs for these programs typically are subject to annual discretionary appropriations, however. For\u00a0L-HHS-ED agencies, these mandatory programs include Supplemental Security Income, Black Lung Disability payments, Foster Care and Adoption, the Social Services Block Grant, and\u00a0Vocational Rehabilitation, as well as general (non-earmarked) fund support for Medicare and\u00a0Medicaid.", "Second, other appropriations bills account for a small portion of L-HHS-ED agency funding\u2014$5.1 billion, or 0.2% of the FY2004 federal total. Two HHS agencies are fully funded by other appropriations bills, and three L-HHS-ED programs are partially funded by bills other than L-HHS-ED. The non-L-HHS-ED sources are shown for each of these agencies below.", "The HHS Food and Drug Administration is funded by the Agriculture Appropriations ($1.4 billion in FY2004). The HHS Indian Health Service is funded by the Interior Appropriations ($2.9 billion in FY2004).

These funds are provided from permanent appropriations and trust funds. The major L-HHS-ED programs in this category include Unemployment Compensation, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, the welfare assistance program), Student Loans, State Children's Health Insurance, and Social Security benefits.", "Jurisdictional Changes Related to L-HHS-ED Appropriations", "On June 9, 2004, the House Committee on Appropriations modified the subcommittee jurisdiction of several programs relevant to the L-HHS-ED bill. It moved the U.S. Institute of Peace ($27 million in FY2004) from L-HHS-ED to Commerce-Justice-State appropriations. It transferred two programs to L-HHS-ED: the Weatherization Grants program of the Department of Energy ($227 million in FY2004) from Interior appropriations, and the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled ($5 million in FY2004), an independent federal agency, from Transportation-Treasury appropriations. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not accept any of these changes when it reported the FY2005 L-HHS-ED bill, S. 2810 ( S.Rept. 108-345 ). Subsequently, the conference agreement on H.R. 4818 , H.Rept. 108-792 , modified the initial House proposal for jurisdictional changes for FY2005, as follows:", "The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is transferred from Transportation-Treasury to L-HHS-ED appropriations.
