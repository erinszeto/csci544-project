This includes revenue support for 20 \"covered commodities\" under either the Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) program or the Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program and interim financing and floor price support for an expanded list of 24 \"loan commodities\" under the Marketing Assistance Loan (MAL) program. Outlays under the MAL, ARC, and PLC programs are funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC).", "In addition, federally subsidized crop insurance is available for over 100 agricultural commodities\u2014including both covered and loan commodities. Federal crop insurance is permanently authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) but is periodically modified by new farm bill legislation. The principal subsidy component of federal crop insurance is premium subsidies that pay for an average of 62% of the cost of buying an insurance policy since 2014. Premium subsidies are funded by USDA's Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).", "Through the first three years of the 2014 farm bill (2014 through 2016), USDA has spent over $38 billion on commodity-specific farm program outlays. Annually, commodity-specific outlays are estimated at $12.7 billion per year, including $7.5 billion for CCC programs and $5.2 billion in FCIC crop insurance premium subsidies. When farm program payments are linked to specific crops, they can influence relative market incentives and resource allocations. Furthermore, significant differences in spending across program crops may have regional or geographic implications.", "This report looks at available CCC and FCIC data for the major program crops and compares relative support using several different measures: absolute payments, payments per acre, payments as a share of the value of production, and payments as a share of the cost of production. In addition, price and income support levels are compared to market prices. By all of these measures, there has been substantial variation in relative support across program crops. Annual corn payments account for 46% of all CCC and FCIC commodity-specific outlays; however, corn also has the most planted acres and the largest annual value of production. When payments are compared per acre, and as a share of either the value or the cost of production for each crop, then peanuts and rice receive higher levels of support than do other program crops. Also significant is the absence of any net program outlays for the U.S. dairy sector under the 2014 farm bill.", "One particular analytical method for comparing price-protection levels across program crops involves PLC reference prices. PLC reference prices for each commodity are adjusted such that 35%, 40%, or 45% of monthly farm price observations fall below the adjusted reference price during the January 2008 through May 2017 period. The choice of these reference levels is arbitrary but facilitates comparison. Important differences in support levels emerge. Peanuts and cottonseed (included for comparative purposes as a hypothetical program crop) receive significantly higher price protection levels compared to the other program crops. Canola and sorghum also have above-average support levels relative to the remaining program crops. In contrast, soybeans and pulse crops receive lower levels of price protection."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates several programs that supplement the incomes of farmers and ranchers in times of low farm prices and helps them to manage risks associated with natural disasters and with variability in crop and pasture yields and commodity prices.

The magnitude of federal support payments may have kept some resources in the agricultural sector that would have otherwise moved to other sectors of the economy.", "Proponents of farm support programs have argued that producer vulnerability to seasonal weather uncertainty and global market conditions\u2014particularly when substantial land and capital resources are invested in a single year's crop activity\u2014merits public intervention. They contend that a single bad weather event or unexpected disruption in international markets could potentially drive significant irreplaceable resources from the agricultural sector.

", "Apart from the policy choice of making a large public investment in a single sector of the nation's economy, the intensive focus on a small number of field crops raises the question of whether all U.S. farm commodities (and hence certain geographic regions of the country) have been treated equitably by the various farm programs. Significant funding differences across programs and commodities raise the question of whether potential unintended incentives might divert producer behavior from the production choices that would otherwise prevail in the absence of government programs. For example, some farm subsidy critics claim that, by focusing federal farm support primarily on feedstuffs (feed grains and protein meals), U.S. farm policy has lowered the cost for American consumers of meat relative to fruits and vegetables\u2014which have been essentially unsubsidized. If true, this would suggest that current farm price and income support programs have indirect nutritional consequences. Similarly, critics of federal intervention in crop insurance markets have argued that by removing a substantial portion of the risk of farming on land with high yield variability, large federal crop insurance subsidies have encouraged production on marginal and environmentally sensitive crop land or discouraged the adoption of more environmentally friendly production techniques.

However, producers may change their coverage level each year (within the $4 to $8 range), thus integrating current market conditions into the producer's program and production choices. Whereas participation in MAL, ARC, and PLC is free, the MPP program operates more like an insurance program: Milk producers must pay an annual administrative fee of $100 for each participating dairy operation and statutorily fixed premiums that rise steadily for higher margin protection levels and greater volumes of insured milk.

Under the 2014 farm bill, peanuts have received an annual average payment of $341.19 per acre, representing 46% of the per-acre crop value.

Outlays under the MPP program, created by the 2014 farm bill, have failed to offset the premiums that dairy producers have paid to USDA to participate. This absence of program payments is displayed in Figure 11 and Figure 12 and contrasts with Figure 7 , which shows that the U.S. dairy sector represents the second-largest commodity sector (behind corn) among program commodities with an annual average value of production estimated at $39.8 billion during the 2014-2016 period.

The permanent legislative authority for commodity support programs, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (P.L. 75-430), uses prices paid for production inputs as a key determinant of support prices. ", "The 1973 farm bill, starting in 1975, used annual changes in COPs (as measured by the index of prices paid by farmers for production inputs, interest, taxes, and wages) and productivity efficiency (measured by yield increases) to adjust target prices, which were crop-specific reference prices used in determining payment rates. Current farm policy no longer explicitly includes COP as a determinant of support. Most economists argue against basing support on COPs for several reasons: ", "First, they contend that the specialized nature of some farm inputs (particularly land, buildings, and machinery) makes their cost dependent on the value of the farm output. This means that when earnings are above market levels because of a subsidy, the gains will be capitalized into the prices of the specialized inputs, thereby raising the subsequent COP and leading to calls for additional subsidies. In other words, the payments become self-inflating by bidding themselves into the capital assets (especially land values) that support agricultural production, thus resulting in higher farm payments as COPs rise. Second, COPs are different for every farmer. Thus, there is the problem of choosing which cost categories and levels should be covered\u2014for example, only variable costs and only at a level of the low-cost highly efficient farmers, or national average variable costs, or average total costs rather than variable costs. Another consideration is that COPs are the key metric for assessing competitiveness in the marketplace. Basing U.S. farm support payments on a crop's domestic COP could result in significant market distortions if U.S. COPs are above international COPs, since any surplus production could not move into international markets without some form of export subsidy.", "Instead, most economists argue in favor of linking farm support to market conditions so as to minimize unintended incentives and subsequent resource misallocations. There are times when market prices drop substantially, but temporarily, below trend levels. At these times, support may be justified to prevent unnecessary and undesirable resource adjustments. This builds on the concept of a market-based \"safety net\" that uses market price trends as the basis for setting support levels. Market-based support is discussed more in the following section.", "In spite of the opposition of economists, most farmers regularly advocate for support to cover their COPs. To this point, how do current levels of support compare to COPs across commodities?

With respect to stakeholders, the various industry, trade, and producer groups that represent the major program crops have seen their cost structures increase substantially since 2006 as higher commodity prices and competing uses have bid up the price of important inputs such as land, fertilizer, and seed. They have also seen increased competition resulting from trade agreements and the integration of China, India, and Brazil into the global agricultural markets. Several extreme weather events, such as the widespread U.S. drought of 2012, have also occurred. These many factors imply that the large capital investments needed to operate a farm are subject to substantial underlying risk. As a result, many commodity interest groups argue for an expanded safety net with a revenue support target that does not shift dramatically following any single market event. Ultimately, many farm groups point to COPs as the relevant reference point for setting target prices.", "In contrast, economists John Groenewegen and Kenneth Clayton argued in 1982 that \"the level of price support should be established below trend market prices.\" One can think of the trend market price as reflecting the long-term equilibrium market price. The logic of providing a \"safety net\" may be used to set support prices at some level below the long-term equilibrium price. Currently, the law specifies fixed support levels under PLC and MAL without consideration for market price trends. Paraphrasing from Groenewegen and Clayton, trend market prices as a reference point should not cause the support program to attract additional resources into the sector but would provide a cash flow to farmers when market prices deviate substantially and temporarily below trend levels. Possibly in recognition of this logic, the last time that USDA proposed a farm bill to Congress in January 2007, it suggested that MAL rates be set at 85% of the five-year Olympic average market price for covered crops, with maximum loan rates as established in the House-passed version of the 2002 farm bill ( H.R. 2419 , 110 th Congress). The WTO dispute settlement ruling against U.S. cotton programs in 2005 further suggested that by giving price support levels a market context, as suggested by the formulation of a moving average, they would be more likely to be found in compliance with WTO rules.", "How do current support prices vary across major program crops in comparison to market price trends? This is evaluated by three different measures. First, support prices (MAL loan rates and PLC reference prices) are compared with average farm prices under the 2014 farm bill. Then, the level of \"price protection\" provided under the MAL and PLC programs is measured as the percent of monthly farm price observations below the MAL loan rates and PLC reference prices established under the 2014 farm bill for each program crop.

The MAL program does not use monthly prices as a basis for payments but rather weekly AWPs for cotton and rice and daily posted county prices for the other program crops.
