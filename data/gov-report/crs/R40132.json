Although modern Presidents communicate with Congress and the public regularly, the State of the Union provides the President with a unique opportunity to present his entire policy platform in one speech. ", "From the President's perspective, the State of the Union address has evolved from a constitutional duty to a welcome source of executive power and authority. Standing before the American public to deliver the annual address, the President combines several constitutional roles: chief of state, chief executive, chief diplomat, commander-in-chief, and chief legislator. Besides delivering the State of the Union, there is no other annual opportunity for the President to showcase his entire arsenal of constitutional powers.", "Over time, the State of the Union address has evolved considerably.

It is difficult to point to one moment in time when the address developed into the contemporary speech now commonly recognized as the starting point of the legislative session. Instead, several Presidents throughout American history presided over shifts and variations to the address.", "George Washington gave the first \"State of the Union\" address on January 8, 1790. At that time, the speech was known as the \"Annual Message.\" Washington's address, which was quite short at 1,089 words, was delivered before both houses of Congress. As the nomenclature implies, when Washington gave his second Annual Message the following year, he established the precedent that the President would provide information annually to Congress.", "John Adams followed Washington's precedent during his tenure. Likening it to a \"speech from the throne\" reminiscent of monarchy's vestiges, Thomas Jefferson changed course and instead submitted his Annual Message in writing. Historians also speculate that Jefferson was a poor public speaker and did not want to deliver it orally since his Inaugural Address had been barely audible and was unfavorably received. Between 1801 and 1913, Presidents fulfilled their constitutional duty by sending their yearly report as a formal written letter to Congress. These written messages contained information about the state of the nation, including policy recommendations. During this time period, the Annual Message swelled in length, with several exceeding 25,000 words.", "President Woodrow Wilson altered historical precedent when he delivered the 1913 Annual Message in the House chamber before a joint session of Congress. Although Wilson's action \"stunned official Washington,\" he had written extensively in Constitutional Government about his disagreement with Jefferson's decision to submit the address in writing. Instead, Wilson read the Constitution as providing the President with the broad authority to serve as a national spokesman. Wilson altered presidential rhetoric, using it as an intermediary tool to draw widespread public attention to the policies he supported. The public's endorsement served as political leverage that could compel Members of Congress to support his legislative agenda.", "From 1913 until 1934, the Annual Message entered a transitional phase in which Presidents occasionally issued the address orally. Wilson delivered six of his eight Annual Messages in person, and Warren Harding presented his two addresses orally. Calvin Coolidge gave one address in the House chamber, and became the first President to broadcast the annual speech on radio. ", "During his presidential terms, Franklin Roosevelt solidified the oral tradition of the Annual Message. Roosevelt also applied the constitutional language \"State of the Union,\" both to the message and the event, which became the popular nomenclature from his presidency forward. Given its oral rather than written delivery, the length of the address decreased to between 5,000 and 7,000 words. Roosevelt also ushered in the modern tradition of using the collective words \"we\" and \"our\" with greater frequency than his predecessors.", " Figure 1 displays the length of State of the Union addresses across American presidential history. It shows the sudden drop in 1913, when Woodrow Wilson resuscitated the oral mode of delivery. The spikes after Wilson are instances in which Presidents issued the final State of the Union of their term in writing, such as Franklin Roosevelt in 1945 and Carter in 1981. After winning reelection in 1972, Richard Nixon issued a series of written messages in 1973 instead of giving an overview speech. Barack Obama's 2015 speech contained 6,718 words, which was slightly shorter than his 2014 speech of 6,989 words. The 2015 address lasted 59 minutes, 57 seconds.", "Harry Truman's 1947 State of the Union address was the first televised. Until 1965, Presidents issued the State of the Union during the day.

Kennedy identified values he deemed critically important to the nation:", "But a stronger nation and economy require more than a balanced Budget. They require progress in those programs that spur our growth and fortify our strength.", "He then recognized the policy problem that arose from the values he emphasized:", "A strong America also depends on its farms and natural resources.... Our task is to master and turn to fully fruitful ends the magnificent productivity of our farms and farmers. The revolution on our own countryside stands in the sharpest contrast to the repeated farm failures of the Communist nations and is a source of pride to us all.", "Finally, Kennedy provided his specific policy recommendation:", "I will, therefore, submit to the Congress a new comprehensive farm program\u2014tailored to fit the use of our land and the supplies of each crop to the long-range needs of the sixties\u2014and designed to prevent chaos in the sixties with a program of commonsense.", "Presidents use this three-part rhetorical sequence when discussing both domestic and foreign policy in the State of the Union."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recurring Themes", "paragraphs": ["In addition to a common rhetorical sequence, State of the Union addresses also exhibit recurring thematic elements.

For example, Bill Clinton used his 1995 speech to promote the concept of a \"New Covenant\" that blended the traditional themes of \"opportunity and responsibility\" with the current policy challenges his Administration faced. Moving back and forth between historical themes and contemporary issues is a common rhetorical practice in State of the Union addresses.

The bipartisan tone of the speech distinguishes it from other types of presidential rhetoric. Speaking before a joint session of Congress, Presidents often try to frame their arguments in such a way to build consensus. In his 2002 speech, George W. Bush stated the following:", "September the 11 th brought out the best in America and the best in this Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve. Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home. I'm a proud member of my party. Yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats but as Americans.", "A rhetorical emphasis on bipartisanship can be politically empowering. By claiming a willingness to reach across the aisle, Presidents can remind listeners that their constitutional authority includes a mandate to protect the welfare of all citizens.

In 2015, the legislative success rate for President Obama's proposals was 35.7%.", "One pattern that can be discerned from Figure 2 is that Presidents typically experience increased legislative success in the year immediately following an election. Of the six Presidents since 1965 who gave State of the Union postelection addresses, the average State of the Union legislative success rate was 46.1%, almost 7 percentage points higher than the overall average. The success rate falls for second-term addresses to 32.1%.", "A different study using a distinct dataset examined whether policy mentions in the State of the Union address increased the likelihood the President subsequently took a position on specific legislation introduced by Congress. The results were mixed. There is a strong link between a President's State of the Union foreign policy rhetoric and his legislative position-taking. The more a President talks about foreign policy in the speech, the more likely he will engage in position-taking later in the year on related bills. There is a weaker relationship in the area of economic policy, but the number of policy mentions in the annual speech still affects presidential legislative behavior. There is no demonstrated statistical relationship in health or social welfare policy. It appears that Presidents are less likely to support their rhetoric with subsequent position-taking when Congress considers bills in these issue areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capturing and Holding the Public's Attention", "paragraphs": ["Evidence also suggests that Presidents can successfully capture the public's attention by mentioning a policy proposal in the State of the Union. Increased emphasis in a State of the Union speech translates into a higher level of public interest in that particular policy area. Both substantive arguments (in which the President took a position on an issue) and symbolic rhetoric (in which the President spoke generally about an issue but did not offer a specific recommendation) can increase public attention. Merely mentioning an issue in the State of the Union has the power to heighten the public's awareness of it. In a 2004 analysis of State of the Union addresses from 1946 to 2003, every 50 words a President devoted to an issue resulted in a 2% increase in the public identifying that problem as the most important in the nation.", "However, the President's ability to maintain the public's interest varies according to the issue area. Increased public attention to economic policies mentioned by the President in his State of the Union address tends to evaporate by the end of the year. Conversely, however, the American public appears to retain its interest in foreign policy: attention to foreign policy issues mentioned by the President in his annual speech remains steady at the year's conclusion. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the President can use the State of the Union address more successfully to reshape and reconstitute public opinion about foreign policy. Presidents may intuitively understand this disparate effect; a study of State of the Union addresses from 1956 through 2005 demonstrates that \"international affairs and foreign aid\" is the most frequent policy area mention by the President in the speech within this time frame.", "The empirical evidence suggests that presidents have used the address to discuss foreign policy issues in recent years. Using a \"word cloud\" tool that counts the frequency of words in a document, President George W. Bush said \"terrorist\" 14 times on September 20, 2001. In 2003, he used the name \"Saddam Hussein\" 19 times. In 2005, President Bush used the word \"security\" 29 times. \"Iraq\" was spoken 10 times in 2007. The frequent use of foreign policy terms is not, however, a product of a post-September 11 world. President Jimmy Carter said the word \"Soviet\" 57 times in his 1980 State of the Union, and President Lyndon Johnson said \"Vietnam\" 32 times in his 1966 speech.", "Given that Presidents must compete with cable television channels not airing the State of the Union address and other digital media, the threat of a declining viewership might depress the speech's potential salience.
