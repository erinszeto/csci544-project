The Army had also suggested it saw \"a lot of value in common chassis in terms of logistics support,\" and that it might pursue a common chassis for GCV variants. Other possible GCV features discussed by the Army included a V-shaped hull and side armor to protect against improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The Army also suggested the GCV would be fuel efficient. The air transportability of the GCV has been discussed as a key design consideration, and the Army had said the GCV must be able to fit on C-17 transports. In order for the GCV to be a \"full spectrum\" combat vehicle, the Army reportedly had required non-lethal weapon systems be incorporated into vehicle design. While the GCV is to have some military equipment directed by the Army, such as radios and chemical protection systems, Army officials are leaving most of the specific solutions to industry recommendations.

This includes incorporating Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles into the fleet while modernizing current vehicle fleets including Stryker. The first GCV will be an Infantry Fighting Vehicle offering a highly-survivable platform for delivering a nine-man infantry squad to the battlefield. The GCV is the first vehicle that will be designed from the ground up to operate in an IED environment. It is envisioned to have greater lethality and ballistic protection than a Bradley, greater IED and mine protection than an MRAP, and the cross country mobility of an Abrams tank. The GCV will be highly survivable, mobile and versatile, but the Army has not set specific requirements such as weight, instead allowing industry to propose the best solution to meet the requirements.", "Prior to the release of the RFP, the Army engaged with industry through a series of industry days to inform them of the government's intent for GCV development and gain their feedback from potential contractors about GCV requirements and emerging performance specifications.

The Army included affordability targets of per unit cost for the vehicle between $9 million and $10.5 million and an operational sustainment cost of $200 per operational mile, with both affordability targets being in FY2010 dollars. In addition, the Army will require the GCV fit on a C-17 transport but not on a C-130. The Army was expected to award technology development contracts to three contractors by April 2011, and the Technology Development (TD) Phase is planned to last 24 months. An early prototype vehicle is expected by the middle of FY2014 and the first full-up prototype is expected by the beginning of FY2016.

Another concern was industry was not clear on how many vehicles the Army intended to build and questioned whether the Army could afford the production in the long run. According to the Army, the GCV is intended to replace infantry fighting vehicles in ABCTs, which would be 50% of the Bradleys in the ABCT. Some analysts suggest the GCV's price tag per vehicle could make it vulnerable to future budget cuts, with one analyst noting the cost was so high \"the program is sure to be politically controversial and therefore suffer much the same fate the Marine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) has.\" ", "Because of concerns the GCV program would not make it to production, issues regarding sustaining the industrial base have been raised. Analysts contend there are very few new combat vehicles currently in production, noting that Bradley A3 production ended in 2012; the last Stryker armored personnel carrier production ended in 2013; and the M-1 Abrams tank remanufacturing program is slated to end after 2014, leaving the improved Paladin self-propelled howitzer in production until the GCV starts production in 2017. Even though congressional action will keep the Abrams production line open, some defense industry analysts are concerned that with so few opportunities to develop and manufacture armored fighting vehicles, some long-standing U.S. defense firms might drop out of the business, thereby limiting bidding on any future armored fighting vehicle programs to foreign manufacturers.

While the contracts for the original 24 month TD were firm fixed price, the parallel work during this phase from the Analysis of Alternatives, Non Developmental Item (NDI) evaluations, and trade space evaluations with the contractors have provided opportunities to modify the requirements for a more affordable and executable GCV design. The additional six months in TD enables the contractors to complete preliminary designs that represent what we really want to produce. The Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) plan is to award both EMD and production options to a single vendor. This single change saves the department nearly $2.5 billion in RDT&E resources. Milestone B will remain as a full and open competition for the EMD phase of the GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle Program and allows other vendors (including non U.S. NDI product based vendors) to propose modified NDI vehicles. In support of full and open competition resulting in a single award for EMD, the Army's previously planned procurement of long lead materials for test rigs and production prototypes is not authorized at this time. This decision eliminates spending scarce resources on incomplete designs and is consistent with our full and open competitive intent. Lastly, in support of the schedule risk associated with the integration during EMD and the six month TD extension, I have directed Milestone C to move from FY2018 to FY2019 and the associated re-phasing of procurement dollars. I will drive this program to hold this schedule to the maximum extent possible; this shift is both more affordable and executable. All of these changes, when supported with the approval of the requirements changes for the CDD under review, will save a total of $4+ billion over the FYDP [Future Year Defense Plan\u2014FY2014-FY2019].", "The major changes include extended the current TD phase by six months, permitting only a single contractor to proceed to the GCV's EMD phase and postponing the program's Milestone C production decision until FY2019, almost a year longer than the previously planned early FY2018 Milestone C decision. There have been concerns expressed by some that designating only one EMD contractor will eliminate cost savings from competition and extending the TD phase by six months and the Milestone C decision by up to a year will add cost to the program.
