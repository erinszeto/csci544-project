It called for the repeal of the existing law (Title 10, United States Code, \u00a7654) barring open homosexuality in the military by prescribing a series of steps that must take place before repeal occurs. One step was fulfilled on July 22, 2011, when the President signed the certification of the process ending the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which was repealed on September 20, 2011. However, in repealing the law and the so-called \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy, a number of issues have been raised, but were not addressed by P.L. 111-321. This report considers issues that Congress may wish to consider regarding matters arising as a result of the repeal of \u00a7654.", "Under the Constitution, Congress has the authority for making \"rules for the government and regulation\" of the military services. It has been suggested that Congress could hold hearings concerning such matters as the anticipated changes in other laws regarding military benefits, for example.", "Issues for consideration include, but are not limited to, congressional oversight of the repeal process, differences in benefits and privileges some individuals may experience (especially differences created under the Defense of Marriage Act), changes involving sodomy prohibitions, and efforts by some to expand the repeal to include transgender individuals.", "Certain military benefits and privileges are extended to spouses as defined by law. Under the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal government recognizes marriage as the union of one man and one woman. However, certain states recognize same-sex marriages. Thus, it is possible for a same-sex couple to be legally married but not eligible for certain military benefits and privileges.", "Laws prohibiting sodomy (defined as \"unnatural carnal copulation\") in the military context have varied over time. There existed proposed language in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act in the 112th Congress that would remove sodomy from the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, effectively decriminalizing sodomy. Similar language did not exist in the House version. This language was not included in the final law. Instead, use of the term \"forced\" sodomy has been cited suggesting violations involving \"consensual\" sodomy will not be enforced.", "The repeal of the ban on homosexual behavior has encouraged some to expand efforts to end discrimination against transgender individuals. Based on military fitness policies, individuals who have a history of mental disorders that, in the opinion of the medical examiner, would interfere with or prevent satisfactory performance of military duties are not allowed to serve. Among the disorders cited are \"sexual and gender identity disorders.\" (These disorders are listed in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification or ICD-9-CM, 302.) At one time, homosexuality was listed as a psychiatric disorder, but this was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1973. Some have argued that other \"gender disorders\" should also be removed. Along these lines, advocates believe it is unfair for the military to continue to discriminate against these individuals. Others, however, believe that until the DSM and ICD-9-CM are changed, such individuals should continue to be barred from serving."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1993, homosexuality was banned in the military under Department of Defense (DOD) regulations. The then-existing policy had been in place since the Carter Administration. During his campaign for the presidency, Bill Clinton promised that, if elected, he would \"lift the ban.\" In response, Congress began considering legislation on the issue. Following his election, President Clinton implemented an interim policy seemingly suspending the existing policy until Congress could finish its work. Following a lengthy public consideration of the issue, Congress passed P.L. 103-160 , codified in 10 United States Code Section 654. This language codified the grounds for discharge from the military as follows: (1) the member has engaged in, attempted to engage in, or solicited another to engage in a homosexual act or acts; (2) the member states that he or she is a homosexual or bisexual; or (3) the member has married or attempted to marry someone of the same sex. In implementing the law, the Clinton Administration added language in regulations that went beyond the law and prohibited questioning military members and recruits about their sexuality. This policy became known as \"Don't ask, Don't tell\" or DADT.", "On January 27, 2010, during his State of the Union speech, President Obama stated his desire to work with Congress \"to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.\" ", "Shortly thereafter, on March 2, 2010, the Secretary of Defense appointed the Honorable Jeh Charles Johnson (General Counsel) and General Carter F. Ham to co-chair a working group to \"undertake a comprehensive review of the impacts of repeal, should it occur, of Section 654 of Title 10 of the United States Code.\" The unidentified group formed to conduct this study became known as the Comprehensive Review Working Group or CRWG. The CRWG report was issued on November 30, 2010, although certain \"findings\" were leaked to the media before that date. ", "Legislation was introduced ( H.R. 2965 ), modified, and after congressional passage, signed into law by President Obama as P.L. 111-321 on December 20, 2010, setting in motion the process for repealing Section 654, Title 10 United States Code and the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that was promulgated as a result of this law.

Gates, released a memorandum calling on DOD military and civilian leaders to deliver a plan for carrying out the repeal by February 4, 2011. This memorandum called for the creation of a Repeal Implementation Team (RIT) to develop plans for the repeal, update policies for publication following the repeal, train and prepare members of the force, and provide bi-weekly progress reports. (It is also noteworthy that the Pentagon would not keep statistics on gay service members.)", "The certification occurred on July 22, 2011. As a result, Section 654 and the DADT policy were repealed on September 20, 2011, 60 days after certification.", "According to reports, the Department of Defense decided on a three-tiered approach to implementing the repeal of DADT that focused on training and education of its personnel. Under this plan, tier one focused on those in senior leadership positions having to deal with the overall repeal process; this group includes military lawyers and chaplains. Tier two was for senior leadership who will oversee the education and training of troops in their commands.

Does DADT repeal apply to state National Guardsmen when not in federal service? What benefits are available to gay service members and their partners/dependents? Does the federal statute prohibiting the recognition of gay marriages create equal treatment issues? How will language in the Uniform Code of Military Justice, particularly the article prohibiting sodomy, be affected? Will a lack of federal language on the topic possibly allow administrative regulations prohibiting certain behaviors to be reinstated?

It is the duty of the President to execute the laws and to draft the means of implementing these laws. In the case of the repeal of Section 654, Congress is removing the statutory language prohibiting open homosexuality and allowing the Administration to implement the rules and regulations, subject to this oversight. (Congress did not add new language to federal statutes.)", "Prior to the adoption of Section 654 (and the DADT policy), there were no federal statutes banning gay individuals from serving openly in the military. Instead, the ban was contained in various military regulations. Repeal of Section 654 returns to a situation in which there are no federal statutes regarding open service by gays. In this environment, it could theoretically be possible for this or any future Administration to draft regulations that resemble the pre-1993 ban or any number of similar restrictions. Some have suggested that it is necessary for Congress to go beyond repealing Section 654 and put into place statutory language that prevents a return to restrictions on service based on sexuality. Others dismiss the possible return to a gay ban as unlikely, particularly given such a change would be vulnerable to legal challenges, and therefore claim that the need for such legislation is unnecessary. ", "Still others have noted that, lacking any prohibitions in law, it is possible for state governors to establish such rules for state National Guard members. Advocates for repeal of Section 654 suggested that Congress could go further in considering language that would prevent a governor from taking such actions. Concerns have also been expressed that such actions could potentially challenge or usurp a governor's authority when the National Guard is under state control."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Congress may also respond to the repeal by exercising its oversight duties. For example, it could hold hearings, as well as propose legislative changes to laws/policies affected by the repeal of Section 654.

", "However, the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act did not contain this language.", "Other steps Members of Congress have taken include the following: ", "During this repeal process, Representative Joe Wilson, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's Military Personnel Subcommittee, stated that he planned to hold hearings on the repeal declaring it \"'irresponsible' for Congress to repeal the ban on openly gay service without giving the House of Representatives time to hold hearings.\" To date, no hearings have been scheduled specifically on the topic of the repeal. On January 19, 2011, Representative Duncan Hunter introduced H.R. 337 , a bill that would amend P.L. 111-321 to expand the list of those needed to certify the repeal to include other members of the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS): the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. Supporters of H.R. 337 contend that it was important to have all military leaders in agreement and they have criticized relying on the certification of only three individuals who stated their support for repeal before the CRWG's work was underway. Opponents of H.R. 337 , and the earlier attempts to add similar language requiring the consent of the entire JCS viewed it as a \"poison pill\" given the hesitancy expressed by some JCS members during Senate Armed Services Committee hearings on DADT in December 2010. This bill was referred to the Committee on Armed Services without further action. According to a recent report, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Representative Buck McKeon, \"is seeking copies of the written assessments performed by each service about the impact of the policy change on recruiting, retention and readiness, which he believes could provide ammunition for an attempt to block the scheduled Sept. 20 date when the ban would lift once and for all.\" Again, it appears that this request has been overtaken by events with the repeal.", "With repeal of Section 654, Congress retains its oversight authority and may take other actions such as requesting reports or holding hearings with regard to the effects of repeal on military cohesion and effectiveness, disciplinary issues (such as any problems resulting from harassment or assault), and any regulatory changes that arise as a result of repeal, for example."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Benefits and Privileges", "paragraphs": ["A panoply of pay, benefits, and privileges are available to military personnel.

The federal government, therefore, does not recognize same-sex marriages for the purpose of extending benefits and privileges, although several states do.", "Certain DOD benefits, such as Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI), require the service member to designate a recipient in the event of his or her death. In other cases, such as the Death Gratuity, the service member may designate a beneficiary. If the service member does not designate a beneficiary, then the law stipulates the beneficiary from a list, beginning with the spouse. The services may use this list to pay the first eligible beneficiary. In the case of a same-sex marriage, the spouse would not be recognized as an eligible beneficiary under this method because federal law does not recognize such marriages. Nevertheless, the military same-sex partner could opt to designate a beneficiary under the Death Gratuity.", "Other benefits, such as military health care, travel, survivor benefits, and military housing, explicitly designate, in law, who is an eligible beneficiary. In addition, policies on compassionate re-assignment and former spouse protection laws, for example, would not apply to same-sex couples. As a result of the DOMA and the explicit definitions of eligible beneficiaries in service statutes, a member of the military who is in a same-sex marriage will not be afforded the full benefits available to heterosexual couples. ", "Other questions arise. For example, if a military same-sex couple adopts a child, arguably, the child would be eligible to attend DOD Dependent Schools. But the same-sex marriage would not be recognized in considerations for assignments, command-sponsored or otherwise. To go further, if the member dies in such a hypothetical case, the adopted child would be awarded the Death Gratuity ($100,000) unless the service member had explicitly designated the same-sex spouse as the beneficiary.
