When Congress passes a law, it may amend or repeal earlier enactments or it may create new law. Newly enacted laws are published chronologically, first as separate statutes in \"slip law\" form and later cumulatively in a series of volumes known as the Statutes at Large. Statutes are numbered by order of enactment either as public laws or, far less frequently, private laws, depending on their scope. Most statutes are incorporated into the United States Code. The United States Code and its commercial counterparts arrange federal statutes, that are of a general and permanent nature, by subject into titles. As the statutes that underlie the Code are revised, superseded, or repealed, the provisions of the Code are updated to reflect these changes.", "Statutes and the United States Code can be found on the Internet. In addition, the slip law versions of public laws are available in official print form from the Government Printing Office. Federal Depository Libraries (e.g., university and state libraries) provide slip laws in print and/or microfiche format. The Statutes at Large series often is available at large libraries. The United States Code and its commercial counterparts are usually available at local libraries.", "Many statutes (for example, the Social Security Act and the Clean Air Act) are published and updated both in the public law, as amended, version and in the United States Code. For some titles the public law, as amended, is the authoritative version of the statute and not the Code.

L. 112-10). Private laws are enacted for the benefit of a named individual or entity (e.g., due to exceptional individual circumstances, Congress enacts a law providing a government reimbursement to a named person who would not otherwise be eligible under general law).

This law generally consolidated and amended federal statutory law on the admission and stay of aliens in the United States and how they may become citizens. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 was codified at Title 8 of the U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71 et seq. In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-603 , 100 Stat. 3359). Section 101 of this act amended Section 274 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (codified at 8 U.S.C \u00a71324) by adding Section 274a (codified at 8 USC \u00a71324a). This new section (Section 274a) made it unlawful for a person to hire for employment in the United States an illegal alien. In 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-208 , Division C, 110 Stat. 3009). Section 412 of the 1996 act amended the employer sanctions process by requiring an employer to verify that a new employee is not an illegal alien. As with the 1986 act, the 1996 act expressly amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (Section 274A in this case) and Section 1324a in Title 8 of the U.S.C.

On the \"Titles of United States Code \" page of the Code an asterisk appears next to some of the titles. The asterisks refer to a note that states: \"This title has been enacted as positive law.\" If the title is asterisked, the Code provides the authoritative version of the public law, as amended. For example, there is no asterisk beside Title 42 of the U.S.C . Thus, the provisions codified in Title 42 are not authoritative. Should there be a discrepancy, a court will accept the language in the Statutes at Large as the authoritative source and not the Code . It should be noted that there is no substantive difference between the language of the public law as published in the Statutes at Large and that of the Code .", "It is often difficult to find current, updated versions of frequently amended public laws.
