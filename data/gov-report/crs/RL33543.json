Substantial cost increases, schedule delays, and changes in requirements have significantly reduced procurement quantities of new aircraft. For example, since its start, the development period for the F-22A doubled, threat conditions changed, new ground attack and intelligence-gathering requirements were added, and its unit costs more than doubled, resulting in a steady decline in the number of aircraft the Air Force can now procure. Similar conditions and risk of poor outcomes seem to be emerging for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF). The JSF is the linchpin for future modernization efforts because of its sheer size and plans to replace hundreds of operational systems in all three services. However, its development costs have increased by $31.6 billion since 2004, and procurement and delivery schedules are slipping.", "Funding needs and plans for new and legacy aircraft are by nature interdependent. Legacy systems must be sustained and kept operationally relevant until new systems complete development and are ready to replace them. If quantities of new aircraft are reduced and/or deliveries slip further into future years, significantly more as yet unplanned money will be required to sustain, modernize, and extend the life of legacy systems to ensure that the total force is both capable and sufficient in numbers. Uncertainty about new systems costs and deliveries makes it challenging to effectively plan and efficiently implement modernization efforts and legacy retirement schedules. Over the next seven years, the services are investing an average of about $1.7 billion per year on legacy modifications, but there are large pent up demands\u2014billions more\u2014for unfunded requirements and potential life extension programs identified by program officials. Officials said the time is approaching when hard decisions on retiring or extending the life of legacy aircraft must be made.", "Looking forward, DOD does not have a single, comprehensive, and integrated investment plan for recapitalizing and modernizing fighter and attack aircraft. Lacking an integrated DOD-wide view of requirements, it is difficult to determine the extent of capability gaps and shortfalls, or, alternatively, duplication of capability. Rather, each military service operates largely within its own stovepipe to plan and acquire the resources needed to fill its individual force structure construct. In the Air Force's case, it is the forces deemed necessary to fill its air and space expeditionary wings; for the Navy, its carrier strike forces; and for the Marines, its expeditionary forces. Collectively, the services have underperformed to date in terms of delivering aircraft within desired costs and quantities, and future plans are likely unaffordable within projected funding levels. Individual service plans are largely dependent on favorable assumptions about the cost, quantity, and delivery schedules for new acquisitions and the ability to increase and sustain future funding levels substantially above current levels. These favorable assumptions are not realistic when juxtaposed with projected decline in future federal discretionary spending (including defense investment accounts), continued operational support requirements for the global war on terror, and looming start-ups of other big-ticket defense items, such as a strategic tanker aircraft and next generation long-range strike systems, competing for the same funds.

Force structures that replaced some fighters with smaller numbers of attack aircraft could provide air-to-ground weapons capacities comparable to those of today's forces and be fielded at costs similar to those projected for DoD's plans.

The additional aircraft scheduled for retirement are 112 F-15s, 134 F-15s and 3 A-10s. The committee notes that such actions could lead to serious gaps in force structure and capability since these actions are being taken while replacement aircraft are still being tested and are not yet available for fielding.

The committee believes that such a shortfall will adversely affect the ability of the active duty forces and air reserve forces to meet future requirements for both air expeditionary forces and for the air sovereignty alert mission in the United States.", "Accordingly, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation with the Chief of the Air National Guard and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve, to provide a report to the congressional defense committees by March 1, 2010. The report should include statements from both the Chief of the Air National Guard and the Chief of the Air Force Reserve describing their separate and independent views to Congress, as applicable. The report should address the so-called ''fighter gap'' issue in the long- and short-term with alternative solutions including but not limited to: accelerated procurement of fifth generation fighters such as the F-22 and F-35; an interim procurement of so-called ''4.5 generation'' fighters; and fleet management options such as service life extension programs. The report must include a detailed analysis of the effect that any shortfalls will have on the Air National Guard and the air sovereignty alert mission specifically, including the loss of Air National Guard flying missions throughout the United States and the resultant loss of Air National Guard pilot and maintenance capability. (Page 101)", "The report states the following regarding the projected Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall:", "The committee is concerned regarding the current and forecasted strike-fighter aircraft inventory of the Department of the Navy. The committee understands that the Department of the Navy has a fiscal year 2009 strike-fighter inventory shortfall of 110 aircraft and predicts a fiscal year 2010 shortfall of 152 aircraft, with a potential peak strike-fighter shortfall of 312 aircraft by fiscal year 2018. The committee believes such drastic shortfalls in strike fighter-inventory are unacceptable.", "The committee understands that a variety of factors cause the current and projected strike-fighter shortfall. Those factors include a fiscal year 2002 decision to reduce F/A-18A through D inventory by 88 aircraft, a reduction in the program of record quantity for F-35B/C by 409 aircraft, delays in development of the F-35B/C program, and F/A 18A through D aircraft reaching forecasted service life sooner than expected.", "The committee remains unconvinced that naval strike-fighter shortfalls should be viewed against the totality of Department of Defense strike-fighter inventory. The capabilities of the naval strike-fighter force are inherent in the capability of the aircraft carrier as a strike platform and, as such, force structure requirements for naval aviation must be viewed as those required to support sufficient carrier air wings (CVW) to match the number of statutorily mandated aircraft carriers.", "The committee supports procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft to mitigate the naval strike-fighter inventory shortfall and believes that procurement of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft through a multi-year procurement contract is more cost effective and prudent than procuring new aircraft through an annual contract or applying $25.6 million of additional fiscal resources per aircraft to extend the service life of the F/A-18A through D fleet. Therefore, the committee includes a provision in title I of this Act that would authorize the Secretary of the Navy to enter into a multi-year procurement contract for the purchase of additional F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft and also includes a provision in title X of this Act [Section 1051] that expresses a sense of Congress that the Department of the Navy should maintain no less than ten carrier air wings with no less than 44 strike-fighters each. Additionally, the committee directs the Director of the Congressional Budget Office to submit a report to the congressional defense committees by February 2, 2010, that evaluates the operational effectiveness and costs of extending and modernizing the service-life of F/A-18A through D aircraft to 10,000 flight hours versus procuring, either through an annual or multi-year procurement contract, additional F/A-18E/F aircraft beyond the current program of record.

The committee raised this issue in the committee reports accompanying S. 1547 ( S.Rept. 110-77 ) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 and accompanying S. 3001 ( S.Rept. 110-335 ) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. The committee is disappointed that the Navy has failed to provide the report comparing single versus multiyear procurement costs mandated by the second of those committee reports.", "Last year, the committee received testimony from the Navy of a projected shortfall in Navy tactical aviation. The Navy indicated that, under assumptions current at that time, it would experience a shortfall of 69 tactical aircraft in the year 2017, a number that swells to 125 when requirements of the United States Marine Corps are included. The committee believes that the Navy's projection of this shortfall was, however, based on a series of questionable assumptions.", "This year, the Chief of Naval Operations said that the projected gap may be as high as 250 aircraft total for the Department of the Navy. The committee believes that the Navy has failed to present a budget in fiscal year 2010 that takes effective action to deal with this substantially increased projected shortfall in the Department of the Navy's tactical air fleet and is concerned about the potential risk such a shortfall could pose to national security. The committee also notes that this shortfall figure is still predicated on an initial operation capability of the F\u201335C in 2015 but that achieving this is considered optimistic by many observers. The Navy's delay in taking action causes concern that it: (1) is continuing to accept the substantial security risks associated with the projected shortfall; (2) remains overly reliant on a potentially costly service life extension program (SLEP) for legacy F/A-18s as a means to mitigate the gap until the Joint Strike Fighter achieves full operational capability; and (3) is not adequately considering realistic, fiscally responsible long-range procurement plans to address the carrier strike aircraft shortfall, such as a multiyear procurement of F/A-18E/F aircraft as opposed to a series of single year purchases.", "The committee is concerned that, in response to possible further delays, expanding costs and technological immaturity with the JSF, the Navy appears increasingly reliant on its proposal to extend the life of select legacy F/A-18's from 8,600 to 10,000 flight hours through a SLEP currently estimated to cost on average $26.0 million per plane. This life extension would be in addition to the 2,600-hour service life extension that the Navy already plans for most legacy F/A-18s. By the Navy's own testimony, it is unclear how many of the planes are capable of reaching 10,000 flight hours even with a SLEP. The committee is concerned that the cost uncertainties of a SLEP achieving an additional 1,400 flight hours make such a plan risky. In any case, the committee believes such SLEP may be inefficient when compared with the benefits of procuring new F/A\u201318E/F's, which might cost less than $50.0 million each in 2009 constant dollars under a multiyear procurement acquisition strategy. Normalizing costs for the expected return in additional service life, a SLEP to achieve the additional 1,400 hours would cost approximately $18,571 per flight hour gained, versus $8,333 per flight hour provided by a new F/A\u201318E/F (at a 6,000 flight hour life, the cost per flight hour of a new F/A-18E/F would fall even further to $5,814 if those planes are similarly extended to 8,600 flight hours as have legacy F/A-18s). In light of such costs, the committee believes the Navy must more carefully evaluate costs and benefits of new F/A\u201318E/F procurements, compared to investing in a SLEP of legacy aircraft.", "The committee further notes that new F/A-18E/F models come equipped with improved technological capabilities over the legacy F/A-18's, including active electronically scanned array radar, modernized avionics, advanced aerial refueling system capability, and added weapon hard points, among other features that would not be part of a SLEP upgrade package for the older aircraft. These factors would tend to increase the benefit of purchasing new F/A-18E/Fs compared to conducting a SLEP on legacy aircraft. The Navy projects that the F/A-18E/F will remain in the fleet until at least 2040, and should be able to use most or all of the full service life of any newly purchased aircraft.", "The committee understands that the Department of Defense intends to review the whole issue of tactical aircraft forces in the pending Quadrennial Defense Review. The committee expects the Department to conduct and submit the analysis of multiyear procurement for the F/A-18 as directed in the committee report last year to include cost differentials between single year and multiyear procurement strategies and tradeoffs between a SLEP and new procurements of the F/A-18E/F. The Department should include such information derived from that analysis in deciding how to implement the results on the ongoing Quadrennial Defense Review regarding tactical aviation.", "The committee expects that the Department's tactical aviation procurement strategies will be informed by the Quadrennial Defense Review. In light of the significant increase in the strike-fighter shortfall testified to before the committee this year, additional actions to address that shortfall cannot be delayed too long.

The Committee directs that the reports stipulated in the House-passed version of the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Authorization Act also be transmitted to the Defense Appropriations Committees. Particularly given these outstanding reports and the expected publication of the Quadrennial Defense Review in the coming year, the Committee is concerned that full implementation of the restructure may be premature.", "Additionally, the Committee is concerned with the personnel costs and potential acquisition costs associated with the Air Force proposal to remove the training of F\u201315 pilots and related personnel from Tyndall Air Force Base. The Committee directs the Department to provide a cost benefit analysis of this proposal regarding Tyndall Air Force Base and Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act.

The report shall include analysis on simulator and ancillary training access, expected effect on the quality and experience of the instructor base, future military construction requirements and special considerations and costs required due to the differing training environments and climatology at each base.", "Moreover, the Committee requests that the Department identify airfields that share runways for both Air Force and commercial operations within the continental United States. The Committee requests that the Department include air force policy on and analysis of the training and operational mission impacts at bases with shared runways.", "Additionally, the Committee directs an independent review by a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) on the impact of the restructure on the Nation's combat air forces.", "The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide the described reports no sooner than 180 days after enactment of this Act. The Committee further directs that no funds may be obligated on executing the Combat Air Force restructure until 180 days after submission to the congressional defense committees of all directed reports. (Pages 62-63)", "The report states the following regarding the project Navy-Marine Corps strike fighter shortfall:", "STRIKE FIGHTER SHORTFALL", "Sustained, continued operations in overseas contingencies have resulted in the Department of the Navy's tactical aircraft fleet (primarily the F\u201318 variant aircraft) being flown at an extremely high operational tempo. This has caused the aircraft to age at a faster rate than the Navy had planned when determining the introduction of the follow on aircraft, the F\u201335 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. The net result of these sustained operations is that the Navy is forecasting critical shortfalls in its strike fighter inventory. Delays in the introduction of the F\u201335 from the original forecast have exacerbated this shortfall. Last year, the Department of the Navy predicted that the shortfall would peak at 125 aircraft in fiscal year 2017. Although the Department of the Navy has not provided an updated shortfall prediction with the submission of this year's budget, the Committee understands it is now over 200 aircraft. This is due to the fact that a key assumption in last year's prediction, the life extension of the older variant F\u201318 aircraft, is proving to be more problematic than anticipated. Additionally, the Navy has reduced the number of F\u201318 aircraft being purchased in fiscal year 2010 from what was predicted last year. This reduction is confusing, since it moves the tactical aircraft inventory in the exact opposite direction one would expect when faced with a shortage of aircraft.", "Fortunately for the Navy, the production line for the F/A\u201318E/F variant aircraft is still open and producing aircraft. For the last ten years this program has produced cost effective aircraft under the umbrella of a multi-year procurement strategy, however the fiscal year 2010 aircraft are being purchased as a standalone, annually priced procurement. The unit price difference between an annual procurement and a multi-year procurement is substantial. Since the F\u201335 will not begin to deliver in significant quantities for several years, the Committee believes the Navy is letting a golden opportunity slip away by not entering into another multi-year procurement for F/A\u201318E/F aircraft. In addition to mitigating the strike fighter shortfall, the Navy would achieve significant savings by purchasing aircraft under a multi-year procurement. Therefore, the recommendation provides $108,000,000 above the request for the procurement of long lead equipment in an economic order quantity and cost reduction initiatives for a five year, 150 aircraft multi-year procurement for the F/A\u201318E/F and EA\u201318G programs. Additionally, in an attempt to further mitigate the strike fighter shortfall, the recommendation provides $495,000,000 for the procurement of an additional nine F/A\u201318E/F Aircraft.

The shortfall is currently estimated to be at least 129 aircraft; it could be well above that level if it extending the life of the F/A\u201318 out to 10,000 hours is cost prohibitive. To ensure that Navy has sufficient aircraft for the fleet, the Committee provides an increase of $512,280,000 to procure an additional nine 9 F/A\u201318s in fiscal year 2010. The Committee again encourages the Navy to pursue a multi-year procurement contract for these aircraft.
