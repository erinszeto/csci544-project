What is a Department of Defense Form 1391 (DD 1391)?", "Department of Defense Form 1391 (also known as DD 1391) is a form that originates at the installation level and is used by DOD as a programming document to request construction funding from Congress. The form is used to explain each proposed construction project individually and includes a cost estimate, description of proposed construction, requirement, current situation, impact on operations if the project is not approved, and any useful supplemental data. Appendix C presents an example of a completed DD 1391.", "3. What is \"planning and design\" funding?", "The execution of any authorized construction project proceeds through several steps. These are intended to identify any issues and provide conceptual design including cost estimates for construction (e.g., site preparation, facility and supporting structure design, and sequencing of construction) and designing the anticipated facility and each of the roads, ramps, utilities, and the like needed for its operation. These activities may be broken out by function, with planning handled primarily by civil engineers and design handled primarily by architects. By funding planning and design through a separate, nonspecific appropriation, the scope and costs of projects may be accurately estimated before funds for individual construction projects are requested.", "4. How long are funds available for projects?", "Prior to FY2018, Congress would provide the authorization of appropriation of military construction and allow for the obligation of such funding for up to three years. However, appropriations provided for military construction are typically available for obligation for up to five years. The FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 115-91 ) moved to align the period of authorization with the period of appropriations, providing authorization of FY2018 projects and appropriations through 2022, and extending authorizations provided in FY2016 and FY2017 accordingly.

Why does a military construction project need an authorization and a separate appropriation for each construction project?", "Section 114, of Title 10, United States Code, specifies, in part, that \"No funds may be appropriated for any fiscal year to or for the use of any armed force or obligated or expended for ... military construction ... unless funds therefore have been specifically authorized by law.\" The section goes on to define military construction as \"... any construction, development, conversion, or extension of any kind which is carried out with respect to any military facility or installation ....\" Additionally, 10 U.S.C. \u00a72802 specifies that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments may carry out such military construction projects, land acquisitions, and defense access road projects \"as are authorized by law.\" ", "In practical application of these statutes, Congress has required project-by-project authorization and appropriation for military construction projects.", "6. When the committee supports a requested military construction project, why is the amount of the project that is disclosed in the new budget authority sometimes greater than the actual project cost?", "New budget authority requested before construction begins is an estimate of project cost while the actual cost calculated at completion represents the actual expenditure. In March 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) raised concerns that DOD guidance describing the process of developing construction cost estimates does not fully incorporate all the steps needed to develop high-quality, reliable cost estimates. DOD partially concurred with the GAO recommendation, agreeing that DOD cost estimating guidance \"lacks specificity\" in several areas. As a result, DOD intends to revise its cost estimating guidance in FY2019.", "After Congress authorizes and appropriates for the project, the budget authority may only be used for specific facilities listed on the associated DD 1391. In cases where the budget authority exceeds the actual cost of the project, the congressional appropriators may rescind the remaining budget authority, or approve the reprogramming of remaining unobligated budget authority to be applied to other military construction projects if requested. Should actual costs exceed the project's allocated budget authority, additional costs may be covered through reprogramming or additional appropriations.", "7. What are the \"McCain Rules\"?", "The McCain R ules are criteria that were incorporated into the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 ( P.L. 103-337 , Section 2856) as a sense of the Senate:", "Appropriations for any military construction project not included in the DOD annual budget request should be considered for authorization only if the project is\u2013", "1.essential to the DOD's national security mission,", "2. not inconsistent with past actions with the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC),", "3. in the services' Future Years Defense Program,", "4. executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated, and", "5. offset by reductions in other defense accounts, through advice from the Secretary of Defense.", "The McCain Rules were used as guidance for congressional consideration of Member requests (i.e., earmarks) for military construction projects.

", "8. What is the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)?", "The Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) is an annually compiled catalogue that summarizes the forces, resources, and programs associated with DOD operations. Formally approved by the Secretary of Defense, the FYDP projects DOD funding, manpower, and force structure needs over a five-year period. The FYDP is typically completed during the programming phase of the Planning, Programing, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process, and is generally updated during the budgeting phase to reflect DOD's final funding decisions presented in the annual President's budget request.", "During the programming and budgeting phase, the highest-priority construction projects that will fit within the budgetary guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will be included in the President's request. The approved projects assigned a lower priority are slated for funding in future years and are generally included in the FYDP. The FYDP is generally submitted to the congressional committees with jurisdiction over defense matters. Note that while the data structure of the FYDP is unclassified, the actual FYDP data are classified. ", "9. Why does a military construction project, listed in the FYDP, never seem to move to the front of the line and be included in the President's budget request?", "Individual projects are prioritized by their relevance to military operations, training, quality of life, environmental requirements, etc. A newly identified requirement may be assessed as having a higher priority than projects already in the planning process. Therefore, some construction, while worthy, may be deferred to later years.", "Appendix B. Selected Statutes Governing Military Construction and Repair Authorities", "Appendix C.
