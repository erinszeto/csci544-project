U-2 detachments can deploy to other operatinglocations if necessary. ", "Intended to overfly the vast expanses of the Soviet Union at a time when there were no satellites, the U-2 was designed to fly at very high altitudes to avoid detection and attack. (6) Beginningin the 1980s an updated version of the U-2 began to replace the earlier models. (7) From 1994 to 1999,U-2R aircraft were upgraded with the General Electric F-118-10 engine, which burns less fuel,reduces weight and increases power. The upgraded aircraft were re-designated as a U-2S/ST. TheAir Force expects this airframe and engine combination to last until 2050. (9)", "The U-2 can carry a variety of sensors and cameras depending on its assigned mission. It is capable of collecting multi-sensor photo, electro-optic, infrared and radar imagery, as well asperforming other types of reconnaissance functions such as SIGINT collection. Photographicsensors include the HR-329 high resolution camera and the Optical Bar camera. Electro-opticsystems include the Intelligence Reconnaissance Imagery System III, and the Senior YearElectro-Optical Reconnaissance System (SYERS), which also collects information in the infra red(IR) wavelength. These systems vary in resolution and aperture, but when combined, can captureimages of territory on the order of 33 x 21 nautical miles. (10) The Advanced Synthetic Aperture RadarSystem (ASARS) gives the U-2 real-time, high resolution -- although not as high as EO systems-- capability at night and in bad weather (when the EO systems cannot function effectively) with animproved capability to detect moving targets. (11)", "The U-2's Senior Glass SIGINT capability is composed of the Senior Ruby electronic intelligence (ELINT) sensor and the Senior Spear communications intelligence (COMINT) sensor. These systems can acquire signals and telemetry at 300 nautical miles, downlink data to groundstations 300 nautical miles away, giving the U-2 a real-time \"reach of 600 nautical miles (690 statutemiles, 1,110 km). The Senior Span pod, which is attached to the top of the fuselage allows the U-2to transmit SIGINT data via satellites to global ranges.\" (12) The Senior Spur pod, performs the samefunction for ASARS data. (13)", "The U-2 is notoriously difficult to fly. Pilots called the U-2 \"Dragon Lady\" because of its unforgiving handling characteristics at altitude. (14) Landing the U-2 is a complex ballet that oftenentails intentionally stalling the aircraft, employing runway \"chase cars,\"and oftentimes deliberatelydragging the plane's wingtip down the runway. ", "A major challenge for the Air Force is maintaining an adequate supply of U-2 pilots. U-2 pilots face physical rigors that are unique in the aviation world. Flying at extreme altitudes, pilots mustwear pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts. The pilots have to engage in special trainingand pre-flight preparations (e.g., special diets and inhaling 100% oxygen 1 hour prior to take-off)to help ward off the profuse sweating, fatigue and dizziness caused by 10 hour missions. There areonly some 50 pilots currently qualified to fly U-2s and they have to spend significantly higherpercentages of their tours of duty on temporary flying assignments than other Air Force officers. Some observers believe that extended deployments and the dangers and hardships involved in flyingU-2s may contribute to significant retention problems that could affect overall capabilities. TheGeneral Accounting Office (GAO) concluded that \"It is difficult to find pilots with the aptituderequired to master the difficult handling characteristics of the U-2.\" (15) The Air Force has, however,taken steps to reduce the average temporary additional duty (TAD) rates of U-2 pilots to bring theminto line with other pilots.

Information acquired from the U-2 was ofimportance to the U.S. Intelligence Community's ability to provide adequate assessments of Sovietstrategic forces, but the utility of the platform for this purpose was virtually destroyed by thediplomatic embarrassment following the shoot down of a U-2 in May 1960 and the public trial ofits pilot, Francis Gary Powers. Beginning in the 1960s this mission was taken over by surveillancesatellites that presented no danger of captured pilots. U-2s were not especially valuable in Vietnamwhere photography of triple-canopy jungle often provided little useful intelligence on troopmovements along the Ho Chi Minh Trail underneath. It was not until Desert Storm in 1991 thatU-2s demonstrated their value as the platform that could provide the near-real-time intelligence thatallows military commanders to place bombs on the exact targets intended. The greater use of theU-2 derived from improvements in surveillance and communications technologies as well as themuch greater availability of precision guided munitions that benefit from U-2-derived data. ", "Desert Storm saw the largest U-2 operation in history with nine aircraft and thirty pilots flying some five sorties a day. Primary missions were Iraqi Army field positions, bomb damage assessment(BDA), and searching for SCUD missile launching sites. Photography and other data collected fromU-2s was for the first time rapidly available to tactical commanders. Inevitably, there werearguments about collection priorities, and, especially, demands by operational commanders for largervolumes of photographic coverage (especially wide-area coverage) even though some intelligenceofficials believed that electro-optic and radar collection was a better use of assets. There weredifficulties with developing photography in-theater and with disseminating hard copies. Nonetheless, according to one estimate, U-2s provided 30% of total intelligence, 50% of imageryintelligence, and 90% of all Army targeting intelligence for the entire theater. (17)", "Military operations over the former Yugoslavia in the mid-1990s saw continued reliance on the U-2 by military commanders. Balkan missions were initially related to gathering information ontreaty verification, troop dispositions, and missile sites. During the NATO attack on Serbian forcesin the spring of 1999, known as Operation Allied Force, U-2s were used to identify Serbian targetsand to conduct BDA to determine the accuracy of Allied strikes. Data collected by an airborne U-2was transmitted back to Beale Air Force Base in California for analysis (18) and then sent back tooperations centers and thence to aircraft which could attack the target. Admiral Daniel Murphy,Commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet during Allied Force, recalled having satellite positioning dataon key Serbian early warning radars.", "But that was insufficient for targeting a Tomahawk missile, which was the weapon that we intended to employ. So I walked into the intelligence centerand sitting there was a 22-year-old intelligence specialist who was talking to Beale Air Force Basevia secure telephone and Beale Air Force Base was driving a U-2 over the top of this spot. The U-2snapped the picture, fed it back to Beale Air Force base where that young sergeant to my young pettyofficer said, we have got it, we have confirmation. I called Admiral Ellis [Commander, AlliedForces Southern Europe], he called General Clark [Supreme Allied Commander, Europe], and about15 minutes later we had three Tomahawk missiles en route and we destroyed those threeradars. (19)", "Another senior Air Force general wrote after the Kosovo campaign, \"We never dropped a bomb on a target without having a U-2 take a look at it.\" (20)", "To meet requirements for Allied Force, U-2 pilots and support personnel were transferred from other theaters. As one senior Air Force commander noted, U-2s were \"stretched to the limit duringAllied Force.\" (21) Observers suggest that if the AirForce were required to conduct operations on ascale larger than Allied Force, limits on U-2 availability would have to be faced and could constrainthe effectiveness of precision bombing campaigns.", "In addition to missions in the Balkans, U-2s continue to fly collection missions over Iraq and the Korean peninsula. In those regions they supplement collection by satellite and other systems andare intended to provide early warning of attacks. Their chief defense is their ability to operate ataltitudes above 70,000 feet, far higher than most military aircraft and out of the range of most SAMs. U-2s are not, however, by any means invulnerable. Besides the celebrated shootdown of the planecarrying Gary Powers, a number of other U-2s were lost flying classified missions over the Asianmainland in the 1960s and 1970s. In the current environment, U-2s can in many cases collectrequired information by remaining in international airspace. U-2 overflights of Iraqi territory,however, have raised concerns about their vulnerability. Fighter escorts have been assigned to coverthem and stiff warnings have been delivered to Bagdad, threatening dire consequences should effortsbe made to attack U-2 missions. The availabiliy of SAMs to various governments that can reachusual U-2 flying altitude represents a standing threat that air force planners must take intoconsideration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RQ-4A Global Hawk", "paragraphs": ["The RQ-4A Global Hawk is a high altitude, long endurance, long range un-piloted aerial vehicle designed to perform many of the same functions as the U-2.

The LRE needs to be deployed to the GlobalHawk's operating base, but the MCEs could theoretically be based anywhere. It takes two C-17Globemaster aircraft to deploy the two ground elements. The Global Hawk, as evidenced by a recentflight from the United States to Portugal, can self deploy.", "As currently designed, the Global Hawk can carry electro-optical, IR, and synthetic aperture radar sensors. It is not designed to carry SIGINT sensors. While the Global Hawk's EO and IRcapabilities are on-par with the U-2s, its SAR capabilities are not. Due to greater power and a largerantenna, the U-2 can more effectively use its SAR to detect moving targets than can the GlobalHawk. If used to find static targets however, the U-2 and Global Hawk SAR capabilities are morecomparable.", "DOD's current plan is to manufacture twelve Global Hawk air vehicles between FY2003 and FY2009. These UAVs would carry the EO/IR/SAR sensor payload, and are described by the AirForce as a complement to the U-2. In FY2009, the Air Force wants to produce four of the nextgeneration Global Hawks, which could carry SIGINT sensors, instead of either the EO/IR or theSAR payload.

On a one-to-one basis, a comparison of these characteristics is important for policymakers to consider when making decisions on the overall size and composition of the U.S. airborneISR force structure. There are significant similarities. The platforms are of similar physicaldimension. They fly at approximately the same altitude and at similar speeds. Yet, there areimportant differences between the platforms that stand out when comparing the U-2 and GlobalHawk on a platform-to-platform basis. These differences include (1) pilot requirements, (2) rangeand endurance, and (3) mission payload.", "The first difference between the platforms is the Global Hawk's lack of a pilot. While not putting a pilot in danger appears obviously beneficial, there are a number of associated issues thatmerit discussion. One potential downside to being pilotless is that the platform is not as responsiveto changing circumstances as a piloted aircraft. Remotely located mission control personnel cannot,in theory, make decisions and take action as quickly as a pilot on the scene. However, during amission, U-2 pilots infrequently take action based on what they personally observe from the cockpit. Rather, they typically make adjustments to their pre-planned mission profile based on warnings andorders from mission control elements. Thus, unmanned aircraft may not suffer from a lack ofresponsiveness in the high altitude ISR mission as they would if performing other missions. ", "The lack of a pilot may be more of a hindrance when flying through civil-controlled U.S. and foreign-country airspace than it is when overflying a combat area. Civil authorities are concernedthat in the event of an unforeseen emergency, such as an engine burnout, or malfunction, a pilotlessaircraft would be less able to take corrective action, such as making a controlled landing at a localairfield. Instead, they fear that a pilotless aircraft would be more likely to crash into inhabited areas.Therefore, civil authorities currently impose very demanding mission planning requirements onunmanned systems; if they allow them to overfly at all. This exhaustive mission planning takes time,manpower and money.", "Finally, the Global Hawk's lack of a pilot doesn't necessarily confer increased operational utility. The Global Hawk's size, flight profile and lack of stealth features suggest it is approximatelyas survivable as the U-2. It will likely be employed as the U-2 is: outside of high threatenvironments such as long-range SAMs. At approximately $50 million each, the Global Hawk istoo expensive to be considered expendable.", "The second difference between the Global Hawk and U-2 that bears discussion is that of range and endurance. The Global Hawk has superior range and endurance to the U-2. Global Hawk canfly approximately twice as far as the U-2, and its loiter time is three times that of the U-2. Thissuggests important ramifications for the number of platforms required in the overall ISR inventory.All other things being equal, fewer platforms with long endurance can do the same job as moreplatforms with less endurance.", "The third noteworthy difference between the platforms is payload. The U-2 enjoys an advantage in payload over the Global Hawk of more than two-to one. This allows it to carry more and differentpayloads. A larger payload capability also provides more potential for unforseen upgrades andtradeoffs. Generically speaking, a larger volume on an aircraft presents engineers with more choicesand opportunities than a smaller volume. Additionally, the U-2's large engine provides moreelectrical power than the Global Hawk's, which in turn increases the capabilities of some of itssensor payloads. All things being equal, fewer platforms with more sensors can do the same job asmore platforms with fewer sensors. ", " Table 2.

A formal decision to retire the U-2 early to free up funds foradditional UAVs will likely be given close scrutiny by Congress and the public.", "Advocates of the proposal note that Global Hawks have performed well in tests. They argue that the Global Hawk's long endurance gives it the ability to perform the U-2's imagery collectionmissions with fewer platforms. Furthermore, future upgrades and reconfigurations will give GlobalHawk the U-2's SIGINT collection capability. To lay the groundwork for future airborne surveillancecapabilities, it is reasonable, according to this view, to retire the U-2s beginning in 2006 rather thangradually phasing them out by attrition and make instead the investment in the next generation ofairborne reconnaissance platforms.", "Air Force options on Global Hawks and U-2s appear to be based on the assumption that funding must be adjusted within overall limits on spending for ISR programs. Apparently an earlytermination of the U-2 effort is the most acceptable way for the Air Force to identify funding for atrade-off to fund accelerated acquisition of the Global Hawk within its budgetary constraints. Someobservers suggest that Air Force officials may anticipate that, at some point, funding might beidentified elsewhere within the defense budget or that Congress might provide funding specificallyfor additional Global Hawks. One report noted, \"some service sources say it is unlikely the AirForce will be able to come up with the money without significant help from OSD [Office of theSecretary of Defense] or Congress.\" (37)", "Opponents of the proposal believe that the two systems should operate simultaneously. They argue that, considering the very high demand for today's innumerous airborne ISR assets, it isessential that the Air Force increase today's ISR capabilities, not just replace them on a one-to-onebasis. Opponents of Secretary Peters's proposal also argue that the U-2 should not be phased outuntil the Global Hawk is produced and employed in large numbers, and its operational capabilitiesand limitations are well understood. This, they say, would ensure a smooth transition from today'sISR fleet to tomorrow's, and would ensure that the replacement of U-2s does not result in a loss ofan essential capability. ", "Opponents also argue that decommissioning all U-2s which, as a result of extensive investment in upgrades have an expected service life of up to 50 more years, would be wasteful of an importantcapability. They note that whereas fewer UAVs than U-2s might be needed for the same missionif they were identically equipped, the actual number of Global Hawks required might vary since theycannot (at least at present) carry the same set of collection systems as the U-2. Furthermore, theycontend, it is unclear when Air Force scientists will be able to overcome the technologicalimpediments that currently limit the Global Hawk's payload.", "There may be other options that could be pursued to maintain or improve DOD's aerial ISR capability until the Global Hawk is optimally configured, and produced in sufficient quantities, toreplace the U-2. These options include (1) increasing the number of operational U-2s; (2) moreeffectively managing the existing U-2 inventory; (3) attracting and retaining more U-2 pilots; or (4)returning the SR-71 aircraft to active service.", "There are currently 31 operational U-2s with another four used as trainers. At any one time, three of the 31 operational U-2s are in depot for maintenance. Since it takes five U-2s to maintaina 24 hour orbit (38) , these 28 U-2s can theoreticallyoperate in five to six different spots on the globeat the same time. Given the limited inventory of U-2s, a key concern is the foreseeable loss ofaircraft through accidents and attrition. In recent years, one U-2 has been lost through attrition everytwo years. If this rate persists, by 2008 the Air Force would only have enough U-2s to provide 24hour coverage of four to five different spots at any one time.", "Some urge the procurement of additional U-2s by reopening the production line. This idea has received some congressional attention. (39) Someobservers believe that this may be a cost-effectiveway to make additional platforms available in a relatively short period of time. The technology iswell-proven under operational conditions and acquiring new platforms would not require longlead-times for research and development and costs would be relatively manageable.", "Others argue that such a step would be counterproductive in that the Air Force would have a fleet of U-2s of varying ages which would present maintenance problems at some point.Furthermore, they suggest that the U-2 is representative of decades-old technology and is difficultto fly. Also, the U-2 production line has lain fallow for approximately 20 years. Is re-opening thisline feasible? If so, at what cost? Another key consideration is manning; the U-2 requires speciallytrained pilots whose employability in other Air Force positions becomes limited. Most importantly,it places pilots at risk of death or capture. Proponents of re-opening the U-2 line counter, however,that it should be possible to manufacture future U-2s that don't require a pilot. The additional costsof re-designing the U-2 to fly without a pilot are unclear, but advances and technologies developedunder the Global Hawk and other UAV programs could probably be exploited.", "Another important action that could be taken to relieve the high operational tempo felt by the U-2 force would be to attract more pilots to the program and better retain the ones already qualifiedto fly the Dragon Lady . U-2 proponents suggest that Congress may wish to enquire about steps theAir Force has or has not undertaken to attract more pilots into the U-2 program. What, for example,would be the impact on overall recruitment and retention if the Air Force were to dictate that agreater percentage of its pilots enter the U-2 program?", "Options may also exist to more effectively manage DOD's current U-2 inventory. For instance, only four U-2 training aircraft exist. This lack of trainers could slow the pace of preparing new U-2pilots for their missions. It is feasible that two-seat training aircraft could be used to fly operationalmissions if required, though with diminished capabilities. However, the 31 single-seat aircraft usedto fly operations can't be used to train new pilots. Therefore, the reduction in ISR capability causedby converting a handful of single-seat U-2s to two-seat trainers may be outweighed by theimprovement in training capabilities.", "Another inventory management issue that might be examined is the U-2's foreign basing arrangements. In addition to bases in the United States, U-2s currently operate from five air baseslocated in France, Cyprus, Spain, South Korea, and Saudi Arabia. The Air Force is currentlywithdrawing the U-2 from the French and Cypriot locations. Fewer forward bases may mean thatU-2s could spend a greater percentage of their 10 hour missions transiting to and from the theaterto be observed, and less time collecting intelligence. Additional U-2s would be required to overflythe theater to maintain the same amount of coverage. Base consolidation has been justified by thedissolution of the Soviet Union. Yet there has also been a proliferation of smaller scalecontingencies in which the United States has an interest. This raises questions about the efficacy ofreducing the U-2's operational basing by two fifths at a time of high operational tempo. Someobservers have suggested that examining the utility of opening additional U-2 bases in differenttheaters may be in order.", "Another inventory management issue pertains to the Expeditionary Air Force concept. To increase deployment predictability and more evenly distribute the deployment burden, the Air Forceis dividing its people and forces into 10 Air Expeditionary Forces (AEFs). These AEFs are looseamalgams of resources that will rotate through set training and deployment cycles. Currently, the AirForce does not have a similar strategy for its \"high demand, low density\" (HD/LD) assets such asthe U-2. Instead, U-2s are sent to a given theater as demand rises. Some within DOD have suggestedthat the U-2 and other ISR assets could be included in the current AEF concept and thus increase U-2deployment predictability. This idea may help distribute the deployment burden throughout the U-2force, but may not reduce the deployment tempo, due to low numbers of operational platforms. Another suggested option is to devise an AEF-like inventory management scheme specifically forthe U-2.", "Different variants of the Global Hawk may have to be developed and other UAVs or manned aircraft may be acquired. The Global Hawk is not the only UAV potentially available, but it hasbeen designed to meet certain DOD requirements for range and endurance. Configuring smallerUAVs, such as the Predator, to accomplish at least some of Global Hawk's mission capabilitiesmight be feasible, but would entail considerable delays and could come at the cost of otheroperational capabilities. Yet, this idea may merit further investigation.", "A final option that may bear investigation is to \"un-retire\" a handful of SR-71 Black Bird aircraft. Proponents of this approach point out that the SR-71 was a very capable ISR asset. Its veryhigh speed contributed to the SR-71's survivability, and increased the potential volume of territorythat could be surveilled. Also, several SR-71 airframes still exist. They have been preserved at theAir Force facility in Palmdale, California. Also, SR-71 aircraft have been \"un-retired\" in the past.Opponents of this idea point out that the SR-71 was a very expensive aircraft to fly and maintain,and that flying just a handful would not be cost effective. Also, the airframes may exist, but whatabout pilots? Are there any pilots qualified to fly the aircraft? Are there any pilots qualified to teachand train pilots? Opponents of this idea argue that un-retiring the SR-71 would be too expensive ameasure to simply bridge the gap between the U-2 and Global Hawk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["It is likely that Congress will play a key role in dealing with the futures of the Global Hawk andthe U-2. Direct congressional interest in UAVs is longstanding and funding and policy direction forthe Global Hawk has been reflected in a series of appropriations and authorization acts.
