The excise tax predates the act, having been enacted under separate legislation and first assessed in 1919. The tax is set at 10% of the manufacturer's price for pistols and revolvers and 11% of the manufacturer's price for other firearms, shells, and cartridges. It is collected by the manufacturer, and it also applies to imports. In addition, an 11% tax on archery equipment is deposited into the Wildlife Restoration Trust Fund, although this tax accounts for a relatively small share of the total amount in the Fund.
