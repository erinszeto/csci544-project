The Corps' feasibility report proposed activities to divert water from the Mississippi River to convey sediments into nearby wetlands, and to help stabilize the coastline.

In the diversions, wetlands would gradually reestablish themselves on newly deposited sediments.", "The Coastal Louisiana title of WRDA 2007, Title VII, used the Corps feasibility report as a starting point. To reflect concerns raised and knowledge gained by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, additional provisions were added by the House and Senate, and further changes were made in the conference report.

It also created a federal-state task force to participate in developing and implementing the plan, supported by expert working groups. The task force makes recommendations to the Secretary and submits a biennial report to Congress. Title VII also authorized funding for activities in several areas the task force might examine, including $10 million for modification of existing projects; $100 million for related scientific and technical work; $100 million for demonstration projects (with no single project exceeding $25 million); and $100 million to explore using dredged materials in restoration.", "Title VII authorized a number of specific projects\u2014$828.3 million for five restoration projects that are close to ready to start (including $105.3 million for environmental restoration work that would not have any navigation benefits for the controversial Mississippi River Gulf Outlet). The Corps must provide a report to the authorizing committees describing any modifications before it starts any of these five projects. It also limited cost increases for each of these initial projects to 150% of the current estimated cost. It also authorized the Corps to carry out four additional projects that are in earlier stages of planning with a total estimated cost of $184.6 million if they are determined to be feasible, and to submit feasibility reports to the authorizing committees by the end of 2009, and to provide feasibility reports on six other projects with a total estimated cost of $534.6 million by the end of 2008. The Corps can carry out any of these 10 projects if a favorable Chief's report is completed by the end of 2010 and both authorizing committees have approved a resolution. Title VII allows the Secretary to forgo economic evaluations if these projects' environmental benefits to the coastal Louisiana ecosystem are demonstrated. In addition to the reports to Congress listed above, Title VII called for several other status reports on progress of the work, the most significant of which may be a comprehensive overview to be provided six years after the date of enactment.", "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita altered the debate over wetlands restoration proposals and the cost-share for restoration investments.

Decisions that Congress may face in the future include whether to authorize any additional coastal Louisiana restoration efforts beyond those authorized in WRDA 2007, and whether to seek additional synergies between wetlands restoration and hurricane protection.

Many of these activities were already appropriated funds through the $7 billion in supplemental appropriations legislation in FY2005 and FY2006 for coastal Louisiana hurricane storm protection.

The UMR-IWW makes commercial navigation possible between Minneapolis and St. Louis on the Mississippi River, and along the Illinois Waterway from Chicago to the Mississippi River. It permits upper midwestern states to benefit from low-cost barge transport. Since the 1980s, the system has experienced increasing traffic delays, purportedly reducing competitiveness of U.S. products (primarily agricultural products) in some global markets. The river is also losing the habitat diversity that allowed it to support an unusually large number of species for a temperate river system. This loss is partially attributable to changes in the distribution and movement of river water caused by navigation structures and operation of the 9-foot navigation channel.", "The Corps' Chief of Engineers approved the completed feasibility report on UMR-IWW improvements in December 2004.

The Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) requested that an economic reevaluation of the navigation investments be made available by the end of September 2007. The reliability and completeness of the Corps' analysis of the UMR-IWW navigation investments previously had been the subject of controversy and investigation. Critics of the investments argued that the economic justification for the navigation locks were decreasing with the use of corn in the region for ethanol production (rather than the corn being shipped on the waterway to international markets). The critics questioned the urgency, necessity, and national benefit of the investments. Supporters of the investments argued that competitiveness of U.S. products was being harmed by the additional cost and travel time incurred during transit through and waiting for availability of the existing shorter locks.", "The Corps' ecosystem restoration plan was less controversial than the UMR-IWW navigation investments.

An array of interests are questioning current river management practices across the nation and how management can balance benefits (and harm) across multiple river uses, including in-stream uses. How the nation uses and values its rivers has changed over time. Rivers now are seen as providing not only economic benefits but also recreational opportunities and species habitat. This shift has resulted in a reexamination by the courts, agencies, and stakeholders of the distribution of economic and other benefits of management alternatives. For example, Missouri River management raises some fundamental questions about water resources management, such as whether some river uses should take priority over others (e.g., threatened and endangered species protection over inland waterway transportation, or vice versa) and how precedence should be decided (e.g., balancing competing uses versus maximizing economic benefits, versus maintaining minimum levels of some values).

Hurricane Katrina raised questions about this role; in particular, the disaster brought attention to the trade-offs in benefits, costs, and risks of the current division of responsibilities among local, state, and federal entities for flood mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. The question of the federal role also is raised by increasing competition over water supplies, not only in the West but also for urban centers in the East (e.g., Atlanta), which have resulted in a growing number of communities seeking financial and other federal assistance, actions, and permits related to water supply development (e.g., desalination and water reuse projects, reservoir expansions and reoperations). Congress rarely chooses to pursue broad legislation on federal water resources policies for many reasons, including the challenge of enacting changes that affect such a wide breadth of constituencies. Instead, Congress traditionally has pursued incremental changes through WRDA bills and other legislation, and this pattern seems likely to continue.", "Like WRDA debates in recent Congresses, the WRDA 2007 debate was dominated by different opinions over the desirability and need for changing the agency's policies, practices, and accountability, and for authorizing billions of dollars in investments in ecosystem restoration, navigation, and flood and storm damage reduction measures. The debates surrounding WRDA 2007 illustrated the continuing differences of opinions over the role of authorizations in guiding and prioritizing the agency's activities. The growing backlog of Corps construction and maintenance activities, constraints on federal water resources funds, the nation's aging water resources infrastructure, failure of the Corps-constructed floodwalls in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and increased attention to the flood risks of urban areas have raised concerns about continuing the practice of adding billions of dollars in authorizations to the Corps' portfolio of activities through omnibus WRDA legislation.
