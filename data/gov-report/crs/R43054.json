As in Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI)\u2014Social Security's retirement program\u2014SSDI benefits are based on a worker's past earnings. To qualify, individuals must have worked and paid Social Security taxes for a certain number of years and be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) due to a severe mental or physical impairment that is expected to last for at least one year or result in death. In 2015, the monthly SGA earnings limit for most individuals is $1,090. In general, disabled workers must be unable to do any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience.", "Recently, some Members of Congress and the public have expressed concern over the growth in the SSDI program. Between 1980 and 2013, the number of disabled workers and their dependents more than doubled, rising from 4.7 million to 11.0 million. This increase has placed pressure on the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund, from which SSDI benefits are paid. Over the same period, spending on benefits increased by more than 50%, from 0.54% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1980 to 0.84% of GDP in 2013. Without legislative action, the DI trust fund is projected to be depleted by the end of 2016. After that, ongoing tax revenues would be sufficient to pay about 80% of scheduled benefits.", "Most researchers agree that changes in the demographic characteristics of the working-age population account for a large share of the growth in the number of individuals on SSDI. Demographic changes consist of (1) the aging of the baby boomers, (2) the influx of women into the labor force, and (3) the overall growth in the working-age population. However, there is considerable disagreement among researchers over how much non-demographic factors contributed to the growth. Non-demographic factors include (1) changes in opportunities for work and compensation (e.g., slow wage growth for low-skilled workers and high unemployment), (2) changes in federal policy that made it easier for some people to qualify as disabled, and (3) the rise in the full retirement age for unreduced Social Security retirement benefits. In general, people who support higher spending on SSDI focus on changes in the demographic characteristics of workers. In contrast, individuals who want to limit program spending typically focus on the effect of changes in the economic incentives to apply for SSDI and legislative changes to the program's eligibility criteria.", "To assist lawmakers in addressing the sustainability of the program, this report provides an overview of proposals to manage the long-term growth in the SSDI rolls. Most of the proposals focus on reducing the inflow (enrollment) of new beneficiaries into the program. These proposals involve (1) tightening eligibility criteria, (2) improving the administration of the program, and (3) providing incentives for employers to help keep employees working when they become disabled. On the other hand, some of the proposals seek to increase the outflow (termination) of beneficiaries from the program. These proposals entail (1) providing stronger incentives for beneficiaries who can work to return to the labor force, and (2) increasing the number of periodic continuing disability reviews, which stop benefits for people found to be no longer disabled. This report does not examine options to reduce benefit levels or increase program revenues.", "Although many of the options discussed in this report have the potential to slow or even reverse the growth of SSDI receipt and thus generate savings to the program over the longer term, such proposals are highly unlikely to significantly forestall the projected exhaustion of the DI trust fund. To avoid a 20% cut in benefits in late 2016, lawmakers would almost certainly have to use cash infusions to bolster the assets of the DI trust fund. For example, Congress could reallocate the Social Security payroll tax rate to give the DI trust fund a larger share (as was done in 1994), or it could authorize interfund borrowing from the OASI trust fund or Medicare's Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund. These short-term financing options would give lawmakers more time to develop and implement some of the longer-term proposals mentioned in the report if they wished to slow the growth in the disability rolls."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Concern among some Members of Congress and the public over the financial sustainability of the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program has grown.

If depleted, the DI trust fund would be able to pay about 80% of scheduled SSDI benefits.", "The declining solvency of the DI trust fund is the result of an increasing imbalance between SSDI's income and outlays. Between 1980 and 2013, non-interest income to the DI trust fund (adjusted for inflation) increased 181%, while spending on benefits grew 219%. The increase in spending is due largely to the growth in the number of beneficiaries on SSDI. Over the same period, the number of disabled workers and their dependents more than doubled, rising from 4.7 million in 1980 to 11 million in 2013. Because benefit payments account for nearly all program spending, the growth in the SSDI rolls has contributed heavily to the financial difficulties of the DI trust fund.", "To assist lawmakers in addressing the sustainability of the program, this report provides an overview of reform proposals to manage the long-term growth in the SSDI rolls.

OASDI is commonly called Social Security. Like Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), SSDI is a form of social insurance that replaces a portion of a worker's earnings based on the individual's career-average earnings in jobs covered by Social Security. Specifically, SSDI provides benefits to insured workers under the full retirement age (FRA) who meet the statutory test of disability and to their eligible dependents. FRA is the age at which unreduced Social Security retirement benefits are first payable (currently 66). In November 2014, 10.9 million individuals received SSDI benefits, including 9 million disabled workers, 150,000 spouses of disabled workers, and 1.8 million children of disabled workers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["To qualify for SSDI, workers must be (1) insured in the event of disability, and (2) statutorily disabled. To achieve insured status, individuals must have worked in covered employment (i.e., jobs covered by Social Security) for about a quarter of their adult lives before they became disabled and for at least five of the past 10 years immediately before the onset of disability. However, younger workers may qualify with less work experience based on their age. In 2014, SSDI provided disability insurance to an estimated 151 million workers.", "To meet the statutory test of disability, insured workers must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for at least one year.

In general, workers must have a severe condition that prevents them from doing any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Cash benefits begin five full months after a beneficiary's disability onset date. Initial benefits are based on a worker's career-average earnings, indexed to reflect changes in national wage levels (up to five years of the worker's low earnings are excluded). Benefits are subsequently adjusted to account for inflation through cost-of-living adjustments (COLA), as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). However, benefits may be offset if a disabled worker also receives workers' compensation or other public disability benefits. In November 2014, the average monthly benefit was $1,146 for disabled workers, $309 for spouses of disabled workers, and $343 for children of disabled workers. ", "In addition to cash benefits, disabled workers and certain dependents are eligible for health coverage under Medicare after 24 months of entitlement to cash benefits (29 months after the onset of disability). In 2012, Medicare spending per disabled beneficiary averaged about $9,900. ", "Some SSDI beneficiaries may also qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSI provides cash payments to aged, blind, or disabled individuals with limited income and assets. Both programs are administered by SSA and use the same definition of disability; however, unlike SSDI, SSI has no work or contribution requirements. In most states, SSI recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid.

DDSs\u2014state agencies that are fully funded by the federal government\u2014decide whether applicants meet national disability standards established by SSA. State DDS examiners and medical and psychological consultants typically use medical evidence collected from the claimant's treating sources (physicians, psychologists, or other acceptable medical sources) to determine the severity of the claimant's impairment(s). If a claimant's condition is determined to be severe and meets (or is of equal severity to) the medical criteria in SSA's Listing of Impairments , the claimant is considered disabled and therefore eligible for SSDI. Claimants who do not meet the medical criteria in the listings proceed to a more individualized assessment that examines their residual functional capacity to perform any past relevant work or other work that exists in the national economy. If a claimant cannot perform such work, the claimant is awarded benefits.", "Claimants whose initial applications are denied may appeal. During the appeals process, claimants may present additional evidence or arguments to support their case as well as appoint a representative to act on their behalf. The appeals process is composed of four stages: (1) reconsideration by a different examiner from the state DDS office, (2) a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ), (3) a review before the Appeals Council, and (4) filing suit against SSA in U.S. district court.

At the same time, the overall incidence (enrollment) rate rose from 4.4 awards per 1,000 disability-exposed to 6.3. The incidence rate is the ratio of the number of new beneficiaries awarded benefits each year to the number of workers who are insured in the event of disability but not currently receiving benefits (i.e., the disability-exposed population ).

", "As depicted in Figure 2 , three main factors drive the termination rate: death, recovery, and conversion. The beneficiary death rate decreased 42% between 1980 and 2013, from 48 disabled-worker terminations per 1,000 disabled-worker beneficiaries to 28, reflecting the trend in the U.S. population of declining mortality rates across all age groups. ", "Recovery refers to individuals whose benefits were terminated because of medical improvement or earnings above SGA. From 1980 to 2013, the recovery rate declined 77%, from 29 disabled-worker terminations per 1,000 disabled-worker beneficiaries to 6.7. A conversion termination occurs when SSA automatically converts a disabled-worker benefit to a retired-worker benefit due to a disabled worker reaching the FRA. Over this same period, the conversion rate fell 25%, from 68 disabled-worker terminations per 1,000 disabled-worker beneficiaries to 51.", "The rise in the recovery rate during the early 1980s stemmed mainly from the enactment of the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 ( P.L. 96-265 ), which expanded the use of continuing disability reviews (CDR) for all non-permanently disabled beneficiaries. CDRs are periodic medical reevaluations conducted to determine if beneficiaries continue to meet SSA's definition of disability. The frequency of CDRs is linked to a beneficiary's probability of recovery. A major review of the SSDI program after the passage of the 1980 amendments resulted in a marked increase in the recovery rate between 1980 and 1982. However, the political backlash over the implementation of the reviews led to a temporary moratorium on CDRs for most mental impairment cases as well as an increase in the percentage of beneficiaries designated as \"permanently disabled\" and therefore subject to less frequent reviews. These actions, coupled with changes to the disability determination and review process stemming from the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-460 ), contributed to the subsequent decrease in the recovery rate.", "The 1997 increase in the recovery rate largely resulted from the passage of the Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-121 ), which terminated the benefits of SSDI and SSI recipients whose drug addiction and alcoholism (DA&A) significantly contributed to their disability. However, because DA&A beneficiaries represented less than 3% of all disabled adults on SSDI and SSI in 1996 and new applicants could no longer claim disability based on DA&A, P.L. 104-121 's impact on the overall trend in the SSDI recovery rate was minimal.", "Starting in 2002, the recovery rate contracted again, in part, because of a reduction in the number of medical CDRs conducted by SSA. The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996 authorized additional funds for CDRs but only for FY1996 through FY2002. In FY2003, the additional funding for CDRs lapsed and SSA shifted its focus away from CDRs toward processing the growing number of initial disability claims. As a result, the number of medical CDRs performed by SSA dropped from an all-time high of 877,000 in FY2000 to 208,000 in FY2007, before climbing back up to 526,000 in FY2014 ( Figure 3 )."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Size", "paragraphs": ["Between 1980 and 2013, the overall number of SSDI beneficiaries increased 134%, from 4.7 million to 11 million.

In contrast, the number of spouses of disabled workers on SSDI decreased 66% during this period, from 462,000 in 1980 to 157,000 in 2013.

From 1980 to 2013, a marked rise in the incidence rate, coupled with a steady decline in the termination rate, resulted in an appreciable increase in the number of beneficiaries on SSDI. The prevalence rate measures the total number of disabled workers relative to the overall insured-worker population at the end of the year. The insured-worker population is the sum of the disability-exposed population and the number of individuals who are already receiving SSDI benefits.

As a result, the share of women ages 15-64 who were insured for disability increased from 51% in 1980 to 67% in 2014. The portion of men who were insured declined slightly over this period, from 77% to 71% ( Figure 7 ).", "The growth in the share of women insured for disability coincided with an increase in the rate at which insured women were awarded benefits. As Figure 8 shows, both male and female age-adjusted incidence rates increased markedly between the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, male age-adjusted incidence rates declined following the 1990-1991 recession while female rates held steady. Researchers refer to this trend as women's \"catch-up.\" Since the late 1990s, age-adjusted incidence rates for women have been more or less at parity with men's rates. Although the reason for the gap between incidence rates during the 1980s is not entirely clear, researchers have speculated that past generations of women may have been less likely to know about SSDI and more likely to turn to family members or means-tested programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), when affected by work-limiting impairments.

Beginning in 1996, working-age baby boomers increasingly aged and became more prone to disability, resulting in a shift in the age distribution of the insured-worker population from younger workers to older workers. This shift helped to increase the gross incidence and prevalence rates, inasmuch as older workers have a higher likelihood of benefit receipt relative to younger workers. Between 1996 and 2013, the portion of SSDI awards to disabled workers ages 50 to FRA increased from 54% to 66% ( Figure 9 ). One reason for this is that older workers report suffering from work-limiting disabilities at higher rates relative to younger workers.", "Another factor is that the definition of disability is effectively less strict at higher ages. In making a disability determination, DDS examiners take into account the claimant's medical condition as well as vocational factors such as age, education, residual functional capacity, and work experience. Under its regulations, SSA considers advancing age to be a limiting factor in a claimant's ability to adjust to other work. Therefore, older workers are more likely to receive benefits than are younger workers, even if they have the same disability. The trustees expect the gross prevalence rates to grow at a slower pace in the future as baby boomers increasingly become eligible for full Social Security retirement benefits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changes in Opportunities for Work and Compensation", "paragraphs": ["Changes in financial incentives also contributed to the growth in the program. In deciding whether to apply, workers compare the value of SSDI benefits (cash payments and health coverage) with their opportunities for work and compensation. When the economy is strong, more individuals who could qualify for SSDI might decide to seek or continue employment. On the other hand, when labor market conditions are adverse, more individuals may find SSDI benefits preferable to the jobs and compensation available to them in the economy. Although the initial determination process screens out most non-meritorious claimants, SSA may grant awards to some claimants on the margin of program entry who could potentially work but choose not to due to economic circumstances. This subsection outlines how changes in the financial incentives to apply for SSDI likely increased the incidence of benefit receipt."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "High Unemployment", "paragraphs": ["During periods of economic weakness, individuals who might otherwise choose to work may be more likely to apply for SSDI benefits as a form of unemployment assistance. There is a positive relationship between the unemployment rate and the SSDI application rate. With the exception of the period between 1980 and 1984, instances of high unemployment are associated with an increase in SSDI applications. As shown in Figure 10 , the recent recession (December 2007 to June 2009) contributed to a conspicuous spike in the number of SSDI applications submitted to SSA; between 2007 and 2010, applications for SSDI increased 32%, from 2.2 million to 2.9 million.", "The relationship between the unemployment rate and the approval rate is somewhat more ambiguous, inasmuch as the award year may not coincide with the application year due to a prolonged determination and appeals process. Several studies have found an inverse relationship between the approval rate and the unemployment rate. In other words, a claimant's likelihood of receiving an award at the initial determination level decreases as the unemployment rate rises. This is thought to occur because adverse labor market conditions induce more marginally disabled individuals to apply for benefits. Nevertheless, the overall number of SSDI awards issued by SSA appears to increase during economic downturns. One possible reason for this is that some individuals who could qualify for SSDI but choose instead to work when the economy is strong are often less likely to find reemployment opportunities following a job loss when the unemployment rate is high. Between 2007 and 2010, the number of SSDI awards granted by SSA increased 22%, from 819,000 to 1 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Value of Cash Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Over the past few decades, SSDI appears to have become more attractive to lower-skilled workers because their potential SSDI benefits replace a larger portion of their earnings than before.

Although the replacement rate depends on a worker's past earnings, the Social Security benefit formula also reflects changes in the average earnings of all workers in the national economy, as measured by the Average Wage Index (AWI). Due to the progressive nature of the benefit formula, replacement rates are greater for workers with low lifetime wages than for high-wage workers ( Table 1 ).", "Some part of the growth in SSDI is driven by rising replacements rates for low-skilled workers, which have made SSDI benefits more desirable than work for an increasing share of workers. The increase in the relative attractiveness of SSDI benefits was likely strongest for low-wage workers, because they experienced slower real earnings growth over the last three decades than medium and high-wage workers. This increase in wage inequality has interacted with the structure of the benefits formula to increase replacement rates for lower-skilled workers. That means that SSDI is more attractive to those workers than it had been in the past.", "While researchers generally agree that replacement rates \"are rising due to the widening distribution of income,\" there is some disagreement over the extent to which this increase induced low-wage workers to apply for SSDI benefits.

Congress extended Medicare to SSDI beneficiaries under the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (P.L.92-603) because the \"use of health services by people who are severely disabled is substantially higher than that by the nondisabled ... yet the disabled have limited incomes in comparison to those who are not disabled, and most disabled persons are unable financially to purchase adequate private health insurance protection.\"", "Health care is generally more expensive for individuals with disabilities. One study found that health care expenditures per capita were over four times greater for workers with disabilities than those without disabilities. Persons with disabilities have higher health care expenditures because they typically use more health services and have secondary conditions that further impair overall health. These higher costs can make health care coverage prohibitively expensive for some individuals with disabilities. In 2013, 39% of individuals with disabilities had private health insurance coverage, compared with 71% of individuals without disabilities. The lower coverage rate for individuals with disabilities under private health insurance is due, in part, to the availability of government-sponsored health care coverage under Medicare and Medicaid.", "Some research suggests that the desire to gain access to Medicare induced some individuals with disabilities to apply for SSDI.

On the one hand, the ACA may reduce SSDI applications by increasing access to affordable health coverage, making access to Medicare less valuable. On the other hand, the ACA may increase SSDI applications by making it easier for individuals who get health coverage through their work to apply, because they could obtain Medicaid coverage or subsidized coverage in the exchange during the 24-month waiting period for Medicare. Recent research indicates that the health care law's effect on SSDI application rates is likely to vary by locality due to factors such as (1) the availability of Medicaid in a state, (2) local health insurance coverage rates, and (3) the availability and type of state Medicaid buy-in programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changes in Federal Policy", "paragraphs": ["In addition to demographic and economic changes, various amendments to the Social Security program played a role in increasing the number of people on SSDI.

High inflation and low wage growth starting in the 1970s had eroded the balance of the OASI trust fund, which finances the benefits and administrative costs of the OASI program. In 1982, the Social Security trustees projected that the OASI trust fund would exhaust by the middle of 1983. ", "To improve the financial condition of the OASI trust fund, Congress enacted the comprehensive Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ). Among the 1983 amendments' many substantial changes was an increase in the FRA from 65 to 67. Between 2002 and 2009, the FRA gradually increased until it reached 66 for workers born between 1943 and 1954. The FRA is scheduled to rise again, reaching 67 for workers born in 1960 and later. ", "Raising the FRA reduced OASI spending but increased DI spending in several ways. First, it increased the number of workers who are eligible for SSDI. From 2003 to 2014, the number of insured workers ages 65-FRA rose from over 200,000 to more than 2.4 million. Because workers aged 65-FRA are more likely to have a qualifying disability, the increase in the number of insured workers led to an increase in the number of workers awarded benefits. In 2013, over 7,400 workers aged 65-FRA were awarded benefits.", "Second, the increase in the FRA lengthened the duration of benefit receipt for SSDI recipients near retirement age. Disabled workers move from SSDI to OASI when they reach the FRA. As the FRA increased above 65, beneficiaries remained on SSDI longer. In December 2013, over 455,000 disabled workers ages 65-FRA received benefits.", "Third, the rise in the FRA increased the value of SSDI cash benefits relative to early retirement benefits. Insured workers who choose to retire between the ages of 62 and FRA are subject to a permanent reduction in their monthly cash benefits. Prior to the 1983 amendments, the reduction for claiming retirement benefits at age 62 was 20%; with the increase in the FRA to 66, the reduction at age 62 rose to 25%. That reduction will rise to 30% for workers whose FRA is 67. Because SSDI benefits are approximately the same as full retirement benefits, the increase in the FRA likely impelled some additional workers to apply for SSDI benefits in order to maximize their total cash benefits. Although recent studies suggest that an increase in the value of disability benefits relative to early retirement benefits induces individuals to apply for SSDI benefits, researchers are divided over whether such individuals are actually awarded benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980 ( P.L. 96-265 ) markedly expanded the use of continuing disability reviews (CDRs) as a means of reducing the growth in program costs. CDRs are periodic medical reevaluations conducted to determine if beneficiaries are still disabled. Between January 1982 and fall 1984, SSA issued benefit termination notices to 490,000 of the 1.2 million SSDI beneficiaries subjected to a CDR. However, the rise in beneficiary terminations due to CDRs sparked a degree of public outcry and had \"a very damaging effect on the public perception of SSA's administration of the disability program.\" News stories at the time often depicted the financial and emotional difficulties faced by recently terminated beneficiaries and their dependents. Ultimately, of the 490,000 beneficiaries who received termination notices, approximately 200,000 had their benefits reinstated on appeal.", "In response to the contention over the increased use of CDRs, Congress unanimously enacted the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 (DBRA; P.L. 98-460 ). DBRA changed the statutory standards for evaluating disability in a variety of ways. First, it revised the medical eligibility criteria for CDRs so that SSA could terminate the benefits of a recipient due to medical improvement only if the agency found substantial evidence of medical improvement related to the recipient's ability to work since the most recent favorable determination. Under the 1980 amendments, SSA had treated medical CDRs as a new determination and could revoke benefits even if a beneficiary's health had not changed.", "Second, it required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise the criteria under the \"mental disorders\" category in the Listing of Impairments . Before the reforms, disability determinations relied primarily on medical factors, which tended to disadvantage claimants with mental impairments from benefit receipt. The revised listings for mental impairments\u2014first published in 1985 \u2014\"reduced the weight given to medical factors and put a greater weight on functional capacities, such as the applicant's ability to perform activities of daily living. \" ", "Third, it required SSA to consider the combined effect of multiple non-severe impairments on the claimant's ability to engage in SGA. Prior to DBRA, a disability determination could not proceed unless the claimant had one or more independently severe impairments. Lastly, DBRA provided a temporary statutory standard (through the end of 1986) for evaluating pain. Before the reforms, there was no \"specific statement in the law\" as to how pain should be evaluated. SSA issued new pain regulations in 1991.", "In enacting DBRA, Congress sought to protect the rights of \"those correctly and properly allowed on the rolls\" while continuing to remove non-meritorious beneficiaries from the program. To accomplish this, Congress established a national, uniform process for determining disability, which complemented objective medical criteria with more subjective criteria such as pain and functional capacity. Congress, though, explicitly stated that the intent of DBRA was not to change the basic standard of eligibility for SSDI.", "Nevertheless, a number of researchers argue that despite Congress's intention, the establishment of new evaluative criteria contributed to the growth in the disability rolls by making it easier for claimants with \"difficult-to-verify\" impairments to qualify for SSDI, such as mental and musculoskeletal disorders. For example, the revision to the \"mental disorders\" category in the Listing of Impairments , which gave greater weight to functional capacities, may have permitted more claimants with mental impairments to qualify for SSDI. Similarly, the allowance of the combined effect of multiple non-severe impairments and the evaluation of pain may have made it easier for claimants suffering from musculoskeletal disorders (impairments involving bones, muscles, tendons, or ligaments) to enroll in the program.", "As Figure 11 illustrates, the percentage of awards due to mental and musculoskeletal impairments increased markedly following the passage of DBRA. Between 1985 and 2001, the share of newly awarded beneficiaries with mental impairments increased from 18% to 26% before declining to 17% in 2013. According to one researcher at SSA, the increase in awards resulting from mental disorders in 1986 \"is directly attributable to changes in the decision making process due to the 1984 Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act.\" From 1986 to 2012, the share of all beneficiaries with mental impairments increased from 24% to 31%.", "The change in musculoskeletal impairments was even more pronounced. Between 1985 and 1994, awards based on musculoskeletal disorders remained roughly constant, rising from 13% to 13.4%. However, due to a change in the reporting method for awards, the percentage of awardees with musculoskeletal impairments jumped to 22% in 1995, later increasing to 36% in 2013. From 1986 to 2013, the share of all beneficiaries with musculoskeletal impairments grew from 18% to 31%.", "For an alternative perspective, Figure 12 shows the change in the incidence of various diagnostic groups over time. Although the incidence of other diagnostic groups, such as circulatory-related disabilities, stayed roughly constant over the past 30 years, the growth in musculoskeletal and mental awards was such that the share of awards based on other disabilities declined ( Figure 11 ). In other words, as mental and musculoskeletal awards increased in absolute terms, other impairments remained generally steady. However, because the overall rate of mental and musculoskeletal awards increased, the share of other impairments decreased.", "The growth in the share of beneficiaries with mental and musculoskeletal impairments may have also increased the disability rolls by increasing the average length of time that beneficiaries stay on SSDI. Mortality rates for beneficiaries with mental or musculoskeletal impairments are lower than average, while their conversion rates are higher than average. As a result, they experience a longer-than-average duration of benefit receipt.

Although many of the large surveys used by researchers specifically ask questions pertaining to disability, the wording and complexity of the questions often differs. Because many surveys are self-reporting, the definition of what constitutes a work-limiting disability often rests entirely on the subjectivity of the respondent.

Although DDS examiners base their initial determinations on uniform guidelines established by the SSA, regional differences in demographic, health, and employment characteristics may produce variation in initial allowance rates among DDS offices. However, one study found an appreciable degree of variation in determination outcomes across examiners within the same DDS office. The study estimated that up to 60% of applicants \"could have received a different initial determination from at least one other examiner in the DDS office.\" Even though the appeals process mitigated some of this variation, the study concluded that up to 23% of claimants could have ultimately received different outcomes had other examiners in the DDS office performed the determination. ", "Some have speculated that the uncertainty of an outcome at the initial determination level due to variation across DDS examiners likely encouraged denied claimants to pursue the appeals process, increasing their likelihood of SSDI receipt. The aforementioned study found that claimants denied by stricter examiners were more likely to appeal their determinations. Although most of the awards granted by SSA are made at the initial determination level, the hearing level has the highest allowance rate of any step in the determination and appeals process. In FY2013, the allowance rate at the hearing level was 48%, compared with 33% at the initial level, 11% at the reconsideration level, 1% at the Appeals Council level, and 2% at the federal court level. The study found that 75% of denied claimants who contested their initial determinations had their denials overturned eventually on appeal. ", "Others contend that variation in the allowance rates at the hearing level of the appeals process contributed to the number of workers on SSDI. A 2013 report by SSA's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) discovered wide variances in the allowance rates among some ALJs within the same hearing office. Additionally, an earlier OIG report found a direct relationship between the number of cases adjudicated by outlier ALJs (i.e., judges at the extreme ends of the distribution scale) and allowance rates. ALJs with the highest allowance rates adjudicated more dispositions relative to the office average, while ALJs with the lowest allowance rates adjudicated fewer dispositions compared with the office average. A 2014 OIG report estimated that judges with 700 or more dispositions and allowance rates of 85% or higher improperly allowed benefits in approximately 24,900 cases over a seven-year period, resulting in \"questionable costs\" of more than $2 billion.", "Even in the absence of such variation, those claimants improperly granted awards by outlier examiners and judges might have eventually been found disabled in the future. One study found that over 60% of claimants denied at the hearing level of the appeals process were later awarded benefits within 10 years. One possible explanation is that the health of some initially rejected claimants with marginal disabilities may deteriorate to the point that they meet SSA's definition of disability several years later.

At the hearing level, a claimants may present additional evidence or arguments to support the case and appoint a representative to act on his or her behalf. Most claimants are represented by attorneys at ALJ hearings. Since SSA is not represented at the hearing, the proceeding is considered inquisitorial or non-adversarial. Under the inquisitorial process, an ALJ investigates the merit of an appeal by informally questioning the claimant and any scheduled witnesses (e.g., medical or vocational experts).

The AALJ and SSAB argue that the vigorous cross-examination of claimants by SSA representatives would provide ALJs with additional information, resulting in better decisions. According to SSAB, under the inquisitorial process, some ALJs may be reluctant to question claimants aggressively for fear of appearing to be biased. SSAB contends that switching to an adversarial process would allow ALJs to investigate the history and extent of claimants' medical impairments more thoroughly, resulting in better-reasoned decisions and greater judicial consistency.", "Another potential advantage of the adversarial process is that government representation may reduce the number of cases that an ALJ would need to hear, which could further improve the quality of their decisions. In 2013, SSA Deputy Commissioner Glenn Sklar testified that the agency expects ALJs to issue 500-700 decisions annually. Some researchers speculate that the pressure to adjudicate a high number of disability claims quickly has led to poorer ALJ decisions and consequently a higher allowance rate. According to a 2013 Senate report, this pressure stems from a 2007 plan by SSA to reduce its backlog of disability hearings. One reason why the pressure to hear a large volume of cases may have increased the overall allowance rate is that issuing an award is generally not appealed by a claimant and is therefore subject to less scrutiny than a denial would be. A 2014 story on SSA's disability backlog in the Washington Post noted that \"judges complain that saying 'yes' is a lot easier\u2014and faster\u2014than saying 'no.' A negative decision often requires a lengthier write-up, which goes through all the different ailments that might have rendered this person disabled. That means 10 pages of text to prepare for a future appeal. A 'yes' decision is rarely appealed. So, they say, it takes less writing.\" The AALJ contends that switching to an adversarial process would allow government attorneys to settle cases with a high probability of reversal before the hearing level, giving ALJs more time to adjudicate complicated cases or ones with a lower likelihood of being reversed. By allowing government representatives to decide which cases to defend, the adversarial process could reduce the pressure for ALJs to decide a high number of claims, which, in turn, could improve the quality of their decisions. ", "At a hearing in November 2013, SSA refuted the characterization that it is sacrificing quality by granting claims \"too readily\" and insisted that it is \"making quicker, higher quality disability decisions.\" The agency also noted that between FY2007 and FY2013, the share of ALJs with allowance rates of 85% or greater fell from 20% to 3%.

Those extra costs would offset any savings from reduced benefit outlays.", "Second, a federal judge issued an injunction against SSA's previous adversarial pilot program in 1986, so an adversarial process might require new legislative authority. In 1982, SSA initiated the Social Security Administration Representation Project (SSARP) in five hearing offices across the country to test \"whether the participation of SSA representatives in disability cases at the administrative hearing level can contribute toward improving the quality and timeliness of hearing dispositions.\" Under the SSARP, government representatives reviewed hearing requests, initiated case development, and represented the agency whenever a claimant had an appointed representative at a hearing.

In Salling v. Bowen , a district judge issued an injunction against the SSARP, finding that its procedures did not meet the standard for due process and were not \"fundamentally fair.\" The judge also held that the pilot program violated the Social Security Act and intruded on the independence of ALJs.

Most of the impairments described in the listings are permanent or expected to result in death. All other listings must show that the impairment has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year. If the claimant's impairment meets (or is of equal severity to) the criteria in the listings, SSA considers the claimant disabled and therefore eligible for benefits.

Once the comprehensive update is complete, SSA is to conduct periodic reviews of each listing category to ensure that the listings are current.

Despite recent efforts to reduce the backlog, SSA estimated that there were 1.3 million pending medical CDRs at the end of FY2013.", "Reducing the CDR backlog has posed a challenge for SSA, in part because of a reduction in DDS staffing levels over the years. In response to budget deficits following the last recession, some states instituted furloughs or hiring freezes of state employees, including DDS examiners. The reduced staffing at DDSs limited SSA's ability to conduct periodic medical reviews and contributed to the backlog of CDRs. To address the lower staffing levels, SSA transferred a portion of disability cases from furloughed DDS offices in some states to non-furloughed DDS offices in other states. Additionally, the agency received funding in FY2009 and FY2010 to increase the number of DDS staff by more than 2,900 employees. However, due to an agency-wide hiring freeze that began in FY2011, SSA did only limited critical hiring between FY2011 and FY2013. The combination of attrition and hiring freezes during this period resulted in a net decline in DDS staffing levels ( Table 2 ).", "To address the mounting backlog of CDRs and enhance program integrity, advocacy organizations, researchers, and the Obama Administration have all expressed their support for increasing CDR funding. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ), which places caps on discretionary spending, includes a provision to adjust the caps to permit additional appropriations to SSA for program integrity activities such as CDRs and SSI redeterminations. SSI redeterminations are periodic reviews to ensure that beneficiaries meet SSI's financial eligibility requirements. ", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 ( P.L. 113-76 ) appropriated a total of $1.197 billion for CDRs and SSI redeterminations, which was the maximum amount allowed under the BCA for FY2014. With this level of funding, SSA completed nearly 526,000 full medical CDRs and 2.6 million SSI redeterminations (see Figure 3 ). The FY2014 appropriation also allowed the agency to hire about 2,600 DDS employees, including both replacement staff and additional hires. ", "For FY2015, the Administration requested the full amount authorized for program integrity activities under the BCA: $273 million in base funding and $1.123 billion in cap adjustment funding. The Administration estimates that the $1.396 billion in total program integrity funding would allow SSA to perform at least 888,000 full medical CDRs and 2.6 million SSI redeterminations in FY2015. Congress appropriated the maximum amount for FY2015 in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ). ", "According to SSA, the agency would need $11.8 billion in program integrity funding during FY2014-2023 to eliminate the CDR backlog by FY2018 and prevent it from growing back again through FY2023. This level of funding would allow SSA to conduct an estimated 8.8 million full medical CDRs. However, at the funding levels prescribed in the BCA, SSA projects that it would be able to conduct only 7.8 million full medical CDRs at a cost of $10.3 billion.", "For FY2016, the Administration proposes replacing the discretionary spending caps established under the BCA with a dedicated source of mandatory funding to enable SSA to conduct more CDRs and SSI redeterminations on a consistent basis. Under this option, SSA estimates that it would conduct more than 8 million full medical CDRs at a cost of $10.7 billion during FY2014-FY2023."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations of Full Medical CDRs", "paragraphs": ["While additional funding and new hires would allow the agency to perform more full medical CDRs, the shortage of veteran examiners complicates the issue. Part of the problem stems from the fact that DDS examiners experience high rates of turnover. According to GAO, over 20% of DDS examiners hired between September 1998 and January 2006 left or were terminated within their first year. Of the examiners who remain, it takes about two years of experience before SSA considers them to be fully trained. Thus, even with additional hiring, it may take the agency years to reestablish a robust pool of highly experienced disability examiners.", "Additionally, because of diminishing returns, future marginal savings from additional CDRs would be less than the past average. When SSA performs CDRs, it prioritizes the beneficiaries who are most likely to have substantial medical improvement related to their ability to work. However, as the number of completed CDRs increases, the chance of benefit cessation declines for subsequent reviews. ", "The savings-to-cost ratio would also decrease if former SSDI beneficiaries who were terminated due to medical improvement reapply and return to the program. According to one study, of those whose eligibility ceased after CDRs from 2003 to 2008, an estimated 20% of former SSDI-only beneficiaries will come back onto the rolls within eight years.", "It is important to note that program integrity activities alone would be unable to substantially improve the financial outlook of the SSDI program, because potential savings from CDRs take time to accumulate and apply to multiple programs. For example, SSA projects that the full medical CDRs conducted in FY2012 will result in a present value of nearly $7 billion in lifetime savings to the federal government; however, these savings are spread out over decades and are attributable not only to SSDI but also to OASI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Return-to-Work Incentives249", "paragraphs": ["Another policy option to combat the growth in the SSDI rolls is to provide stronger incentives for beneficiaries to return to work.

Ticket to Work assists beneficiaries between the ages of 18 and 64 in returning to the labor force by providing a voucher or ticket for employment, vocational rehabilitation (VR), or other support services through public or private contractors known as Employment Networks (EN), as well as through traditional state VR agencies. Participation in the Ticket to Work program is voluntary, and ticket holders (beneficiaries) decide when and whether to assign a ticket to a particular state VR agency or EN. Under the program, state VR agencies and ENs receive payments from SSA for services provided to ticket holders based on specific work-related performances measures.", "Thus far, the Ticket to Work program has met with little success. Although program participants are more likely to be employed than other beneficiaries, only about 2.3% of all active tickets issued by SSA are in use (i.e., assigned to an EN or state VR agency). According to GAO, EN representatives partially attribute Ticket to Work's low beneficiary participation rate to \"a lack of understanding and awareness of the program.\" Meanwhile, some disability-advocacy organizations contend that the fear of losing benefits may deter beneficiaries from participating.", "To improve the return-to-work rate of SSDI recipients, researchers Bonnie O'Day and David Stapleton have proposed testing early intervention policies that provide beneficiaries with employment and other support services shortly after receipt of benefits. The researchers argue that current programs have failed to increase the return-to-work rate, because many beneficiaries \"have been separated from the labor force, often for years, before they are offered assistance.\" The researchers posit that beneficiaries may have a greater chance of returning to work if they receive services earlier during their stay on SSDI. ", "One early intervention option is to require all future beneficiaries to participate in work preparation counseling to educate them about available services. Beneficiaries may be more likely to participate in programs they understand. Although mandatory work preparation counseling would require new funding, the counseling might be cost-effective if it improves the return-to-work rate of SSDI recipients, especially if it targeted those with the best chance of success.", "SSA oversees two voluntary grant programs aimed at increasing beneficiary awareness of return-to-work services. In addition to the Ticket to Work program, P.L. 106-170 also established the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) program and the Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS). WIPA awards grants to community organizations that provide education and assistance for beneficiaries interested in returning to work, and PABSS provides grants for legal assistance and advice on how to obtain VR, employment, or other services.", "Estimating the overall impact of mandatory counseling on the SSDI beneficiary return-to-work rate is difficult because the results of SSA's current employment-counseling initiatives are inconclusive. According to one study, the use of WIPA services possibly has a positive effect on the employment outcomes of SSDI and SSI beneficiaries. However, it is difficult to discern whether beneficiaries who received WIPA services would have enjoyed the same employment outcome in the absence of such services.

After completing the TWP and a 36-month extended period of eligibility (EPE), beneficiaries who earn more than the SGA limit have their benefits terminated. One study found that between 0.2% and 0.4% of all SSDI beneficiaries parked their earnings below SGA in a typical month from 2002 to 2006 in order to retain their benefits. ", "Beneficiaries may park their earnings below SGA (sometimes called the \"cash cliff\") in part because their impairment prevents them from working consistently. Another study found that 59% of Ticket to Work participants reported working at a job for at least one month during 2003-2005; however, of those participants who later left work, the most cited reason was due to poor health. Parking one's earnings below SGA may weaken a work-oriented beneficiary's attachment to the labor force, possibly resulting in an erosion of skills and thus a reduced likelihood of returning to work following a health-related withdrawal from the labor force.", "To remedy the phenomenon of parked earnings, several disability-rights organizations have advocated eliminating the fixed cash cliff (SGA threshold) and replacing it with a gradual benefit-offset model that allows beneficiaries to increase their earnings while remaining on SSDI. The SSI program operates under a benefit-offset system, deducting $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings over $65. Advocates argue that a benefit-offset model would make SSDI beneficiaries \"financially better off\" by allowing them to maximize their total income and work potential. A benefit-offset model could also improve the finances of the SSDI program by reducing the amount of cash benefits paid out to recipients. Additionally, adopting a benefit-offset model could increase beneficiaries' attachment to the labor force by making work more attractive. ", "On the other hand, benefit offset may induce only a small number of beneficiaries to increase their earnings (i.e., those beneficiaries who park their earnings). Although benefit outlays from the DI trust fund would decrease under this scenario, such savings would have little impact on the solvency of the DI trust fund. Additionally, by making it easier for recipients to maintain their eligibility for benefits, benefit offset could decrease the SSDI termination rate further, which, in turn, could increase the total number of beneficiaries on the rolls. Furthermore, benefit offset may increase the attractiveness of SSDI benefits, impelling more workers to apply to the program.", "SSA is currently in the process of conducting a Benefit Offset National Demonstration (BOND) project, in which treatment participants lose $1 in benefits for every $2 in earnings exceeding a BOND Yearly Amount (BYA) equal to 12 times the monthly SGA limit. Some BOND participants are also eligible for Enhanced Work Incentives Counseling (EWIC), which is designed to address a range of issues related to returning to work, including access to medical treatment, employment services, and job training. In implementing BOND, SSA seeks to test whether benefit offset can increase earnings and reduce dependence on SSDI for work-oriented beneficiaries.", "In preparation for BOND, SSA implemented a four-state pilot program known as the Benefit Offset Pilot Demonstration (BOPD) from 2005 to 2008. According to SSA, participation in the BOPD had a positive effect on the earnings of individuals in the treatment group; however, the pilot also increased average benefit payments because of partial payments made to beneficiaries whose benefits would have been suspended under normal program rules for earning above SGA.", "In August 2013, SSAB called for the early termination of BOND. The board cited the implementation problems associated with the pilot program and BOND's low participation rate as evidence that BOND would likely fail to increase beneficiary return-to-work rates in a cost effective manner.

Most supported-work policies use financial incentives to encourage employers to provide preventive, accommodative, rehabilitative, and other return-to-work services. Although Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA; P.L. 101-336 , as amended) requires employers to provide some level of reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities in the workplace, some employers fail to comply with the provisions of the ADA.

In essence, an insurer calculates a firm's insurance premium based on the likelihood, or risk, of the firm submitting a future claim given its previous behavior. Many types of employer-sponsored insurance use experience rating to determine premiums, including state workers' compensation (WC), unemployment insurance (UI), and private disability insurance (PDI). Because premiums are a function of past claims, firms' costs reflect their use of the insurance program, creating incentives for them to reduce the number of claims.", "To reduce the incidence of SSDI receipt, several researchers have suggested that the federal government should experience rate the employer's portion of the payroll tax used to fund SSDI. Currently, employers pay the same payroll tax rate, regardless of the rate at which their employees enroll in the program. However, an experience rated system would link payroll tax rates to the claim rate, which would give employers an additional incentive to support disabled workers. ", "Proponents of experience rating often point to its use in the Netherlands' disability insurance (DI) system as evidence of its potential impact in the United States. Between 1998 and 2003, the Netherlands gradually incorporated experience rating into its DI system. According to one study, instituting experience-rated DI premiums resulted in a 15% reduction in the Dutch DI incidence rate. Since the early 2000s, the Netherlands has witnessed a marked decline in its DI prevalence rate. ", "Experience rating could be implemented relatively simply. Employers already report payroll tax data to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which the agency shares with SSA. Moreover, most employers are accustomed to the concept of experience rating because of their experience paying state WC and UI premiums. By compiling both payroll tax and beneficiary award data, SSA could experience rate the SSDI payroll tax \"without imposing substantial new reporting requirements or administrative burdens on employers.\"", "Opponents of experience rating argue that the policy would adversely affect some workers. For example, experience rating could make employers hesitant to hire or retain workers \"perceived to be a high risk for disability.\" Employers may discriminate against older workers, people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, or individuals prone to risky behaviors. To address this possibility, supporters of experience rating suggest implementing risk adjustments specific to factors such as age, occupation, and health status, as well as enforcing existing anti-discrimination laws.", "Critics also point out that experience rating could reduce the compensation of low-wage workers. For instance, some employers subject to higher payroll tax rates could shift the additional cost onto workers in the form of reduced take-home pay or benefits. Employers unable to shift additional labor costs onto their employees may instead offset the higher payroll tax rate by hiring fewer workers in the future. Since low-wage individuals tend to work in professions with high rates of disability, they may be disproportionately affected by employer cost avoidance and therefore more likely to suffer financially. Opponents argue that workers harmed by employer cost avoidance could end up on SSDI, increasing the size of the program. ", "Furthermore, some critics say that while the system changes employers' incentives, it fails to address the incentives for workers to apply for SSDI. For example, some workers may apply in response to factors beyond the employers' control, such as low market wages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Employer-Sponsored Private Disability Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Another option to reduce the number of SSDI beneficiaries is for the federal government to promote employer-sponsored private disability insurance (PDI). PDI provides beneficiaries with a partial wage replacement and return-to-work services. As of March 2014, 40% of all workers in private industry had access to short-term disability (STD) insurance, and 34% had access to long-term disability (LTD) insurance. STD insurance typically lasts a fixed number of weeks or months, while LTD insurance can last anywhere from a year to several decades. PDI is less expensive than other forms of employer-sponsored insurance, such as health care. In addition, employers can partially offset the cost of PDI by requiring employees to contribute to the insurance plans. ", "Some researchers have advocated that the federal government should promote employer-sponsored PDI to reduce the growth in the SSDI rolls. Employer-sponsored PDI plans could reduce the incidence of SSDI benefit receipt, because they provide employment-support services soon after the onset of disability when the likelihood of recovery is highest. By intervening with robust supported-work services early in the disability process, PDI may keep workers with disabilities attached to the labor force and therefore reduce the number who apply for SSDI. ", "Offering employers financial incentives is one way to promote employer-sponsored PDI. For example, SSA could lower the tax rate of employers who purchase PDI and whose insurance agents coordinate with SSA to manage disability cases in a cost-effective manner. Alternatively, the federal government could award subsidies or tax credits to firms that provide PDI. ", "A second way to promote PDI would be to require all employers to provide it. Companies that refuse to provide PDI would be subject to possible legal action, financial penalties, or both. Currently, New Jersey, New York, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico require employers to contribute toward some form of STD insurance, generally known as temporary disability insurance (TDI). Employer-mandated PDI has become increasingly popular in many European countries. The Netherlands, for example, requires employers to cover the cost of sick pay for two years following the onset of a disabling condition, while the U.K. requires employers to pay up to six months of statutory sick pay. ", "Researchers David Autor and Mark Duggan have proposed requiring all employers to provide short-term PDI, which would provide workers with rehabilitation services, workplace accommodation, and a partial wage replacement for two years. Under this proposal, plans would be purchased on the existing PDI market, and employers would be permitted to require employees to contribute up to 40% of the cost of their coverage. Following the exhaustion of employer-sponsored PDI, beneficiaries who are found to be disabled would qualify for SSDI. Workers with extremely severe or terminal disabilities would be exempt from the two-year PDI requirement and would qualify for SSDI immediately.", "Using the financial incentives approach would be relatively simple, because the federal government already encourages employers to hire workers with disabilities by offering tax credits to offset the cost of providing workplace accommodation. Having SSA work with employers and insurers under an experience-rating system would likely require significantly more resources than the tax credit proposal, but the system could be structured to limit federal costs. In spite of these advantages, financial incentives might be ineffective. As noted above, the federal government currently offers employers tax incentives to hire workers with disabilities; however, the evidence that such incentives actually drive employers to hire such workers has been \"limited and inconclusive.\" Similarly, the lure of a lower payroll tax rate under an experience-rating model may not cause employers to purchase PDI, especially if the cost of providing PDI outweighs any savings from the reduced payroll tax rate.", "A mandate, on the other hand, would likely have a larger effect. The prospect of having to pay financial penalties due to noncompliance is typically a more powerful incentive for employers than tax credits. Although a government mandate does not guarantee universal compliance because some employers could simply pay the appropriate penalty, requiring employers to provide PDI might still have a marked effect on the inflow of beneficiaries into the SSDI program.", "One of the biggest unknown factors of the mandate approach outlined by Autor and Duggan is whether the private insurance market can offer an economically feasible two-year PDI plan. Most insurers sell PDI plans as either short-term (around 26 weeks) or long-term (anywhere from a year to several decades). Although both types of PDI cost employers about the same amount per hour worked, LTD insurance plans typically have stricter eligibility standards. For instance, LTD plans may have more stringent definitions of disability or have a larger list of pre-existing medical conditions that make employees ineligible. LTD plans are generally stricter because beneficiaries could receive benefits for years or even decades. To offset some of the risk associated with LTD plans, insurers often require beneficiaries to apply for SSDI after the onset of disability and deduct any SSDI income from a beneficiary's LTD benefit. However, because the Autor and Duggan proposal does not permit insurers to offset part of their costs by requiring beneficiaries to apply for SSDI, such two-year PDI plans may not be financially viable in the current insurance market.", "Autor and Duggan contend that their proposal would be economically feasible for insurers because their PDI plan would be less generous that current LTD policies. Based on their conversations with private insurers, they believe that two-year policies would not substantially increase the costs associated with PDI. ", "Additionally, private insurers could simply raise premiums to a level sufficient to make two-year PDI policies profitable. The extent to which insurers could raise rates would depend on the structure of the federal mandate as well as on state insurance laws. However, if insurers raised premiums too high and compliance penalties for employers were too low or not adequately enforced, then employers could choose not to provide PDI."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acronyms", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
