FDA divides that responsibility into two phases. In the preapproval (premarket) phase, FDA reviews manufacturers' applications to market drugs in the United States; a drug may not be sold unless it has FDA approval. Once a drug is on the market, FDA continues its oversight of drug safety and effectiveness. That postapproval (postmarket) phase lasts as long as the drug is on the market. Beginning with the Food and Drugs Act of 1906, Congress and the President have incrementally refined and expanded FDA's responsibilities regarding drug approval and regulation.", "The progression to drug approval begins before FDA involvement. First, basic scientists work in the laboratory and with animals; second, a drug or biotechnology company develops a prototype drug. That company must seek and receive FDA approval, by way of an investigational new drug (IND) application, to test the product with human subjects. It carries out those tests, called clinical trials, sequentially in Phase I, II, and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analysis in a new drug application (NDA).", "At that point, FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identity, strength, quality, and purity. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and associated regulations detail the requirements for each step. FDA uses a few special mechanisms to expedite drug development and the review process when a drug might address an unmet need or a serious disease or condition. Those mechanisms include accelerated approval, animal efficacy approval, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and priority review.", "Once FDA has approved an NDA, the drug may enter the U.S. market, but FDA continues to address drug production, distribution, and use. Its activities, based on ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, address product integrity, labeling, reporting of research and adverse events, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, and direct-to-consumer advertising, all topics in which Congress has traditionally been interested.", "FDA seeks to ensure product integrity through product and facility registration; inspections; chain-of-custody documentation; and technologies to protect against counterfeit, diverted, subpotent, adulterated, misbranded, and expired drugs. FDA's approval of an NDA includes the drug's labeling; the agency may require changes once a drug is on the market based on new information. It also prohibits manufacturer promotion of uses that are not specified in the labeling. The FFDCA requires that manufacturers report to FDA adverse events related to its drugs; clinicians and other members of the public may report adverse events to FDA. The agency's surveillance of drug-related problems, which had primarily focused on analyses of various adverse-event databases, is now expanding to more active uses of evolving computer technology and links to other public and private information sources.", "The FFDCA allows FDA to require a manufacturer to conduct postapproval studies of drugs. The law specifies when FDA must attach that requirement to the NDA approval and when FDA may issue the requirement after a drug is on the market. To manage exceptional risks of drugs, FDA may also require patient or clinician guides and restrictions on distribution.

Two regulatory frameworks support the FDA's review of prescription drugs. First, FDA reviews the safety and effectiveness of new drugs that manufacturers wish to market in the United States; this process is called premarket approval or preapproval review . Second, once a drug has passed that threshold and is FDA-approved, FDA acts through its postmarket or post approval regulatory procedures.", "This report is a primer on drug approval and regulation: it describes (1) how drugs are approved and come to market, including FDA's role in that process and (2) FDA and industry roles once drugs are on the pharmacy shelves."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative History of Drug Regulation", "paragraphs": ["The regulation of drugs by the federal government began with the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, which prohibited the interstate commerce of adulterated and misbranded drugs.

", "Over the next half-century, Congress and the President enacted two major pieces of legislation expanding FDA's authority. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) was enacted in 1938, requiring that drugs be proven safe before manufacturers may sell them in interstate commerce. Then, in 1962, in the wake of deaths and birth defects from the tranquilizer thalidomide marketed in Europe, the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments to the FFDCA was enacted, increasing safety provisions and requiring that manufacturers show drugs to be effective as well.", "The FFDCA has been amended many times, leading to FDA's current mission of assuring Americans that the medicines they use do no harm and actually work\u2014that they are, in other words, safe and effective . In recent decades Congress and the President have enacted additional laws to boost pharmaceutical research and development and to speed the approval of new medicines. (See Table 1 for examples.) The history of FDA law, regulation, and practice reflects the tension between making drugs available to the public and ensuring that those drugs be safe and effective. Advocates of industry, public health, consumers, and patients with specific diseases urge FDA (and Congress) to act\u2014sometimes to speed up and sometimes to slow down the approval process. As science evolves and public values change, finding an appropriate balance between access and safety and effectiveness is an ongoing challenge.", "Since the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the budget for FDA's human drugs program has had two funding streams: budget authority (annual discretionary appropriations from the General Fund of the Treasury) and user fees. The user fee supplementation of the program's budget initially went to a narrowly defined set of activities to eliminate the backlog of new drug applications pending FDA review and to maintain an increased staff effort on incoming applications. With each five-year reauthorization, Congress and the President have expanded the range of activities the fees may cover. The 2012 reauthorization added similar fee collection authority for the review of generic drug applications. ", "While not the focus of this report, FDA also regulates products other than drugs\u2014for example, biological products, medical devices, dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics, animal drugs, and tobacco products.

The IND application includes information about the proposed clinical study design, completed animal test data, and the lead investigator's qualifications. It must also include the written approval of an Institutional Review Board, which has determined that the study participants will be made aware of the drug's investigative status and that any risk of harm will be necessary, explained, and minimized. The application must include an \"Indication for Use\" section that describes what the drug does and the clinical condition and population for which the manufacturer intends its use.

FDA has interpreted this term to mean that the manufacturer must provide at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical studies, each providing convincing evidence of effectiveness. The agency, however, exercises flexibility in what it requires as evidence. As its regulations describe in detail, FDA can assess safety and effectiveness in a variety of ways, relying on combinations of studies by the manufacturer and reports of other studies in the medical literature. For some NDAs, FDA convenes advisory panels of outside experts to review the clinical data. While not bound by their recommendations regarding approval, FDA usually follows advisory panel recommendations.", "FDA approves an NDA based on its review of the clinical and nonclinical research evidence of safety and effectiveness, manufacturing controls and facility inspection, and labeling. An approval may include specific conditions, such as required postapproval studies (or postapproval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials ) that the sponsor must conduct after marketing begins. An approval may also include restrictions on distribution, required labeling disclosures, or other elements of REMS, which are described below in the section titled \"How FDA Regulates Approved Drugs.\"", "The statute requires FDA to approve an NDA within 180 days after the filing of an application, or an additional period agreed upon by FDA and the applicant. In 1992, pursuant to PDUFA, FDA agreed to specific goals and created a two-tiered system of review times: Standard Review and Priority Review. Compared with the amount of time standard review generally takes (approximately 10 months), a Priority Review designation means FDA's goal is to take action on an application within 6 months. If FDA finds deficiencies, such as missing information, the clock stops until the manufacturer submits the additional information. If the manufacturer cannot respond to FDA's request (e.g., if it has not done a required study, making it impossible to evaluate safety or effectiveness), the manufacturer may voluntarily withdraw the application. If and when the manufacturer can provide the information, the clock resumes and FDA continues the review.", "When FDA makes a final determination to approve an NDA, the agency sends the applicant an approval letter or a tentative approval letter if the NDA meets requirements for approval but cannot be approved due to a patent or exclusivity period for the listed drug. If FDA determines that an NDA does not meet the requirements for approval, the agency sends a \"complete response letter\" describing the specific deficiencies the agency identified and recommending ways to make the application viable. An unsuccessful applicant may request a hearing. Regulations identify the reasons for which FDA can reject an NDA, which include problems with clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness for its proposed use, manufacturing facilities and controls, labeling, access to facilities or testing samples, human subject protections, and patent information.", "Supplemental NDA. In order to make a change to an approved NDA\u2014for example, to change the labeling, manufacturing process, or dosing, or to add a new indication (i.e., new use)\u2014the manufacturer must submit a supplement (also referred to as a supplemental NDA). Agency regulations describe the required contents of those applications. Regarding clinical data, the applicant must submit descriptions and analysis of controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, as well as \"a description and analysis of any other data or information relevant to an evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of the drug product obtained or otherwise received by the applicant from any source, foreign or domestic, including information derived from clinical investigations, including controlled and uncontrolled studies of uses of the drug other than those proposed in the application, commercial marketing experience, reports in the scientific literature, and unpublished scientific papers.\" The 21 st Century Cures Act amended these requirements to allow reliance upon qualified data summaries to support approval of a supplemental application for a qualified use of a drug. Data summaries may be used only if existing safety data are available and acceptable to FDA, and all data used to develop the qualified data summaries are submitted as part of the supplemental application. The 21 st Century Cures Act also required the establishment of a program at FDA to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence (RWE) to support a new indication for an approved drug.

Rather than replicate and submit data from animal, clinical, and bioavailability studies, the generic drug applicant relies on FDA's previous findings of safety and effectiveness of the approved brand drug. To obtain premarket approval of the generic, the sponsor submits an ANDA demonstrating that the generic product is pharmaceutically equivalent (e.g., has the same active ingredient[s], strength, dosage form, route of administration) and bioequivalent to the brand-name product.

Such designation does not alter the types of evidence required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Accelerated approval and animal efficacy approval change what is needed in an application. For accelerated approval, rather than requiring evidence of effectiveness on the final clinical endpoint, approval may be based on effectiveness on a surrogate or intermediate clinical outcome. Under the Animal Rule, when human efficacy trials are not ethical or feasible, approval may be based on adequate and well-controlled animal efficacy studies. Priority review designation affects the timing of the review, not the process (neither content nor timing) leading to submission of an application. ", " Table 2 compares these mechanisms across several development and review characteristics.", "In addition to the five mechanisms described above, various laws have provided FDA with other tools aimed at bringing products to the public. Through statutory authorities and regulatory actions, FDA provides incentives to those who would develop certain categories of drugs. The main set of incentives is the granting of market exclusivity, while a newer incentive is providing priority review vouchers. The FFDCA has provisions to grant regulatory exclusivity for statutorily defined time periods (in months or years) to the holder of the NDA for a product that is, for example, the first generic version of a drug to come to market, a drug used in the treatment of a rare disease or condition, certain pediatric uses of approved drugs, and new qualified infectious disease products. During the period of exclusivity, FDA does not grant marketing approval to another manufacturer's product. FDA may award a priority review voucher (shortening the time from an application's submission to FDA's approval decision) to the manufacturer with a successful NDA for a drug used for certain tropical diseases, rare pediatric diseases, or agents that present national security threats. The manufacturer may use the voucher (or sell it to another manufacturer) to get priority review of a subsequent NDA.", "Other options fit limited situations and support shorter times from idea to approved public use.

Protecting the supply chain from counterfeit, diverted, subpotent, substandard, adulterated, misbranded, or expired drugs remains an essential concern of the agency. But as drug production has shifted to a global supply chain, FDA has broadened the scope of the way it monitors manufacturers, processers, packagers, importers, and distributors. The FFDCA dictates requirements that manufacturers must meet, and it allows FDA to regulate manufacturing facilities, warehouses, and transportation plans. For example, among many other requirements, the FFDCA requires (1) annual registration, including a unique facility identifier, of any domestic or foreign establishment \"engaged in the manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing of a drug or drugs\" or their excipients (such as fillers, preservatives, or flavors) for U.S. distribution; (2) registration of importers; (3) submission of lists of products, including ingredients and labeling; (4) adherence to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP); (5) various inspection requirements including risk-based facility inspections, inspection of drug lots for packaging and labeling control, and \"sampling and testing of in-process materials and drug products;\" and (6) numerous reporting requirements, among other actions.", "FDA monitors product integrity beyond the drug's initial manufacture. It continues as the drug moves throughout the supply chain from its manufacturer to one or more wholesale distributors to the entity that dispenses it to the patient. Title II of the Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (DQSA; P.L. 113-54 ), the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, established track-and-trace requirements for prescription drugs, to be implemented over a period of 10 years. Among other things, the law requires manufacturers and repackagers to a put a product identifier, including a standardized numerical identifier, on each package and homogenous case. With certain exceptions, exchange of transaction information, histories, and statements is required when a manufacturer, repackager, wholesale distributor, or dispenser transfers or accepts a drug. The law also requires a system of verification and notification when FDA or a trading partner within the supply chain suspects that a product may be suspect or illegitimate, and for the Secretary to establish national standards for the licensing of wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. ", "One area of federal and state interest is the practice of drug compounding. While FDA regulates drug manufacturers, the regulation of pharmacies and pharmacists has generally resided with state boards of pharmacy. The regulation of compounding pharmacies\u2014where a pharmacist compounds (mixes) ingredients to create a product that differs from an FDA-approved drug based on a prescription for a specific patient\u2014is a state function. However, in past years, some businesses licensed as pharmacies have engaged in compounding large amounts of a drug without corresponding patient-specific prescriptions and then selling the drug out of state. In 2012, long-term concern about the practice came to the forefront with an epidemic of fungal meningitis that CDC and FDA have traced back to a compounding business. The following year, Title I of the DQSA, the Compounding Quality Act, created a new category of drug compounders called outsourcing facilities , a term that describes entities that compound sterile drugs in circumstances that go beyond what the FFDCA allows pharmacies to do under state regulation (e.g., an outsourcing facility might compound drugs in bulk for use in hospitals and other facilities). Unlike traditional compounding pharmacies, outsourcing facilities are required to register with FDA and are subject to CGMPs, in addition to other requirements.

Health professionals and patients may report adverse events to FDA's reporting system at any time.

Not all AEs may be actual drug reactions. Using large surveillance data sets such as FAERS and with an understanding of the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic functioning of various drugs, FDA scientists review the reported AEs to assess which ones may indicate a drug problem. They then use information gleaned from the surveillance data to determine a course of action. FDA might recommend a change in drug labeling to alert users to a potential problem or, perhaps, require the manufacturer to study the observed association between the drug and the adverse event.", "Unlike planned studies with hypotheses to support or refute, for which researchers gather information, most surveillance activities are characterized as passive , in that the information is submitted by others. The agency only learns of an adverse event when someone reports it. There are limitations to that approach.

Other actual drug effects may be unrecognized as such and consequently not be reported.

In 2016, Sentinel moved out of its pilot phase and began operating on a larger scale. An FDAAA-required independent, third-party interim assessment in 2015 noted that Sentinel had already formed partnerships with 19 data organizations covering 178 million lives, allowing more precise estimates of usage and possible adverse events. The analyses had informed FDA decisions to both take and not take actions. However, a 2017 article presented more mixed opinions.
