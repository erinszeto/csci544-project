Over four years of recovery, the annual rate of growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged 2%, well below the 3% to 5% typical of other post-WWII recoveries. As a result, the output gap\u2014the difference between what the economy could produce and what it actually produced\u2014has only declined from a high of 8.1% in mid-2009 to a still large 5.8% in mid- 2013.

However, fiscal stimulus has steadily dissipated since 2010 and in 2013 the federal budget has turned contractionary. While monetary policy is expected to remain stimulative through 2013, it is unlikely to add to that stimulus to counteract the increasing drag of falling federal budget deficits on economic activity. Therefore, sustaining the recovery's momentum in the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 may require a greater push from private spending, particularly household consumption spending.", "In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 recession, which involved a substantial loss of net worth and increase in the burden of debt, households' actions to repair their severely damaged balance sheets by reducing debt and building wealth is thought by many economists to be a key factor dissipating the strength of consumer spending. Although this repair is necessary for building a stronger economy in the long run, it has slowed the economy-wide recovery and job creation in the short run.", "Where households currently stand in repairing their balance sheets is likely to influence the strength of consumer spending going forward. If substantially complete, it would point to the prospect of stronger consumer spending and increased momentum of the economic recovery; but if substantial wealth building is still needed, it would diminish that prospect.", "A number of indicators paint a mixed picture of the prospect for stronger consumer spending. Despite clear progress, more repair of the severely damaged household balance sheet may be needed before households begin to spend at a faster pace. The typical household has likely only seen modest improvement in its net worth in large measure because the value of real estate, most often the largest asset it holds, has only recently been increasing. The rebound of the housing market portends progress for the typical household rebuilding its wealth, but it is unlikely that this process will be completed in 2013, making it also likely that tepid spending by consumers will continue.", "Determining the state of household net worth has implications for the optimal policy response going forward. If household net worth is judged to have not fully recovered from the damage incurred in 2007-2009, particularly for the typical household, some may regard this as an indicator of a continuing need for macroeconomic policy to provide stimulus to maintain the recovery's upward momentum.

Since the 1980s, consumption spending's share of GDP has averaged between 65% and 70% and during previous post-war recoveries consumption spending has typically increased at a 4%-5% annual pace. Typically, a strong rebound by the largest component of final demand was a central driver sustaining the momentum of economic recovery, causing a quick closing of the output gap opened up by the preceding recession, and a quick return to full employment. This recovery, however, has been characterized by relatively weak consumption spending by households, averaging a sluggish 2% annual pace for the four-year period. Several factors have likely contributed to households spending less vigorously in this recovery than in previous economic recoveries. Persistent high rates of unemployment have directly dampened spending by decreasing income for millions of households and more broadly dampened spending by eroding consumers' confidence in their immediate economic prospects. In addition, sharp spikes in energy prices in 2010 and 2012 had significant negative effects on household budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Impact of a Large Decrease in Household Wealth", "paragraphs": ["Many economists have argued that the most important factor making consumer spending in this recovery historically weak is that, unlike previous post-war recessions in which reduced household income impeded spending, the 2007-2009 recession carried with it an enormous decrease in household net worth (wealth) caused by the associated collapse of the housing and stock markets. The $542 billion or 5.3% decrease in disposable income during the recession was large but substantially smaller than the decline in aggregate household wealth, which decreased by $16.4 trillion or 26% (see Figure 2 ).", "However, the loss of wealth for the typical household was proportionately greater than the fall of aggregate household wealth. A clearer view of the damage to the net worth of a typical household is provided by the change in median household net worth\u2014the level of net worth at which half the households are richer and half poorer. The estimated decrease in median household real net worth was 39%. Overall, it is estimated that the bottom 80% of households lost two decades' worth of wealth.", "Although declines in the values of financial assets or businesses were important factors for some families, owner equity in the home has typically constituted 75%-80% of households' total assets. Therefore, the decrease in the median household's net worth appears to have been driven most strongly by an $8.4 trillion or 35% decrease in the value of real estate assets that began in 2006 and continued through mid-2011 (see Figure 3 ). The variation in housing wealth is largely explained by changes in home values, rather than changes in home ownership rates, which have remained largely unchanged. A commonly used measure of home prices is the Case-Shiller index, which tracks home prices in 20 metropolitan regions. Over the 2006-2011 period, the Case-Shiller index fell 33% and its path essentially mirrors the path of the value of household real estate assets (see Figure 4 ).", "Research suggests that housing wealth has a much stronger impact on household spending than does financial wealth, making it a major factor governing consumption spending by most households. It is estimated that a one-time decrease in housing wealth of 1% leads to a 0.10% decrease in consumer spending each year afterward. On the other hand, the same change in financial wealth (i.e., stocks, bonds, pension funds) led to a smaller 0.03% permanent decrease in consumer spending. That degree of consumption sensitivity to housing wealth implies that the 35% decrease in housing wealth experienced between 2006 and 2011 would reduce household consumption by 3.5% or by about $350 billion, which is equivalent to more than half of the $680 billion economy-wide contraction of real GDP during the 2007-2009 recession."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Added Burden on Households of Increased Financial Leverage", "paragraphs": ["The loss of wealth by itself would have likely caused households to divert more income from consumption to saving in an attempt to rebuild their net worth. However, there was another exacerbating factor\u2014a sharp increase in financial leverage. Leverage is the degree to which household assets are financed with debt and is typically measured as the ratio of household debt to assets. In 2007 the leverage ratio of households balance sheet was at a historically high 18%, up from 14% in 2000. With the collapse of asset prices that began in 2006, the leverage ratio would rise, reaching over 21% at the end of the recession in mid-2009 (see Figure 5 ).", "Many analysts argued that this \"debt overhang\" created an additional motive for household deleveraging, giving rise to a further diversion of current income to balance sheet repair and, in turn, causing slower aggregate spending. Sharply rising debt likely dampens household spending by raising financial discomfort, increasing debt service costs, and reducing access to credit markets. A recent study suggests that highly leveraged households had larger declines in spending than other households, despite having smaller changes in net worth.", "Together, a substantial loss of net worth and historically high leverage created a particularly weak aggregate household balance sheet, increasing the severity of the 2007-2009 recession and slowing the pace of the subsequent recovery. Research suggests that roughly two out of every three jobs lost between 2007 and 2009 were attributable to household balance sheet weakness leading to weak consumption spending . Similarly, unlike in earlier post-war recoveries, the need for households to rebuild a sizable amount of lost wealth and to reduce a large debt overhang would cause a substantial diversion of current income from consumption spending to saving. The process of repairing the household balance sheet has been, arguably, a major factor causing the below average pace of the economic recovery since 2009. The ratio of net worth to disposable income is one indicator that households have been repairing their balance sheets; it has been increasing, moving from a recession low of 4.5 to 5.9 in the first quarter of 2013 (see Figure 6 ). Since the start of the recession, the personal saving rate also shows that a larger share of income has been directed toward wealth building. Saving rose from about 2% of income prior to the recession to near 6% during the recession, and it has remained above 5% during the recovery (see Figure 7 )."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Current State of Household Net Worth", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aggregate Nominal Household Net Worth is Now Above the Pre-Crisis Level", "paragraphs": ["Aggregate household net worth has more than fully recouped the wealth lost during the 2008-2009 recession.

The increase in household wealth since 2009 was the net effect of a rising value of assets and falling value of liabilities (debt) although the former was by far the largest contributor to the improvement in net worth (see Figure 8 ). Since the first quarter of 2009, the value of total assets held by households increased by $17.8 trillion, representing about 97% of the increase in net worth, whereas total liabilities fell by $0.5 trillion, representing the remaining 3% of the increase in net worth.

Although inflation has been historically low since the beginning of the recession in late 2007, consumer prices, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, have increased at an annual rate near 2%; the cumulative effect has resulted in a decrease in the purchasing power of a dollar of wealth over the 2007-2013 period by 9.6%. Deflating the current value of household net worth by that factor reduces aggregate net worth in the first quarter of 2013 from $70.3 trillion to $64.3 trillion in 2007dollars; placing real net worth about $4.0 trillion or about 6% short of full recovery of the 2007 level of purchasing power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assets With Greatest Increase in Value Since 2009 Are Not Widely Held", "paragraphs": ["The aggregate net worth numbers masks a significant change in the composition of the households underlying assets. On the asset side, the total gain of household net worth was $10.8 trillion. Most (96%) of that gain was highly concentrated in financial assets (i.e., bank deposits, stocks, bonds, pension fund reserves), which increased by $10.4 trillion, and the share of financial assets that comprise total household assets increased from 63% to 69% (see Figure 9 ). The value of households' nonfinancial assets increased a comparatively modest $2.2 trillion, an increase that was largely the consequence of a like-sized increase in the value of household real estate holdings and is relatively recent, beginning in mid-2011. In addition, non-financial assets share of total household assets has fallen from a pre-crisis share of 35 % to 31% currently.", "The possible significance of this shift toward holding more financial assets as a percentage of totals assets is that such assets are not held widely, tending to be concentrated among a relatively small number of wealthier households whose tendency to spend in response to a rise in wealth is likely relatively low. Census data indicates that the real net worth of the median household, at least through 2011, had not increased. Data on the wealth of the median household are only available for select years, the most recent being 2011. In 2005, median household net worth was estimated to be $93,200; at the recessions trough in 2009, it had fallen to $68,900; and remained essentially unchanged in 2011 at $68,800. The lack of improvement in the median household's net worth is largely a reflection of the decline in the value of household real estate holdings; historically a major component of the median household's wealth. Home equity fell by more than $7 trillion from 2006 to 2009 and has only begun to recover since 2012 (see Figure 10 ), for which median wealth data are not yet available. Consequently, most households have not seen the degree of recovery in their net worth indicated by the aggregate numbers and have a commensurately smaller inducement to boost spending.", "Looking at the aggregate home equity data, during much of this period, more than 30% of all mortgages were estimated to be \"underwater,\" meaning that the remaining balance of the mortgage exceeded the value of the home.

That decline was more than fully explained by a $1.3 trillion decrease in mortgage debt. (Other components of total liabilities, such as consumer credit, increased.) However, these aggregate liability numbers likely overstate changes in active debt repayment behavior by households due to the effect of charge-offs resulting from mortgage defaults that increased greatly between 2007 and 2013.

In the first quarter of 2013, the personal saving rate decreased to 2.5%. A fall in the saving rate could be an indicator of households turning away from balance sheet repair and toward increased consumption spending. However, the first quarter result could also be a manifestation of lower disposable income caused by the increase in the payroll tax in January. With income down, households may have reached into saving to maintain their level of consumption spending, an action unlikely to be sustainable. Real consumer spending in the first half of 2013 increased at an annual rate of 2.0%, slower than the 2.2% pace seen over the previous three years.
