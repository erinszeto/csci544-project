However, housing markets remain fragile, many economic indicators remain weak, and home foreclosure rates remain high. Against this backdrop, the 112th Congress has considered a number of housing-related issues. Broadly speaking, these issues include long-term questions related to reforms to the housing finance system, short-term concerns related to ongoing turmoil in housing markets, perennial issues related to housing assistance programs, and possible reductions in funding for housing programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).", "Given the role that housing played in the recent economic downturn, Congress has expressed interest in reforming the housing finance system to help protect the economy from similar problems in the future. In this vein, the 112th Congress has begun to consider long-term questions about the government's role in housing finance going forward. Such questions include the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) currently in government conservatorship, and the role of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The 112th Congress has also exercised its oversight powers with regard to the implementation of housing- and mortgage-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203), which was enacted during the 111th Congress. Such provisions include ability to repay standards that apply to mortgage originators and risk retention standards that apply to asset securitizers. Many Members of Congress have expressed concern about the implications that some of these provisions could have for private mortgage lending and access to mortgage credit.", "At the same time, the ongoing effects of the recent economic turmoil on consumers and housing markets raise questions about whether further government intervention is warranted in the short term to address ongoing foreclosure issues or to stimulate housing demand. The housing markets' fragility has also led to debates about whether policy options considered by the 112th Congress to reduce government involvement in the mortgage market would have negative effects on the housing recovery.", "Concerns about the nation's budget deficit have led to increased calls for reduced government spending, and an environment of fiscal austerity will likely have implications for housing-related programs and activities along with other domestic discretionary programs. A law providing full-year FY2011 appropriations was not enacted until several months into the 112th Congress, and that law included cuts to several HUD programs, including reduced funding for the Community Development Block Grant (CDGB) and HOME programs. Appropriations for FY2012 included further cuts to housing programs, although some specific programs saw increases in funding. The 112th Congress has also considered perennial issues related to housing for low-income and other vulnerable populations, including possible reforms to the public housing and Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher programs. The debate over the future of federal housing assistance programs has been affected, and will likely continue to be affected, by both the fiscal environment and the ongoing effects of the recent recession and turmoil in U.S. housing markets.", "This report provides a brief summary of major housing issues that have been active in the 112th Congress.

However, housing markets and the economy as a whole have both continued to appear fragile. In the short term, this raises policy questions about whether further government intervention is necessary or desirable to support housing markets, or if such intervention might postpone a necessary market correction. It also raises questions about whether scaling back government involvement in housing finance could further harm already weak housing markets. Finally, given perennial issues related to housing for low-income and other vulnerable populations, the weak economy and the tight fiscal environment raise questions about which housing programs to prioritize in an environment of lower federal spending.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Homeownership Markets", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, homeownership markets have, broadly speaking, been characterized by falling house prices and low housing demand. Low demand for owner-occupied housing may reflect lower rates of household formation and consumer sentiment that housing prices have not yet reached a bottom, among other factors. ", "Some housing market indicators began to show some signs of improvement during the first half of 2012. Such positive indicators include lower housing inventory and shadow inventory levels, rising home sales, slower declines or even increases in house prices, and lower rates of delinquent mortgages and mortgages entering the foreclosure process. However, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures remain at elevated levels. Further, many other economic indicators remain weak, and the continuation of such positive signs in housing markets likely depends largely on economic conditions, including job growth, going forward."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Homeownership Rates", "paragraphs": ["By the first quarter of 2012, the national homeownership rate had fallen to a seasonally adjusted rate of 65.6%, its lowest rate since 1997 and down from a peak of over 69% in the second quarter of 2004. The decrease in the homeownership rate is due both to more households delaying homeownership and to former homeowners becoming renter households after losing their homes through foreclosure or distressed sales. Figure 1 shows the trend in national homeownership rates since 1990. Some analysts note that, when home foreclosures that are likely to occur in the next few years are factored in, the effective homeownership rate is likely to be even lower since many current homeowners will eventually lose their homes to foreclosure and are likely to become renters. ", "More households delaying homeownership or choosing to rent, along with tightened underwriting standards for mortgages, has depressed demand for homes. This depressed demand, along with a large inventory of unsold homes, has continued to put downward pressure on house prices in many areas of the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "House Prices", "paragraphs": ["On a national level, home prices increased sharply for several years until the mid-2000s, at which point house prices began to grow more slowly and then eventually to fall precipitously. Figure 2 illustrates the trend in year-over-year house price appreciation using the housing price index (HPI) published by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The graph shows that, after years of steady gains in house prices, house prices on a national level began to appreciate more slowly, and then depreciate, beginning around 2006. House prices continued to depreciate on a national level for several years, although in the last quarters of 2011 they depreciated at a lower rate. In the first quarter of 2012 house prices increased slightly (0.4%) from the same period the previous year for the first time since 2007, and in the second quarter of 2012 house prices displayed a 3% increase over the same period the previous year.", "The national trend shown in Figure 2 masks regional differences in house prices. While some areas saw steep increases in house prices during the housing boom of the mid-2000s, and then saw steep price declines in the recession that followed, other areas experienced only modest increases in house prices, no increases at all, or less dramatic house price decreases. Similarly, as house price declines begin to slow or reverse on a national level, individual markets may experience very different patterns. ", "Falling house prices have resulted in many homeowners owing more on their mortgages than their homes are now worth, a situation known as having negative equity or being \"underwater\" on one's mortgage. Industry analysts have estimated that nearly 24% of households with mortgages were in negative equity positions as of the first quarter of 2012, although the percentage of households with negative equity and the average amount of negative equity vary greatly by state and even within states. For example, Nevada has the highest percentage of households in negative equity positions at 61%, while Alaska has the lowest percentage at 6%. ", "Negative equity can make it harder for households to avoid foreclosure if they experience income loss or other situations that make it difficult to pay their mortgages, since homeowners with negative equity cannot sell their homes for a high enough price to pay off the mortgage amount that they owe. Negative equity can also impede home sales. If households cannot sell their homes for enough to pay off their mortgage debt, they are unlikely to place their homes on the market, even if they would prefer to move. Negative equity can also limit the ability of a household to refinance. Furthermore, negative equity can contribute to broader economic problems by reducing the amount of wealth that people have in their homes, possibly depressing consumer spending.

Units that had traditionally been owner occupied may be converted to rental housing by homeowners who need to move but cannot sell their properties at their desired price, or by investors who have purchased foreclosed homes. The resulting increase in the supply of rental housing could lead to reduced rental rates in markets. Conversely, as former homeowners become renters, and as fewer families decide to enter a turbulent home purchase market, demand for rental housing may increase, which could lead to increased rents. ", "While rental markets across the country are mixed, with regional markets ranging from soft to balanced to tight, the overall trend appears to be one of tightening.

There is also a third set of housing GSEs, the Federal Home Loan Banks, that are not in conservatorship. ", "In the 111 th Congress, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act, P.L. 111-203 ) required the Secretary of the Treasury to present recommendations by January 31, 2011, for ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. HUD and Treasury jointly released a report in February 2011 that recommended winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and offered three general options for the government's future role in the housing finance system. ", "The first option would have the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and other federal mortgage programs (the Department of Agriculture's rural mortgage programs and the Department of Veterans' Affairs' mortgage guarantees) be narrowly targeted. In particular, FHA would continue to provide mortgage insurance on loans to low- and moderate-income households. The second option would expand on the targeting proposed in the first option and add the capacity to scale up the federal mortgage programs in times of crisis. The third option would also expand on the first option, and add \"catastrophic reinsurance behind significant private capital.\" Under this option, the private sector would take the first losses, with the government providing reinsurance on certain types of mortgages and taking losses only if the private sector guarantors became insolvent. The government would charge the private sector for this re-insurance. More details on these options, including legislative language, have not been provided.", "More than 60 bills with provisions to reform, terminate, or modify the business practices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been introduced in the 112 th Congress. To date, two have become law. H.R. 3765 , the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011, requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase the fees they charge mortgage sellers to guarantee mortgages by at least 10 basis points (0.10%); the proceeds are to be deposited in the Treasury.

If a borrower with an FHA-insured mortgage defaults on that mortgage, FHA pays the lender who owns the loan the unpaid mortgage amount. FHA's single-family mortgage insurance program is funded through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) and has historically been self-financing; that is, it takes in enough money in premium revenue paid by borrowers to pay out any claims to lenders on defaulted mortgages. ", "FHA-insured mortgages, like all mortgages, have experienced increases in default and foreclosure rates in recent years. This, combined with falling house prices and other factors, has strained the MMI Fund. One measure of the health of the MMI Fund, the capital reserve ratio, has fallen below statutorily mandated levels in recent years. The capital reserve ratio measures the amount of funds that the MMI Fund has on hand to cover unexpected losses on the mortgages that FHA currently insures, above and beyond reserves set aside to cover expected losses. By law, the capital reserve ratio is to be 2% or higher. In FY2011, the capital reserve ratio fell to 0.24%, raising concerns that FHA may at some point need to draw on its permanent and indefinite budget authority with the Treasury to pay future claims. ", "To address the strain on the MMI Fund, FHA has taken a number of steps over the past several years to strengthen the Fund, including raising the insurance premiums charged to borrowers, tightening some of its underwriting criteria, and strengthening its oversight of FHA-approved lenders. FHA had the authority to take many of these steps administratively, although some required congressional action. ", "The 112 th Congress has also considered additional measures to strengthen the MMI Fund's financial position, including such possibilities as making further changes to insurance premiums, increasing reporting requirements, or providing FHA more authority with which to pursue lenders who have submitted loans for FHA insurance that do not adhere to FHA's standards. Legislation that has been introduced related to FHA includes one bill, the FHA Emergency Fiscal Solvency Act of 2012 ( H.R. 4264 ), that has been passed by the House of Representatives. ", "FHA has also seen a sharp increase in its market share in recent years. While some argue that FHA's larger market share is playing a key role in supporting the mortgage market in the current environment, others argue that the government, including FHA, is too involved in the mortgage market and that its role should be reduced. In the short term, Congress may consider actions that could reduce FHA's role in the mortgage market. In the longer term, FHA's future role in the mortgage market is likely to be considered as part of the larger discussion about the U.S. housing finance system and the future of the GSEs. The 112 th Congress has held several hearings on the future role of FHA in the mortgage market.", "For more information on FHA, see CRS Report RS20530, FHA-Insured Home Loans: An Overview , by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R40937, The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Risky Lending , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSE Conforming Loan Limits and FHA Maximum Mortgage Amounts", "paragraphs": ["In addition to questions about the long-term future of the GSEs and FHA, another issue confronted by the 112 th Congress relates to the GSEs' conforming loan limits and the maximum mortgage amounts that FHA can insure. ", "The conforming loan limit is a statutory limitation on the size of mortgages that the GSEs can buy. The conforming loan limit is the same in most areas of the country (currently $417,000), but the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 (ESA, P.L. 110-185 ) established higher limits in certain areas of the country deemed to be high-cost. ESA set the high-cost area limit at $729,750. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA, P.L. 110-289 ) established a lower limit in high-cost areas of $625,500. However, the higher limits established by ESA were extended a number of times, until the last extension expired at the end of FY2011. On October 1, 2011, the conforming loan limits in high-cost areas decreased to $625,500. ", "Much like the GSE conforming loan limits, FHA can only insure mortgages up to a certain principal amount that is set in statute. Unlike the GSE conforming loan limits, the FHA loan limits are based on area median home prices, and therefore vary more widely by area. There are also a national floor and a national ceiling that set loan limits in low-cost and high-cost areas, respectively, and are calculated as percentages of the national GSE conforming loan limit. Along with making changes to the GSE conforming loan limits, ESA temporarily raised the FHA loan limits in high-cost areas and some other areas.", "ESA specified that the FHA loan limit would temporarily be set at 125% of area median home prices in most areas, with a high-cost area limit of $729,750. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act established new statutory limits at 115% of area median home prices in most areas with a high-cost area limit of $625,500; however, the higher ESA limits were extended a number of times until the last extension expired at the end of FY2011. At that point, the loan limits briefly fell to HERA levels, until the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-55 ) reinstated the higher FHA loan limits under ESA until December 31, 2013. The higher GSE conforming loan limits were not extended in that legislation, despite proposals from some Members of Congress. ", "The 110 th Congress acted through ESA to temporarily increase the FHA maximum mortgage amount and the GSE conforming loan limit in high cost areas in response to tightening lending standards as the mortgage market began to deteriorate. As lending standards tightened, fewer borrowers were able to obtain loans that were not guaranteed by the GSEs or insured by FHA; however, the GSE and FHA loan limits prevented some borrowers from being able to purchase a home with a GSE- or FHA-backed mortgage, particularly in high-cost markets. The increased loan limits allowed more borrowers to obtain mortgages that could be purchased by the GSEs or insured by FHA. ", "Some policymakers have argued that the GSE conforming loan limits and the FHA loan limits should be allowed to fall as a first step in scaling back federal involvement in the mortgage market. Others, however, have argued that the loan limits should not be allowed to fall while housing markets are still fragile, suggesting that the lower limits would result in some qualified borrowers either being unable to purchase homes or paying higher costs to obtain a mortgage.

Several bills have been introduced that would attempt to further expand refinancing opportunities and reduce some of the barriers related to refinancing, and President Obama has advocated creating a program similar to HARP targeted at borrowers with non-GSE mortgages.

Advocates of principal reduction argue that it can be a cost-effective way to reduce foreclosures that benefits both borrowers and financial institutions when compared to the cost of a foreclosure. However, opponents of principal reduction argue that it is costly, difficult to target to the borrowers who would benefit from it the most, and could encourage borrowers who are able to pay to default on their mortgages in order to qualify. To date, FHFA has not allowed the GSEs to offer principal reductions on mortgages that they own or guarantee, or to participate in existing programs that include principal reduction.

", "The 112 th Congress has held hearings on proposals for national servicing standards, and a number of bills have been introduced in the 112 th Congress that would establish federal mortgage servicing standards to varying degrees. Some national mortgage servicing standards are designed to protect consumers. These proposals generally have at least one of three features. One is a requirement that servicers establish a single point of contact with the borrower. The single point of contact would be a case manager assigned to each borrower seeking a loan modification that would manage communications between the borrower and servicer and have the authority to decide if the borrower is eligible for a loan modification. A second feature is prohibition of dual tracking, which means servicers pursuing a loss mitigation option while simultaneously initiating a foreclosure process. The third feature involves establishing staffing requirements that would set minimum experience, education, and training levels for loan modification staff. Some legislation also proposes caseload limits for individual employees.", "Other proposed mortgage servicing standards are designed to ensure that servicers act in the best interest of the holders of the mortgage loans. Such proposals would prohibit servicers from purchasing services offered by their affiliates at inflated costs that are passed on to investors. Servicers would also be prohibited under these proposals from choosing a loss mitigation option that benefits their affiliates' share in the loans at the expense of other investors. ", "There also are non-legislative avenues through which mortgage servicing standards may be adopted. On August 10, 2012, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) issued proposed rules that would establish mortgage servicing standards that would apply to virtually every servicer and every mortgage in the United States. The proposed rules would amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). They would require mortgage servicers to comply with a number of billing disclosure and documentation standards, provide more advanced notice to consumers before changes in adjustable interest rates take effect, and to contact, by telephone and in writing, all delinquent mortgage borrowers to provide information on foreclosure mitigation options and to assign a specific employee to serve as the primary point of contact for each delinquent borrower. Additionally, the proposed regulations would impose restrictions on mortgage servicers' ability to charge borrowers for force-placed hazard insurance. The public comment period on the proposed rules is open until October 9, 2012. The CFPB plans to issue final rules by January of next year. ", "Although the CFPB's proposed rules would, if finalized, apply to the broadest range of mortgages, they are not the only \"uniform\" mortgage standards that are being considered and implemented by regulators and the industry. In February 2012, the nation's five largest mortgage servicers agreed to comply with extensive new servicing standards as part of a legal settlement with 49 state attorneys general and federal agencies. Separately, in response to deficiencies in the servicing of delinquent mortgages and implementation of foreclosures, the federal banking regulators entered into consent orders with the 14 largest U.S. mortgage servicers that require, among other things, those servicers to comply with various servicing standards. (The legal settlement and the consent orders are described in more detail in the next section.) Additionally, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is in the process of establishing servicing standards for mortgages in default that are either held or guaranteed by the two mortgage companies as part of its Servicing Alignment Initiative.

These alleged transgressions included signing affidavits without personal knowledge of the facts presented in the legal documents submitted to courts to support the right to foreclose; back-dating mortgage documents to fabricate evidence to give the appearance of compliance with state foreclosure requirements; failing to adhere to notarization requirements for foreclosure-related documents filed with courts; losing mortgage paperwork; assessing excessive fees against mortgage borrowers; failing to properly account for borrower mortgage payments; and failing to properly assess borrowers for eligibility in mortgage modification and other loss mitigation programs. Concerns about these illicit acts provoked a number of state and federal regulators to initiate multiple investigations, enforcement actions, lawsuits, and legal settlement negotiations. ", "Although the alleged servicer misconduct is a common thread in these regulatory actions, the legal authorities at the disposal of the regulators vary considerably. These disparate legal authorities appear to have affected the remedies sought and the speed at which resolutions could be secured. For example, each of the 14 largest U.S. mortgage servicers is organized as a depository institution that is primarily regulated by either the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Both the OCC and the FRB have the duty to ensure that the depositories under their jurisdiction are being run in a safe and sound manner in all respects, including in their mortgage servicing activities. To reach this end, these federal banking regulators have the authority to conduct examinations of the institutions under their jurisdiction and have very strong and flexible enforcement powers to rectify any problems, practices, or governing controls found during the course of those examinations that may jeopardize the financial soundness of an institution.", "Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, the federal banking regulators began on-site examinations of the foreclosure processes and governance protocols of these 14 servicers. During the examinations, they reviewed a sampling of mortgage files for which there were foreclosure actions pending during calendar years 2009 and 2010. The regulators \"found critical weaknesses in [the] servicers' foreclosure governance processes, foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party vendors, including foreclosure attorneys.\" As a result of these findings, the banking regulators entered into binding consent orders in April 2011 with all 14 mortgage servicers and several of the third-party service providers that the servicers used in various ways during foreclosure processes. The consent orders require servicers to redress homeowners harmed in the past, as well as to improve behavior going forward.", "Additionally, all 50 state attorneys general, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) initiated a separate investigation into foreclosure-related state and federal law violations by the top five mortgage servicers: Ally Financial, Inc. (formerly GMAC, Inc.); Bank of America, Corp.; Citigroup, Inc.; JP Morgan Chase & Co.; and Wells Fargo & Co. On February 8, 2012, these state and federal officials, with the exception of Oklahoma's attorney general, announced a \"National Mortgage Settlement\" covering certain legal claims with these five institutions. The settlement provides mortgage servicers some certainty regarding their legal liability, while securing monetary relief for individuals who lost homes through foreclosure in recent years and current homeowners who are struggling to maintain monthly payments.", "The agreements stipulate that the mortgage companies will comply with specified servicing standards going forward and will provide approximately $25 billion in direct aid to homeowners and government programs in exchange for a release of liability for legal claims that otherwise could have been raised against the servicers by the participating regulators. The servicing standards include requirements that servicers establish a single point of contact for each delinquent borrower; hire and maintain adequate levels of loss mitigation staff that meet minimum education, training, and experience standards; and maintain electronic documentation of servicing files and interactions with borrowers. The direct aid to homeowners includes principal reductions as well as restitution for individuals whose homes were foreclosed without them being offered loss mitigation options properly or who suffered other harm from other foreclosure-related improprieties.

Virtually every type of player in the mortgage market during the run-up to the housing market crash is suing, being sued, being investigated for potential legal liability, or engaging in negotiations to settle legal claims pertaining to mortgage-related activities. For example, mortgage brokers have been charged with money laundering and other fraudulent activity in violation of federal law. Mortgage originators have been charged with violating fair lending laws for discriminating against protected classes in marketing and originating mortgages. Federal regulators have levied mortgage-related fraud charges against bank directors and officers. Through negotiated settlements and private lawsuits, entities that purchased mortgages in the secondary market are seeking indemnification from sellers for the losses suffered from mortgages that allegedly failed to meet the underwriting standards that were promised pursuant to sales contracts. Mortgage-backed securities investors have raised federal and state securities law and fraud claims against institutions that securitized mortgages, marketed the securities, and sold the securities based on alleged material misstatements or omissions regarding the quality and characteristics of the mortgages underlying the securities.

The desire to limit discretionary spending has implications for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) budget, since it is made up almost entirely of discretionary appropriations. ", "More than three-quarters of HUD's appropriations are devoted to three programs: Section 8 rental assistance vouchers, Section 8 project-based rental assistance subsidies, and the public housing program. Section 8 vouchers make up the largest share of HUD's budget, accounting for nearly half of HUD's total budget. The cost of the Section 8 voucher program has been growing in recent years since Congress has created more vouchers each year over the past several years, and since the cost of renewing individual vouchers has been growing as gaps between low-income tenants' incomes and rents in the market have been growing. The cost of the project-based Section 8 program has also been growing in recent years as more and more long-term rental assistance contracts on older properties expire and are renewed, requiring new appropriations. Public housing, the third-largest expense in HUD's budget, has, arguably, been underfunded (based on studies undertaken by HUD of what it should cost to operate and maintain public housing) for many years, which means there is regular pressure from low-income housing advocates and others to increase funding for public housing. ", "In a budget environment featuring limits on discretionary spending, the pressure to provide more funding for HUD's largest programs must be balanced against the pressure from states, localities, and advocates to maintain or increase funding for other HUD programs, such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, grants for homelessness assistance, and funding for Native American housing.

The program is administered at the local level, by public housing authorities (PHAs), and provides vouchers\u2014portable rental subsidies\u2014to very low-income families, which they can use to reduce their rents in the private market units of their choice (subject to certain cost limits).

In recent years, annual appropriations laws have specified different formulas for allocating voucher funding; voucher reform legislation has sought to codify a permanent formula (although, even if enacted it could still be overridden in the appropriations acts). Finally, recent Section 8 voucher reform proposals have included modifications to and expansions of the Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration, which permits a selected group of PHAs to seek waivers of most federal rules and regulations governing the Section 8 voucher program and the public housing program.

The amount Congress typically provides in annual appropriations for capital needs has not been sufficient to address that backlog. In response, PHAs have increasingly relied on other sources of financing, particularly private market loans, to meet the capital needs of their housing stock. However, there are limits on the extent to which PHAs can borrow funds; most notably, they are generally restricted by federal rules from mortgaging their public housing properties.", "The Obama Administration's last several budgets requested funding and authority for a Transforming Rental Assistance initiative.
