The bill was passed in the House on May 3 by a vote of 309-118 and in the Senate on May 4 by a vote of 79-18. It provides continuing appropriations for 11 of the 12 annual appropriations bills (including the LHHS appropriations bill) through September 30, 2017. Under Title IV of Division H of the FY2017 omnibus, SSA's discretionary appropriations are $12.428 billion for the LAE account and $105.5 million for the OIG account. $1.819 billion of the LAE appropriation is for program integrity activities, which is composed of $273 million in base funding and $1.546 billion in cap adjustment funding. (This amount is the maximum cap adjustment permitted under the BBEDCA for FY2017; see Table 5 .) As shown in Table 7 , the totals and subtotals for the LAE and OIG accounts under the FY2017 omnibus are the same as the amounts passed by the Senate Committee on Appropriations for FY2017.", "The FY2017 appropriation for the LAE account includes a number of changes in the methodology for allocating funds as well as the use of those funds. First, the FY2017 omnibus provides a combined amount for the base LAE and program integrity work: $12.358 billion. The legislative language in the FY2017 omnibus specifies that $1.819 billion of the combined appropriation is dedicated for program integrity work. Thus, the base LAE amount is $12.358 billion minus $1.819 billion, which equals $10.539 billion. Second, unlike in past years, the appropriation for program integrity work is made available through the first half of the next fiscal year; in this case, through FY2018 (i.e., through March 31, 2018). Third, the FY2017 omnibus authorizes funding dedicated to program integrity work to be used for CDI units and costs associated with the prosecution of fraud by SAUSAs. Although the BBA 2015 authorized cap adjustment funding for program integrity work to be used for such activities, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( P.L. 114-113 ) specified that program integrity funding could be used only for CDRs and SSI nonmedical redeterminations for eligibility.", "The FY2017 omnibus provides $90 million from the LAE account to address the disability hearings backlog, which is 40% less than the $150 million authorized for such activities in the second FY2017 CR. However, unlike the second FY2017 CR, the FY2017 omnibus provides funding for the backlog through the end of the next fiscal year; in this case, through FY2018 (i.e., through September 30, 2018)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Trends in the Budget Request and the Appropriation for SSA's LAE Account", "paragraphs": ["Since SSA became an independent agency, the Commissioner's budget request for the LAE account has exceeded the President's budget request in nominal (i.e., unadjusted) dollars for all but two fiscal years: FY1997 and FY1998 ( Figure 3 ). After taking into account all rescissions, except rescissions of no-year information technology systems funds, the enacted appropriation for the LAE account exceeded the Commissioner's budget request only for FY1997, FY1998, and FY2009. The enacted appropriation exceeded the President's budget request only for FY1997, FY2008, FY2009, and FY2014. ", "Please note that the FY2014 President's budget request included a legislative proposal for a dedicated source of mandatory funding for program integrity work instead of a request for discretionary base and cap adjustment funding. If the funding associated with this legislative proposal had been included in the LAE, then the enacted appropriation for FY2014 would have been less than the President's budget request.", " Figure 4 shows historical trends in the annual appropriation for SSA's LAE account using three measures: (1) nominal dollars, (2) price-indexed dollars, and (3) wage-indexed dollars. The lower line labeled \"Nominal Dollars\" shows a steady increase in the appropriation for the LAE account over the past 20 years, although the rate of this increase has slowed since FY2010. ", "The middle line in Figure 4 labeled \"Price Indexed to 2017 Dollars\" shows the trend in SSA's LAE appropriation adjusted for changes in prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). Although the price-indexed line is flatter than the nominal line, there is a noticeable rise in the appropriation for SSA's LAE account during the FY2000s. Between FY2010 and FY2013, however, the value of appropriation declines in real terms, only to increase through FY2017.", "Another method for examining historical trends in SSA's LAE account is to adjust the annual appropriation for wage growth. The majority of SSA's administrative budget is obligated for payroll expenses, which include pay raises due to step increases, promotions, and cost-of-living adjustments. Because wages tend to grow faster than prices, annual increases in payroll expenses, which are largely fixed costs, can increase an agency's administrative expenses faster than the rate of inflation. According to SSA, the agency's fixed costs typically grow at a rate of $300-$350 million per year. The top line in Figure 4 labeled \"Wage Indexed to 2017 Dollars\" shows the trend in the appropriation for SSA's LAE account adjusted for changes in wages, as measured by SSA's Average Wage Index (AWI). The wage-indexed line shows a steady decline in the value of the LAE appropriation in real terms from FY2010 to FY2015, followed by a slight increase in FY2016 and then a small decrease in FY2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes in the Composition of the LAE Appropriation and Effects on SSA's Workloads", "paragraphs": ["The recent nominal growth in the annual appropriation for SSA's LAE account stems from increases in funding authorized specifically for program integrity work. Between FY2010 and FY2017, the amount of the LAE appropriation dedicated to program integrity work increased by 140%, from $758 million to $1.819 billion ( Figure 5 ). ", "Program integrity funding includes base funding provided to meet Section 251(b)(2)(B) of the BBEDCA and cap adjustment funding pursuant to annual limits specified in the act. When adjusted for price and wage growth over this period, SSA's program integrity funding grew by 115% and 94%, respectively. ", "The increases in dedicated program integrity funding have allowed SSA to hire more federal and DDS employees to conduct additional full medical CDRs. Between FY2010 and FY2016, the number of CDRs processed by SSA increased by 162%, from 324,500 to 850,000 ( Figure 6 ). During this period, the CDR backlog declined by 79%, from 1.361 million pending reviews in FY2010 to about 280,000 in FY2016.", "However, as shown in Figure 7 , the amount of the LAE appropriation available for other core workloads has essentially remained flat, increasing by 0.2% in nominal terms, from $10.642 billion in FY2010 to $10.663 billion in FY2017. General LAE funding refers to LAE funding not dedicated to program integrity work, that is, the base LAE appropriation and funding from user fees paid to SSA for certain administrative activities. When adjusted for price and wage growth over this period, general LAE funding fell by 10% and 19%, respectively. ", "According to SSA and others, the declining real value of the general LAE appropriation has contributed to agency delays in processing other workloads. One of the most publicized issues for SSA over the past several years has been the growing number of pending disability cases at the hearing level of the administrative appeals process. From the end of FY2010 to the end of the second quarter of FY2017, the number of pending hearings grew by 58%, from 705,400 to 1.12 million ( Figure 8 ; left axis). During that same period, the average wait time for a hearing decision increased by 37%, from 426 days to 583 days ( Figure 8 ; right axis).", "At a hearing before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, a SSA official stated that", "The House appropriations bill, if enacted, would cut the agency's base administrative funding below the FY 2016 enacted level and result in serious degradation of service. For example, at such low funding levels, we could face up to two weeks of employee furloughs, when our field offices could be closed to the public. The Senate appropriation bill, while higher than the House bill, would still fall short of providing us the funding to serve record numbers of claimants and beneficiaries.", "The reports accompanying the House and Senate bills do not provide an explicit rationale for each committee's FY2017 funding level. However, in enacting the FY2017 omnibus, it would seem that Congress believes that the Senate's FY2017 funding level is sufficient for SSA to perform its non-program integrity responsibilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
