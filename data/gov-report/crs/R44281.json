A common Israeli assertion is that BDS advocates or those who differentiate economically between Israel and West Bank settlements harm the employment situation of West Bank Palestinians. Many Palestinians and some international human rights groups counter this assertion by stating that Palestinians would be able to enjoy greater job prospects if Israeli settlements and movement/access/zoning restrictions in the West Bank did not constrain Palestinians' entrepreneurial capacities or their ability to attract international employers or outside investment.

For instance, an early iteration of congressional legislation would have restricted the availability of federal funds to entities, including universities, which engaged in BDS activity.

The first and most obvious is whether the act of refusing to deal with Israel or Israeli-affiliated entities is expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment. Important to this analysis may be whether those participating in BDS activity are attempting to make a political statement or are attempting to gain an economic advantage. Another relevant factor may be whether the government, in enacting the restriction, may be viewed by a reviewing court to be suppressing a disfavored message or, instead, to be regulating discriminatory conduct. Answers to these questions would likely turn on the text of the specific statutes at issue, as well as a number of other factors that may be difficult to predict."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Is BDS Activity Speech Protected by the First Amendment?", "paragraphs": ["The First Amendment to the Constitution, incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \"Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech ....\" According to the Supreme Court, \"the First Amendment [generally] means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\" The Freedom of Speech Clause refers specifically to the freedom of speech . Some nonverbal conduct, however, may also convey a message and be entitled to protection under the First Amendment. ", "The Supreme Court has found that the government generally has more leeway to regulate expressive conduct than it has to regulate pure speech. Nonetheless, there are limits on the government's ability to regulate conduct protected by the First Amendment. The government normally may not, for example, regulate conduct because of its expressive elements. ", "The Supreme Court has generally interpreted refusals to do business, including through boycotts, as conduct that may be permissibly regulated. Boycotts aimed at gaining an economic advantage for the boycotting parties are generally considered to be within the government's power to regulate and even to prohibit. However, boycotts aimed at achieving something other than an economic advantage, particularly when the motivation is political or social in nature, may have more of an expressive element, which, according to Supreme Court precedent, could qualify for First Amendment protection. ", "No definitive precedent exists examining whether BDS activity is protected by the First Amendment. Scholars who have written and commented on the issue disagree, leading one commentator to describe the question as a \"thorny\" one and others to acknowledge that the answer to the question may not be straightforward. Participants and advocates of the BDS movement characterize their activity as speech protected by the First Amendment. ", "To support this argument, BDS supporters may point to the Court's decision in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware . In that case, the Court held that an economic boycott of white-owned businesses by black citizens was entitled to First Amendment protection. The Court distinguished the situation from typical boycotts intended to secure an economic advantage for a particular business interest. While recognizing the government had considerable power to restrict economically motivated boycotts, the Court in Claiborne Hardware held that the \"right of the States to regulate economic activity could not justify a complete prohibition against a nonviolent, politically motivated boycott designed to force governmental and economic change and to effectuate rights guaranteed by the Constitution itself.\" ", "It may be argued that, like the Claiborne Hardware boycotters, BDS participants' intent is to cause economic harm, but their aim is not to destroy competition. Instead, BDS proponents' stated aim is to place pressure on Israel to make desired policy changes. Moreover, the BDS participants might claim that their activity is nonviolent and politically motivated, designed to force governmental change. Following that reasoning, it might be argued that their activity should receive a similar degree of protection under the First Amendment as the boycott at issue in Claiborne Hardware .", "There are, however, characteristics that distinguish the protected boycott in Claiborne Hardware from the BDS movement, which might factor into a reviewing court's analysis as to whether BDS activity is similarly protected by the Constitution. For instance, the Claiborne Hardware boycott involved an effort to influence the policies of domestic local governments and to vindicate rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Matters of foreign policy were not examined by the Court. The BDS movement, on the other hand, seeks to influence the conduct of a foreign government, Israel, perhaps in contravention of the foreign policy of the United States. Courts generally provide broad deference to Congress and to the executive branch in matters of foreign affairs. It remains unclear whether that deference might affect a court's judgment regarding the degree to which the government may permissibly seek to deter BDS activity.", "There is another important difference between Claiborne Hardware and regulation of BDS activity. In Claiborne Hardware , the Court explicitly noted that it was not deciding that \"a narrowly tailored statute designed to prohibit certain forms of anticompetitive conduct or certain types of secondary pressure may restrict protected First Amendment activity.\" The Claiborne Hardware Court left open the question of whether a statutory boycott restriction tailored by a legislature to balance legitimate competing interests might survive constitutional review even if it burdened protected speech.", "At least one commentator has argued that a Supreme Court decision issued the same year as Claiborne Hardware provides support for the argument that BDS activity is not protected by the Constitution. In International Longshoremen's Ass'n, v. Allied Intern., Inc. , the Court upheld a statutory prohibition on certain union boycotts as applied to a politically motivated boycott against a foreign government's policies. At issue in the case was a union's decision, in the wake of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, to stop handling Russian products. A U.S. importer of Russian products challenged the union's actions as violating the National Labor Relations Act, which prohibits \"unions from inducing employees to refuse to handle goods with the object of forcing any person to cease doing business with any person.\" In reviewing the case, the Supreme Court considered whether, among other things, the boycott was protected by the First Amendment. ", "The Court held that the union's boycott was prohibited by federal law and the statutory prohibition did not raise First Amendment concerns. With regard to the union's argument that the boycott was protected by the First Amendment, the Court observed that it had previously held that secondary picketing by union members was not protected activity under the First Amendment. The Court went on to conclude that it was \"even clearer\" that the boycott at issue was entitled to \"still less consideration under the First Amendment\" because such conduct was \"designed not to communicate but to coerce.\" ", "The Court's opinion in International Longshoremen's Ass'n , however, may not provide precise support for arguments regarding the permissibility of statutory restrictions on BDS activity. For example, International Longshoremen's Ass'n dealt with restrictions on union boycotting activity. Such restrictions traditionally have been viewed by the Court (including in Claiborne Hardware ) as permissible \"as part of 'Congress' striking of the delicate balance between union freedom of expression and the ability of neutral employers, employees, and consumers to remain free from coerced participation in industrial strife.'\" BDS activity does not primarily involve activities by unions or collective bargaining organizations, which may limit the applicability of Court jurisprudence regarding the First Amendment implications of government restrictions on union-led boycotts. ", "Some commentators also point to federal statutes and executive orders that have restricted the ability of U.S. persons to participate in boycotts sponsored or enforced by a foreign government, to argue that BDS activity may permissibly be restricted. For example, the Export Administration Act of 1979 imposed criminal penalties on U.S. persons engaged in \"any boycott fostered or imposed by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States.\" The EAA regulations prohibited, among other things, U.S. persons from responding to questionnaires sent by the Arab League to aid those countries in their boycott against Israel. These regulations were unsuccessfully challenged on First Amendment grounds by some companies who wished to respond to questionnaires that they received. ", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the restriction on answering the Arab League questionnaire, and found that the restriction was a constitutionally valid regulation of commercial speech. Commercial speech regulations are reviewed under a more lenient standard than regulations of political speech. The plaintiffs in these cases had attempted to argue that their decision to answer the questionnaire was political speech, warranting full First Amendment protection because \"the decision to boycott Israel is itself a political decision,\" and, therefore, \"their answers to the questionnaires should be viewed as attempts to influence political decision making.\" The Seventh Circuit disagreed, finding instead that \"the appellants do not seek to answer the questionnaire in order to influence the Arabs' decision to conduct or enforce a trade boycott with Israel.... They wish through their answers only to show that the boycott's sanctions should not be applied to them, because they have not violated its terms.\" In other words, they sought to protect their economic interests and not to engage in political arguments. The Seventh Circuit, therefore, held their speech was commercial and affirmed the lower court's finding that the regulations were properly tailored to withstand scrutiny.", "BDS activity may be distinguishable from the activity prohibited and regulated by the EAA. The EAA prohibited participation in boycotts enforced by foreign governments. BDS activity is not enforced by a foreign government. Furthermore, unlike the companies that challenged the EAA regulations, BDS participants generally do not appear to be seeking to protect their own economic interests, rather, they appear to seek to pressure Israel to change its policies. It might, therefore, be argued that BDS activity is not commercial speech, but political speech, and regulations of political speech generally are scrutinized more closely than commercial speech restrictions. For these reasons, the case law upholding regulations promulgated under the EAA might not provide directly analogous precedent to regulations of BDS activity. However, the regulations at issue in the Seventh Circuit case applied unambiguously to speech. They prohibit the communication of information from one party to another via speech. The case did not examine whether the activity of boycotting a foreign nation for political or economic reasons was speech protected by the Constitution or the degree to which that activity might be restricted even if it is protected speech. ", "The cases discussed above indicate that politically motivated boycotts generally may receive some degree of constitutional protection. However, the government may have greater leeway to regulate boycotts, even politically motivated boycotts, than it has to regulate pure speech, particularly where the boycotters have the power to coerce neutral third parties to comply with a boycott. Whether a particular statute or regulation burdening BDS activity would withstand scrutiny would likely turn on a number of factors, which may be difficult to predict, but could include the type of regulation at issue, the actors (i.e., would-be boycotters) to which it applied, and whether it was viewed by a reviewing court to be aimed at suppressing a particular message."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Restrictions on the Provision of Government Funding to Entities Engaged in BDS", "paragraphs": ["An early congressional proposal to deter participation in the BDS movement would have restricted participating entities from receiving government funding, igniting a debate about the constitutionality of such a restriction. The government has broad powers under the Spending Clause of the Constitution to tax and spend for the general welfare. The powers granted by the Spending Clause include the powers to limit what can be done with federal funds in order to ensure that they are used in accordance with Congress's will. However, the Supreme Court has found that the First Amendment does limit the conditions that can be placed on the receipt of federal funds. Whether the government constitutionally may restrict the availability of federal funding to entities engaged in BDS activity could depend upon a number of factors, including the specifics of the funding restriction at issue and whether it is intended to target or suppress speech. ", "Some scholars have argued that, even if there is arguably some expressive quality to BDS activity, proposals to restrict entities engaged in BDS activity from receiving government funding should be viewed as possible prohibitions on discrimination. Specifically, some commenters have likened a possible restriction on discrimination against Israel-affiliated entities to other constitutionally permissible legislative prohibitions on discrimination, such as government restrictions against race-based discrimination by private entities. ", "Two cases identified in support of this argument are Grove City College v. Bell and Christian Legal Society v. Martinez . In Grove City College , the Supreme Court held that Title IX of the Higher Education Amendments of 1972, which bans sex discrimination by universities that receive federal funds, did not violate the First Amendment rights of the educational institutions accepting the funds. According to the Court, \"Congress is free to attach reasonable and unambiguous conditions to federal financial assistance that educational institutions are not obligated to accept.\" ", "In Christian Legal Society , the Court upheld a public law school's requirement that student groups allow all interested students to join their organizations in order to be recognized by the school and to receive the benefits of recognition (e.g., recognized student groups could receive financial assistance from the school for their events). The Christian Legal Society (CLS) argued that the law school's nondiscrimination policy violated CLS's First Amendment rights to limit its membership to Christians. The Supreme Court disagreed. According to the Court, the law school's policy did not require the group to refrain from discrimination directly. Instead, the law school's policy placed only \"indirect pressure\" on the group to allow any interested student to join regardless of that student's religious beliefs. If CLS wished to continue to discriminate in its membership, all it needed to do was forgo government subsidy. Furthermore, the Court noted that the law school's nondiscrimination policy had no effect on the beliefs any organization wished to espouse. Instead, the policy regulated CLS's conduct \"without reference to the reasons motivating that behavior.\" ", "Applying the reasoning of these cases in the present context, if a federal funding restriction applied only to BDS activity, without reference to motivation, and did not restrict a funding recipient's ability to speak about boycotts or to express an opinion about Israel, it could be argued that such a restriction would be constitutional. Under this reasoning, people would remain free to communicate their beliefs about Israel's policies and the wisdom of placing economic pressure on the country, but would not be free to engage in conduct that discriminated on the basis of a person's association with Israel. On the other hand, some have argued that laws aimed at restricting or deterring BDS activity, even if they would apply only to refusals to deal and not to the expression of support for the BDS movement, are nonetheless aimed at suppressing the message communicated by BDS participation and raise First Amendment issues. Supreme Court precedent has indicated that funding restrictions intended to suppress the private parties' expression of a particular viewpoint are unconstitutional. In Christian Legal Society the Court upheld the antidiscrimination requirement but explicitly noted that the requirement did not \"target conduct on the basis of its expressive content.\" Opponents of BDS-related funding restrictions might claim that a restriction on federal funding to entities engaged in BDS activity would be a restriction enacted on the basis of the message communicated by the BDS movement, which could arguably place the restriction outside the Court's holding in Christian Legal Society . In other words, they might argue that in enacting the funding restrictions, the government was attempting to disfavor a message the government dislikes, and the funding restriction may implicate the First Amendment for that reason. ", "Even if the First Amendment is implicated by a restriction on funding to entities engaged in BDS activity, in general, the government is not required to fund goals with which it does not agree. The government generally may prohibit recipients of federal funds from using those funds in a way the government does not approve, provided that the restrictions on the use of the funds are germane to the federal interest in the program to which the funds are directed. For example, the Supreme Court has held that the government could prohibit the use of federal funds for family planning services to advocate or provide referrals for abortion. However, under Supreme Court precedent, the government cannot prescribe what an entity that receives federal funds may say with private money. Therefore, the government could not require recipients of federal funds to espouse a government-approved policy that applied to the entire organization, including the portion funded privately. Consequently, even if BDS activity is protected by the Constitution, the government may be able to restrict the use of federal funds by entities engaged in the BDS movement to support BDS activity, so long as the conditions on the use of the funds are germane to the federal interest being funded and do not burden speech funded privately.

Similar to the arguments surrounding proposed restrictions on government funding for entities engaged in BDS activity against Israel, some scholars and commentators argue that these laws bar discrimination by government contractors against Israel and Israeli-affiliated entities, and, thus, do not raise First Amendment concerns. Government contractors in many situations are already prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. If a reviewing court accepted the argument that the state government contracting restrictions applied only to discriminatory conduct and were not aimed at suppressing a particular viewpoint, the restrictions might be upheld.", "However, similar to the arguments surrounding potential government funding restrictions, if BDS activity is protected speech, the First Amendment may limit the government's ability to restrict that activity by government contractors. The Supreme Court has held that government contractors do not surrender their First Amendment rights as a result of the contract. Government contractors, therefore, retain their rights to engage in speech on matters of public concern, outside of the performance of the contract, and the Constitution limits the government's ability to terminate the contract on the basis of their speech. However, the Supreme Court has also acknowledged that the government has legitimate interests as a contracting party, which may outweigh the First Amendment rights of contractors in some circumstances. Reviewing courts therefore weigh contractors' rights to engage in speech on matters of public concern against the government's rights and interests as a contractor to determine whether the limitation on speech rights is permissible under the circumstances. If a reviewing court determined that a restriction on a government contractor's ability to engage in BDS activity outside the scope of the contract limited the speech of the contractor, a court might balance the competing interests of the state and the contractor to determine whether the limitation was permissible.", "Another distinction that may be important is whether the contracting restriction applies to existing government contracts or to contracts prior to their formation. The Supreme Court has held only that the Constitution limits the termination of existing contracts in retaliation for engaging in protected speech. The Court has not opined on whether this protection would extend to new bids for government contracts, that is, whether the Constitution limits the government's ability to deny the award of a contract on the basis of the contractor's otherwise-protected speech. Lower courts that have considered this question have disagreed on this issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Investment Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["Certain states have also taken action to divest state funds from entities engaged in BDS activity.

", "Proponents of state action to restrict investment in entities engaged in BDS activity argue that BDS is not protected speech and investment restrictions, therefore, do not implicate the First Amendment. If a reviewing court were to accept that argument, the state restrictions on investment arguably could be permissible under the First Amendment.", "Other observers, however, have noted that the constitutional status of BDS activity is, at the least, unclear. If BDS activity is protected by the First Amendment, the constitutionality of a restriction on state investment in entities engaged in that activity would also be uncertain. According to one scholar, whether a state limitation on investing its funds in entities because of their speech might violate the First Amendment is without \"direct precedent, at least at the Supreme Court.\" ", "The closest analogue appears to be the Supreme Court's line of cases analyzing restrictions on government funding, discussed earlier. In the Court's most recent opinion analyzing a government funding restriction on speech, Chief Justice Roberts distilled the Court's precedent in this area, writing that \"the relevant distinction that has emerged from our cases is between conditions that define the limits of the government spending program \u2013 those that specify the activities Congress wants to subsidize \u2013 and conditions that seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself.\" A court reviewing state investment restrictions might, therefore, examine whether the restriction represented the government's expression of support for a specific public policy or an attempt by the government to \"leverage\" its investing power \"to regulate speech.\" "], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Preemption Questions: Commerce Clause and Foreign Affairs179", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, some state and local governments have enacted or are considering measures to counteract BDS-related or differentiation measures.

The extent to which a federal statute preempts state law in a given area is within the control of Congress. Congress may, by clearly stating its intent, choose to preempt all state laws, no state laws, or only those state laws with certain attributes. When Congress enacted the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act (EAA) in 1977, for example, it expressly preempted any state or local measure that \"pertains to participation in, compliance with, implementation of, or the furnishing of information regarding restrictive trade practices or boycotts fostered or imposed by foreign countries against other countries.\" ", "Even absent an express preemption provision such as that found in the EAA, an act of Congress can impliedly preempt state or local action. Where Congress has not expressly preempted state and local laws, two types of implied federal preemption may be found: field preemption , in which federal regulation is so pervasive that one can reasonably infer that states or localities have no role to play, and conflict preemption , in which \"compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\" or where the state law \"stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\" The Supreme Court felled a Massachusetts law on the latter ground because the law imposed sanctions on Burma (Myanmar) in such a way that frustrated the implementation of a federal statutory scheme also targeting Burma. ", "In order to preclude implied preemption, Congress may sometimes include nonpreemption language in sanctions legislation. One bill in the 115 th Congress has been introduced to preserve state and local anti-BDS or antidifferentiation measures. The Combating BDS Act of 2017, S. 170 (see Table 1 ), would permit state and local governments to divest their own assets from or prohibit government contracting with certain entities that they determine engage in BDS-related activity, as defined by the bill and subject to its restrictions.

In addition to this affirmative grant of constitutional authority, the Supreme Court has recognized that the Commerce Clause implies a corresponding restraint on the authority of the states to interfere with commerce, even absent congressional action. This inferred restriction arising from congressional inaction is generally referred to as the \"dormant\" Commerce Clause. Under this established principle, states and localities are prohibited from unreasonably burdening or discriminating against either interstate or foreign commerce unless they are authorized by Congress to do so. In a series of cases involving state taxes, the Supreme Court has set out criteria for examining whether state measures impermissibly burden foreign commerce where affirmative congressional permission is absent. In sum, the Court has required a closer examination of measures alleged to infringe the Foreign Commerce Clause than is required for those alleged to infringe its interstate counterpart, but has also provided some room for state measures in situations where a federal role is not clearly demanded.", "Where Congress has not clearly immunized a state selective purchasing or divestment law, a state may defend a challenged law by invoking the market participant doctrine, which protects those laws in which the state or local government acts as a buyer or seller of goods rather than as a regulator. Consequently, state and local measures that pertain to the investment of government funds, as well as measures that regulate government procurement, may be defended on the ground that the state or local government is merely making investment or purchasing choices for itself and not regulating other investors or buyers, as the case may be.
