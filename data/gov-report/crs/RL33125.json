Among these are provisions: to make changes to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) with respect to asylum and other forms of relief from removal; to expand the terrorism-related grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportation; and to set standards for state-issued drivers' licenses and personal identification cards, if such documents are to be accepted for federal purposes.", "The security-related issue of immigration enforcement remains on Congress's agenda. H.R. 4437, as passed by the House, contains provisions on border security, the role of state and local law enforcement, employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement, smuggling, detention, and other enforcement-related issues. In addition to these provisions, H.R. 4437 contains significant and, in some cases, highly controversial provisions on unlawful presence, voluntary departure and removal, expedited removal, and denying U.S. entry to nationals from uncooperative countries. Despite efforts by some House Members to amend H.R. 4437 to establish new guest worker programs, the bill does not contain any such provisions. S. 2611, as passed by the Senate, combines provisions on enforcement and on unlawful presence, voluntary departure and removal, expedited removal, and denying U.S. entry to nationals from uncooperative countries with provisions on legal temporary admissions, including guest workers, and legal permanent admissions. S. 2611 also would establish legalization programs to enable certain groups of unauthorized aliens in the United States to obtain legal permanent resident (LPR) status.", "The 109th Congress has enacted some border security-related provisions. P.L. 109-295, the FY2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, includes border tunnel provisions like those in S. 2611, as well as other enforcement-related provisions. P.L. 109-367 includes border fencing provisions similar to those in H.R. 4437. In addition, the House has passed other bills with border security and enforcement-related provisions (H.R. 4830, H.R. 6094, H.R. 6095, H.R. 6160, H.R. 6162).", "The 109th Congress also has enacted limited provisions on temporary and permanent employment-based immigration as part of P.L. 109-13 and P.L. 109-364.", "Among the other immigration bills that have received action are measures on alien victims of domestic violence (P.L. 109-162, P.L. 109-271, and S. 1197), trafficking in persons (P.L. 109-162, P.L. 109-164, and S. 1197), and refugees (P.L. 109-102 and P.L. 109-149).", "This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, policymakers have linked the issue of immigration, particularly unauthorized immigration, to homeland security. This linkage was cemented with the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ), which shifted primary responsibility for immigration policy from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS). As in the past several years, security concerns have figured prominently in the development of and debate on immigration legislation in the 109 th Congress. In May 2005, the REAL ID Act became law as Division B of the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief ( P.L. 109-13 ).

Various bills have been introduced that address enforcement-related issues, including border security; the roles of the U.S. military, civilian patrols, and state and local law enforcement agencies in immigration enforcement; smuggling; detention; and the enforcement of prohibitions on employing unauthorized workers. Among these bills are the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 ( H.R. 4437 ), which was passed by the House on December 16, 2005, and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 ( S. 2611 ), which was passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006. Fencing provisions similar to those in H.R. 4437 have been enacted in P.L. 109-367 . The FY2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-295 ) contains several security-related provisions, including border tunnel provisions like those in S. 2611 . In addition, the House has passed a number of other enforcement-related measures, among them H.R. 6094 , H.R. 6095 , H.R. 6160 , and H.R. 6162 .", "In addition to its enforcement provisions, S. 2611 contains provisions on temporary and permanent immigration, unauthorized aliens in the United States, and other issues. In March 2006, the Senate Judiciary Committee amended and approved an S. 2611 predecessor proposal drafted by Committee Chairman Specter, known as the Chairman's mark. This bill contained provisions on border enforcement, interior enforcement, and unlawful employment of aliens, as well as on guest workers, legal permanent immigration reform, unauthorized aliens in the United States, and other issues. Prior to the completion of the mark-up, Senator Frist introduced a separate bill, Securing America's Borders Act ( S. 2454 ), containing selected titles of the Chairman's mark, with some modifications. These titles address border enforcement, interior enforcement, unlawful employment, permanent legal immigration reform, and other topics. S. 2454 does not contain provisions on guest workers or on the future status of unauthorized aliens in the United States. During Senate floor debate on S. 2454 in late March, Senator Specter proposed a substitute amendment based on the Judiciary Committee-approved bill ( S.Amdt. 3192 ). On April 6, 2006, the Senate rejected a motion, by a vote of 39 to 60, to invoke cloture (and thereby initiate post-cloture procedures to eventually move to a vote) on the Specter substitute. The following day, the Senate rejected two other cloture motions: It rejected, on a 38 to 60 vote, a motion to invoke cloture on a motion to recommit S. 2454 to the Senate Judiciary Committee with instructions that it be reported back with the Hagel amendment (Hagel-Martinez compromise); and it rejected, on a 36 to 62 vote, a motion to invoke cloture on S. 2454 . The Hagel-Martinez compromise, with some modifications, was subsequently introduced in the Senate as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 ( S. 2611 / S. 2612 ).", "While major immigration reform proposals remain pending, Congress has enacted limited provisions on temporary and permanent employment-based immigration as part of P.L. 109-13 and P.L. 109-364 .

In most cases, no statutory standards existed prior to the REAL ID Act; instead, standards were established by regulation and (sometimes conflicting) case law. In some areas, the guidelines established by the REAL ID Act are arguably more stringent than under preexisting law (e.g., pursuant to the act, an asylum applicant must now show that one of the five grounds for asylum eligibility was or will be at least one central reason for his persecution, a higher standard than previously employed in some federal circuits); in other cases, the REAL ID Act simply codifies existing regulation or case law. The act also eliminates the annual caps on the number of persons granted asylum who may have their status adjusted to legal permanent residents (LPRs), and on the number of persons who may enter the United States as refugees/asylees on account of persecution for resistance to coercive population control methods (a special asylum category)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judicial Review", "paragraphs": ["The REAL ID Act expressly limits federal habeas review and certain other non-direct judicial review for certain matters relating to the removal of aliens under INA \u00a7242, while permitting appellate court review of constitutional claims and questions of law.

The REAL ID Act makes activities such as espousal of terrorist activity and receipt of military-type training from, or on behalf of, a terrorist organization grounds for exclusion. It also significantly expands the terrorism-related grounds for deportation so that they are identical to the terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility.

States must also verify an applicant's legal status in the United States before issuing a driver's license or personal identification card that may be accepted for any federal purpose, and may only issue aliens temporary drivers' licenses or ID cards which expire on the date when the aliens' legal presence in the United States is due to end. If a state opts not to conform with REAL ID Act guidelines, the act nevertheless requires the state's drivers' licenses and ID cards to contain certain identifying features that alert federal officials that such documents are not to be accepted for any official federal purposes. Further, all states are required to maintain a motor vehicle database that contains specified information regarding persons issued drivers' licenses and ID cards, and this database must be made accessible to all other states.

Operationally, this means controlling the official ports of entry (POE) through which legitimate travelers and commerce enter the country, and patrolling the nation's land and maritime borders to safeguard against and interdict illegal entries.", "Border security has been a key immigration issue for the 109 th Congress. Enactment of border security provisions as part of the REAL ID Act, as discussed above, has been followed by congressional consideration of a variety of other related measures. There has been much debate in the 109 th Congress about whether DHS has sufficient resources to fulfill its border security mission, and some bills would add resources to the border, including personnel, infrastructure, and technology or institute new programs within the Department. Other bills propose to expand various programs already being implemented by DHS at the border. H.R. 4437 , as passed by the House, and S. 2611 , as passed by the Senate, contain provisions of both types. Some border security provisions in H.R. 4437 and S. 2611 have been enacted in the FY2007 DHS Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-295 ) and in the Secure Fence Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-367 ).

These tunnel provisions also appear in S. 2611 , as passed by the Senate, and H.R. 4830 , as passed by the House. Another border-security related provision in P.L. 109-295 requires the DHS Inspector General to review all contracts relating to the Department's Secure Border Initiative (SBI) worth more than $20 million. This provision was included in H.R. 4437 , S. 2611 , and House-passed H.R. 6162 . P.L. 109-295 also includes $1.2 billion in funding for border fencing, infrastructure, and technology, but does not specify what mix of resources should be implemented or to what locations on the border these resources should be allocated, instead leaving these decisions to DHS's discretion.", "P.L. 109-367 directs DHS to construct border fencing along five different stretches of the southern border that total roughly 850 miles. This language is identical to that in H.R. 4437 , but includes later construction deadlines. P.L. 109-367 also calls for a study on the feasibility of constructing border security infrastructure along the northern border. S. 2611 , as amended, would direct DHS to replace current border fencing in the Border Patrol's Tucson and Yuma sectors and to construct additional border fencing totaling 370 miles and additional vehicle barriers totaling 700 miles.", "H.R. 4437 , as passed by the House, and S. 2611 , as passed by the Senate, contain a number of other border-security related provisions. Both bills would require the Secretary of DHS to submit a National Strategy for Border Security outlining a comprehensive strategy for securing the border, including a surveillance plan and a time line for implementation. Both would add personnel, technology, and infrastructure resources at and between POE and would direct DHS to work with the Department of Defense (DOD) to formulate a plan for increasing the availability and use of military equipment to assist with the surveillance of the border. Both bills would require DHS to expand the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Technology (US-VISIT) Program to collect 10 fingerprints from aliens currently required to register with the program as they enter the country, and would require DHS to submit a time line for deploying and enabling the exit component of US-VISIT at land POE. Both bills would also require DHS to enhance the connectivity of its biometric fingerprint database with the Federal Bureau of Investigation's database and develop and implement a plan to ensure clear two-way communications for DHS agents working along the border.", "While the border security provisions in S. 2611 and H.R. 4437 are largely similar, there are some substantive differences between the two bills. Among the major differences, House-passed H.R. 4437 would direct DHS to improve coordination and communication among its component agencies by creating task forces and other mechanisms to enhance information and intelligence sharing, and would require DHS to design and carry out a border security exercise involving officials from federal, state, local, tribal, and international governments as well as representatives from the private sector within one year of the bill's enactment. It would allow homeland security grant funding to be used for reimbursing state and local governments for costs associated with detecting and responding to the unlawful entry of aliens. H.R. 4437 would also remove Air and Marine Operations (AMO) from DHS's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and establish a stand-alone AMO Office within DHS. For its part, S. 2611 includes three separate provisions that would direct DHS to acquire and deploy various kinds of surveillance assets in order to establish a \"virtual fence\" along the southwest border. S. 2611 would also establish criminal penalties for attempting to evade inspection at POE or for disregarding orders given by CBP officers, Border Patrol agents, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) investigators.", "H.R. 6160 , as passed by the House, would give recruitment and retention bonuses to Border Patrol agents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Military at the Border", "paragraphs": ["The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 ( P.L. 109-163 ) includes a provision (\u00a71035) that requires a report from the Secretary of Defense concerning the potential use of military air assets to support DHS by surveilling the border. This language was inserted during conference, and replaced prior language in the House-passed version of the bill ( H.R. 1815 ) that would have authorized the U.S. military to be deployed to the border to assist DHS in preventing the entry of terrorists, drug smugglers, and unauthorized aliens at and between official ports of entry. Under the House-passed provision, which also appears in H.R. 5122 , as amended and passed by the House, U.S. military personnel would have been deployed to the border only at the request of the Secretary of Homeland Security and only after completing a training course on border law enforcement.

Historically, the authority for state and local law enforcement officials to enforce immigration law has been construed to be limited to the criminal provisions of the INA; by contrast, the enforcement of the civil provisions has been viewed strictly as a federal responsibility, with states playing an incidental supporting role. Some posit, nonetheless, that states and localities, as sovereign entities, retain certain police powers under the Constitution, and consequently, possess inherent authority to enforce civil as well as criminal violations of federal immigration law.

In addition, employers may elect to participate in an electronic employment eligibility verification system, established under a 1996 law. Participants in the Basic Pilot program electronically verify new hires' employment authorization through Social Security Administration (SSA) and, if necessary, DHS databases.

Particularly since the 2001 terrorist attacks, many have raised security concerns about having such a large unauthorized population. In addition, the issue of worksite enforcement has gained attention recently in connection with guest worker proposals.
