Under the 1990 law, the head of an executive branch agency may request that OPM temporarily waive the prohibition on dual compensation on a case-by-case basis for employees in positions for which there is exceptional difficulty in recruiting or retaining qualified employees. If a federal annuitant is reemployed under a waiver that allows concurrent receipt of a federal annuity and a federal salary, he or she accrues no new retirement benefits under CSRS or FERS.", "Second, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 ( P.L. 108-136 ) delegated to the Secretary of Defense authority to hire federal annuitants without reducing their salaries by the amount of their annuities. The approval of the Director of OPM is not required. Under this law, a federal annuitant hired by the Department of Defense is entitled to receive both a federal annuity and the full salary for the position into which he or she is hired. The reemployed annuitant does not accrue additional CSRS or FERS retirement benefits during the period of reemployment.", "Finally, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 ( P.L. 111-84 ) allowed the head of a federal agency to appoint an individual who is receiving an annuity under CSRS or FERS to a temporary, part-time position in civilian federal employment without the offset to salary otherwise required by law.

Reemployed annuitants earn additional retirement benefits while reemployed, unless hired under a waiver granting simultaneous receipt of salary and pension.
