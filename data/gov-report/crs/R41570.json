A 2010 congressional report by minority staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee concluded that the current systems of refugee admissions and resettlement \"are out-dated and fail to address the needs of the culturally and linguistically diverse populations now being admitted to the United States.\" The report, based on field research conducted in Indiana and Georgia, also chronicled the strains the current system places on local communities. A May 2010 report by the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) on the U.S. refugee admissions and resettlement programs determined that", "increasing demographic diversity among the arriving refugee population and a shifting focus toward resettling the most vulnerable has tested the limits of the U.S. resettlement system and has revealed serious problem areas.
