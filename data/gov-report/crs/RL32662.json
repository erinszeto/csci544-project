Also, political powers are separated and exercised by institutions that check and balance each others' powers, hence impairing a tyranny of power. Democracies generally have free market economies, which depend upon the rule of law and private property rights. The rule of law is assured through an independent judicial and legal system. The accountability of government officials to the citizenry is assured most importantly through elections that are freely competed and fairly conducted. An informed electorate is assured through the government's obligation to publicize its activities (termed transparency) and the citizenry's freedom of expression. In contrast, in an authoritarian state the leadership rules with wide and arbitrary latitude in the political sphere but interferes somewhat less in economic and social affairs. The government strictly limits opposition activities, and citizens are not able to change leaders by electoral means. Rather than legitimizing its rule by appealing to an elaborate ideology, an authoritarian regime boasts to its citizenry that it provides safety, security, and order.", "Some theorists have delineated a political system with mixed features of democracy and authoritarianism they label \"managed democracy.\" In a managed democracy, the leaders use government resources and manipulation to ensure that they will not be defeated in elections, although they permit democratic institutions and groups to function to a limited extent.

The extent of progress, however, and the direction of recent trends, are subject to dispute. Democratization has faced myriad challenges, including former President Boris Yeltsin's violent face-off with the legislature in 1993 and recurring conflict in the breakaway Chechnya region. Such challenges, virtually all analysts agree, have hindered Russia from becoming a fully-fledged or \"consolidated\" democracy in terms of the above definition. Some analysts have viewed Putin as making decisions that have diverted Russia further away from democracy, but they have argued that the country is not yet fully authoritarian and may be described as a \"managed democracy.\" Others insist that he is clearly antagonistic toward democracy, not least because he launched security operations in Chechnya that have resulted in wide scale human rights abuses and civilian casualties. The NGO Freedom House claims that Russia under Putin has suffered the greatest reversal among the post-Soviet states in democratic freedoms, and warns that the main danger to Russia's future political stability and continued economic growth is an overly repressive state.", "Other observers agree with Putin that stability is necessary to build democracy.

Public opinion polls before the election showed that Putin was highly popular, and it was expected that pro-Putin parties and candidates would fare well. On election day, there was a low turnout of 56 percent and 59.685 million valid votes cast. The Putin-endorsed United Russia party won the largest shares of the party list and district votes, giving it a total of 224 seats. The ultranationalist vote was mainly shared by the newly formed pro-Putin Motherland bloc of parties and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party (which usually supports the government). Candidates not claiming party affiliation won 67 district seats (most later joined the United Russia faction in the Duma). Opposition parties and candidates fared poorly. The opposition Communist Party won far fewer seats (52) than it had in 1999 (113 seats), marking its marginalization in the Duma. The main opposition liberal democratic parties (Union of Right Forces and Yabloko) failed to reach the five percent threshold for party representation in the Duma, and were virtually excluded.", "Election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Parliamentary Assembly for the Council of Europe (PACE) concluded that the Duma race was less democratic than the previous one in 1999. They highlighted the government's \"extensive\" aid and use of media to favor United Russia and Motherland and to discourage support and positive media coverage of the opposition parties. Such favoritism, they stated, \"undermined\" the principle of equal treatment for competing parties and candidates and \"blurred the distinction\" between the party and the state. They further considered the Central Electoral Commission's (CEC's) failure to enforce laws against such bias \"a worrisome development that calls into question Russia's ... willingness\" to meet international standards.", "Before the Duma convened on December 29, 2003, most of the nominally independent deputies had affiliated with the United Russia party faction, swelling it to over 300 members. This gave United Russia the ability not only to approve handily Putin's initiatives, but also the two-thirds vote needed to alter the constitution without having to make concessions to win the votes of other factions. The United Russia faction leader assumed the speakership, and its members were named to six of nine deputy speakerships and to the chairmanships of all 28 committees. The United Russia faction took control over agenda-setting for the chamber and introduced a streamlined process for passing government bills that precluded the introduction of amendments on the floor by opposition deputies.", "The Duma of the 2003-2007 convocation has handily passed Kremlin-sponsored legislation requiring a two-thirds majority, including changes to federal boundaries. Even a highly unpopular government bill converting many in-kind social entitlements to monetary payments (but retaining them for officials and deputies) was overwhelmingly approved in August 2004. The Russian newspaper Moscow Times reported that some Duma deputies complained that the bill was pushed through even though there was not a full text. Many senators in the Federation Council (the upper legislative chamber), who represent regional interests, raised concerns about the shift of the welfare burden from the center to the regions.

The Communist Party leader declined to run. The party nominated a less-known surrogate, State Duma deputy Nikolay Kharitonov. Similarly, the Liberal Democratic Party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, declined and the party nominated Oleg Malyshkin.

Political debate also was circumscribed by Putin's refusal to debate with other candidates. Concern that the low public interest in the campaign might be reflected in a turnout less than the required 50 percent, the CEC aired \"get out the vote\" appeals that contained pro-Putin images, according to the OSCE.", "While praising the efficiency of the CEC and lower-level electoral commissions in administering the election, the OSCE also reported that vote-counting appeared problematic in almost one-third of the precincts observed. Irregularities included penciling in vote totals for later possible alteration, and in one case, the reporting of results without counting the votes. In six regions, including Chechnya, voter turnout and the vote for Putin were nearly 90% or above, approaching implausible Soviet-era percentages.

This party in most cases has been strongly backed by the regional governors, the majority of whom are party members.", "Elections to the Moscow City Duma (Moscow has federal regional status) in December 2005 resulted in United Russia winning nearly 50% of the party list vote and all 15 single member constituencies, giving it a majority of 28 out of 35 seats in the city Duma. The Communist Party remained viable, winning four seats. Several liberal parties cooperated with Yabloko, and it won three seats. A party had to get at least 10% of the votes in order to win seats, resulting in the elimination of six parties, including the Liberal Democratic Party and the Party of Life. Reportedly reflecting the Putin administration's disfavor, the Motherland Party was disqualified from running. Some observers criticized severely circumscribed election monitoring and media coverage, which made it difficult to assess whether the vote was free and fair. According to one report, when the city duma winners met to divvy up responsibilities, the winners in single member districts demanded that all the duma staffers serve them, since they represented constituents who had voted for them, and the party list winners were forced to ally themselves with these deputies in the hope of obtaining staff support.", "In the formerly breakaway region of Chechnya, legislative elections were held on November 27, 2005, as part of Putin's plan to pacify and control the region.

In these regional contests, United Russia performed better than previously, while the Liberal Democratic and Communist parties lost ground, and Yabloko (which ran in two regions) won no seats. Where party lists were used, the governors were highlighted on the United Russia Party lists, indicating the favored status of the party (after the election, the governors declined their legislative seats). Central and regional electoral decisions and administrative resources were used to support favored parties and hinder non-favored parties.

In 2003, the government allegedly used its direct or indirect ownership shares to tighten control over the independent television station NTV, close down another station (TV-6), and rescind the operating license of a third (TVS). In 2005, the pro-government steel company Severstal and some German investors purchased Ren-TV, a television station with a national reach that had been permitted some editorial freedom. It had been owned by the government monopoly United Energy Systems and private investors. After the takeover, the new owners imposed a pro-government editorial stance. Not only does the government reportedly have controlling influence over these major nationwide television networks and other major broadcast and print media, but a Ministry of Culture and Mass Communications created in 2004 has major influence over the majority of television advertising and print distribution.

Critics alleged that Lavrov's call appeared to mark efforts to re-create Soviet propaganda organizations under the control of intelligence agencies, such as the Soviet-era Committee for the Defense of Peace (its successor organization, the Federation of Peace and Accord, took part in the meeting). They also raised concerns that many of the NGOs that met with Lavrov appeared newly created, and that the government's aim was for these groups to crowd out established and independent NGOs.", "In July 2005, President Putin re-emphasized his concerns about foreign funding for NGO political activities, asserting that \"no self-respecting state will allow this, and we will not allow it.\" In November 2005, the Duma began consideration of a draft NGO bill banning the presence of branches of foreign NGOs in Russia, forbidding foreigners from belonging to Russian-based NGOs, and strengthening the auditing functions of the government to monitor and control foreign and domestic funding of NGOs. Some observers suggested that the bill reflected the Putin administration's perception that foreign-based or foreign-funded NGOs helped trigger \"color revolutions\" that overthrew governments in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, and that such NGOs similarly were subverting the Russian government.", "Following harsh criticism of the draft NGO bill from many Russian and international NGOs and others, including U.S. officials, President Putin (and many Public Chamber members) suggested some changes to the draft to permit branches of foreign NGOs to operate in Russia under certain conditions. President Putin continued to argue that this legislative change, like others he had orchestrated, was prompted by the need to protect Russia from foreign \"terrorist ideology.\" The bill was approved and signed into law in December 2005 and entered into force in April 2006.", "Potentially worrisome provisions in the law include the ability of officials from the Federal Registration Service (FRS) to attend meetings of NGOs without their consent or a court order.

The FRS may cancel the activities and ban financial transactions by Russian branches of foreign organizations. The law also imposes onerous annual reporting requirements on NGOs.

Some observers speculate that the Putin government was surprised by the strength of Motherland's electoral support. Although widely viewed as a creature of the Kremlin, Motherland claimed that it was a \"loyal opposition\" to the government in the Duma. The \"opposition\" component appeared to become a reality during early 2005 when Motherland sided with protesters who were against the monetization of social benefits (these benefits previously had involved free or discounted goods and services).

These analysts suggest that as the civil society matures, prompted by the growth of the middle class, Russians will rewrite the constitution and otherwise restructure their political system to create a more democratic balance of power.", "Those researchers who maintain that Putin is essentially committed to democratization argue that the term \"managed democracy\" exaggerates the degree to which he has been able to dominate politics. Although civil society is underdeveloped, some regions remain authoritarian, and the Kremlin intervenes in elections, \"the overall trend is still probably toward democracy,\" according to analyst Richard Sakwa. Although the numbers of siloviki in top political posts have greatly increased during the Putin era, Sakwa has argued that they do not appear to make policy in the economic, foreign policy, or regional realms.", "According to some critics, the Putin government's early 2005 replacement of many social benefits in kind (mainly free rides on public transportation, but later including medicine, rent, and utility subsidies) by cash subsidies demonstrated that democratic institutions had not fully functioned. Instead of a democratic process that involved soliciting public input, the government and legislature too hastily enacted the monetization reforms, these critics allege. The monetization reforms caused large-scale protests not seen in Russia in several years, because the cash payments fell short of the former in-kind benefits. Putin's popularity dipped briefly for the first time below the 50% range. The Putin government resisted overturning the monetization reforms but postponed eliminating some in-kind benefits and greatly boosted budgetary funding for cash payments. In January 2005, Putin partly justified the elimination of direct gubernatorial elections by blaming the sitting regional governments for the problems with the monetization reforms. The \"constructive opposition\" Motherland Party demanded the resignations of \"liberal ministers\" and a moratorium on the monetization reforms. The United Russia Party faction in the Duma blamed the central ministries and regional governments for problems with the monetization reforms and continued this mostly successful tactic of deflecting blame during regional and local electoral contests in 2005-2007.", "Protests by many pensioners, war veterans, students, and disabled persons about the monetization reforms galvanized opposition political parties, which moved quickly to abet protests and appeared to gain at least temporary popular support. Some college students and other youth became involved in the protests and set up new groups, viewed by some observers as encouraging aspects of future civil society development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Chaotic Interlude?", "paragraphs": ["Some observers have warned that Russia could have a period of political uncertainty in 2007-2008 and perhaps beyond if President Putin does not run for re-election.

However, the Administration has criticized threats to the process such as state control over media, Khodorkovskiy's arrest, and pressure on NGOs. While the Administration has been critical of Russia's human rights abuses in Chechnya, it also tentatively has supported Russia's efforts to hold elections and a constitutional referendum there (but also has criticized the campaigns and outcomes as not free and fair).", "Reflecting a positive assessment before the 2003-2004 cycle of Russian elections, President Bush at the September 2003 Camp David summit stated that \"I respect President Putin's vision for Russia: a country at peace within its borders, with its neighbors, and with the world, a country in which democracy and freedom and rule of law thrive.\" In the wake of the 2003 Duma election, however, former Secretary of State Colin Powell was more critical, writing in the Russian newspaper Izvestia in January 2004 that \"Russia's democratic system seems not yet to have found the essential balance among the ... branches of government. Political power is not yet fully tethered to law. Key aspects of civil society ... have not yet sustained an independent presence.\" He also raised \"concerns\" about Russian actions in Chechnya and in former Soviet republics, and warned that \"without basic principles shared in common,\" U.S.-Russian ties \"will not achieve [their] potential.\" President Bush, however, still appeared to stress Putin's democratic potential during a June 2004 G-8 meeting, hailing \"my friend Vladimir Putin\" as \"a strong leader who cares deeply about the people of his country,\" although he reportedly also raised concerns about media freedom in Russia.", "Putin's announcement on September 13, 2004, that he would launch a government re-organization heightened concerns by the U.S. Administration and others that Russia's democratization might be threatened. Although supporting Putin's goal of enhancing anti-terrorism efforts, then-Secretary Powell the next day raised concerns that Russia was \"pulling back on some ... democratic reforms\" and emphasized that there must be a \"proper balance\" between anti-terrorism efforts and democracy. Dispensing with Putin's earlier apparent subtlety, Lavrov retorted that the re-organization was an internal affair and that the United States should not try to impose its \"model\" of democracy on other countries. Russia's efforts in late 2004 to interfere in Ukraine's presidential election raised additional Administration concerns about Putin's commitment to democratization at home and in other Soviet successor states.", "Despite these concerns, the Administration has stressed that it must maintain a balance between advocating democratization and U.S.-Russia cooperation on anti-terrorism, non-proliferation, energy, and other strategic issues. In testimony at her confirmation hearing in January 2005, Secretary of State-designate Condoleezza Rice reiterated this policy to \"work closely with Russia on common problems,\" while at the same time to \"continue to press the case for democracy and ... to make clear that the protection of democracy in Russia is vital to the future of U.S.-Russia relations.\"", "Perhaps illustrative of this approach, before a planned summit meeting with President Putin in late February 2005, President Bush stressed that \"for Russia to make progress as a European nation, the Russian government must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law.... We must always remind Russia [that we] stand for a free press, a vital opposition, the sharing of power, and the rule of law.\" At the summit, the status of democratization in Russia appeared to be a major issue of contention, but President Bush emphasized continued cooperation with Russia on nonproliferation and anti-terrorism. He reported that he had told Putin that \"strong countries are built by developing strong democracies\" and had raised concerns with Putin about the rule of law, minority rights, and viable political debate. President Putin countered that Russia's media were free and that the new method of selecting regional governors was akin to the U.S. electoral college. He emphasized that Russia's democracy would be attuned to \"our history and our traditions\" but would nonetheless be akin to those in other \"modern, civilized\" societies. At the same time, he seemed to qualify this assurance by stressing that democratization should not interfere with the creation of a strong Russian government and economy. President Bush in turn hailed this declaration of what he termed Putin's \"absolute support for democracy in Russia.\"", "Advocates of such a balanced U.S. response argue that the United States has economic and security interests in continued engagement with Russia. The Task Force on Russia has argued that \"on a number of issues\u2014Iran, energy, HIV/AIDS, and preventing terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass destruction\u2014Russia's cooperation is seen as central to promoting American interests.\" Although U.S.-Russia cooperation has been \"disappointing\" on many issues, according to the Task Force, \"selective cooperation\" should still be pursued where possible. U.S. economic interests include diversified sources of energy. Russia's capabilities to provide oil and liquified natural gas to U.S. markets are growing, and proposed Russian shipping from arctic ports would be quicker and more secure than shipments from the Middle East, according to some experts. Some observers more generally urge a U.S.-Russia relationship like that between the United States and China, where the United States advocates democratization but nonetheless maintains close economic ties that may \"mak[e] China richer and eventually freer.\"", "Some observers have discerned a greater Administration recognition in recent months that authoritarianism is deepening in Russia. Vice President Dick Cheney reflected this perhaps less hopeful view in May 2006 when he stated that Russia's \"government has unfairly and improperly restricted the rights of her people\" and that such restrictions \"could begin to affect relations with other countries.\" He called for Russia to \"return to democratic reform.\" He also stated that \"no legitimate interest is served when oil and gas become tools of intimidation or blackmail.... And no one can justify actions that undermine the territorial integrity of a neighbor, or interfere with democratic movements.\" In his May 2006 State of the Federation address, President Putin appeared to respond to Vice President Cheney by criticizing those who follow \"stereotypical bloc-based thought patterns\" of the Cold War. He also obliquely stated that \"comrade wolf knows whom to eat. He is eating and listening to no one.... Where does all the rhetoric on the need to fight for human rights and democracy go to when it comes to ... one's own interests? It turns out that everything is permitted.\" President Bush was reticent in his public statements about the status of democracy in Russia when he attended the Moscow G-8 Summit in Moscow in July 2006, in line with his declared plan not to publicly \"scold\" Putin.", "As Russia prepares for the upcoming 2007-2008 cycle of Duma and presidential elections, the U.S. Administration has urged the Russian government to affirm its commitment to democratization.", "Several U.S. allies have become increasingly concerned about democratization trends in Russia. After Putin's Beslan proposals, EU Commissioner Chris Patten warned that the Russian government should not try the failed policy of combating terrorism by centralizing power. PACE in January 2005 adopted a resolution stating that it appeared that the Putin government's arrest of Khodorkovskiy \"goes beyond the mere pursuit of criminal justice, to include such elements as to weaken an outspoken political opponent, to intimidate other wealthy individuals and to regain control of strategic economic assets.\" In the wake of Russia's cutoff of gas shipments to Ukraine in January 2006, German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Russia in April 2006 and reportedly voiced serious concerns about democratization trends in Russia. EU concerns about democratization were reflected in several documents and decisions, including a May 2006 decision at an EU-Russia summit to launch negotiations on a new EU-Russia Agreement that recognizes \"common values such as democracy, human rights and the rule of law\" and covers energy cooperation. At a European Parliament session in December 2006, European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso called for a united EU stance vis-\u00e0-vis Russia on respect for human rights.
