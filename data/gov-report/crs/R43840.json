The report also refutes a persistent rumor that there are special tax benefits for aliens starting businesses in the United States.", "The report focuses on federal income taxes.

Substantial presence test: the individual is present in the United States for at least 31 days during the current year and at least 183 days during the current and previous two years (counting all the qualifying days in the current year, 1/3 of the days in the immediate preceding year, and 1/6 of the days in the earliest year).

For example, an individual meeting the substantial presence test will be treated as a nonresident alien if he or she has a closer connection to a foreign country, maintains a tax home in that country, and is in the United States for fewer than 183 days during the year.", "Resident aliens are generally subject to the same federal income tax laws as U.S. citizens, which include being subject to tax on income earned in the United States and abroad. In contrast, nonresident aliens are subject to special rules, such as only being taxed on income from U.S. sources and facing restrictions on claiming certain tax benefits.

This classification is for federal tax purposes only and does not affect the individual's immigration status.", "While an individual's status under immigration law is generally irrelevant in determining whether he or she is liable for federal income taxes or must comply with other IRC requirements, there are situations where it is important.

This means noncitizens must have a taxpayer identification number in order to file tax returns, pay taxes, and otherwise comply with federal tax law.

Does an ITIN confer immigration (legal) status?", "paragraphs": ["Being assigned an ITIN does not affect an individual's immigration status. ITINs are supplied solely so that individuals are able to comply with federal tax law, which requires that taxpayers provide a taxpayer identification number in order to file returns and other documents. In fact, one reason for having the IRS be the agency responsible for distributing ITINs was to emphasize that there are no immigration consequences of being assigned one. As the IRS has explained,", "Having the IRS as the sole issuer of ITINs will facilitate the general public's acceptance of the fact that the assignment of an ITIN creates no inference regarding the immigration status of an alien individual or the right of that individual to be legally employed in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "8. When did the IRS begin issuing ITINs?", "paragraphs": ["The IRS began issuing ITINs in 1996. Previously, most aliens with U.S. tax obligations had been able to obtain a nonwork SSN from the SSA. For those aliens without nonwork SSNs, the IRS had issued temporary, one-time identification numbers that were assigned to the return rather than the taxpayer.", "In 1995 and after discussions with SSA, the State Department, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the IRS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to issue permanent ITINs to aliens who were ineligible for SSNs. The purpose of the new ITIN system was to improve tax compliance and administration for individuals without SSNs. The regulations were finalized in 1996, and the IRS began issuing ITINs that year. The SSA, meanwhile, began the process of restricting who was eligible for nonwork SSNs, apparently due to concerns about the growth in the number of nonwork SSNs that could not be associated with a wage earner. As part of this, and in light of the new ITIN system, SSA stopped providing aliens nonwork SSNs solely so they could file their taxes. Thus, since SSA has stopped issuing SSNs for tax filing purposes and since aliens must have a taxpayer identification number in order to comply with U.S. tax law, the ITIN is used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "9. Does the IRS have the authority to issue ITINs?", "paragraphs": ["It appears the IRS's authority to issue ITINs comes from IRC Sections 6109 and 7805.

How many ITIN filers are there?", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, the most recent year for which a complete count is available, the IRS reported that 4,135,379 individual income tax returns were filed using an ITIN. This includes returns where an ITIN was used as a primary, secondary, or dependent's taxpayer identification number. (The IRS does not currently provide a more detailed breakdown of this number. For example, the IRS does not currently provide data on the number of tax returns where the ITIN was associated with a dependent child as opposed to the number of returns where it was associated with the primary taxpayer or his or her spouse.) Hence, a married couple filing jointly in which one taxpayer has an SSN and the other uses an ITIN would be counted as a return filed using an ITIN. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "11.

For example, the child tax credit requires the qualifying child be a U.S. citizen, national, or resident. This may affect the ability of taxpayers using an ITIN (e.g., a foreign taxpayer) to claim the credit\u2014not because of the ITIN, but because of the status of their children.

Examples include the following:", "\"unlawfully present aliens,\" as defined by regulation, are ineligible for the health insurance premium assistance credit enacted by the Affordable Care Act; the EITC requires taxpayers to provide SSNs that were issued for work purposes for themselves, their spouses if married filing jointly, and any qualifying children, thus denying the credit to individuals without such SSNs; and certain benefits are disallowed to nonresident aliens (see Question 1), which means any unlawfully present alien who is a nonresident alien is ineligible for these benefits. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "15. Can unlawfully present aliens claim tax benefits based on earnings?", "paragraphs": ["Several provisions in the IRC are based on earnings. Two prominent examples are the EITC and the additional child tax credit (ACTC), both of which are refundable tax credits. It might be argued that the earnings of an unlawfully present alien should not be considered when calculating these credits if that person is not legally authorized to work in the United States. ", "The EITC restricts the ability of individuals with earnings from unauthorized work to claim the credit by requiring that taxpayers provide SSNs issued for work purposes for themselves, their spouses (if married filing jointly), and any qualifying children. Some aliens who are currently in the country unlawfully may have once received work-authorized SSNs, but have since overstayed their visa. While they might attempt to claim the credit using those SSNs, it appears Congress intended to limit the EITC to those individuals whose work authorization was still valid. ", "The ACTC, on the other hand, does not have an SSN requirement, and nothing else in the tax code requires the earnings be earned while authorized to work in the United States. Therefore, it appears that unlawfully present aliens working in the United States can legally claim the credit under the IRC. In 2011, TIGTA reported that individuals not authorized to work in the United States whose tax returns were processed in 2010 claimed $4.2 billion worth of the ACTC, increasing from $924 million for returns processed in 2005 and $2.1 billion for returns processed in 2008.

How will individuals covered by the Obama Administration's recent immigration initiative be treated for federal tax purposes?", "paragraphs": ["On November 20, 2014, President Obama announced the commencement of a multi-pronged immigration initiative which would, among other things, (1) expand the scope of aliens eligible for grants of relief under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative that was announced in 2012 and (2) establish a new DACA-like initiative for unlawfully present alien parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs. Both categories of individuals would generally be subject to the same tax rules as other noncitizens (see Questions 1 and 13).", "These aliens' eligibility for two tax benefits may be affected by the President's initiative: the EITC and the ACA premium assistance credit. Aliens covered by the initiative who are given an SSN for work authorization purposes may then also be eligible for the EITC. With respect to the ACA premium tax credit, their eligibility will depend on whether they meet the credit's definition of \"lawfully present.\" Regulations define the term \"lawfully present\" to include aliens granted deferred action, with the exception of those granted deferred action through the 2012 DACA initiative. It is unclear whether this exception would also apply to aliens granted deferred action through the 2014 expansion of DACA (i.e., group (1) above).
