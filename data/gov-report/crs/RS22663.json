The U.S. Congress has played a leading role in determining program priorities and funding levels for these objectives. These programs constitute an important component of U.S. human rights policy toward China. Although the United States is not the largest bilateral aid donor to China, it is the largest provider of government and civil society programming, according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).", "In 2000, the act granting permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) treatment to China (P.L. 106-286) authorized programs to promote democracy in the PRC. Between 2001 and 2015, the United States government allocated over $417 million for Department of State and USAID foreign assistance efforts in the PRC, including Peace Corps programs. Of this total, $342 million was devoted to democracy, human rights, and related activities; Tibetan communities; and the environment. The direct recipients of State Department and USAID grants have been predominantly U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and universities. Chinese NGOs, universities, and some government entities have participated in or indirectly benefited from U.S. programs, or have collaborated with U.S. foreign aid grantees.", "Appropriations for Department of State and USAID programs in China reached a peak in FY2010, totaling $46.9 million. Funding decreased by nearly 40% between 2010 and 2012 and has since remained at lower levels. Reduced appropriations have resulted in the discontinuation of a number of rule of law and environmental programs.", "Some policymakers argue that the United States government should not fund foreign assistance programs in the PRC because Beijing has significant financial resources and can manage China's own development needs. Other critics say that U.S. democracy, human rights, rule of law, environmental, and related programs have had little effect in China. Some observers fear that growing PRC restrictions on civil society could further undermine U.S. aid efforts. Some experts counter that U.S. programs in China aim to promote U.S. interests in areas where the PRC government has lacked the expertise or will to make greater progress. They argue that U.S. assistance activities in China have helped to develop protections of some rights, build foundations for the rule of law and civil society, and bolster reform-minded officials in the PRC government. Some proponents suggest that U.S. programs have nurtured relationships among governmental and nongovernmental actors and educational institutions in the United States and the PRC, which have helped to develop common understandings about human rights, the rule of law, and related principles and norms.

Congressionally mandated foreign assistance programs constitute an important component of U.S. human rights policy toward China, along with the U.S.-China Human Rights Dialogue, public diplomacy efforts, reporting on human rights conditions in the PRC, and multilateral diplomacy at the United Nations and elsewhere. With the exception of some Tibetan and infectious disease programs, U.S. assistance efforts in the PRC do not focus on development objectives such as economic growth, poverty reduction, basic health care and education, and governmental capacity. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) does not have an aid mission in China and administers PRC programs through its regional mission in Bangkok, Thailand. The Department of State refers to China \"as a development partner with the resources to invest in its own future.\"", "Between 2001 and 2015, the United States government allocated over $417 million for the Department of State's foreign operations or aid programs in China, of which $342 million was devoted to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and related activities; Tibetan communities; and the environment.

Program areas supported by U.S. assistance have included the following: civil liberties; governmental transparency and accountability; legal training and awareness; access to legal counsel; capacity building of nongovernmental organizations; criminal justice reform; labor rights; private sector competitiveness, job skills training, and support to traditional artisans in Tibetan areas of China; and the prevention, care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS.

Chinese NGOs, universities, and some government entities have participated in or indirectly benefited from U.S. programs or collaborated with U.S. foreign aid grantees.", "Some analysts fear that growing PRC restrictions on civil society could adversely affect U.S. assistance programs. Chinese leaders long have been wary of domestic Chinese NGOs receiving foreign support, and, in recent years, PRC authorities have stepped up monitoring of Chinese NGOs that accept outside funding. In 2015, the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress considered new legislation on the management of foreign NGOs. Draft regulations place foreign NGOs and their activities under the oversight of Public Security departments and impose greater limitations or controls related to their supervision, funding, and staffing. Many experts believe that these and other new laws would give the public security apparatus greater, arbitrary authority over a wide range of social activity, and seriously impede the development of, and stifle innovation in, Chinese civil society. In September 2015, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators sent a letter to President Obama expressing concerns about the human rights situation in China. The letter stated: \"The rise of civil society in China has been one of the only human rights success stories of the past two decades, and it is imperative the U.S. speak up to protect it.\"", "In FY2011, foreign operations appropriations for programs in China began to decline after peaking in FY2010.

In 2013, the most recent year for which complete OECD numbers are available, the largest bilateral aid donors to China, ranked by the amount of ODA, were Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Denmark. About two-thirds of ODA from Germany and 60% from France were provided in the form of concessional or low-interest loans. The United Kingdom and the United States do not provide development loans to China. Japan, once a large provider of loan assistance, stopped extending such financing to China in 2008. In terms of ODA grants, in 2013, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States offered $274 million, $163 million, $30 million, and $50 million, respectively, to the PRC. OECD data indicate that the United States was the largest source of support for \"government and civil society\" sector activities in 2013 ($18.4 million), largely provided through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), followed by Germany ($16.3 million). German and French development programs in China largely focus upon education, health, water supply and sanitation, environmental protection, agriculture, and \"other social infrastructure and services.\" ", "Some bilateral donors have begun to reduce assistance to China due to Beijing's ability to finance its own development and provide foreign aid to less developed countries. In 2011, the United Kingdom and Australia announced that they would begin phasing out their aid programs in China, and the European Union (EU) announced that it would cut ODA to 19 emerging economies, including Brazil, China, and India, beginning in 2014. The European Commission stated that China \"has moved from being a traditional recipient of overseas development assistance to the position of a strategic partner.... Increasingly, the country is an important source of aid for other developing countries.\" ", "The EU reportedly funded aid projects and programs in China worth \u20ac224 million ($291 million) in 2007-2013. Program areas included the following: democracy and human rights; NGO financing; gender (women migrant workers); health; environmental programs; urban development; business cooperation; higher education; and information technology and communication. The EU currently lists ongoing, multi-year aid efforts in China worth approximately \u20ac15 million ($16 million). Program areas include strengthening civil society and promoting non-state actors in the following activities: combating HIV/AIDS; empowering and integrating young migrant populations; enhancing disabled persons organizations; caring for children-at-risk, particularly children of convicted parents; assisting people with mental health conditions; protecting the environment through public awareness and corporate responsibility; and supporting sustainable development in Tibet.", "OECD data include not only State Department and USAID funding, but also international programs carried out by other U.S. agencies. In 2013-2014, the Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) supported major activities in China. DOE efforts in China included programs to promote nuclear security through the reduction and protection of nuclear materials. TDA is an independent U.S. foreign assistance agency that is funded by Congress, whose mission is to promote the export of U.S. goods and services for development projects in emerging economies. HHS efforts in the PRC focused on the control of infectious diseases. In addition, the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency administered relatively small programs in China to protect endangered species and address air pollution. OECD data also include programs administered by the National Endowment for Democracy, a private foundation that receives an annual congressional appropriation. ", "Some private entities also support human rights, the rule of law, civil society, and environmental conservation in China. For example, the Ford Foundation, which does not receive U.S. government support, is one of the leading providers of assistance to China in the areas of civil society and good governance. It has offered grants worth over $350 million for programs in China since 1988. The Foundation's grants database listed over 87 programs with total funding of approximately $18 million during 2012-2015. Working with research institutes, civil society organizations, and government entities in China, Ford Foundation activities aim to promote civil society and philanthropy; transparent, effective, and accountable government; civil and criminal justice system reform; access to secondary and higher education; community involvement in natural resources policy; and awareness in the areas of sexuality and reproductive health. Programs include research on civil society; courses in citizen participation, social accountability, and governance for NGO leaders; legal aid and education; and training for villagers and local officials regarding rights under current laws and policies. Oxfam Hong Kong has been engaged in poverty alleviation, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, disaster relief, civil society development, and other efforts in mainland China since 1987. Oxfam reported that in 2013, the organization spent $14.2 million on programs, administered in partnership with Chinese NGOs and government entities, related to labor conditions, education for migrant children, violence against women, and environmental protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Debates", "paragraphs": ["As with many other efforts to promote democracy, human rights, and the rule of law in China, some observers maintain that U.S. assistance has not led to meaningful changes. They posit that foreign-funded rule of law, civil society, and related efforts in China have produced marginal results due in part to the Chinese Communist Party's rejection of many forms of institutional checks on state power. Inherent obstacles to reform, they assert, include the lack of judicial autonomy, restrictions on lawyers, weak enforcement of laws, and severe curbs on civil liberties and the ability of NGOs and Chinese citizens to perform social functions independently of state control. Some human rights activists argue that some U.S. stakeholders involved in such activities may refrain from supporting tougher U.S. approaches toward China's human rights abuses in order to protect their programs and policy interests. They suggest that U.S. assistance should focus on changing China's understanding of the rule of law, rather than expanding existing programs. ", "Other experts assert that U.S.-funded programs in the PRC have helped to strengthen protections of some rights, promote good governance practices, build foundations for the rule of law and civil society, and temper the effects of periodic political crackdowns. For example, the efforts of the United States government and private organizations, such as the Dui Hua Foundation, reportedly have helped to achieve some progress in the area of criminal justice reform in China in recent years. Some experts refer to the role of U.S. programs in promoting access to legal counsel; greater professionalism among judicial and legal personnel; increasingly worldly and dynamic NGOs and social organizations; and a cadre of human rights activists and lawyers. Some argue that U.S. assistance efforts respond to broad Chinese interest and support, and many observers note that awareness of legal rights among many segments of PRC society is growing.", "Some Members of Congress have advocated eliminating U.S. assistance activities in the PRC, with the exception of aid to Tibetans and some human rights and democracy programs. In particular, during the 112 th Congress, after a decade of congressional support for expanded programming, some Members argued that China does not need or deserve U.S. assistance, due to its enormous trade surplus and foreign exchange reserves, allegedly unfair trade practices, and poor human rights record. Some proponents of U.S. programs in China responded that U.S. assistance does not provide support to the PRC government, U.S. programs benefit U.S. interests, and they operate in areas where the PRC government has lacked sufficient capacity or commitment. ", "Some Members also opposed U.S. environmental programs in China, asserting that it is not the responsibility of the United States to help alleviate China's environmental problems. They argued that such assistance may unfairly bolster China's economy through the possible transfer of environmental and energy-saving technologies. Furthermore, they emphasized, China has been accused of not enforcing environmental regulations and of unfair trade in the clean energy sector. However, some U.S. officials defended the environmental programs, noting that air pollution from China has adversely impacted North American air and water, particularly on the U.S. West Coast.
