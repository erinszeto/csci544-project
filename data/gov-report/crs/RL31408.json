Congress passed the 2001 USA PATRIOT Act ( P.L. 107-56 ) that, inter alia , makes it easier for law enforcement officials to monitor Internet activities. That act wasamended by the Homeland Security Act ( P.L. 107-296 ), loosening restrictions as to when, and towhom, Internet Service Providers may voluntarily release the content of communications if theybelieve there is a danger of death or injury.

The result was the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA),Title XIII of Division C of the FY1999 Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency SupplementalAppropriations Act, P.L. 105-277 . (1) The FTC's final rule implementing the law became effective April21, 2000 http://www.ftc.gov/os/1999/10/64fr59888.htm . Commercial websites and online servicesdirected to children under 13, or that knowingly collect information from them, must inform parentsof their information practices and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, ordisclosing personal information from children. The Commission adopted a \"sliding scale\" forcomplying with the verifiable consent requirement depending on how the data would be used. Thatis, if the information was for internal use only, the verifiable consent could be obtained from theparent by e-mail, plus an additional step to ensure the person giving consent is, in fact, the parent. If the website operator planned to disclose the information publicly or to third parties, a higherstandard was set. This sliding scale was set to expire in 2002 with the expectation that betterverification technologies would become available. However, in 2002, the FTC determined that suchtechnologies still were not available, and the sliding scale was extended to April 12, 2005. In 2005,the Commission extended it again, and is seeking public comment on how to proceed, as part of itsoverall review of the COPPA rule.

The FTC continued monitoring websites to determine if legislation was needed for thosenot covered by COPPA. In 1999, the FTC concluded that more legislation was not needed at thattime because of indications of progress by industry at self-regulation, including creation of \"seal\"programs (see below) and by two surveys conducted by Georgetown University. However, in May2000, the FTC changed its mind following another survey that found only 20% of randomly visitedwebsites and 42% of the 100 most popular websites had implemented all four fair informationpractices. The FTC voted to recommend that Congress pass legislation requiring websites to adhereto the four fair information practices, but the 3-2 vote indicated division within the Commission. On October 4, 2001, Timothy Muris, who had recently become FTC Chairman, stated that he did notsee a need for additional legislation at that time.

In the wake of theSeptember 11 terrorist attacks, the debate over law enforcement monitoring has intensified. Previously, the issue had focused on the extent to which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),with legal authorization, used a software program, called Carnivore (later renamed DCS 1000), tointercept e-mail and monitor Web activities of certain suspects. The FBI would install the softwareon the equipment of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Privacy advocates were concerned aboutwhether Carnivore-like systems can differentiate between e-mail and Internet usage by a subject ofan investigation and similar usage by other people. Technical details of the system were not publiclyavailable, meaning that privacy groups were unable to independently determine exactly what thesystem could or could not do, leading to their concerns. Section 305 of the 21st Century Departmentof Justice Appropriations Authorization Act ( P.L. 107-273 ) required the Justice Department to reportto Congress at the end of FY2002 and FY2003 on its use of Carnivore/DCS 1000 or any similarsystem.

The contents can be disclosed to \"a Federal, state, or localgovernmental entity\" (instead of a \"law enforcement agency\").

EPIC notes, for example, that allowing the contents of Internet communicationsto be disclosed voluntarily to any governmental entity not only poses increased risk to personalprivacy, but also is a poor security strategy. Another concern is that the law does not provide forjudicial oversight of the use of these procedures. (10) A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on September 23, 2004explored some of these concerns.

As December 31, 2005approached, the issue became very contentious. The House passed a permanent extension (i.e., itrepealed the sunset clause) in H.R. 3199 . The Senate, however, passed only asix-month extension ( S. 2167 ) to allow time for further consideration of concerns bysome Senators that more civil liberties protections are needed. The House did not agree with theSenate action, and amended S. 2167 so that the extension was only for five weeks (throughFebruary 3, 2006) to ensure that the Congress dealt with the issue early in the second session.

Judges Torruella and Cyr concluded, however, that they were in temporary storagein Interloc's computer system, and therefore were not subject to the provisions of the Wiretap Act.

Moreover,at this juncture, much of the protection may have been eviscerated by the realities of moderntechnology.... However, it is not the province of this court to graft meaning onto the statute whereCongress has spoken plainly.\" (p. 14-15). In his dissent, Judge Lipez stated, conversely, that he didnot believe Congress intended for e-mail that is temporarily stored as part of the transmission processto have less privacy than messages as they are in transit. He agreed with the government'scontention that an \"intercept\" occurs between the time the author hits the \"send\" button and themessage arrives in the recipient's in-box. He concluded that \"Councilman's approach to the WiretapAct would undo decades of practice and precedent ... and would essentially render the actirrelevant....

The term \"spyware\" is not well defined. Oneexample of spyware is software products that include, as part of the software itself, a method bywhich information is collected about the use of the computer on which the software is installed. Some products may collect personally identifiable information (PII). When the computer isconnected to the Internet, the software periodically relays the information back to the softwaremanufacturer or a marketing company. Some software traces a user's Web activity and causesadvertisements to suddenly appear on the user's monitor -- called \"pop-up\" ads -- in response. Suchsoftware is called \"adware,\" and one aspect of the spyware debate is whether adware should beincluded in the definition of spyware. Software programs that include spyware can be sold orprovided for free, on a disk (or other media) or downloaded from the Internet. Typically, users haveno knowledge that spyware is on their computers.", "A central point of the debate is whether new laws are needed, or if industry self-regulation,coupled with enforcement actions under existing laws such as the Federal Trade Commission Act,is sufficient. The lack of a precise definition for spyware is cited as a fundamental problem inattempting to write new laws. FTC representatives and others caution that new legislation couldhave unintended consequences, barring current or future technologies that might, in fact, havebeneficial uses. They further insist that, if legal action is necessary, existing laws provide sufficientauthority. Consumer concern about control of their computers being taken over by spyware leadsothers to conclude that legislative action is needed.", "Utah and California have passed spyware laws, but there is no specific federal law regardingspyware.
