This report provides a description of and background for selected provisions in the Rebuild America's Schools Act of 2019 ( H.R. 865 / S. 266 ), which would provide federal funding for public school construction. H.R. 865 was ordered to be reported by the House Committee on Education and Labor on February 26, 2019.

Funds would be allocated to states proportionally based on their prior-year share of grant allocations under Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), a grant program designed to provide educational and related services to low-achieving and other students attending schools with relatively high concentrations of students from low-income families.

In school year 2015-2016, for instance, public elementary and secondary schools in the United States collectively received about 47% of their revenue from state governments and about 45% from local governments. Of the local revenue, the majority\u00e2\u0080\u0094approximately 81%\u00e2\u0080\u0094was derived from property taxes. While different states and LEAs have access to various other funding streams and mechanisms to finance school construction, a common practice to raise funds for this purpose is to issue a general obligation bond (backed by the credit of the state or local government) and repay the debt over time with revenue from sources such as property taxes. Nationwide, public schools spent approximately $48 billion on facilities acquisition and construction in the 2015-2016 school year. ", "While state and local governments typically provide the majority of support for facilities-related expenditures in public K-12 schools, the federal government also provides some direct and indirect support for school infrastructure. Federal direct support is provided through loans and grants to K-12 schools with specific needs or serving certain populations of students. For example, there are school infrastructure grant programs respectively for schools with high populations of students with disabilities or students who are Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, American Indians, or children of military parents. Funding is also available to schools affected by natural disasters or located in rural areas. Additionally, there are facilities financing assistance programs to encourage the development of charter schools. Although ED administers several of the grant programs funding facilities at elementary and secondary schools, other agencies, such as the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense, also administer programs. ", "Aside from the targeted efforts, a one-time appropriation of $1.2 billion was made under the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2001 ( P.L. 106-554 ) for emergency school renovation and repair activities, as well as activities under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and technology activities. Most recently, Congress provided a one-time appropriation in 2009, as part of the response to the Great Recession, that could be used for renovation and construction, among other purposes. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ) authorized a $54 billion State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF). States were required to use at least 81.8% of their share of the SFSF to restore support of public elementary, secondary, and postsecondary schools, and, as applicable, early childhood education programs and services. Among the allowable uses of restoration funds were modernization, renovation, or repair of public school facilities. States were required to use the remaining 18.2% of their share of the SFSF for education, public safety, and other government services, which included modernization, renovation, or repair of public school and public or private college facilities, depending on the criteria that the state's governor used to allocate the funds. ED issued guidance specifically allowing a portion of the SFSF to be used for the construction of K-12 schools but not institutions of higher education.", "Another large source of federal contributions to school facilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094the forgone revenue attributable to the exemption of interest on state and local governmental bonds used for school construction, modernization, renovation, and repair\u00e2\u0080\u0094is indirect. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC, or Chapter 26 of the U.S. Code) provides for the federal government to exempt interest income earned on bonds issued by state, local, and tribal governments for a \"public\" purpose from federal income tax (26 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7103). \u00c2\u00a0Examples of public projects include elementary, secondary, and postsecondary schools; public buildings; and roads. The tax exemption lowers the cost of capital for state and local governments because investors are generally willing to accept a lower rate of return when it is not subject to federal taxation.
