Maintaining theplant on standby status also has its cost ($5 million annually). ", "Preparing the plant for full operational capacity has some environmental advocacy groups in the United States and Mexico concerned. They are worried about the impact on a wetland in Mexico as a result of plant operations. The salineagricultural water that is currently diverted around the desalting plant because it isnot operating is discharged into the Cienega de Santa Clara wetlands in Mexico. This diverted water supports 11,000 acres of wetlands that are a protected biosphereby the Mexican government and provide habitat for species designated as threatenedand endangered by the U.S. and Mexican governments. The water diverted to thesewetlands does not currently count toward the Colorado River water that the UnitedStates is required to deliver to Mexico under a 1944 treaty. If the plant were tobecome operational, the treated water would likely be discharged into the ColoradoRiver and the saline effluent stream discharged into the Cienega. The water reachingthe Cienega would likely be 4 to 5 times more saline, and the quantity reaching theCienega would be 30% of the current flow. Environmental groups supportalternatives to plant operation, such as short-term leases of water rights, whilesupporters of plant operations argue that the demand for the water in the UnitedStates is too high to allow for the water to continue flowing to the Cienega withoutit counting toward the treaty requirements.

Within DSW, NNSA plans to conduct a study for the RNEP, for which $15.0 million wasappropriated for FY2003; another $15.0 million was requested for FY2004.Warheads of this type would burrow into the ground before detonating in order todestroy underground targets with less explosive yield than a surface-burst weaponwould require. This warhead is controversial. Supporters argue that it is needed toattack hard and deeply buried targets (such as leadership bunkers or chemicalweapons production facilities) in countries of concern, thereby deterring or defeatingsuch nations; critics reply that RNEP would lower the threshold for use of nuclearweapons and prompt other nations to develop nuclear weapons to deter U.S. attack.

Pits are the fissile cores of nuclear warheads that trigger the thermonuclear secondary stage. DOE has had no facility to produce pitsfor use in stockpiled weapons since it suspended pit production at the Rocky FlatsPlant (CO) in 1989. As a result, the United States has been unable to make all-newnuclear warheads of existing or advanced new designs. The Pit Manufacturing andCertification Campaign supports two pit projects: installation of a low-capacity pitproduction facility, and supporting R&D, at Los Alamos National Laboratory; andplanning for a higher-capacity Modern Pit Facility.

The Senate Appropriations Committeefor FY2002 recommended increasing funding substantially to \"fully fund\" allrelevant activities, viewing the then-current schedule, which would not certify a pitfor use in the stockpile until FY2009, as \"unacceptable\" ( S.Rept. 107-39 ). In itsFY2003 request, NNSA stated its plans to \"certify a W88 pit built at [Los AlamosNational Laboratory] without underground nuclear testing by FY 2009, with a goalof achieving an earlier date of FY 2007.\" Further, NNSA planned to defer detaileddesign of a Modern Pit Facility until FY2004, \"with FY 2003 funding used tocontinue manufacturing concepts.\" The FY2002 appropriation for this campaign was$219 million.", "The FY2003 request was $194.5 million.

The sum includes the requested $2.0 million for pit activities and$2.0 million for the Modern Pit Facility. The committee, however, \"remains greatlyconcerned about the NNSA's refusal to request funds consistent with its own projectplan submitted less than 1 year ago.\" Because this was not done, which would haveresulted in a lower request for this important project, \"the Committee has been forcedto reduce other items in the budget.\" For pit manufacturing and certification, theHouse Appropriations Committee provided $194.5 million, the requested amount,while the final appropriation provided $220.6 million. According to the jointexplanatory statement of the Committee of Conference, \"The increase will ensurethat the NNSA maintains its commitment to produce a certifiable W88 pit by 2003and a certified W88 pit by 2007.\"", "For FY2004, the Administration requested a substantial increase to items in this campaign: $126.8 million for manufacturing the pit for the W88 warhead, $108.6million for W88 pit certification, $19.7 million for Pit Manufacturing Capability (pitactivities not specifically supporting the W88), and $22.8 million for planning for theModern Pit Facility. In addition, it requested $42.4 million for \"subcriticalexperiments [at the Nevada Test Site] which support the certification of the W88pit.\" For FY2004, this funding element was transferred into the Pit Manufacturingand Certification Campaign from Directed Stockpile Work; its FY2003 request was$41.5 million. Thus the total request for FY2004 is $320.2 million, an increase of35.7% over the FY2003 request of $236.0 million (with both figures includingsubcritical experiments supporting W88 pit certification).", "The House Appropriations Committee saw the pit campaign as proceeding too quickly. It recommended reducing the request for this campaign by $47.0 million,still an increase of $12.2 million over the FY2003 budget. The committee praisedNNSA and Los Alamos National Laboratory for \"turning around\" this campaign, buturged NNSA to reduce costs. It stated that the current plan would \"aggressivelypursue a multi-billion dollar Modern Pit Facility before the first production pit haseven been successfully certified for use in the stockpile.\" In reducing MPF to $10.8million from the requested $22.8 million, it recommended that NNSA should lookhard at better ways to use the pit production facility at Los Alamos for near-termrequirements and \"take a less aggressive planning approach\" to MPF. It felt that itwas premature to spend $19.7 million to develop technologies for manufacturing pitsother than for the W88 when MPF was at least 15 years from operating, and sorecommended reducing this part of the request, Pit Manufacturing Capability, to $4.7million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended the amount requestedfor this campaign.

Theyreduced MPF funding to $10.8 million: \"The conferees agree with the House Reportthat until the Congress reviews the revised future Stockpile plan it is premature topursue further decisions regarding the Modern Pit Facility.\"", " National Ignition Facility (NIF). This facility, under construction at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is to be the world's largestlaser. It is a key project for the stockpile stewardship program. NIF is intended tohelp solve weapons problems, attract top physicists to the nuclear weapons program,and advance the quest for fusion power. A top priority of the facility is to achieve\"ignition,\" in which nuclear fusion of deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen)would release more energy than was provided by the laser to achieve fusion.", "Over the years, various reports have been highly critical of NIF on such grounds as technical problems, delays, and cost overruns. (8) In 1999, the NIF Project identifiedseveral problems with the original cost estimates and notified DOE that NIF couldnot be completed for the original estimated cost. The project was rebaselined andrevalidated in 2000, adding approximately $1 billion to the cost and several years tothe schedule. Since mid-2001, criticism of NIF has fallen sharply; for example, theNatural Resources Defense Council's NIF resources page was last updated February7, 2000, and the most recent General Accounting Office report on NIF was datedJune 1, 2001. (9) The NIF Project Office stated in 2002that the project was on theschedule and budget set forth in the new baseline, and that no technical obstaclesremained. The FY2004 budget document shows the total project cost of NIF toremain at $2,248.1 million, plus $1,200.0 million in other related costs, with physicalconstruction to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2008; these dates and costs arethe same as the FY2001 amended budget request. The document further states thatthe NIF project \"continues to meet all major milestones on or ahead of schedule,\"and that the first stockpile stewardship experiments on NIF are planned for 2004.", "In its FY2003 report, the Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern that the project's scope seemed to be shifting \"from a focus on achieving the specificgoal of ignition to a generalized physics research program.\" In response, \"[t]heCommittee rejects this re-prioritization and down-scoping. Ignition is now and willremain the primary objective\" for NIF. In part because of concern that theAdministration did not request certain funds for equipment and technology essentialfor ignition, the committee added $35.0 million to the FY2003 request for inertialconfinement fusion, for a total of $487.3 million ( S.Rept. 107-220 ). The HouseAppropriations Committee provided $498.8 million, and also expressed concern thatNNSA was changing the focus \"from the specific goal of ignition to a generalizedphysics research program.\" Accordingly, it \"direct[ed] NNSA to re-establish ignitionas the primary objective and justification for the NIF.\" ( H.Rept. 107-681 .) The finalfigure for FY2003 was $489.7 million for inertial confinement fusion, including$214.0 million, the same as the request, for continued construction of NIF.

In addition, the RTBF element Operationsof Facilities included $32.5 million appropriated for FY2003 for the National Centerfor Combating Terrorism.

A key issue is whether the United States can and should continue to maintain its weapons throughthe Stockpile Stewardship Program without nuclear testing. While that program hassought to do so, statements in early 2002 implied a reduced commitment to thatapproach. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld reportedly said that nations withnuclear weapons have \"a responsibility to see that they are safe and reliable. To theextent that can be done without testing, clearly that is the preference. And that is whythe President has concluded that, thus far, that is the case.\" (11) J. D. Crouch, AssistantSecretary of Defense for International Security Policy, stated that there is \"no changein the Administration's policy at this point on nuclear testing. We continue to opposeCTBT [Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty] ratification. We also continue to adhere toa testing moratorium.\" (12)", "The FY2004 budget request contained $303.5 million for Weapons Activities at the Nevada Site Office, vs. $292.5 million for FY2003. (13) Much of this was foroperation of the site, safeguards and security, and operation and maintenance ofexperimental facilities at NTS.", "Of particular interest regarding testing is Test Readiness, a component of the Program Readiness element of RTBF. Since FY1996, U.S. policy has been thatNNSA (or DOE prior to NNSA's establishment) should be ready to conduct a nucleartest within 24 to 36 months from the time the order is given. Several studiesidentified work needed to reduce this time to 18 months. These studies were fundedby \"Enhanced Test Readiness.\" The FY2004 budget document stated, \"The DoD andthe NNSA agreed to transition to an 18-month test readiness posture while continuingto review the optimum posture. The actions necessary for moving toward an18-month posture are expected to begin upon completion of the final FY 2003appropriation.\" The Senate Armed Services Committee's bill for FY2004 nationaldefense authorizations, S. 1050 , section 3132, required an 18-monthposture unless the Secretary of Energy determined that a different posture waspreferable. NNSA, however, prepared a study in April 2003 that concluded that an18-month posture was preferable. (14) Meanwhile,through FY2003, funds in the\"Nevada Site Readiness\" account maintained the 24- to 36-month posture withongoing work at the Nevada Test Site. Because no policy decision had been reachedon reducing the time needed to test, the Enhanced Test Readiness and Nevada SiteReadiness accounts had to be kept separated. With the move to an 18-month testreadiness posture, the enhanced posture was expected to become the current posture,which would have made this separation unnecessary. Accordingly, the two accountswere expected to be merged into \"Test Readiness\" beginning in FY2004, dependingon congressional language, though the FY2004 NNSA budget request level did notreflect that merger.", "The FY2003 appropriation for enhanced test readiness was $15.0 million. Conferees on the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for FY2003 directed DOEto notify the Appropriations Committees before obligating any of these funds inFY2003. ( H.Rept. 108-10 .) The FY2004 request for Test Readiness was $24.9million, and for Nevada Site Readiness was $39.6 million.", "In its FY2004 report, the House Appropriations Committee sharply criticized the plan for enhanced test readiness and recommended eliminating FY2004 funds forit. The committee expressed its concern over an \"open-ended commitment\" toenhanced test readiness \"without any budget analysis or program plan to evaluate theefficiency or effectiveness of this funding increase,\" argued that the proposal \"doesnot address the fundamental difficulties in maintaining test readiness during a testingmoratorium,\" and noted that it took 18-24 months to conduct a fully-instrumentedtest during the era of routine testing so that a proposal to maintain indefinitely an18-month posture during the testing moratorium \"reflects a disturbing 'cost is noobject' perspective.\" Finally, even though NNSA and DOD decided to move to an18-month test readiness posture, \"The Committee does not recognize the NNSAdeclaring a revised test readiness posture as a new requirement nor is it convincedthat the decision can be successfully implemented based on the planning informationprovided to date.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee made no reference tonuclear test readiness, and provided the amount requested for Program Readiness, thecomponent of RTBF containing test readiness funds. The Feinstein amendment( S.Amdt. 1655 ) discussed under DSW, which was tabled, would havebarred use of funds provided by H.R. 2754 for modifying the testreadiness posture to a posture of less than 24 months. Conferees provided $24.9million for test readiness, as requested, on grounds that test readiness had atrophied. \"However, the conferees expect the NNSA to focus on restoring a rigorous testreadiness program that is capable of meeting the current 24-month requirementbefore requesting significant additional funds to pursue a more aggressive goal of an18-month readiness posture.\"", "Budget Process Issues. NNSA issued its first Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) in March 2002. The HouseAppropriations Committee criticized that effort. The committee, in its FY2003report on Energy and Water Development Appropriations ( H.Rept. 107-681 ), stated,", "the FYNSP has several fundamental weaknesses that limit its usefulness for Congressional oversight. ... The NNSA budget and the FYNSP arebuilt around activities rather than programs and products. ... The FYNSPincludes a laundry list of performance targets -- few of which are the sameas an identifiable program -- and there is no specific funding associatedwith any of the performance targets. Thus, it is impossible to determinehow a specific resource allocation will impact performance. ... It is difficultfor the Congress to determine what NNSA proposes to accomplish withthese funds. ...

The amount of time and money needed to clean up environmental contaminationresulting from the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War has been alongstanding issue. Since the beginning of the U.S. atomic energy program, DOEand its predecessors have been responsible for administering the production ofnuclear weapons and managing radioactive and other hazardous waste. In later years,DOE expanded its efforts to include the environmental restoration of radioactive sitesand those with other hazardous contamination in buildings, soil, and water to ensuretheir safety for future uses. In 1989, the George H. W. Bush Administrationestablished an Environmental Management Program within DOE to consolidate theagency's efforts in cleaning up contamination from defense nuclear waste, as well aswaste from civilian nuclear energy research. DOE is responsible for complying withnumerous federal environmental laws and regulations in administering the program,and is subject to fines and penalties for violations of these requirements. Consequently, DOE has signed numerous legally binding compliance agreementswith the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states to perform cleanupactivities and dispose of waste according to specific deadlines. ", "DOE reports that there are 114 geographic sites in 31 states and one U.S. territory where the production of nuclear weapons, and civilian nuclear energyresearch and development activities, resulted in radioactive and other hazardouscontamination. Together, these sites occupy approximately 2 million acres, whichis equivalent to the land area of Rhode Island and Delaware combined. DOE reportsthat all response actions were complete at 75 sites as of the end of FY2002 at a costof over $60 billion, and expected that cleanup would be complete at two additionalsites by the end of FY2003. However, the sites that have been cleaned up arerelatively small and are among the least hazardous, and the sites where cleanupremains underway contain some of the most severely contaminated areas. DOE hasestimated that, if program reforms are not initiated, cleanup at the remaining sitesmay take 70 years to complete, and that total cleanup costs may range from $220billion to as high as $300 billion.", "DOE has been working on a cleanup reform initiative that would accelerate cleanup and lower costs. The Department estimates that its initiative could savebetween $50 billion and $100 billion in total cleanup costs over the long term, andthat the time frame for total site cleanup could be moved from 2070 to 2035. Thesegoals would be accomplished by assessing the risk of exposure to determine whichcleanup remedies are selected. Risk is currently one of many factors that DOE usesto select cleanup remedies. Altering the current process to use risk as the primaryfactor could result in decisions to contain waste on site as a means of preventingexposure, rather than removing it. While containment can often be accomplishedmore quickly and at less cost, the possibility of future exposure remains if the methodof containment fails over time.", "While there has been widespread concern about the amount of time and money needed to clean up nuclear waste sites, questions have been raised as to how DOEwould use a risk-based approach to accomplish its goals of faster and less costlycleanups without weakening environmental protection. Some have drawn attentionto the possibility that basing the selection of cleanup remedies on risk alone mightresult in more contamination being left on site, rather than it being removed. Because of the substantial amount of time required for radioactive decay to occur,arguments have been raised that contamination left in place may migrate inunexpected ways over the long term, and result in pathways of exposure that couldnot have been predicted when the remedy was originally selected. Others counterthat completely removing radioactive contamination from all sites to permitunrestricted future land use, and eliminate all future pathways of exposure, would notbe economically feasible, and in some cases would be beyond the capabilities ofcurrent cleanup technologies.", "DOE first proposed a risk-based cleanup reform strategy as part of its FY2003 budget request. In the 107th Congress, numerous questions were presented during theFY2003 appropriations debate as to whether the use of risk-based approaches wouldprovide adequate environmental protection. Prior to final action on FY2003appropriations, DOE signed letters of intent with EPA and the states to acceleratecleanup at most of its sites. Some Members criticized DOE's attempt to implementits cleanup reform strategy prior to the appropriation of funds as premature. WhileCongress did appropriate funding to honor these agreements, it provided the fundsunder the existing account structure rather than under a separate cleanup reformaccount that DOE had proposed. Some Members expressed concern about how thefunds would have been distributed among the sites if DOE had been given anunallocated lump sum under a new account.", "For FY2004, DOE requested a total of $7.24 billion for its Environmental Management Program, $290 million more than the FY2003 enacted level of $6.95billion. The budget request proposed a new appropriations account structure for theprogram in order to focus funding on DOE's reform initiative to accelerate cleanupschedules and lower costs. The proposed accounts were structured according to thepurposes of \"Site Acceleration Completion\" and \"Environmental Services,\" and therewere separate \"Defense\" and \"Non-defense\" accounts for each category. The SiteAcceleration Completion accounts represented nearly $6.0 billion of the total request,and focused funding on efforts to complete cleanup and close contaminated facilitiesat a faster pace than previously scheduled. The Environmental Services accountsfocused funding on activities that indirectly support the mission of acceleratedcleanup and closure, such as policy development and coordination, and theintegration of mission activities across the complex of sites. The budget request alsoproposed a Uranium Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund Account tosupport the cleanup of uranium and thorium processing sites, for which there hadbeen a similar account entitled Uranium Facilities Maintenance and Remediation.", "The conference agreement on H.R. 2754 approved the Administration's proposed account structure.

Thereduction was directed at defense sites, for which the conference agreement provided$6.64 billion, $168 million less than the request of $6.81 billion, whereas the requestfor non-defense sites was increased by $40 million, from $463 million to $503million. Conference report language indicated that less funding was appropriatedthan requested for defense sites, primarily due to concern that DOE had not madesufficient progress in negotiating all of its cleanup agreements to the satisfaction ofEPA and the states, which had been expressed in the House bill. Negotiations torevise these agreements would be necessary to allow the selection of cleanupremedies to be altered according to a risk-based approach.", "The conference report also reiterated concerns expressed by the House and Senate about inaccurate estimates of cleanup costs and scheduling of certain projects,particularly the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant. DOE hadrecently understated the estimated cost of this project by 33%. The House and Senatehad expressed concerns that this sharp increase may be an indicator that costestimates of cleanup acceleration projects at other sites also could be understated. In response, the conference agreement directed DOE to transfer $2.5 million of itsEnvironmental Management funds to the Office of Management, Budget, andEvaluation for increased oversight of accelerated cleanup projects. The Senate hadrecommended $5 million for this purpose.", "Another issue noted in the conference agreement is the possible need for amendments to existing law to allow certain cleanup acceleration projects to proceed. To examine this need, DOE is directed to prepare a report to Congress within 60 daysof enactment on potential statutory restrictions that may delay or prohibit cleanupacceleration projects that are currently planned. The conference agreement alsodirects DOE to submit a legislative proposal requesting these changes as part of theAdministration's FY2005 budget submission to Congress.", "In addition to the conference report language discussed above, the House raised questions about long-term stewardship needs once cleanup is complete at each site,and directed DOE to consider these needs when implementing accelerated cleanupplans \"to ensure that long-term stewardship is not used as a substitute for completeand effective site cleanup.\" As discussed earlier, some have expressed concern thatDOE's cleanup acceleration strategy may result in more waste being left on site thanwould be allowed under original cleanup agreements. If more waste were permittedto remain, rather than being removed, the stewardship costs at such sites would likelyrise as a result of the need for additional measures to ensure that the waste continuesto be safely contained in future years to prevent exposure. In response to this issue,the House report indicated that the Performance Management Plan for each cleanupsite should identify the resources that would be necessary for fulfilling DOE'sresponsibilities to manage the legacy of contained waste that is left behind aftercleanup response actions are complete.", "Civilian Nuclear Waste.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requested a total budget of $626.1million for FY2003, including $7.3 million for the NRC inspector general's office. The funding request was 8.3% above the FY2003 level. Major activities conductedby NRC include safety regulation and licensing of commercial nuclear reactors,licensing of nuclear waste facilities, and oversight of nuclear materials users. TheHouse and Senate approved the full NRC request, as did the enacted bill.", "In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, NRC has focused additional attention on the security of nuclear power plantsand other users of radioactive material. NRC's FY2004 budget request included$53.1 million for activities related to homeland security, a 50% increase overFY2003. In FY2004, NRC intends to begin conducting \"full security performancereviews, including force-on-force exercises, at each nuclear power plant on a 3-yearcycle instead of the 8-year cycle that the agency used before September 11, 2001.\" (For more information on protecting licensed nuclear facilities, see CRS Report RS21131 , Nuclear Power Plants: Vulnerability to Terrorist Attack .)

The FY2003 appropriation provided about $25 million for new reactorlicensing, up from $10 million in FY2002. According to the NRC budgetjustification, the funding will be used for early site permits (sites approved for futurereactors), reactor pre-licensing and licensing reviews, and updating the nuclearlicensing infrastructure.", "For the decade before FY2001, NRC's budget was offset 100% by fees on nuclear power plants and payments by other licensed activities, such as the DOEnuclear waste program. The nuclear power industry had long contended that the feestructure required nuclear reactor owners to pay for a number of NRC programs, suchas foreign nuclear safety efforts, from which they did not directly benefit. To accountfor that concern, the FY2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act( P.L. 106-377 ) included an NRC proposal to phase down the agency's fee recoveryto 90% during the subsequent 5 years -- two percentage points per year.
