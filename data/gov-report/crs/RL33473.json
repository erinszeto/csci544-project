Between October 1, 1980, and September 30, 1993, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) collected information about reports of inappropriate communications, threats, and attacks involving federal judicial officials. During the 13-year period, 3,096 reports were recorded by the USMS. Approximately 8% of the reports involved inappropriate communications that appeared to be linked to later, more serious actions; 4% involved incidents where court officials were attacked or involved in attacks against others; and another 4% involved incidents where court officials were in danger of being harmed by people who threatened or attempted to take inappropriate actions. More recently, the USMS reported that they received an estimated 700 threats against members of the judiciary each year. Of these, about 20 were serious enough to warrant a protective detail and about 12 warranted around-the-clock protection.", "Additional data, while more limited, demonstrate that state and local judges face many of the same threats as federal judges.

Thirty-five percent of the respondents reported that they changed their judicial conduct \"somewhat\" or \"a great deal\" because either they or one of their associates had experienced one or more threats, inappropriate approaches, or physical assaults. Moreover, New York's Office of Court Administration reported that since 1987, it has handled more than 2,000 reported threats against judges, with more than 1,300 of the reported threats occurring since 1995.", "There have been concerns about the ability of the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to provide security for the federal judiciary. A Department of Justice (DOJ), Office of the Inspector General (OIG), report on the U.S. Marshal's Judicial Security process found that USMS routinely failed to assess the threats against federal judges in a timely manner. The OIG found that USMS has limited ability to collect and share intelligence on threats to the judiciary amongst its districts and its representatives on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Joint Terrorism Task Forces. The OIG also found that USMS lacked adequate risk-based standards for determining the appropriate means for protecting judges during high-risk trials and for protecting threatened judges while they are not in court.", "In congressional testimony, Judge Jane R. Roth stated that funding and staffing issues at the USMS have decreased its ability to provide adequate protection for the federal judiciary. Judge Roth noted that on many occasions, the Judicial Conference had found that the USMS did not have adequate staff to protect the judiciary. Judge Roth testified that DOJ had not shared information about USMS staffing levels, but \"many United States Marshals report to us that their staffing levels have been significantly reduced.\" Judge Roth also questioned whether the law enforcement responsibilities (fugitive apprehension, asset forfeiture, and witness protection) had caused budgetary problems for the Marshals' judiciary security program because the USMS must serve both the executive and judicial branches. A report that reviewed the protection provided to the federal judiciary by the USMS found \"[t]he staffing level of the USMS for protection of the Judiciary has not grown commensurate with operational demands.\" Specifically, the USMS is having problems with providing an adequate number of Deputy U.S. Marshals (DUSMs) for judicial security duties.", "There is federal funding available for state courts; however, with respect to judicial security in state courts, state courts cannot directly apply for such funding.

Witness intimidation can reduce public confidence in the criminal justice system and it can create the perception that the criminal justice system cannot protect citizens. Witness intimidation can be the result of actual or perceived threats from an offender or his associates, but it can also be the result of more general community norms that discourage residents from cooperating with the police or prosecutors. Witnesses can be intimidated in many ways, including", "implicit threats, looks, or gestures, explicit threats of violence, actual physical violence, property damage, or other threats, such as challenges to child custody or immigration status.", "Threats are more common than actual physical violence, but they can be just as effective in deterring cooperation with police and prosecutors. Some witnesses might experience one incident of intimidation, but others might experience an escalating series of threats and actions that become more violent over time. Other witnesses might not experience intimidation directly, but they believe that they will receive retaliation if they cooperate with law enforcement.", "According to a Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) report, \"small-scale studies and surveys of police and prosecutors suggest that witness intimidation is pervasive and increasing.\" The report cites a study of witnesses appearing in criminal courts in Bronx County, New York, which shows that 36% of witnesses had been directly threatened, and of those that were not directly threatened, 57% feared reprisals. The report also states that prosecutors believe that witness intimidation plays a role in 75%-100% of violent crime committed in gang-controlled neighborhoods, but it might be less of a factor in neighborhoods not dominated by gangs and drugs. The report also notes that it is hard to quantify the prevalence of witness intimidation for several reasons. Some reasons include", "crime is under-reported for reasons not related to witness intimidation; in cases where a witness is successfully intimidated, neither the crime nor the intimidation is reported; victimization surveys and interviews with witnesses whose cases go to trial only capture information from a subset of witnesses; and there has been no empirical research on the scope or specific characteristics of community-wide intimidation.", "A report from the National Center for Victims of Crime presented data from surveys and interviews of youths in Massachusetts. The youth surveys and interviews focused on different topics related to gangs and violence, including experiences with gang-related crime and witness intimidation. Thirty-eight percent of survey respondents reported hearing about threats against schoolmates and 28% reported hearing about threats made against neighbors because they reported gang crime. Of the respondents who had reported a gang crime, 12% reported receiving a threat because they reported the crime. The most common way threats were made against schoolmates, neighbors, or the respondents themselves were face-to-face contacts, followed by receiving telephone calls. Respondents reported that half of the threats against schoolmates and neighbors they heard about involved beatings, though the researchers warn that this figure might be inflated because respondents were more likely to hear about threats that involved violence. Threats were also delivered though notes, online, and indirectly by stalking the person who reported the crime, vandalizing their property, or socially isolating them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislation in the 110th Congress", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to strengthen court security, the 109 th Congress responded with a number of measures that would have affected both the federal and state judicial systems.
