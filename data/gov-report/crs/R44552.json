New Zealand also has a history of fighting alongside the United States in major conflicts including World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. New Zealand is a regular contributor to international peace and stability operations and has contributed troops to fight Islamist militants in Afghanistan, where New Zealand had a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Bamiyan Province until 2013, and more recently in Iraq where it is training Iraqi military personnel.

New Zealand has traditionally had particularly close ties with the United Kingdom and Australia and is a member of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) of 1971 (discussed below). In recent years, New Zealand has sought to expand its traditionally close relationships by reaching out to develop closer ties with other countries, particularly through expanded trade, with China and other Asian states. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Australia", "paragraphs": ["New Zealand enjoys very close relations with Australia, its neighbor across the Tasman Sea. These trans-Tasman ties are based, to a large extent, on the two nations' common origin as British colonies. Their ties were strengthened as the two nations fought together in the Australian and New Zealand Army Corp (ANZAC) in places like Gallipoli in World War I. This relationship evolved into what is known as \"the ANZAC spirit\" of close defense cooperation. This ongoing defense cooperation has been demonstrated most recently through the Joint Australia-New Zealand Building Partner Capacity mission in Iraq. In a 2016 ANZAC Day message, then-Secretary of State John Kerry paid tribute to ANZAC bravery and noted that the United States has worked with Australia and New Zealand in support of Afghan security and stability. He also highlighted that the three nations are working together as part of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL and to ensure regional stability in the Asia Pacific. Economic ties between New Zealand and Australia are formalized in the Closer Economic Relations (CER) agreement, which prohibits trade tariffs between the two nations. Close economic, people-to-people, and cultural ties, including the shared popularity of rugby, cricket, and other sports, further reinforce bilateral relations between these two states. Over 647,000 New Zealanders, out of a total population of 4.5 million, live in Australia.

New Zealand in 2008 was the first organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country to sign a Free Trade Agreement with China. New Zealand dairy exports to China grew from NZ$0.5 billion in 2008 to NZ$4.6 billion in 2013. Overall, New Zealand exports to China grew from less than 3% of all exports in 2000 to approximately 20% of exports in 2014.

Chinese military power will continue to increase in relative and absolute terms.\" While the Defence Assessment noted a rising risk of major interstate conflict, and an increase in defense spending in the Asia Pacific region of 23% from 2010 to 2014, it remained cautiously optimistic that major conflict could be averted due to economic incentives produced by an integrated global economy.

The decline of trade with the United Kingdom led New Zealand to search for new foreign markets. New Zealand's proactive and successful policy of export diversification has expanded New Zealand's markets to include China, Australia, the European Union, the United States, and Japan.
