When Secretary Salazar increased the OCS new lease rate to 18.75%, he contended that there was no longer a need to keep the deepwater royalty rate at the minimum level because the royalty relief act had helped spur the technical change and innovations necessary for deep water drilling to be commercially viable.

The leasing and permitting processes are dramatically different on private versus federal lands. One controversial issue has been the permitting process, considered by some to be too lengthy and cumbersome, particularly when compared to permitting for oil and gas exploration on private lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT-05, P.L. 109-58 ) enacted several provisions that were aimed at expediting the development of oil and gas on public lands, particularly with respect to the approval of applications for permits to drill (APDs).

A small amount of GOMESA revenues have been allocated while the vast majority is set to be disbursed beginning in 2017.

These costs may be incurred indirectly from events (e.g., a hurricane or flood) that require maintenance to ensure continual offshore activity. Infrastructure costs include roads, water and waste facilities, pipelines, storage facilities, disposal facilities, public safety, and education. Protection and conservation of coastal states' ecosystems include barrier islands, marshes, etc., to protect near-shore facilities.

They may compensate some states with employment opportunities (direct and indirect jobs) that become available in the oil and gas industry. These businesses and employees in related fields pay taxes, make investments, and support local economies. This, however, may be insufficient to cover the full impact of the industry, states contend.

Successful bidders make an up-front cash payment, called a bonus bid, to secure the lease. A minimum acceptable bonus bid is determined by BOEM (based on their economic analysis of fair market value) for each tract offered. In contrast to onshore oil and gas leasing, if no bids match or exceed the minimum, the lease is withheld, to be offered again at a later sale.

Chapter 2). The minerals can then be extracted from sites with valid claims.
