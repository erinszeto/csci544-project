Previously, water and species management issues have exacerbated competition and generated conflict among several interests\u2014farmers; Indian tribes; commercial and sport fishermen; federal water project and wildlife refuge managers; environmental groups; hydropower facility operators; and state, local, and tribal governments. Drought conditions and a call for water by senior water rights holders in 2013 have again brought these issues to the forefront.", "In 2010, the Secretary of the Interior and the governors of Oregon and California, along with multiple interest groups, announced the results of a multiyear negotiation process to resolve long-standing issues in the basin: two interrelated agreements, supported by the federal government and signed by the two states and numerous other parties. These agreements, known as the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA), together aim to provide for water deliveries to irrigators and wildlife refuges, fish habitat restoration, and numerous other related actions. Generally, the KBRA provides for actions intended to restore Klamath fisheries and for assurances for water deliveries to wildlife refuges and federal project irrigators under certain circumstances, among other things. The KHSA lays out a process that could lead to the removal of four privately owned dams on the Klamath River. This dam removal would be one of the largest and most complex projects of its kind ever undertaken.", "Some parts of the Klamath agreements are being carried out under existing authorities. Studies to inform a determination on dam removal under the KHSA by the Secretary of the Interior are complete, and some restoration actions have been initiated. However, congressional authorization is required for the most significant components of the agreements to be implemented.", "The KBRA and KHSA did not address all outstanding issues in the basin. A water rights adjudication by the state of Oregon (in progress since the 1970s) is ongoing. In 2013, the adjudication reaffirmed \"time immemorial\" tribal water rights in the upper part of the Klamath Basin, confirming that tribal water rights are senior to those of other water rights holders. This resulted in a \"call\" on water rights (i.e., notice by senior water rights holders that their demands exceed available flows), and led to reductions to water supplies for some junior users during the low water year of 2013. To resolve these issues and prevent such a scenario from occurring again, a separate settlement agreement (the Upper Klamath Basin Settlement Agreement) was negotiated by stakeholders and finalized in April 2014. To be implemented, the agreement would need to be authorized along with the KBRA and KHSA.", "The KBRA and KHSA were originally set to expire in 2012 if no authorizing legislation was enacted, but they have since been extended (most recently through 2015). Parties may also withdraw individually from the agreements, and several parties initiated this process of withdrawal.", "In the 114th Congress, S. 133 would authorize the Klamath agreements, including a suite of new federal actions that have received support from disparate parties and are required for the agreements to be implemented.

Subsequent problems with Klamath Basin fisheries, in particular events in 2002 and 2006 (see \" Previous Events ,\" below), and conflict over the relicensing of the Klamath Hydropower Project, exacerbated these conflicts. Low water conditions and a call for water by senior water rights holders in 2013 have again brought these issues to the forefront.", "Congress has oversight authority over federal activities in the Klamath Basin related to operation of the Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation's) Klamath Project; management of federal lands (including six national wildlife refuges, managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service); and implementation of Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205 ) and other federal laws. Previously, Congress has held hearings and appropriated funding to address issues in the Klamath Basin. Past congressional debate has generally focused on the ESA's role in water management, the operation of the Klamath Project, and other topics, such as supplemental support for parties impacted by federal policies. ", "The Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement (KHSA), collectively referred to as the Klamath a greements in this report, were signed in 2010 by a wide array of basin interests (although not all basin interests support the agreements). They aim to address many of the ongoing conflicts in the Klamath Basin. The KBRA would, among other things, set limits for water allocations for irrigators and wildlife refuges under a range of conditions related to the amount of water forecast in a given year; attempt to make available supplemental water and power supplies in the basin; and provide for restoration and monitoring of certain fish species. It also includes other assurances to settle ongoing water conflicts between basin tribes and other entities, although it would not settle all ongoing conflicts in the basin. The KHSA lays out a process that could lead to removal of four nonfederal hydroelectric dams currently owned and operated by a private entity, PacifiCorp. If carried out as envisioned, the project would be one of the largest, most complex dam removals in history. Under the KHSA, the Secretary of the Interior led a study process to determine whether removal of these dams is in the public interest. Most of this study process has been completed, but the final step\u2014a determination by the Secretary\u2014would require congressional authorization. ", "Although the Klamath agreements require congressional authorization to move forward on key components, some activities under existing authorities have already been undertaken. Consideration of the agreements could result in Congress revisiting previous issues in the Klamath Basin, as well as considering new ones.

It assumes some familiarity with the basin on the part of the reader."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Klamath River Basin is a largely sparsely populated area on the Oregon and California border with limited water resources (see Figure 1 ). Irrigated agriculture in the upper basin relies in large part on water provided by the Bureau of Reclamation's Klamath Project. Other farmers and ranchers (known as off-project irrigators) also rely on basin water supplies for irrigation. The area is home to six national wildlife refuges that rely on the same water supplies to sustain migratory bird populations and several Native American tribes that were historically dependent on lower and upper basin fish species. Two species of upper basin fish are currently listed as endangered under the ESA (the Lost River and shortnose sucker), and one species of lower basin fish is listed as threatened under the ESA (coho salmon, an anadromous fish).", "The basin also includes seven dams on the Klamath River and its tributaries, built between 1918 and 1962. Six of these dams are owned by PacifiCorp, a private company, and are known collectively as the Klamath Hydroelectric Project (KHP). Historically, all but one of the dams produced hydroelectric power for the basin, including low-cost power for Klamath Project irrigators. The original Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license to operate the KHP expired in 2006, and PacifiCorp applied for relicensing of the project in 2004. To date, a new long-term license has not been granted because of the lack of state certification under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (P.L. 92-500), as well as ongoing uncertainty related to fish passage upgrades and the status of the Klamath agreements, discussed below. In the absence of a new FERC license, the project continues to operate under a temporary annual license with the same conditions of the expired FERC license.

These events resulted in press coverage, legal conflicts, and studies that framed the negotiations and agreements currently at issue. More recently, in the summer of 2013, a call on water rights under the newly released Oregon water rights adjudication resulted in limitations on water deliveries for junior water rights holders in the upper part of the basin.", "Several events have put the Klamath region in the national spotlight. In 2001, as a result of previous biological opinions by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the Bureau of Reclamation severely curtailed water deliveries to the Klamath Project to provide more water for endangered fish in the basin and to prevent their extinction. These allocations were met with protests by area irrigators, who threatened to open irrigation head gates by force. Later, in 2002, irrigators received more water than had been allocated in 2001, but thousands of fish (mainly Chinook salmon) died on the lower part of the Klamath River, largely due to poor water conditions and fish health in that part of the basin. In 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration severely restricted ocean fishing for salmon in the region due to low numbers of naturally spawning adults (due in part to residual effects of the aforementioned 2002 event). This restriction resulted in a large decrease in that year's commercial and recreational salmon catch compared to previous years. ", "The federal government provided emergency funding in response to these and other events in the Klamath Basin. The funding included at least $170 million in addition to regular programmatic expenditures over the last decade. For instance, for the 2001 and 2006 events, the federal government provided approximately $35 million and $60 million in emergency aid, respectively. Aid in addition to regular agency programs and appropriations was also provided in other years. Between 2002 and 2007, Reclamation spent $14 million on a pilot water bank to alleviate water shortages. Due to drought events in 2010, an additional $10 million in supplemental appropriations was provided to the Klamath Basin in that year and $2 million was provided for a Klamath Drought Initiative by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The 2002 farm bill provided $50 million to the Klamath Basin, and USDA funding was also provided under other general authorities and programs authorized in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills. ", "In addition to these events, an Oregon state water rights adjudication in the basin that was first initiated in the 1970s received added attention in 2013 (See box above, \"Klamath Water Rights Adjudication\"). At the conclusion of the adjudication's administrative phase, the state of Oregon upheld a number of previous water rights claims including, among other things, that the Klamath Tribes have water rights with a date of \"time immemorial.\" These water rights are now protected under Oregon law and were exercised over junior water rights holders in the basin for the first time in the summer of 2013. The 2013 \"call\" on water rights (in which senior water rights holders gave notice that their demands exceeded available flows) limited or shut off water deliveries to some junior water rights holders (for the most part, off-project irrigators) in the upper basin.

Participants in negotiations included state governments, tribes, counties, irrigators, fishermen, conservation groups, and hydropower facility owners and users. The goal of the negotiations was a long-term solution to the multiple water and endangered species issues in the Klamath Basin, including the aforementioned issues associated with irrigation deliveries and flows for fish, as well as potential issues associated with pending water rights adjudications and relicensing of the basin's hydroelectric dams. The two agreements that resulted from the negotiations, the KBRA and the KHSA, are officially linked in that signatories see them as complementary and do not support authorization of one agreement without the other. Originally, both agreements were set to expire without congressional authorization by 2012, but this deadline has been extended to 2014. In response to concerns and outstanding issues in the upper basin, in 2013 a task force was convened to incorporate additional issues not addressed by the KBRA and KHSA.

It was agreed to by more than 40 signatories, or parties, although not all interests in the basin support it. Broadly speaking, under certain conditions, parties to the KBRA promise to support diversions for Klamath Project irrigators and federal wildlife refuges that correlate to a given year's forecast inflows into Upper Klamath Lake. Water that is surplus to these inflows and not subject to other valid water rights (e.g., off-project diversions) would be allocated to other uses, including instream flows (see Table 1 for an abbreviated summary of this arrangement). In exchange for this support, environmental interests would gain additional federal and state funding for fisheries restoration, some of the aforementioned surplus water supplies, and related assurances for dam removal under the KHSA (which is expected to restore fisheries). Parties have also agreed that the ESA will not be amended under the agreement. For their part, three of the four largest tribes in the basin agreed to support the project and refuge diversions and not make a call on certain water rights in exchange for the aforementioned restoration actions, federal actions to restore fisheries, and economic aid. ", "The exact projections of the effects of the KBRA allocations on various water users are subject to debate. However, compared to recent water years, the allocations are generally expected to result in less water for Klamath Project irrigators in wet years but more certainty\u2014and potentially greater allocations than may have been the case otherwise\u2014in dry years. Under the agreement, area irrigators are also promised funding to develop low-cost power to replace hydropower previously provided by the PacifiCorp dams, as well as funding to potentially make available more water supplies through means yet to be determined. Irrigators who did not initially agree to the KBRA, including some off-project irrigators in the upper basin, were not subject to the KBRA's assurances as they relate to tribal water rights. However, these irrigators have subsequently come to an agreement with the Klamath tribes that may prevent future curtailment of deliveries in exchange for promised retirement of some water rights and support for the KBRA and KHSA.", "The federal government is not party to the KBRA until Congress enacts authorizing legislation. Some of the actions envisioned by the KBRA have been interpreted as not being authorized and would require significant federal appropriations to go forward. Initial estimates stated that total federal costs to implement the Klamath agreements would be $798.5 million or $536 million over 15 years (depending on the assumptions used).

Under the agreement, the facilities' removal would be paid for by ratepayers in California and Oregon ($200 million) and an assumed California Water Bond ($250 million). The entity responsible for removal (known as the Dam Removal Entity, or DRE) has yet to be defined.

The Department of the Interior (DOI) and most parties agree that congressional authorization is necessary to make a final Secretarial Determination on dam removal and to move forward with that project.

The federal role has been contentious in the past and is a central question related to congressional consideration of the Klamath agreements. Both agreements assume numerous actions by the federal government, and, as noted earlier, a subset of these actions cannot go forward absent new congressional authorization. In particular, the agreements envision an expanded federal role in the Klamath Basin in regard to the dam removal process (i.e., a determination on dam removal), provision of payments for water rights retirement, and pursuit of low-cost power for irrigators, among other things. These actions are not currently authorized in the basin and have been proposed to alleviate ongoing conflicts. Without authorization of these provisions, some supporters of the KBRA and KHSA may withdraw their support for the agreements.

These groups note that federal involvement, including operation of the Klamath Project, implementation of ESA, and management of fisheries and federal lands, is central to conflicts in the basin. They argue that the agreements represent a consensus achieved by a majority of basin interests that are traditionally opposed to one another and are the best opportunity to solve the region's problems going forward. They also argue that many of the expenses for these agreements are likely to be offset in the form of reduced future federal expenditures for litigation and emergency financial support. Supporters also note that the agreements will be a valuable source of jobs within the basin. ", "Opponents of one or both of the agreements cite a number of reasons for their opposition. Some note that the federal government has no clear obligation to authorize and implement the agreements, and they contend that federal involvement in this case amounts to overreach that will harm the local economy. These opponents have argued that the activities represented in both agreements, such as dam removal and water quality improvements, could potentially occur through preexisting processes and authorities. Some also generally oppose the removal of operational dams and associated hydropower facilities, including those in the Klamath Basin, on principle because of the dams' status as an energy source. Finally, some argue against federal authorization of the Klamath agreements because they believe that specific components of the agreements will undermine existing federal laws (e.g., the ESA) or federal responsibilities (e.g., tribal trust responsibilities) or that they will fail to achieve their stated goals (e.g., fisheries restoration)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost of Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Some Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the cost to the federal government to implement the agreements. Most have assumed that the majority of actions in the KBRA would be federally funded, including the costs for the on-project plan, fisheries restoration, and tribal components of the agreement. A detailed discussion of the estimated costs for the agreements (in particular those for the KBRA) and how they have changed over time is provided below.", "There have been multiple estimates of the cost to implement the Klamath agreements, and in some cases these have contradicted one another or employed differing assumptions. The original 2010 KBRA estimated $970 million (in 2007 dollars) for the total cost to implement the KBRA over a 10-year window. Most of these costs were assumed to be incurred by the federal government, although the exact split was not specified. In 2011, this figure was revised to estimate the federal government's portion of expenses over a newly extended 15-year window. This estimate indicated that the federal cost to implement the agreement over 15 years would be $795 million (2007 dollars). Thus, there was a reduction in the estimated costs using constant 2007 dollars. The 2011 revision reflected increased state commitments for some activities and altered assumptions in other areas. The 2011 estimate also included an estimate of \"base\" funding already being spent in the basin that could potentially reduce the \"new\" costs of the agreements to the federal government, but it did not estimate the amount of budget authority required for previously unauthorized activities. The first two estimates were most recently revised in a December 2013 report by the Klamath Basin Task Force, which estimated that $923 million (in 2014 dollars) in federal funds would be required to implement the agreements and that $250 million of this funding would come from newly authorized appropriations. The 2013 report also provided a retroactive estimate for the new authorizations of appropriations under the 2011 document. Table 2 , below, provides a comparison of these costs, including estimates in constant dollars.", "In contrast to the KBRA, cost estimates to implement the KHSA have not changed substantially since the original agreement. They also have not garnered as much attention from Congress because states are the primary entities responsible for funding dam removal under the KHSA. Previous studies by DOI to inform the Secretarial Determination estimated potential costs of approximately $290 million for dam removal, which is less than the combined amount anticipated to be available from ratepayers ($200 million) and the state of California ($250 million). One potential issue related to these costs is whether the dam removal determination will recommend the federal government as the dam removal entity. If so, a major question may be how additional costs for dam removal, such as cost overruns and costs resulting from potential lawsuits, would be handled.", "There is no formal estimate of potential future savings to state and federal governments associated with the agreements. Supporters point to previous costs to federal and state governments that would be unlikely to occur if the agreements are implemented, including at least $170 million in supplemental aid for irrigators and fisheries that has been provided since 2001. Advocates also point to decreased costs for litigation as a result of agreements. Although the agreements would not prevent future litigation, supporters argue that, if authorized, they would obligate parties to pursue other dispute resolution mechanisms that are expected to be less costly and would thus render future litigation costs less likely. Opponents note that none of these savings are guaranteed under the agreements and that supplemental appropriations and expenditures for litigation may still be necessary.", "In addition to savings, supporters also argue that the KBRA and KHSA could create economic benefits, both in terms of traditional and \"non-use\" benefits. Studies commissioned to advise DOI's secretarial determination on dam removal estimated that the total potential value of restoration, including non-use values, could total $16 billion-$84 billion, depending on the assumptions and methodology used. Some dispute these estimates and argue that they are unrealistically large or derived from questionable methodologies.", "Obtaining authorization and appropriations for these activities from Congress may be difficult. In the 113 th and 114 th Congresses, authorization of new programs and projects by both chambers has been limited. Beyond authorization of new funds, some observers also note that it is unlikely that federal agencies will obtain the new appropriations envisioned for the KBRA in a constrained budgetary environment. Hypothetically, a lack of discretionary appropriations or overall progress associated with future actions assumed in the KBRA or KHSA could affect the status of support for either agreement among the parties and thus cause additional conflicts among the agreement's supporters. Supporters have for the most part acknowledged these difficulties, but they argue that initial authorization of the agreements is an important first step and that the basin's issues are important enough to warrant congressional authorization and funding.

Since authority for the Secretary of the Interior to make a final determination on dam removal is a key step in the KHSA, some argue that authorization of the agreements is the primary opportunity for Congress to weigh in for or against this decision. Although it did not formally recommend dam removal, the study findings intended to inform the Secretary's dam removal determination did not find major drawbacks associated with this course of action. Thus, some have concluded that if Congress authorizes the dam removal determination to go forward, a finding that dam removal would be in the public interest is likely. While many in Congress support dam removal as a means to restore rivers, others see it as an unnecessary and expensive step that decreases the availability of renewable energy.

Improvements under the KBRA, including new fish habitat and improved water quality, are assumed to result in greater fish abundance, which would in turn allow managers to forgo the previous restrictive flows that were provided under the ESA.

Government representatives also have pointed to the costs that resulted from previous conflicts in the basin, including supplemental aid, crop insurance, mitigation actions, and litigation costs.", "Other groups have chosen to support the agreements not only for their potential to end conflicts in the basin but also because they include specific provisions that are important to certain groups. For instance, environmental groups have pledged to support the allocations for irrigation absent a similar allocation for fish in exchange for assurances of dam removal under the KHSA and other promised fisheries restoration actions under the KBRA. Among irrigators, those on the Klamath Project have pledged to support restoration provisions and less water in wet years in exchange for benefits from water supplies in dry years that presumably would be higher than under the status quo. Approximately half of the off-project irrigators in the upper basin support the agreements, in some cases because the agreements offer potential alternatives that are preferable to losing water deliveries outright due to their junior water rights status. ", "For its part, PacifiCorp notes that it supports removal of its four dams under the KHSA because retirement of the dams under the terms of the KHSA reportedly represents a more cost-effective option for its ratepayers than FERC relicensing. Previously there have been disagreements over which option the company would pursue in absence of the KHSA: FERC relicensing for ongoing operations on all four dams (which would entail costly improvements for fish passage, and altered operations for water quality) or a surrender of its license and related decommissioning of some or all of the Klamath hydropower projects. Both options would likely be costly for PacifiCorp and its ratepayers, and could potentially cost the company more than the arrangement under the KHSA. The KHSA also has the added benefit of allowing the company to operate the dams under the current management regime through 2019, through annual extensions to the project's FERC license.

Some of these parties were initially involved in settlement negotiations but dropped out for various reasons, while others were not invited to participate in negotiations because they were not seen as representing significant interests. Still others, including county officials in the areas of the Reclamation project and dams, oppose the agreements in their elected capacities. Notable opponents of the Klamath agreements include local officials in Klamath County in Oregon and Siskiyou County in California, the Hoopa Valley and Resighini Rancheria and Quartz Valley tribes, the Northcoast Environmental Center, Waterwatch of Oregon, Oregon Wild, and others. As noted above, some groups that initially opposed the agreements, including approximately half of the off-project irrigators in the upper basin, recently reached an agreement, the Upper Basin Agreement, the effectiveness of which is tied to the authorization of the KBRA and KHSA. Other opponents, including Klamath and Siskiyou County, have since stated their opposition to that agreement for its ties to the KBRA and KHSA (which they also oppose).", "Some groups oppose the agreements because they believe the agreements will further damage the region's economy. Some off-project users continue to oppose the agreements (including the Upper Basin Settlement) because of economic damages to farmers resulting from water rights retirement and restoration requirements. Siskiyou County has opposed the agreements for a number of reasons, including the assertion that the PacifiCorp dams provide flood protection and economic benefits for downstream areas. Some residents and officials in these areas also oppose dam removal because of an expected loss of property taxes associated with certain lands that will lose lake frontage when the dams are removed. ", "Others argue that the agreements do too little to benefit fisheries and give up too much to farmers and other interests. For instance, the Hoopa Valley Tribe has been critical of the agreements because it feels that the provisions of the KBRA have the potential to terminate the duty of the United States to assert and protect tribal fishery rights when they conflict with operation of the Klamath Reclamation Project. The tribe argues that the KBRA would subordinate its senior priority water rights to the junior water rights of the irrigation project. ", "Some opponents have also focused on the uncertain nature of fisheries restoration in the Klamath under the KBRA. Some contend that these uncertainties were highlighted in expert panels as a part of the larger DOI dam removal study process but were not adequately acknowledged by DOI in its final studies. Some of these groups favor dam removal but argue that removal could be achieved through the existing FERC relicensing processes and does not need to be tied to the KBRA. They note that by providing annual renewals of the FERC license for the Klamath Hydroelectric Project, the KHSA allows the company to avoid project upgrades (or removal) that would otherwise be paid for by the company and benefit fisheries in the short term. Combined with a lack of performance metrics for fisheries restoration provisions and promises to not make a call on project water rights holders under the KBRA, these opponents assert that the agreements disproportionately benefit PacifiCorp and irrigators at the expense of fisheries. ", "Some environmental groups oppose other provisions of the Klamath agreements and dropped out of negotiations as a result. Waterwatch of Oregon and Oregon Wild find fault with a number of the provisions in the agreements, including the lack of water supplies for fish and the inclusion of lease-land farming on wildlife refuges. Along with the Hoopa Valley Tribe, these groups have called for voiding the KHSA and resuming water quality certification processes under the Clean Water Act to force dam upgrades or removal through a separate process, which they argue will be more expedient and less costly for state and federal taxpayers (i.e., a process to be funded by PacifiCorp and potentially its ratepayers).", "The Yurok Tribe, which initially supported the Klamath agreements, issued a notice of withdrawal from the agreements in September 2015. Among other things, the tribe cited inaction by Congress and disagreements with the provisions of the Upper Klamath Settlement Agreement, in which it was not invited to participate.
