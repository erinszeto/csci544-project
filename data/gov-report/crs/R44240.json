These limits are known as CHIMPS, \"changes in mandatory program spending.\" CHIMPS usually are reductions to mandatory spending authority, but they also may be increases in spending authority. Although many CHIMPS have an effect for one year, rescissions may be made to mandatory spending programs to permanently cancel budget authority (also considered a CHIMP here and by CBO).

However, their action has a similar effect through CHIMPS, but usually only for the one year to which the appropriation applies.

Budget sequestration of mandatory accounts has occurred every year since FY2013, reducing the amount available to most mandatory programs. For example, the CHIMP to accomplish the complete prohibition on spending for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program resulted in a smaller $153 million CHIMP in FY2014, after sequestration, than the $165 million CHIMP in FY2013, even though no spending was allowed either year ( Table 15 ). In FY2016, the scoring of the Administration's request and the Senate bill are before sequestration, while scoring of the CHIMP in the House bill is after sequestration.

Budget Sequestration", "Sequestration is a process of automatic, largely across-the-board reductions that permanently cancel mandatory and/or discretionary budget authority when spending would exceed statutory budget goals. The current requirement for sequestration is in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). Table B-1 shows the rates of sequestration and the amounts of budget authority cancelled from accounts in the Agriculture appropriations bill.", "Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ) raised spending limits in the BCA to avoid sequestration of discretionary accounts in FY2014 and FY2015\u2014and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ( P.L. 114-74 ) did it again for FY2016 and FY2017\u2014they do not prevent or reduce sequestration on mandatory accounts.", "In fact, to pay for avoiding sequestration of discretionary spending in the near term, or as a general budgetary offset for other bills, Congress extended the original FY2021 duration of sequestration on mandatory programs three times. First, it extended the duration of mandatory sequestration by two years (until FY2023) as an offset in the 2013 budget act. Second, by another year (until FY2024) to maintain retirement benefits for certain military personnel ( P.L. 113-82 ). And third, another year (until FY205) as an offset in the 2015 budget act.", "The first farm commodity program payments from the 2014 farm bill were due in October 2015, and USDA indicated that they would be subject to the 6.8% reduction applicable to FY2016.", "Some farm bill mandatory programs are exempt from sequestration. The nutrition programs and the Conservation Reserve Program are statutorily exempt, and some prior legal obligations in crop insurance and the farm commodity programs may be exempt as determined by OMB. Generally speaking, the experience since FY2013 is that OMB has ruled most of crop insurance as exempt from sequestration, while the farm commodity programs have been subject to it.", "Since enactment of the BCA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has ordered budget sequestration on non-exempt, non-defense discretionary accounts only once, in FY2013 ( Table B-1 ), and on mandatory accounts annually in FY2013-FY2016 ( Table B-2 )."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
