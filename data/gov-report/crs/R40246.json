Federal homeland security assistance, for the purpose of this report, is defined as U.S. Department of Homeland Security programs that provide funding, training, or technical assistance to states, localities, tribes, and other entities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from man-made and natural disasters. Since the nation is still threatened by terrorist attacks and natural disasters, the 111th Congress may wish to consider questions and challenges about whether, or how, federal homeland security assistance policy should be revisited. Policy solutions could affect, and be constrained by, existing law and regulations, and constitutional considerations.", "Since FY2002, Congress has appropriated over $34 billion for homeland security assistance to states, specified urban areas and critical infrastructures (such as ports and rail systems), the District of Columbia, and U.S. insular areas. Originally, in FY2002, there were eight programs; in FY2010 there are 15 programs. This expansion and scope of homeland security assistance programs are the result of congressional and executive branch actions.", "The Grant Programs Directorate, within the Federal Emergency Management Agency, administers these programs for the Department of Homeland Security. Each assistance program has either an all-hazards purpose or a terrorism preparedness purpose. However, in FY2010, 60% of funding has been appropriated for terrorism preparedness programs, a decision that has been criticized by some grant recipients, Members of Congress, and others.", "Congress appropriated $757 million less for state and local programs than was appropriated in FY2009; however, some programs received increased funding in FY2010, such as the Urban Area Security Initiative. This reduction is primarily the result of Congress not funding the Commercial Equipment Direct Assistance Program, and the Trucking Security Grant program. According to news reports, a Department of Homeland Security official announced that the overall FY2011 budget request for the department will decline from previous years' levels, and in the FY2011 budget request, the Administration requested approximately $4 billion. The impact of a reduction on grants assistance may be an issue.", "This report summarizes these programs, and identifies and analyzes potential issues for the 111th Congress. These issues include (1) the purpose and number of assistance programs; (2) the evaluation of the use of grant funding; (3) the determination of eligible grant recipients; (4) the programs' funding amounts; and (5) the programs' funding distribution methodologies.

Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress further increased its attention on homeland security assistance programs by, among other things, establishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This report focuses on the department's homeland security assistance programs, but not the department as a whole.", "The number and purpose of programs, their administration, and funding have evolved over the past 12 years. These assistance programs are intended to enhance and maintain state, local, and non-federal government entities' homeland security and emergency management capabilities. Since FY2003, DHS has administered these assistance programs through four different offices or agencies within the department due to both congressional and departmental actions.", "With the increase of terrorist threats and attacks against the United States following the end of the Cold War and the termination of old civil defense programs, a number of policy questions have arisen regarding homeland security assistance programs. The majority of these questions have not been completely addressed, even though Congress has debated and enacted legislation that provides homeland security assistance to states and localities since 1997. Some officials such as Members of Congress, former President Bush's administration personnel, and President Barack Obama have questioned (1) the purpose and number of assistance programs; (2) the use of preparedness funding; (3) the determination of eligibility; (4) the funding amounts for the assistance programs; (5) the programs' funding distribution methodology, and (6) the use of grant funding for sustainment and maintenance costs associated with previous fiscal year homeland security projects. ", "These policy questions may continue to be important during the second session of the 111 th Congress as Members continues to appropriate funding and conduct oversight of these assistance programs. Specifically, the House Homeland Security Committee stated that oversight of DHS grants is one of its priorities for 111 th Congress. Discussion of these potential issues may enable Congress and the federal government to anticipate possible homeland security crises and establish policies that are not strictly reactionary.

Murrah federal building in 1995. This assistance was separate from any federal disaster assistance these cities may have received due to these terrorist attacks. Federal homeland security assistance evolved and expanded after the terrorist attacks on September 11 th , 2001, and the establishment of DHS in 2002 with P.L. 107-296 , \"Homeland Security Act of 2002.\" A brief discussion on this evolution and expansion follows.", "In 1996, Congress enacted The Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act (also known as the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Act). This law, among other things, established the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Program (NLD) that provided financial assistance to over 150 major U.S. cities. This assistance, with the Oklahoma City bombing being the primary catalyst, was focused on helping first responders prepare for, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. Two years later, the Department of Justice (DOJ) established the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP) to administer assistance programs that enhanced state and local emergency response capabilities, including terrorist attack response. At first, NLD provided assistance to 120 cities; it was later expanded to include 157 cities and counties. At the end of 1998, 40 of the original 120 cities had received funding and training. In addition to training, approximately $300,000 was provided by DOD to each city for personal protection, decontamination, and detection equipment. Following the transfer of NLD to DOJ, all cities completed the training initiated by DOD, and DOJ based the training and exercises on state assessments. The program ended in 2001 upon completion of the training. ", "ODP was transferred to DHS with enactment of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Initially, ODP and its terrorism preparedness programs were administered by the Border and Transportation Security Directorate, and all-hazard preparedness programs were in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ODP and all assistance programs were transferred to the Office of the Secretary in 2004 due to state and local criticism of DHS not having a \"one-stop-shop\" for grant programs assistance. After investigations into the problematic response to Hurricane Katrina, the programs were transferred to the National Preparedness Directorate. Currently all programs and activities are administered by the Grants Program Directorate (GPD), within FEMA. GPD is now the primary DHS and FEMA entity responsible for managing the majority of DHS assistance to states and localities. ", "Since the establishment of DHS, the department has not only been responsible for preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks, it is also the lead agency for preparing for, responding to, and recovering from any accidental man-made or natural disasters. The most recent legislative action affecting DHS grants was P.L. 110-53 , Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 , which authorized a number of the DHS grants and mandated some of their allocation methodologies.

EMPG is an example of an all-hazards assistance program. The National Governors Association (NGA), in a policy position paper, states that an all-hazards approach to preparedness should be preserved. Terrorism preparedness focused programs allows recipients to obligate and fund activities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from terrorist incidents. SHSGP is an example of a terrorism preparedness focused program.", "The majority of disasters and emergencies that have occurred since September 11, 2001, have been natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Gustav. However, the majority of homeland security assistance funding to states and localities has been appropriated to programs dedicated to preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks. A DHS fact sheet regarding Homeland Security Presidential Directive 8 states that federal preparedness assistance is intended primarily to support State and local efforts to build capacity to address major (or catastrophic) events, especially terrorism.", "In FY2010, Congress appropriated approximately $4.16 billion for state and local programs, and of this amount $2.55 billion (60%) is targeted for terrorism focused programs. Following Hurricane Katrina, a congressional committee reported that some state officials \"voiced a concern that in the post-9/11 environment undue emphasis is placed on terrorism-based hazards.\" However, DHS (FEMA specifically) does provide natural disaster assistance that is separate from the programs summarized in this report, such as FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program, and the acquisition of flooded property.", "In July 2005, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that emergency response capabilities for terrorism, and man-made and natural disasters, are similar for response and recovery activities, but differ for preparedness. The similarity is associated with first responder actions following a disaster that are focused on immediately saving lives and mitigating the effects of the disaster. Preparing for a hurricane, or any natural disaster, by comparison is markedly different than preparing for a terrorist attack. Preparing for or preventing a terrorist attack includes such activities as installing security barriers and conducting counter-intelligence, whereas preparing for a natural disaster involves a different set of functions such as planning for evacuations or stockpiling equipment, food, and water. ", "GAO stated that legislation and presidential directives related to emergencies and disasters following the September 2001, terrorist attacks emphasize terrorism preparedness. In the FY2009 homeland security assistance guidance to states and localities, DHS listed terrorism preparedness as the priority in distributing funding. DHS used terrorism risk as the primary factor in its FY2009 state and local assessments and listed terrorism preparedness as one of the programs' \"core missions.\"", "Another aspect of this issue that the 111 th Congress may wish to address is the number of state and local assistance programs DHS administers. In FY2002, and prior to the establishment of DHS, federal assistance programs for states and localities numbered eight. In FY2010 the programs numbered 15. Total funding for all homeland security assistance programs has averaged $3.8 billion each year for the past seven years. The funding was lowest in FY2002 when Congress appropriated $1.43 billion for eight programs. The largest funding amount was in FY2009 when 17 programs shared $4.92 billion. For the present fiscal year (FY2010), Congress appropriated $4.16 billion for 15 assistance programs (see Table 2 for funding by year per program). This increase in the number of grant programs from FY2002 might be the result of Congress and the administration targeting funds in anticipation of future homeland security threats to specific facilities, locations, entities, and jurisdictions.", "In September 2003, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that DHS's grant system was fragmented, and therefore complicated coordination and integration of services and planning at state and local levels. This fragmentation may be seen in the development of targeted infrastructure security grant programs, such as bus and trucking security programs in FY2004; a grouping of transit security programs in FY2005; the Buffer Zone Protection in FY2006; and the Public Safety Interoperable Communications Grant Program in FY2008. One can assume this expansion of terrorism preparedness programs reflects the federal government's terrorism preparedness priority, whereas states and localities may place a priority on natural and accidental man-made disasters. Additionally, the DHS Inspector General, in a 2010 report, determined that FEMA grants to states and localities are redundant and inefficiently coordinated.", "This expansion of programs, largely at the discretion of the administration, may be the result of DHS intending to focus homeland security efforts and funding on specific national homeland security needs. However, the majority of programs that have been added are terrorism preparedness programs and, as noted earlier in this report, states and localities have criticized DHS's terrorism preparedness focus. It should also be noted that DHS and the administration did not request the development of all these new grant programs, such as the bus security program. Congress appropriated funding, for the first time, in FY2005 for the bus security program even though the Administration had not requested an appropriation for this program. Additionally, Administration officials have requested the consolidation of grant programs, such as in FY2007 when the Administration requested an appropriation for a Targeted Infrastructure Protection Program (TIPP). TIPP was to be a consolidation of six infrastructure security grant programs; however, Congress did not appropriate the infrastructure security programs through TIPP.", "Congress might wish to continue providing a share of funding to the present number of terrorism preparedness programs. Specific and targeted programs, such as the Buffer Zone Protection Program, could provide a funding source for a specific homeland security need. However, this would not address the criticism of some state and local officials who believe more funding should be provided for all-hazard emergencies and disasters, that the programs are fragmented, and federal, state, and local disaster response is uncoordinated.", "Congress might also consider increasing funding to all-hazards programs, such as the Emergency Management Performance Grant program and the Metropolitan Medical Response System. This could be achieved by increasing overall funding to state and local programs or decreasing the funding for terrorism preparedness programs. This option would address state and local criticism; however, if terrorism preparedness program funding were decreased states and localities may not be able to meet their terrorism preparedness needs.", "Should Congress determine there is a need to address the types and number of grants DHS provides to states and localities, it could consider allowing terrorism preparedness programs such as the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative, to be used for all-hazards preparedness, response, and recovery. Presently, these programs require states and localities to focus their funding on terrorism preparedness. This use of terrorism preparedness programs to address all-hazards might result in states and localities having more flexibility in prioritizing their homeland security needs, whether they are targeted to natural disasters or terrorism needs. ", "Finally, Congress may wish to establish one or more block grant programs to reduce the number of programs administered by GPD. This option might include the development of both an all-hazards and a terrorism preparedness block grant program. This option could encourage grant recipients to further prioritize their homeland security needs and apply federal funding to both all-hazards and terrorism priorities. Additionally, this would increase greater flexibility in use of grant funding. This might address the issue of grant coordination and allow recipients to focus funding on specific needs instead of targeted programs established by Congress and the Administration. However, DHS would need to ensure its distribution methodology included aspects of all the disparate grant programs currently administered by GPD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Funding Use", "paragraphs": ["Another issue Congress may wish to address is how effectively DHS's assistance to states and localities is being spent. One way to review the use of program funding is to evaluate state and local jurisdictions' use of DHS's assistance. However, DHS has yet to complete an evaluation of how states and localities have spent past homeland security program allocations. It can be argued that prior to establishing preparedness benchmarks for future program funding allocations, DHS, or another federal entity, would need to complete an evaluation of present homeland security funding and its uses to determine a baseline for any future evaluation of states and localities meeting federal preparedness benchmarks.", "When DHS announces annual state and locality homeland security grant allocations, grant recipients submit implementation plans that identify how these allocations are to be obligated. However, the question remains whether or not the grant funding has been used in an effective way to enhance the nation's homeland security. DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano directed FEMA to provide reports on national planning and state and local integration; however, the directives do not address state and local use of grant funding.", "In early 2009, GPD conducted an evaluation called Cost-to-Capability (C2C). This evaluation was intended to measure a grant recipient's ability to prevent and respond to various types of disasters. C2C uses DHS's National Planning Scenarios to organize the evaluation. The intent of this evaluation was to enable GPD to effectively administer DHS grant programs and help states and localities use their grant allocations. Prior to GPD beginning the C2C, state and local capability assessments were self-assessments.", "GAO, in a congressionally mandated report, stated that the input data for C2C was to be based on capability self-assessments from state preparedness plans, estimates of baseline capabilities, and other factors. However, GAO stated that the validity of the input data was uncertain since the data was based on state and local self-assessments. Additionally, GAO criticized the C2C as a limited national capability assessment tool because of the limited analytical skill levels, due to the level of training and experience of analysts, across state and local users of C2C. Also, in a summary of testimony from March 2008, GAO concluded that even though DHS has taken some steps in establishing goals, gathering information, and measuring progress, the monitoring of homeland security grant spending did not provide a method to measure the achievement of desired program outcomes. In a prepared hearing statement before a subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee, FEMA's National Preparedness Deputy Administrator Timothy Manning stated that C2C data provided FEMA with limited information on federal, state, and local investment in preparedness activities.", "In 2008, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) conducted a Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) for some of DHS's grants to states and localities. OMB assessed the program effectiveness of the State Homeland Security Grant Program, the Urban Area Security Initiative, and the Emergency Management Performance Grant Program. Overall, OMB rated the programs as adequate. However, the programs were rated as \"small extent\" for the question: \"Do independent evaluations of sufficient scope and quality indicate that the program is effective and achieving results?\" ", "The PART analysis and GAO's research might lead an observer to assume that GPD's grant programs are not enhancing state and locality homeland security capabilities. But one could argue that even though these assessments have not shown that GPD's grant programs can achieve certain benchmarks, states and localities have increased, at a minimum, the amount and types of homeland security equipment, planning, and training needed in case of a natural disaster or terrorist attack. Arguably, states, localities, and the nation as a whole are better prepared than on September 11, 2001. However, critics have seen the PART as overly political and a tool to shift power from Congress to the President, as well as failing to provide for adequate stakeholder consultation and public participation. Some observers have commented that PART has provided a needed stimulus to agency program evaluation efforts, but they do not agree on whether the PART tool validly assesses program effectiveness.", "In January 2009, DHS's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released an annual report on state and urban area management of homeland security grant programs. Individual audit reports for states and urban areas resulted in identified areas for improvement that included questioned costs, monitoring and oversight, measurable program goals and objectives, and needs assessment. The report, however, did not address overall issues for DHS, states, or urban areas. Instead it only identified areas for improvement for individual states and urban areas. Additionally, in March 2009, DHS OIG reported that FEMA does not consistently and comprehensively execute its two oversight activities, which are financial and program monitoring. In March 2010, DHS OIG identified legislative \"barriers\" to FEMA grant coordination. These \"barriers\" included: ", "multiple grant programs have similar legislated goals; grant objectives are disparate due to legislation; and congressional earmarks for specific grants.", "If Congress determines that the present C2C process is not adequate, it could require DHS to refine the C2C assessment with a reduction in weight given to state and local self-assessments. This might result in a baseline capability assessment, which DHS could use to determine annual preparedness benchmarks associated with homeland security grant funding. One could argue that these benchmarks would need to be established for individual grant recipients (state or local) instead of serving as national benchmarks. Each state does not possess the same homeland security capabilities; thus, benchmarks would need to reflect each state's need for capability enhancement. ", "Finally, if Congress finds the C2C inadequate in evaluating grant funding use, it could mandate that DHS develop an assessment tool other than C2C to measure the nation's preparedness. This new assessment tool could rely less on state and locality self-assessments, and more on DHS developing and implementing a new assessment tool that might require DHS to collaborate with individual grant recipients. This might result in an assessment tool that more accurately reflects individual state and locality preparedness baselines. However, this may extend the time that a national preparedness baseline is established and further lengthen the time until preparedness benchmarks can be established. One possible preparedness assessment tool could incorporate a risk assessment of all states, DC, and U.S. insular areas that also assess vulnerability (since C2C does not directly measure vulnerability). This risk assessment would, arguably, need to not only assess terrorism risk, but natural and accidental man-made disaster risk. In conjunction with the risk assessments, the preparedness assessment tool could also measure each grant recipient's ability to meet the Target Capabilities List (TCL). Such an assessment tool that incorporates risk and an evaluation of the TCL is not the only option, just one that Congress might wish to consider if it determines the C2C inadequately measures state and local preparedness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligible Grant Recipients", "paragraphs": ["Another policy issue associated with homeland grant programs is the question of who or what entities and jurisdictions are eligible to receive federal homeland security assistance. There are two specific questions: (1) are the appropriate eligible recipients identified for each grant program, and (2) does the DHS use an appropriate grant recipient determination process? There are 11 grant programs in FY2010 that specifically identify recipients, and this results in 11 different groups of eligible grant recipients and numerous grant recipient determination processes, as shown below.", "Of these grants, seven explicitly use risk assessment as a determination of recipient eligibility, and some sort of risk assessment may be used to determine recipients for other programs such as the Metropolitan Medical Response System. What cannot be determined is if DHS uses the same risk assessment process for each individual grant program. This may cause confusion or duplication of effort if a jurisdiction is eligible to apply for numerous grants. This multitude of grants with different eligible recipients may also lead to confusion in grant funding opportunities or redundancy in funding. It would appear that each program is narrowly defined and involves DHS using different methods for identifying grant recipients.", "Some jurisdictions with genuine homeland security needs may not be eligible for funding because different methods are used to identify grant recipients through various risk assessments that, according to critics, do not adequately assess risk, vulnerability, and consequences. Because of this, Congress might wish to address the issue of how DHS determines grant recipients. Also, Congress might wish to require DHS to use one risk assessment process for identifying grant recipients, or at a minimum, require DHS to refine the process to ensure grant recipients are not requesting funding for a single homeland security need through multiple grant programs.", "Congress may also decide to specifically identify (by type or name) grant recipients through legislation, or at least mandate that DHS report on the process to make it more transparent. Presently, the determination of grant recipients is arguably to be labor intensive and confusing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Amounts", "paragraphs": ["Annual federal support, through the appropriation process, for these homeland security programs is another issue Congress may want to examine considering the present economic situation and the limited financial resources available to the federal government. Specifically, is there a need for continuity of federal support for these programs, or should Congress reduce or eliminate funding? In the past eight years, Congress has appropriated a total of $34 billion for state and local homeland security assistance with an average annual appropriation of $3.8 billion. In FY2009 Congress appropriated a high total of funding of $4.9 billion, and the lowest appropriated amount was $1.43 billion in FY2002. Congress, in the FY2010 DHS appropriations, provided $757 million less for these programs than was appropriated in FY2009; however, some programs received increased funding in FY2010. These data are presented in Table 4 .", "Some might argue that since over $34 billion has been appropriated and allocated for state and local homeland security, jurisdictions should have met their homeland security needs. This point of view would lead one to assume that Congress should reduce funding to a level that ensures states and localities are able to maintain their homeland security capabilities, but doesn't fund new homeland security projects. However, if DHS is unable to report on the extent of state and local homeland security capabilities (as discussed earlier in the report), reducing funding amounts prior to confirming state and local capabilities may result in unmet homeland security needs. Additionally, some may argue that states and localities should assume more responsibility in funding their homeland security projects and the federal government should reduce overall funding. This, however, may be difficult due to the present state and local financial situations.", "Another argument for maintaining present funding levels is the ever changing terrorism threat and the constant threat of natural and accidental man-made disasters. As one homeland security threat (natural or man-made) is identified and met, other threats develop and require new homeland security capabilities or processes. Some may even argue that funding amounts should be increased due to what appears to be an increase in natural disasters and their costs.

Specifically, Congress may want to continue to address the funding distribution methodologies to ensure state and local homeland security. This issue has garnered Congress's attention the most over the past seven years, with the issue addressed in P.L. 110-53 in January 2007. Specifically P.L. 110-53 required that SHSGP and UASI allocations to be based on 100% risk; however, SHSGP recipients were guaranteed a minimum amount annually through 2012. This funding debate has been primarily focused on SHSGP and UASI; the majority of GPD programs have not been discussed during this debate.", "This guaranteed minimum allocation for SHSGP, and the continued use of population as a key factor for other grant program distribution methodologies (such as for grant programs like EMPG and CCP) have been the focus of many critics. One of these critics was the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission), which recommended that all homeland security assistance be allocated based only on risk. Since P.L. 110-53 required DHS to guarantee a minimum amount of SHSGP funding to states, it could be argued that the law did not meet the 9/11 Commission recommendation. Others might contend that the statue is consistent with the 9/11 Commission's recommendation because of the 100% risk allocation of SHSGP and UASI. While the 9/11 Commission criticized the allocation of federal homeland security assistance and recommended that the distribution not \"remain a program for general revenue sharing,\" commissioners acknowledged that \"every state and city needs to have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response.\" The 9/11 Commission also recommended that state and local homeland security assistance should \"supplement state and local resources based on the risks or vulnerabilities that merit additional support.\" In a policy document published prior to his inauguration, President Obama stated, in what appears to be in agreement with the 9/11 Commission, that homeland security assistance should be based solely on risk.", "Due to this criticism, Congress may wish to consider further refining how DHS allocates homeland security funding to jurisdictions. Instead of guaranteed minimums, Congress could require that DHS allocate funding based on risk. This option, however, might result in some jurisdictions receiving no or limited allocations. Arguably, a risk assessment process used to allocate homeland security assistance would determine that every state and locality has some risk, whether terrorism or natural disaster related, and needs some amount of funding. This, however, would require DHS to evaluate state and local capabilities, vulnerability, and risk in a manner that accurately reflects the nation's current homeland security environment.

The potential issues included in this report are (1) the purpose and number of assistance programs; (2) evaluation of grant funding use; (3) determination of eligible grant recipients; (4) funding amounts; and (5) funding distribution methodologies. All of these policy issues identify a potential need for Congress to continue its debate and consider legislation related to federal homeland security assistance for states and localities and the nation's overall emergency preparedness.", "Additionally, if homeland security continues to be of national interest, how homeland security assistance is funded, administered, and allocated will be of importance to the 111 th Congress. Since Congress will continue to conduct oversight and legislate on homeland security assistance to states and localities, as the House Homeland Security Committee has stated it intends to do, Members may elect to consider options that anticipate, as well as react to, future catastrophes. The potential issues identified in this report are not presumed to be the only issues, however, these issues may be of enough significance to merit Congress's attention. "], "subsections": []}]}}
