Apart from the budget for procuring weather satellites, NWS received the most funding (about $1.1 billion) of any office or program within the FY2016 budget for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The largest fraction of the NWS budget has been devoted to local forecasts and warnings, suggesting that short-term weather prediction and warning is a high priority for NWS and for NOAA, in accord with NOAA's statutory authority.", "Starting in FY2015, NWS restructured its programs, spreading out the local warning and forecast activities among five separate subprograms. The restructuring makes it difficult to compare funding for local warning and forecast activities prior to FY2015 with funding for forecast and warning activities after FY2014. According to NOAA, the restructuring was \"part of a broader effort to align the NWS budget to function and link to performance.\"", "Several bills introduced in the 114th Congress would directly or indirectly affect NWS if enacted. Some of the bills focus on single topics, such as increasing the number of NWS-operated Doppler radar stations across the country (e.g., H.R. 3538, H.R. 5089, S. 2058). Other bills would address a broader array of programs within NOAA and NWS (e.g., H.R. 1561, S. 1331, S. 1573). Several bills may affect NWS only indirectly, such as those that would authorize strategies to improve resilience to extreme weather events (e.g., H.R., 2227, H.R. 2804, H.R. 3190).

NWS strives to meet society's need for weather and hydrological forecast information.\" ", " Table 2 displays NWS funding in the restructured accounts for FY2014 through the FY2017 proposed budget. It also shows the percentage of total NOAA funding represented by each account within NWS. As stated above, the restructuring makes it difficult to compare LW&F funding prior to FY2015 with the restructured accounting; however, total NWS funding as a percentage of total NOAA funding appears to have dropped by a percentage point or two in the last few years.

Several of the bills listed in Table 3 indicate congressional interest in some of those components and programs, such as the research programs within the office of Oceans and Atmospheric Research at NOAA, and in the challenge of improving the integration of research results into operational weather forecasting (e.g., H.R. 1561 , S. 1331 ). Several of the bills are more narrowly focused, such as those that would require additional Doppler radars to provide coverage for large population centers or state capitals (e.g., H.R. 3538 , H.R. 5089 , S. 2058 ) or those that would require additional personnel at NWS forecast offices (e.g., S. 1573 ). NOAA weather satellites are also critical components of the NWS's core mission, and Congress has been concerned about possible gaps in coverage and about the future of the weather satellite programs. Congress has expressed concern about the future of the weather satellite program in annual appropriations bills and accompanying reports and will likely continue to do so for the foreseeable future, as the budget for satellite acquisitions continues to be a major component of overall NOAA annual spending. Furthermore, Congress likely will continue to introduce legislation that would shape NWS operations, directly or indirectly, in an overall effort to improve NWS's ability to provide forecasts and warnings for protection of life and property in the United States."], "subsections": []}]}}
