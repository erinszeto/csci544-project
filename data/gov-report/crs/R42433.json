The authors of the North Carolina study suggest that health centers provide health care at a lower cost because they can offer discounted services through federal programs (see \" Which Federal Programs Are Available to Health Centers? \").

In other outpatient settings this may not be the case because providers generally work under a fee-for-service model where they may receive additional remuneration for providing more services. Other studies note that differences in the cost of services (i.e., the cost for a particular procedure or visit) do not explain the difference because health centers are paid the FQHC rate, which should likely be comparable to, or higher than, the rates reimbursed in other outpatient settings.

For example, health centers may be affected by the mandatory budget reductions that may be required as part of the Budget Control Act ( P.L. 112-25 ), and such budget reductions may impact the ability of health centers to provide access to care for the newly insured when the ACA is fully implemented. This section briefly summarizes these issues and discusses how some ACA changes may alleviate or exacerbate health center concerns. ", "Health care access has traditionally been an issue of congressional concern. For example, GAO, at congressional request, has examined Medicare and Medicaid beneficiary access to health care providers. In addition, one of the purposes of ACA Title V was to improve access to and the delivery of health care services for all individuals, particularly low income, underserved, uninsured, minority, health disparity, and rural populations. The health workforce and its role in providing access to traditionally underserved populations has also been an area of congressional interest. For example, one of the four mechanisms that Title V of the ACA included to improve health care access was to \"increase the supply of a qualified health care workforce.\" The title also reauthorized a number of programs in Titles VII and VIII of the PHSA, both of which focus on the workforce. ", "Congress, through the appropriations process for the health center program and for programs that support health centers, has an interest in the financial circumstances that health centers face. Congress may also be interested in how deficit reduction efforts and other policy changes (for example, changes in Medicare and Medicaid payments or eligibility) may affect the health center program and the financial circumstances of individual health centers.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Centers and Health Insurance Expansion in the ACA", "paragraphs": ["The ACA aims to expand insurance coverage to the uninsured, which may have a number of effects on health centers. Specifically, the law aims to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding the Medicaid program and by providing subsidies for certain low-income individuals to purchase health insurance coverage. These health insurance expansions may increase the number of health center patients and may increase reimbursements received for providing this care. Although health centers are available to the uninsured and to Medicaid patients prior to the full implementation of the ACA, patients are required to pay for services based on their income (see \" Fee Schedule Requirements \"). Individuals who obtain private health insurance or Medicaid coverage under the ACA may have lower out of pocket costs for services received at health centers. These lower costs could increase the number of health center patients. There is also evidence that individuals use more health services after obtaining insurance coverage. If this occurs after the ACA is implemented, it would also increase health center use. Evidence from Massachusetts, which implemented health insurance expansions similar to those included in the ACA, suggests that health center use will increase after implementation. Massachusetts health centers reported that their patient case load increased by 7% after the state's health insurance expansions were implemented. The ACA health insurance and Medicaid expansion, by potentially increasing the health center patient base, may also strain health centers' capacity to provide services. These changes may affect health care access in general and health care access for Medicaid beneficiaries in particular. This section discusses the potential impacts of Medicaid and private insurance expansion on health centers. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Centers and Medicaid Expansion", "paragraphs": ["As noted, Medicaid beneficiaries may seek care at health centers because they are required to accept Medicaid patients. In contrast, some private providers may not accept Medicaid because of low reimbursement rates or administrative requirements. The ACA aims to increase health insurance coverage, in part, by expanding Medicaid enrollment. However, under the United States Supreme Court's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , states have the option to implement the Medicaid expansion, and some state governors have indicated that they will not to do so. This state variation in Medicaid eligibility will affect health center patients and the finances of the health centers where they seek care. Health centers may benefit if their currently uninsured patients enroll in Medicaid eligible because they would be able to bill Medicaid for the services they provide to these patients. In general, health centers use sliding scale fees to serve uninsured patients and may supplement these patient payments with grant or other funds. An increased patient share enrolled in Medicaid would mean higher collections from Medicaid, which is currently the largest source of health center reimbursements. ", "One study attempted to quantify the effect of Medicaid expansion on health centers. This study estimated that under a full Medicaid expansion, an estimated 5 million health center patients would have been eligible for Medicaid; however, given that some states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion, they expect that only 4 million of the estimated 5 million health center patients will become Medicaid eligible. This would leave 1 million health center patients not eligible for Medicaid. The authors estimate that health centers in states where the state intends to expand its Medicaid program will see more than $2 billion in additional reimbursements. These increased reimbursements are expected to allow these centers to expand or improve services. It is also possible that the increased revenue base may improve the quality of care that health centers provide. Conversely, health centers in states where Medicaid is not expanded will not realize this additional revenue and will continue to use grant funds or other sources to provide care to the uninsured. Given that current grant funding does not equal the cost of providing services to uninsured patients, health centers located in states that do not expand their Medicaid program may be strained to provide services to the population that remains uninsured.

Some suggest that once health center patients who were previously uninsured gain insurance coverage, they may seek private providers, which may in turn reduce the health center service population. However, evidence from Massachusetts, which has already expanded insurance coverage, does not suggest that this may occur. Researchers found that Massachusetts health centers retained their patients after Massachusetts's insurance expansion was implemented. Should this occur after the ACA insurance expansions, it would likely benefit health centers because more health center patients would likely have services reimbursed by private insurance, which should increase health center revenue. Experts project that 9.2% of health center patients will be covered by a private insurance plan offered through the new health insurance exchanges and that this percentage should grow over time. ", "The ACA also requires that private insurance policies offered through the newly created exchanges include access to \"essential community providers\"\u2014providers that serve predominately low-income and medically underserved individuals\u2014including health centers. This means that health insurance plans offered through the exchanges must have providers in their plan's networks that serve the population that health centers typically serve. It does not require that these insurance plans offer health center contracts. This distinction concerns some health centers; they fear that their current patients will enroll in exchange plans where health centers are not part of the provider network. If this were to occur, health centers would not be able to receive reimbursements for these patients, which might create financial strain for the health centers or require health center patients to choose different providers. In addition to concerns about being included in exchange plans, health centers are also concerned that they may not receive reimbursement rates high enough to cover the cost of care for patients enrolled in these plans because they believe that they may have little leverage to negotiate rates.

For example, an expanded patient base could strain health centers' capacity to provide care because some health centers have provider shortages.

Health centers may have challenges recruiting and retaining staff because they are located in rural and remote areas, because there are generally declining numbers of primary care providers, and because private practice options are generally more lucrative for providers.

As more than half of all NHSC providers fulfill their service commitment in health centers, this program is viewed as many as a central component of the health center workforce, and the future funding of the program may be a concern for health centers. In addition to future funding uncertainty, there may be concerns that reliance on the NHSC may create instability in the health center workforce because the NHSC offers scholarships and loan repayments in return for a service commitment for a defined period of time. Some NHSC providers will likely stay beyond their service commitment; however, not all will, which could mean high turnover among health center providers.

Teaching health centers may help health centers recruit physicians; however, health centers may face a number of challenges when operating residency programs. Case studies of pre-ACA teaching health centers found that operating a training program requires provider time and may reduce the number of patients a health center can see, thereby reducing health center reimbursements. These case studies also found that health centers do not receive graduate medical education payments in amounts that are high enough to support the full costs of the resident training and supervision. These case studies did show some benefits from operating training programs. For example, teaching health centers were, as the researchers expected, an important recruitment tool for health centers. These programs also connected non-primary care providers (i.e., medical specialists) with health centers because some specialists may supervise health center residents in other settings.

Advocates note that this phenomenon resulted in fewer New Access Point grants (i.e., grants to establish new health centers) being awarded as HRSA used appropriated funds to support health centers already in existence including those created using ARRA funds. This may indicate that the federal government's focus has shifted to maintaining the program\u2014rather than continuing program expansions\u2014as congressional concern has increasingly focused on deficit reduction.

In FY2011, NHHCS provided medical and enabling services, such as transportation and translation services, to more than 8,400 people.", "Tribal Health Centers ", "Indian Tribes (ITs), Tribal Organization (TOs), and Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs) may receive funds from the Indian Health Service (IHS) to operate health centers for American Indians or Alaska Natives. Although tribal health centers may be similar to health centers funded under Section 330 grants they are not subject to Section 330 requirements. For example, they are not required to provide services to all individuals in their service area. They are also not required to seek payments or reimbursements on behalf of the clients they see because IHS provides services to all eligible American Indians and Alaska Natives free of charge. Tribal health centers\u2014those operated by an IT, a TO, or a UIO\u2014may be designated as Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and receive the Medicare and Medicaid FQHC payment rate (See Appendix B ). ", "ITs, TOs, and UIOs may also apply for and receive funds under Section 330 of the PHSA; however, should an entity receive Section 330 funds it would be subject to all Section 330 requirements (i.e., would be require to provide services to non-American Indians and Alaska Natives). Tribal health centers that receive Section 330 grants are also required to ensure that funds received from IHS are only used to provide services to IHS-eligible individuals. ", "Rural Health Clinics", "Rural health clinics (RHCs) are outpatient primary care facilities located in rural and medically underserved areas. These facilities receive higher Medicare and Medicaid payments\u2014similar to the FQHC payment rate\u2014for services provided to beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. RHCs are similar to health centers except that they (1) do not receive federal grants, (2) may be operated by for-profit entities, (3) are not required to provide services to individuals regardless of ability to pay, and (4) are not required to offer a sliding scale fee schedule.", "Free Clinics ", "Free clinics are outpatient facilities that provide medical, dental, and behavioral health services to underserved populations that are primarily uninsured. Free clinics are tax-exempt organizations that provide health care to individuals regardless of their ability to pay and are not permitted to charge for services. In general, free clinic funding comes from donations (both monetary and in-kind), religious groups, foundations and corporations. There are more than 1,200 free clinics that provide services to a population that is similar to that served by health centers. Free clinics do not receive funding from HRSA, but may participate in the Free Clinics Medical Malpractice Program administered by HRSA that provides liability coverage to health care providers at free clinics. ", "Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Look-Alikes", "FQHC look-alikes are facilities that meet the criteria to receive a health center grant, but do not receive a grant because Section 330 funding is not available. The FQHC look-alike program was authorized in 1990 to support the demand for new health centers. HRSA and CMS can designate certain facilities as \"FQHC look-alikes,\" making these facilities eligible for certain federal programs (e.g., the NHSC and the 340B drug discount program) available to health centers and for the FQHC payment rate. To be designated as an FQHC look-alike, a facility submits an application to HRSA, the agency reviews the application and then recommends to CMS which facilities should be designated as FQHC look-alikes. As of November 2013, HRSA reported that there were 316 FQHC look-alikes.", "Appendix B. Medicare and Medicaid Payments and Beneficiary Cost Sharing for Health Center Services ", "All health centers can be designated as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) upon enrolling as a provider in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The FQHC designation makes Section 330 grantees (among others, see text box) eligible for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements rates that are generally higher than the reimbursement rates for comparable services provided in a physician's office. The FQHC designation was created to ensure that Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements cover the costs of providing services so that Section 330 grant funds are not used to subsidize these costs. This appendix describes Medicare and Medicaid payments to FQHCs and ACA-required changes to Medicare FQHC payments. ", "Medicare Payments to Health Centers ", "Health centers are paid an all-inclusive payment rate for most services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. It is intended to reflect the cost of all services provided to a beneficiary during a \"covered visit\" regardless of the specific services provided (see text box). The all-inclusive payment rate is calculated by dividing the total estimated allowable costs (with certain limits that take into account the reasonable costs for providing a service, productivity, and payment limits) by the number of total number of visits for services (see text box for definition of visits). The rate includes services provided by physicians and other providers and the supplies used to provide these services. The all-inclusive rate does not apply for certain preventive services including pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and their administration; instead these services are billed separately and reimbursed at 100% of the reasonable cost of providing the service. The all-inclusive payment rate also does not include certain diagnostic tests such as x-rays and laboratory tests, which are billed separately. FQHCs are reimbursed based on estimated costs; this payment is then adjusted at the end of the year to account for the actual costs of providing services. These reconciled amounts are subject to payment limits, which are updated each year by a measure of price inflation. The all-inclusive payment rate is also updated annually and is adjusted to take into account urban and rural differences in the costs of providing care. ", "Medicare beneficiaries are subject to different deductible and cost sharing requirements for services provided at FQHCs. Specifically, the Medicare Part B deductible does not apply for FQHC services. Beneficiaries\u2014with some exceptions \u2014must pay the 20% copayment for Medicare services. ", "ACA Payment Changes ", "Recent studies have indicated that Medicare reimbursements may not be sufficient to cover the costs of providing services; therefore, the ACA requires changes to how FQHCs are paid for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Specifically, the ACA required that Medicare develop a prospective payment system (PPS) for FQHCs that would eliminate the all-inclusive payment rate and may better align Medicare payments with the cost of providing services. To implement the new PPS system, CMS issued a proposed rule that proposes to establish a national encounter-based rate for all FQHCs. This encounter rate would be calculated using Medicare cost report and claims data to assure that the rate reflects the cost of providing services. The rate would also be adjusted for several factors including geographic differences costs, more intensive services that may be provided during the annual wellness visit, and more time or services that may be provided during a Medicare beneficiary's first visit to an FQHC. The new rule would also eliminate payments for multiple visits on one day, which CMS determined are rare among Medicare beneficiaries who receive services at FQHCs. ", "The ACA also required that Medicare preventive services and the initial exam for new Medicare beneficiaries be provided without copayments. This differs from the general Medicare beneficiary copayment of 20% of the fee charged by the health center. ", "Mental Health Service Payment Changes ", "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ) also changed Medicare reimbursement for mental health services at FQHCs. Previously, Medicare reimbursements were limited at 62.5% of the reasonable costs for outpatient mental health services; however, this limit will be phased out by January 1, 2014. ", "Medicaid Payments", "Medicaid uses a PPS to reimburse FQHCs for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. The PPS establishes a predetermined per-visit payment rate for each FQHC based on costs of services. The PPS was established based on cost report data in FY1999 and FY2000 and is updated annually for medical inflation. The state, in turn, receives the appropriate federal matching amount. States are also required to adjust PPS payment rates based on any changes in the scope of services provided at the FQHC. States are not required to use the PPS to reimburse FQHCs, but they may not reimburse an FQHC less than it would have received under the PPS. In 2011, approximately 20 states and Puerto Rico used the PPS, 12 states used an alternative payment methodology (APM) to reimburse FQHCs under Medicaid, and the remaining states used a combination of both methods. States are also required to supplement FQHCs that subcontract (directly or indirectly) with Medicaid Managed Care Entities (MCEs). These supplemental payments are supposed to make up the difference, if any, between the payment received by the FQHC from the MCE and the Medicaid payment that the FQHC would be entitled to under the PPS or the APM. The ACA did not include changes in Medicaid FQHC reimbursement policy."], "subsections": []}]}}
