These include facilitating the use of private hedging, expanding the LGM-dairy margin insurance, establishing \"farm savings accounts\" to encourage cash reserves, implementing a national margin insurance program, modifying the existing MILC program, and helping secure additional lines of credit for margin accounts used in hedging. Regarding both private marketing tools (e.g., hedging) and public programs, policymakers will likely consider whether the margin provided by markets (and determined essentially each day that the futures market is open) is sufficient for producers, or whether a minimum margin needs to be set through a government program.

As a result, individual producers had little need for managing price risk\u2014the government price support program did it for them by removing large amounts of dairy products from the market. Subsequently, Congress reduced price support levels throughout the 1980s to reduce program costs. Since then, farm milk prices have remained mostly above support levels, following increases in domestic and export demand, and annual fluctuations in farm milk prices have become routine. For example, from 2006 to 2010, milk prices moved between lows and record or near-record highs. (See Figure 1 .) The experience for dairy producers in 2009 was severe because prices had been at a record high in 2007-2008 and then fell sharply at a time when feed costs were rising substantially above long-run averages. ", "In recent years, increased demand for U.S. dairy product exports has been a factor behind the strength in milk prices. The dairy industry has made significant gains by developing export markets and positioning itself to capture future growth in the global market. The United States is now a net dairy exporter, and exports account for 10% or more of milk production. Becoming a larger player in the global dairy market has brought additional demand to the industry, but dairy producers have become more exposed to the price volatility in that market."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cost of Feed and Milk Margins", "paragraphs": ["While the farm milk price is an important factor for the financial health of dairy farms, it is only part of the picture. Another significant factor is the cost of dairy feed, which accounts for about three-quarters of a dairy farm's operating costs or about one-half of total costs. In 2011, dairy farmers are facing record corn prices, well above the long-run average. (See Figure 2 .) Prices of other major feed ingredients, including soybean meal and alfalfa, have increased as well. ", "Many suggest that to adequately describe the current farm situation at any price level for milk or feed, a \"milk margin,\" or the milk price minus feed costs, should be used. The margin is the amount available to pay all other costs once the feed bill is paid. The milk margin can be calculated by subtracting a national feed cost from the national farm milk price, as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) each month.", "Using National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) calculations (based on USDA data), the milk margin on a monthly basis typically moves between $5 and $10 per hundred pounds (cwt) of milk. Once outside this band, the margin typically reverses course. In Figure 3 , three periods are identified. The recent boom period for milk prices (blue line) was fairly short-lived in 2007 and early 2008 and was followed by a steep and prolonged decline through mid-2009. Meanwhile, feed costs (green line) spiked dramatically in 2008. The combined movements of milk prices and feed costs eventually drove the milk margin to below $3 per cwt in 2009, and producers culled their herds. In the latter part of 2009 and into 2010, domestic and international demand for milk and dairy products improved and producers continued cutting back their herds. Milk prices rose and the milk margin returned to $7-$8 per cwt, which is near the longer-run average."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Producer Reaction to Recent Margin Volatility", "paragraphs": ["During the period of rapidly rising margins in 2007, producers added cows to their herds. This continued well into 2008, even though margins were deteriorating ( Figure 4 ). The number of dairy cows eventually fell, which helped bring supplies in line with demand. The delayed supply response has prompted some industry observers to note that dairy farmers, like other business people, often reinvest profits from boom years back into the operation in order to minimize their tax liability. If continuous investment occurs industry-wide, it has the potential to build capacity and supplies even during cyclical market downturns.", "To deal with recent market and income volatility, more producers have reportedly adopted risk strategies. Some may have become interested in risk management for the first time, while others may have dabbled in it before and become true believers in actively managing their business risk. Producers who have long managed their market risks typically view market volatility as a potential profit opportunity and employ strategies to avoid the catastrophic events often attributed to low milk prices. These farmers say that volatility has led to profits in the up years and made them better managers in the down years. In contrast, other producers continue to call for the government to mitigate market volatility in some way.

They might also use brokers to establish hedges using futures or options that lock in favorable prices or margins. As a third option, producers might maintain cash reserves to get through the low price periods. In the government category, Congress occasionally grants emergency government assistance to producers that could be considered short-run risk management because, over the years, some producers have apparently considered the possibility of assistance to be sufficient risk protection. Finally, government insurance products administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency but delivered by private insurers are available to manage short-run risks. ", "Long-run risk management strategies might include diversifying the farm operation, perhaps by growing more feed (thus avoiding market purchases) or by adding other enterprises, such as a trucking operation. The goal of such moves would be to generate revenue streams that do not fluctuate in the same way as dairy revenues. Pursuing off-farm income is another way to reduce variability in farm household income by simply reducing dairy returns as a share of the overall household income. But given the labor requirements of dairy operations, this is usually considered a less viable option than for other types of farms.", "Finally, the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program makes payments when milk prices drop below certain levels. MILC is considered a long-run tool because the target levels are in statute for multiple years over the life of the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ). This is in contrast to the short-run private tools listed above, which offer price or margin protection at whatever levels the milk and feed markets determine for a specific time period, generally one year or so into the future. Sometimes producers can lock in favorable (high) margins, while at other times margins may be low or even negative.

Producers sign forward contracts with their cooperative or milk buyer to sell in the future at a price determined when the contract is made. Prices are based on the futures market at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Dairy farmers pay fees for this service (e.g., administrative costs or brokerage fees).", "This method of risk management can work well for producers with 100 or fewer cows, because the milk volume produced is insufficient to hedge directly on the futures exchange. Producers also do not need to post \"margin money,\" as when hedging with futures (see \" Private Delivery: Hedging \" below), where money must be posted when prices move in a direction against a trader's position. With a basic forward contract, the producer has no downside price risk, but no upside potential either. Other types of forward contracts offer upside potential.", "In 2002, USDA reported results from a pilot program on forward contracting that demonstrated the price-smoothing effect of contracts. In Figure 6 , note that the dark blue line, which is the average contract price, is relatively stable (ranging from $13 to $15 per cwt), while the market price (in pink) fluctuates (from $12 to $18 per cwt). Across the 18-month period, the average contract price was lower than the average market price, thus illustrating that lower risk (lower volatility) is associated with lower return and higher risk is associated with higher returns. Individual producers may see benefits to following either approach, depending on their business management strategies.", "Producers can also contract their feed requirements with local grain elevators or producers, with prices typically set relative to futures prices. With the grain seller handling the risk-related activities, this approach can work especially well for smaller producers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Delivery: Hedging", "paragraphs": ["Rather than forward contracting, producers can hedge risks directly and protect against the prospect of declining prices by selling a milk futures contract on the CME in advance of when the milk is produced and sold. If prices in the future in fact decline, the farmer will realize a profit on the trade when the original contract is eventually liquidated (i.e., when the farmer buys another contract of the same kind to offset the first contract), because the futures contract in effect conveys the right to sell at the old (higher) price. The farmer adds any profit generated from this set of transactions to the actual value of milk he or she sells. ", "If the futures price rises instead of falls, the farmer will realize a loss in the futures market. However, these losses can be offset by gains in the value of milk the farmer is selling, because the cash market and futures market tend to move in the same direction. By using such a strategy (called \"hedging\"), farmers can \"lock in\" a predetermined price for the milk they produce. A similar strategy can be employed to lock in favorable prices of key feed inputs, such as corn and soybean meal. When milk and feed hedges are used together, a dairy producer can lock in a milk margin (milk price minus feed cost). ", "A graphical depiction of a hedge to protect against a decline in milk prices appears in Figure 7 . If the farmer wants to lock in a price represented by the black arrow, he would sell a futures contract. If overall prices decline, he would see a lower actual cash price for milk but would realize a gain in the futures market (shown in green) when the original position is offset by purchasing a futures contract. As a result, the net price would be the hedge price shown as the arrow. If overall prices were to rise, the producer would realize a much higher cash price, but the loss in the futures market (shown in red) would reduce the net price back to the hedge price (dark arrow). A numerical example of producer hedging is provided in Figure 8 .", "A producer can execute hedges through a broker who will set up a margin account. The margin account is used to pay for any daily losses incurred if the market moves opposite to the producer's position in the futures market. (Producers, who typically lock in a selling price, incur futures losses when market prices rise.) The producer also receives marketing advice, including strategies for tailoring hedging to the producer's operation and risk preferences. Direct hedging works best for farms with at least 100 cows (which produce about 200,000 pounds of milk per month, roughly the same amount as a single futures contract).", " Figure 7 suggests that hedging with futures is equivalent to giving up possible windfall gains from rising prices in exchange for insurance against downside price risk. Producers who wish to retain some of the upside potential may hedge by purchasing an option contract, which conveys the right, but not the obligation, to sell at a predetermined price. By using options, producers avoid the need for a margin account. However, because options buyers must pay a premium to the seller, options can be more expensive in terms of price protection per quantity of milk."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hedging Outcomes During the 2009 Market Collapse", "paragraphs": ["Hedging can be effectively used to mitigate market risks for dairy producers.

First, producers need access to a hedge line of credit, which is used to make payments to the \"margin\" account when the market moves counter to the producer's position.

Market observers have commented that the basis for dairy producers is sometimes inconsistent and more difficult to determine than for other commodities because of the nature of milk pricing under milk marketing orders. ", "The cost of margin protection is another issue. Per-unit costs might discourage a producer from implementing a hedging strategy because, when margins are low, the cost of executing a risk strategy may wipe out potential profits, and some producers might not be comfortable with locking in a zero profit. Similarly, producers must overcome fear of leaving money on the table, which happens when hedging, or of locking in a loss when an even larger loss might force them out of business.", "The preceding discussion on forward contracting and hedging describes unsubsidized privately available risk management tools.

LGM-Dairy is administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) as part of the federal crop insurance program and is sold by private insurance agents. At the end of an 11-month insurance period, producers receive an indemnity if the actual gross margin is less than the guarantee.", "LGM-Dairy became available in 2008. Observers have commented that participation has been low because producers are still learning how to use it, and until recently, the policy premium has not been subsidized (unlike most other RMA products).

These included shifting the due date for the premium paid by the producer from the beginning of the policy period to the end (approximately one year later). Policy sales increased sharply but then were halted when allocated funds ($16 million) ran out midway through FY2011. The Federal Crop Insurance Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 et seq.), limits expenditures on livestock policies to $20 million per year (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1523).

Producers received a per-cwt loss payment equal to the difference between the guarantee and the actual margin.

In the summer of 2009, when milk prices were hitting rock bottom, the guarantee level was fairly low. For a producer who purchased a policy in mid-summer 2009, the actual margin turned out to be higher than the guarantee for much of the insurance period.

The current insurance products are designed primarily for small, diversified livestock and specialty crop farms.

The annual payment quantity is limited to 2.985 million pounds of annual production (equivalent to about a 160-cow operation) and declines to 2.4 million pounds for the last month of program authority.
