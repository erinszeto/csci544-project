Those that qualify under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code are taxed only on certain income. Under the Code, 527 organizations are subject to reporting requirements that involve registration, the periodic disclosure of contributions and expenditures, and the annual filing of tax returns. Section 527 organizations must also comply with applicable campaign finance laws. In the 110th Congress, the 527 Transparency Act of 2007 (H.R. 1204) would change the frequency of the periodic disclosure requirements and the penalties for violating them, and the State and Local Candidate Fairness Act of 2007 (H.R. 3771) would change the tax rates at which state and local candidates' principal campaign committees are taxed. This report describes these organizations, the reporting requirements they face under the Internal Revenue Code, and the two bills."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 1975, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) was silent as to the tax treatment of organizations whose primary purpose is influencing elections. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treated contributions to political organizations as gifts, which meant that the organizations did not have taxable income and were not required to file tax returns. By the early 1970s, it was apparent that these organizations had sources of income besides contributions, and the IRS indicated it would require those with investment and other types of income to file tax returns and pay tax at the corporate rate.", "P.L. 93-635 , enacted in 1975, added Section 527 to the IRC to address the tax treatment of political organizations. The section grants tax-exempt status to qualifying political organizations. This treatment is the focus of this report, but it should be noted that Section 527 has two other purposes: it imposes a tax on 501(c) organizations that make political expenditures and it clarifies that expenditures by political organizations on behalf of an individual are generally not income to the individual."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 527 Political Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Political organizations that qualify under Section 527 are taxed only on certain income. A political organization is any organization, including a party, committee, association, or fund, that is organized and operated primarily to directly or indirectly accept contributions and/or make expenditures for an exempt function .", "An exempt function is the influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of an individual to a federal, state, or local public office, to an office in a political organization, or as a Presidential or Vice-Presidential elector. An exempt function does not necessarily involve explicitly advocating for or against the individual. For example, when determining whether an issue advocacy communication is for an exempt function , the IRS looks at such things as whether it identifies a candidate, identifies his or her position on the issue and this has been raised to distinguish the candidate from others, is timed to coincide with an election, targets voters in a particular election, and is not part of an ongoing series of similar communications by the organization on the same issue.", "527 organizations are subject to tax only on political organization taxable income . This is the organization's gross income, excluding exempt function income , less $100 and any allowable deductions. Exempt function income is any amount received, to the extent that it is segregated to use for an exempt function , as:", "contributions of money or other property, membership dues, fees, or assessments, proceeds, which are not received in the ordinary course of business, from political fundraising and entertainment events or from the sale of campaign materials, and proceeds from conducting a bingo game.", "The tax rate is generally the highest corporate income tax rate. However, under IRC \u00a7 527(h), income of the principal campaign committee of a Congressional candidate is taxed using the graduated corporate tax rate schedule.

For example, political parties and candidate committees are 527 organizations. However, because some 527 organizations are unrelated to federal elections, not all 527 organizations are regulated by FECA. In recent years, there has been considerable debate about the extent to which FECA regulates certain types of 527 organizations and the constitutional limitations on such regulation.

This was because not all 527 organizations reported to the FEC under FECA and organizations only filed a return to the IRS if they had taxable income. The fact that organizations could qualify under Section 527 without reporting to the FEC was largely unnoticed until 1996, when the IRS began issuing guidance on the types of activities that qualify as exempt functions . This awareness helped lead to an increase in the number of 527 organizations, called \"stealth PACs,\" that were designed to avoid reporting to the FEC. In 2000 and 2002, Congress amended Section 527 to require that organizations report to the IRS, the FEC, or a state."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Notification of Status", "paragraphs": ["An organization must notify the IRS of its 527 status by electronically filing Form 8871 within 24 hours of its formation.

The district court had held that the requirements for organizations involved in state and local elections violated the Tenth Amendment and the requirement to disclose expenditures violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The basis of the district court's decision was that the requirements were part of a regulatory (campaign finance reform) scheme that was subject to a higher level of scrutiny than action under Congress' taxing powers would be. The district court then closely examined the requirements and found some to be impermissible. For example, the district court held that the requirement to disclose expenditures was unconstitutional because Congress had not sufficiently tailored the requirement to meet its informational and corruption-related goals or established a compelling reason to treat political organizations differently than other tax-exempt organizations. The Court of Appeals held that the disclosure requirements fell within Congress' power to tax and that the Anti-Injunction Act, which requires taxpayers pay a tax before disputing it, barred the suit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Return", "paragraphs": ["Section 527 organizations with gross receipts of at least $25,000 ($100,000 if a qualified state or local political organization) must annually file an information return, Form 990, with the IRS.
