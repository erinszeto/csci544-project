This action wasthe consequence of the Department of Defense's broad reevaluation of its mission in conjunctionwith the weakening and ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union. There was little need, according tothe Pentagon, to continue to retain the vast Cold War-era infrastructure. Funds saved from closingdown underutilized bases, DOD further noted, could be used to enhance development of newweapons and improved readiness.", "The 1988 round of infrastructure reductions was followed by three additional rounds in 1991, 1993, and 1995. Since then, no further rounds of base closures and realignments have beenauthorized by Congress, despite repeated requests from the Department of Defense in recent yearsfor two additional rounds. The reasons for congressional resistance are two-fold. First, there isconcern over a likely backlash from constituents living in or near military installations. Second,many Members of Congress remain wary about a repetition of the perceived political intrusion bythe Clinton Administration that occurred in regard to the 1995 recommendations to close Kelly andMcClellan air force bases.", "The four base closure and realignment (BRAC) commissions recommended, individually, a total of 534 actions to close, realign, or otherwise affect specific bases, facilities, and activities.

The disposing of all theclosed property, however is expected to take many more years. The Pentagon's current estimate ofthe percentage reduction in base structure as a result of the first four rounds is 21%. This figure isused as support for additional infrastructure reductions, since other key indicators, such as thedefense budget and the force structure (personnel and units) have declined 40% and 36%,respectively.", "In terms of costs and savings associated with the first four rounds of closures and realignments, a DOD report (April 1998) estimated a net total savings of about $14 billion through FY2001. Itprojected that net annual savings, thereafter, would be in the vicinity of $5.6 to $5.7 billion.

Military installations are rather diversifiedand can include a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, home-port, or leased facility. Further, morethan one mission or function may be housed on a given installation.", "The report noted, additionally, that: ", "an individual (BRAC) recommendation may actuallyaffect a variety of activities and functions without fully closing an installation. Full closures, to theextent they occur, may involve relatively small facilities, rather than the stereotypically large militarybase.

For example, the Army defines a major installation as onewith 5,000 or more U.S. service members, DOD civilian employees, and/or other authorized tenants. It defines a minor installation as one with personnel numbering between 1,000 and 5,000. In its\"other\" category, it includes sites and facilities with personnel levels between 300 and 1,000.

According to GAO, about 464,000acres of BRAC real property were determined to be excess, but, as of March 1998, only about 31%of property designated for non-federal users had been formally transferred. (8) The main delayingfactor in the process has been the need to meet strict environmental clean-up standards. In order tomove things along more swiftly, DOD has adopted the use of interim leases until such time as formaldeeds can be issued. ", "It is difficult to find consistently determined figures on overall BRAC actions. However, the Department of Defense does provide one such set of statistics, smaller in number, that identifies 97major closures and realignments. The overall baseline figure for DOD's major bases (non-BRACas well as BRAC) is 495. As of September 30, 1999, the following information on BRAC majorclosures and realignments was as follows:", "The two remaining BRAC major bases are scheduled to be closed during fiscal year 2001. They are McClellan AFB, CA and Roslyn Air Guard Station, NY. ", "Percent of Base Structure Closed. In its report to the 1993 Base Closure Commission, the Department of Defense estimated that, under the first tworounds (1988 and 1991), domestic base structure was reduced by only 9%, measured by plantreplacement value. (9) It stated that adding the 1993closures (recommended by DOD) to the previousones would reduce the domestic base structure by about 15%. ", "In its recommendations to the 1995 Base Closure Commission, the Department of Defense estimated that adding the 1995 closures (recommended by DOD) to the previous ones would reducethe domestic base structure by approximately 21%. The Pentagon's current (1999) estimate of thepercentage reduction in base structure remains essentially the same -- 21% (see Figure 1 forcomparison with other indicators of defense drawdown).", "For several years, the Department of Defense has been urging Congress to authorize additional base closure rounds. It has stressed that base structure reductions lag significantly behind thereductions in the defense budget and in the force structure (military units and personnel). Additionalbase closures, according to DOD, would free up funds urgently needed for the development of newweapon systems as well as providing for increased training and readiness of the armed forces. ", "Many, if not most, authorities on defense policy agree with DOD's assessment. A few havesuggested, however, that the underlying premise of relative parity may be false. For a start, someargue that the \"defense budget\" and \"military personnel\" columns below represent worldwide figures, while the \"domestic base structure\" column represents the fifty United States and itsterritories. If the U.S. overseas bases closed are added to those of the domestic base structure,thecomparable figure would be an overall reduction of about 26%. ", "A second concern has to do with the issue of \"reconstitution\" -- a potential need to increase military capability when the United States is confronted, at some future point, by a hostile andpowerful enemy state. The argument is that, while the defense budget can be increased in a matterof weeks, the same is not true of the force structure or the base structure. Some believe the problemof reconstitution is potentially most hazardous with regard to the base structure.

Proponents believed that their cause would be helped by the fact that it was not an election year. On January 20,1999, Senator John McCain, along with Senators Carl Levin and Charles Robb, introducedlegislation ( S. 258 ) that would authorize two new rounds of base closures in 2001 and2003.

However, most Members of Congress werenot inclined to act on an issue fraught with potential controversy, especially during a presidentialelection year.

Presently, with the implementation of four BRAC rounds nearingcompletion (the deadline is end of FY2001), savings are projected to be significantly greater thancosts. The second, and more fundamentally problematic, aspect has to do with determining theaccuracy of data -- especially data involving savings.
