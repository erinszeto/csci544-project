The budget resolution represents an agreement between the House and Senate on a budgetary plan for the upcoming fiscal year (and several out years). The budget resolution does not become law; therefore no money is spent or collected as a result of its adoption. Instead, the outline is designed to establish parameters within which Congress will consider subsequent budgetary legislation that will fulfill the budgetary plan. ", "Once the budget resolution has been agreed to by both chambers, certain levels contained in it are enforceable through points of order. This means that if subsequent legislation was being considered on the House or Senate floor that would violate certain levels established by the budget resolution, a Member could raise a point of order against the consideration of that legislation. Generally, such points of order can be waived in the House by a simple majority of Members and in the Senate by three-fifths of all Senators. ", "The idea of a \"traditional\" budget resolution means a budget resolution as defined by the Budget Act, which specifies the way that a budget resolution shall be developed and considered and what components it must include. Specifically, it states that House and Senate Budget Committees shall develop the budget resolution, and in doing this, the Committees must hold hearings and receive testimony from Members of Congress and \"such appropriate representatives of Federal departments and agencies, the general public, and national organizations as the committee deems desirable.\" Further, it states that the budget committees will receive input from their congressional colleagues in at least two ways: (1) through \"consultation\" with committees during the preparation of the budget resolution (the act applies only to the House Budget Committee) and 2) through the review of \"Views and Estimates,\" which are required to be submitted by committees to the Budget Committee and reflect information on the desired levels of spending and revenue within the relevant committee's jurisdiction. The act also specifies how the budget resolution shall be considered by the House and Senate.

Such reconciliation legislation is then eligible to be considered under special expedited procedures in both the House and Senate. Procedural provisions . A budget resolution typically includes procedural provisions such as House and Senate budgetary rules (enforced by points of order) and direction on the budgetary treatment of certain activities (such as energy savings contracts). Reserve funds and adjustments . Congress frequently includes \"reserve funds\" and \"adjustments\" in the annual budget resolution. These provisions provide the chairs of the House or Senate Budget Committees with the authority to adjust the budgetary allocations, aggregates, and levels in the future if certain conditions are met. Generally, the goal of reserve funds or adjustment is to allow certain policies to be considered on the floor without triggering a point of order for violating levels in the budget resolution.
