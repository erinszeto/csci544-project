The ESA is perennially controversial because the protections provided can make it the visible policy focal point for underlying situations involving the allocation of scarce or diminishing lands or resources, especially in instances where societal values may be changing or traditional land use patterns are affected. As a result, the act often becomes controversial even where a particular species is not the focus of a controversy but a symptom of it. In response to past controversies, Congress has repeatedly considered minor amendments and major changes to the ESA.", "The major features of the ESA and related controversies are briefly summarized as follows:", "ESA retains its authorities even though its authorization for funding expired in 1992, and funds may be and have been appropriated in the absence of a current authorization. ESA prohibitions and penalties remain in effect regardless of appropriations. ESA's principal parts are the listing and protection of species, designation of critical habitat and avoidance of its destruction, and consultation by federal agencies regarding actions that may harm listed species. Dwindling species are listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction. Once a species is listed, legal tools are available to aid its recovery and to protect its habitat. ESA has broad provisions for citizen suits to enforce the act, and lawsuits have played a major role in enforcement and interpretation of many, or perhaps most, of the act's provisions. ESA provides for exemptions from the act for agency projects, but the provisions are little used for a variety of reasons. The act is administered primarily by the Fish and Wildlife Service for terrestrial and freshwater and by the National Marine Fisheries Service for most marine and anadromous species.

Under the ESA, individual species of plants and animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate) can be listed as either \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" according to assessments of the risk of their extinction. Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools are available to aid the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat. Among these legal tools are the ESA's prohibition of unpermitted \"take\" (e.g., killing, capturing, or harming) of endangered species and its requirement that agencies, in consultation with FWS or NMFS as applicable, ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. (See \"Take\" and \" Critical Habitat ,\" below.) As of August 24, 2016, a total of 2,266 species of animals and plants had been listed as either endangered or threatened; 1,593 of these species occur in the United States and its territories, and the remainder occur only in other countries.

The surrogate role is especially likely because other laws often lack the strict substantive provisions that Congress included in the ESA (see \" Major Provisions \" sections, below). There can be economic interests on multiple sides of some vanishing species issues. Like the miners' canaries signaling a scarce resource (safe air supply), declining species are often symptoms of resource scarcities and altered ecosystems. Examples of such resource controversies include the Tellico Dam (hydropower development and construction jobs versus farmland protection and tribal graves, as well as the endangered snail darter); and Northwest timber harvest (protection of logging jobs and communities versus commercial and sport fishing, recreation, and ecosystem protection, as well as salmon and spotted owls). The worldwide debate over global climate change (fossil fuels, carbon dioxide emission levels, shoreline erosion, melting glaciers, traditional jobs, etc.) has found an avatar in the polar bear.", "Tensions over the ESA have increased as species have been added to the protected list, and as the greater demands of a growing economy and human population have affected species' habitats. Both Congress and the executive branch have sought to lessen these tensions by, among other things, tailoring application of the ESA for particular circumstances. The ESA's critics contend that neither the ESA nor administrative efforts go far enough in accommodating needs other than species conservation, while the ESA's defenders counter that it only balances what they see as an inherent bias toward development in other governmental laws and policies.", "Debate on the ESA splits largely along demographic lines. While most demographic groups support species conservation to some degree, that support is stronger among urban and suburban populations and less so in rural areas, and is stronger among those along the coasts and less so in central and mountain states. Sport hunters and anglers seem divided on the issue. Native Americans, as a group often dependent on natural resources (e.g., fish), are frequently involved in ESA issues and often support the survival of listed species. Groups opposing strong protections for listed species usually assert that jobs will be lost if conservation measures are stringent, but those seeking strong protections often claim that jobs will be lost if they are not. It is also noteworthy that, while the debate often centers on jobs and biology, people on both sides claim ethical support for their positions, and many religious groups participate in the debate. In addition, some industries (e.g., logging and land development) generally see the ESA as a serious problem, while others (e.g., some commercial fishing and many recreation interests) see it as generally supporting their interests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authority, Authorization, and Appropriation", "paragraphs": ["There is a difference between the statutory authority to carry out an action and the authorization of appropriations within a statute.

A major goal of the ESA is the recovery of species to the point at which the protection of the ESA is no longer necessary. If this is the standard, the ESA might be considered a failure, because only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, as of July 25, 2016. Ten species have become extinct since their listing; 8 have been delisted due to scientific reclassification of the species; and 11 have been delisted due to improved data, changes in the law, or improved scientific understanding. In the case of the species now believed extinct, some were originally listed to protect any last remaining few that might have been alive at the time of listing. It can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that, or in fact are already extinct. For example, two bird species, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the Eskimo curlew, are both listed as endangered, though confirmed sightings are so rare or so far in the past that these birds may actually be extinct; proving a negative (i.e., that such species do not exist any longer) is quite difficult. Rare species are, by definition, hard to find.", "Even so, because some scientific studies have demonstrated that most species are listed only once they are very depleted (e.g., median population of about 400 animals for vertebrates listed as endangered according to one study), another measure of effectiveness might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if the species is not actually delisted. If this is the standard, the ESA could be considered a success, since a relatively large number (41% of listed species according to one study) have improved or stabilized their population levels. One could also ask what species might have become extinct if there were no ESA: some species (e.g., red wolves and California condors) might not exist at all without the ESA protection, and this too might be considered a measure of success, even though the species are still rare. The authors are unaware of comprehensive studies regarding the likely status of rare species were there no ESA, but some species (e.g., some salmon populations, Florida panthers, California condors, and plants of very narrow ranges) might have declined further, from exceptional rarity to extinction, if ESA did not exist."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Scientific Background on Species Loss", "paragraphs": ["Scientific information and analysis are pillars of ESA actions and enforcement.

The poster species of the debate were passenger pigeons, tigers, wolves, and other well-known animals. But during the 20 th century, a shift occurred. The vast majority of species, including those for which actual removal from the wild was probably an early factor in their decline, now are generally also at risk due to habitat loss. Habitats that have been reduced to a small fraction of their former extent include tall-grass prairie, fresh and salt water wetlands, old growth forests of most types, free-flowing rivers, coral reefs, undisturbed sandy beaches, and others. Global climate change is another contributor to habitat loss, acting in concert with other factors influencing population levels.", "Another high-ranking factor in the demise of many species is the introduction of nonnative invasive species. Nonnative species can be disease vectors or parasites (e.g., avian malaria in Hawaii, chytrid fungus attacking amphibians in much of the world, or Asian long-horned beetles in North America), predators (e.g., brown tree snakes in Guam and Hawaii), or competitors (e.g., barred owls in the Pacific Northwest or snakeheads in the Potomac River).

But is it normal? Geological evidence shows that the vast majority of species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct\u2014an observation uncontested by paleontologists. However, many scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background extinction rates over time. But calculating current rates of extinction, much less making comparisons with the geologic past, is extremely difficult. Current estimates of total numbers of species range from 3.5 million to 100 million, with 10-30 million being commonly accepted numbers. If scientists are unsure of how many species exist, it is naturally difficult to estimate how fast they are going extinct, and whether current extinction rates exceed background extinction rates. Consequently, scientists use very conservative assumptions to make these estimates. The resulting extinction rates (17,000 species per year being a typical estimate) may still seem astonishingly large, in part because the public is generally unaware of the huge number of species in groups to which many people pay little or no attention (e.g., beetles, marine invertebrates, fish), and the large number of species estimated on Earth. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Do Current Extinction Rates Compare to Background Rates?", "paragraphs": ["Widely diverse methods of calculating extinction rates all suggest that current rates exceed background rates. Normal rates are thought to be from 1 to 10 species for every 10 million species per year.

Common estimates of current extinction rates range from 100 to 10,000 times such background rates\u2014roughly comparable to the five great episodes of extinction in the geologic past. Critics most frequently question these calculations by stressing uncertainties, rather than citing specific factual errors. This criticism is not surprising, since each step in these calculations contains uncertainties (e.g., estimating the number of existing species). Most biologists counter by noting that similar numbers are generated in studies of widely different groups by a variety of scientists using different methods; robust results (i.e., similar results from the testing of a hypothesis in a variety of ways) are usually considered scientifically sound.", "Once extinct, a species cannot be revived. But, faced with high rates of extinction, some might argue that a return to an equal number of species, even if those species are different, would constitute a recovery of sorts. Evolution continues, so new species may evolve that are better adapted to new conditions. How long would such a replacement/recovery take? Examining the geologic record after major extinction episodes, some scientists estimate that recovery to approximately equal numbers of (different) species took up to 25 million years for the most severe extinction events. Thus, if the current extinction rate and recovery rate are comparable to past rates, the return to species numbers of the pre-historic era would take at least several million years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The following are the major provisions of the ESA in the order they appear in the U.S. Code .

Otherwise, the experimental population is treated as nonessential and is considered threatened. Special regulations under Section 4 of the ESA are made regarding these populations and can include rules for taking the species.

The Secretary of the Interior may initiate a change in the status of listed species. Alternatively, after receiving a substantive petition for any change in listing status, the Secretary is to review the species' status. The determination to delist, uplist, or downlist a species must be made \"solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data available\" and \"without reference to possible economic or other impacts.\" The statute and regulations also mandate that, at least once every five years, there be a review of each species already listed to determine whether it should be removed from the list, changed from endangered to threatened, or changed from threatened to endangered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Habitat", "paragraphs": ["Critical habitat, as defined, includes not only geographic areas occupied by the species at the time of listing, but also areas outside that geographic area, if the Secretary determines that such additional areas are essential for the conservation of the species.

According to FWS, critical habitat designation shows its greatest conservation benefit when it includes areas not currently occupied by the species; these areas may be important as connecting corridors between populations or as areas in which new populations may be reintroduced. In an announcement on October 22, 1999, FWS placed designation of critical habitat at the lowest priority in its listing budget and stated that the agency could not comply with all of the ESA's demands under its budget constraints. Conservation groups saw a contradiction between that claim and the agency's repeated decision not to request increased funds for listing, together with the agency's requests that Congress place a special cap on funding for designation of critical habitat. These funding restrictions on designation of critical habitat have remained in all subsequent appropriations bills.", "FWS has been sued frequently for its failure to designate critical habitat, and the agency consistently loses such suits. In the agency's view, critical habitat offers little protection for a species beyond that already available under the listing process and thus the expense of designation, combined with the perception of a small margin of additional conservation benefit, make critical habitat requirements a poor use of scarce budgetary resources, especially if the public views critical habitat as the major regulatory impact of the ESA rather than as a supplement to the ESA's prohibition on \"taking\" a listed species.", "The designation of critical habitat may provide additional protection for listed species in the context of federal actions. Federal agencies must consider whether their actions are likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat under the Section 7 consultation provisions, meaning this protection is not available for species without such designated habitat. The FWS previously disagreed that extra protection is provided in this way, saying that it would be rare that a habitat would be harmed in this way without the species also being put in jeopardy. Therefore, according to FWS, designated critical habitat does not provide additional protection from federal actions because the jeopardy consideration would provide the necessary protection. This conclusion was based in part on the FWS regulatory definition of \"destroy or adversely modify,\" which required that the federal action must \"appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species.\" However, it was argued that the definition improperly shifted the focus from recovery of the species to survival of the species. Several federal courts of appeal agreed, holding that the definition was contrary to the ESA because it ignored the recovery goal of the law. This was finally changed in February 2016. The Federal Register notice said: ", "After the Ninth Circuit's decision, the Services each issued guidance to discontinue the use of the 1986 definition \u2026. Specifically, in evaluating an action's effects on critical habitat as part of interagency consultation, the Services began directly applying the definition of \"conservation\" as set out in the Act. \u2026", "The definition now in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 gives greater emphasis to the act's focus on recovery:", "Destruction or adverse modification means a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species.
