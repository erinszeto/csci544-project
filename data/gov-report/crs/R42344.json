The negotiating parties describe the TPP as a proposed \"living agreement,\" which seeks to cover new trade topics and to include new members that are willing to adopt its high standards. The ongoing negotiations, which TPP country trade ministers have repeatedly announced are in the final stages, may progress more quickly with the recent congressional grant of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to the Obama Administration.", "The TPP negotiations are of ongoing interest to Congress. Congressional involvement includes consultations with U.S. negotiators on and oversight of the details of the negotiations, and eventual consideration of legislation to implement the final trade agreement. In assessing the TPP negotiations, Members may be interested in understanding the potential economic impact and significance of TPP and the economic characteristics of the other TPP countries as they evaluate the potential impact of the proposed TPP on the U.S. economy and the commercial opportunities for expansion into TPP markets.", "This report provides a comparative economic analysis of the TPP countries and their economic relations with the United States. TPP negotiating partners encompass great diversity in population, economic development, and trade and investment patterns with the United States. This economic diversity and inclusion of fast-growing emerging markets present both opportunities and challenges for the United States in achieving a comprehensive and high standard regional FTA among TPP countries.", "The proposed TPP and its potential expansion are important due to the economic significance of the Asia-Pacific region for both the United States and the world. The region is home to 40% of the world's population, produces nearly 60% of global GDP, and includes some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Including Canada, Mexico, and Japan, TPP negotiating partners made up 37% of total U.S trade in 2013, and the Asia-Pacific economies as a whole made up 57%. The TPP would be the largest U.S. FTA to date by trade value.", "The United States is the largest TPP market in terms of both GDP and population. In 2014, non-U.S. TPP partners collectively had a GDP of $10.6 trillion, just over 60% of the U.S. level, and a population of 486 million, about 50% larger than the U.S. population. Japan's entry (pop. 127 million and GDP $4.6 trillion) increased the significance of the agreement on both these metrics.", "Unlike most previous U.S. FTA negotiations, the TPP involves countries with which the United States already has an FTA.

Japan is by far the largest U.S. trade partner among TPP members without an existing U.S. FTA.", "Other TPP partners also have extensive existing FTA networks. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam are members, and its collective FTAs with other countries, accounts for the bulk of this interconnectedness.

Moreover, the region's economies are growing quickly. In 2014, six of these 21 economies had GDP growth above 5%, while GDP growth in the United States was 2.4%. Along with increasing economic influence these economies account for a growing share of world trade. For example, Asia's share of world imports grew from 18.5% in 1983 to 31.8% in 2013. The region is significant not just as a burgeoning market, but also as an integral part of global value chains. The East Asian members, in particular, are highly connected through global value chains and involve the United States in complex production networks spanning the Pacific. In 2009, for example, 64% of Asian non-fuel imports were in intermediate goods and over $600 billion in intermediate goods moved between Asia and North America.", "The Asia-Pacific region represents an important source and destination for U.S. trade and investment.

These countries vary greatly in their geography as well. They range from Australia, a large and resource-rich continent, to Singapore, a small, trade-dependent city-state. As discussed in the final section of this report, some of this economic and demographic diversity is reflected in both the type and intensity of trade and investment flows between the United States and TPP countries.", "A potential TPP FTA may present an opportunity for the United States to expand its trade and investment with a large and fast-growing regional market. Non-U.S. TPP partners collectively represent a potential market with a population about 50% larger than the United States and several TPP economies have grown rapidly over the past decade (e.g. , average GDP growth for 2005-2014 was 6.2% in Vietnam and Peru, 5.9% in Singapore, and 4.9% in Malaysia).

The annual flow of both inbound and outward foreign direct investment (FDI) between the United States and TPP countries was much higher in 2013 than 2004, although it has fluctuated throughout the decade. The flow of U.S. FDI abroad to TPP countries was $86 billion in 2013 with inward FDI at $69 billion.

In services, the U.S. trade surplus has increased from $38 billion in 2004 to $83 billion in 2013. In goods, the U.S. trade deficit in 2014 of $155 billion was less than the deficit in 2004 of $203 billion, and significantly less than the peak deficit in 2006 of $247 billion.

According to press reports, South Korea has been consulting bilaterally with the existing TPP negotiating parties about what steps would be required to join the TPP negotiations and what a potential timeframe for participation may be.", "The recent participation of Canada, Japan, and Mexico greatly expanded the size of the TPP in terms of U.S. trade. Using trade figures from 2013, the share of U.S. goods and services trade encompassed by TPP partners increased from 5% to 31% with the addition of Canada and Mexico, increased further to 37% with the addition of Japan, and though unlikely in the near future, expansion of the potential agreement to all of APEC would increase its share of U.S. trade to 57% ( Figure 3 ).", "Japan's entry into the agreement is particularly significant. Japan is the third-largest economy in the world, the fourth-largest U.S. trading partner, and not party to an existing U.S. FTA, as opposed to Canada and Mexico, which are part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Japan is now the second-largest country participating in TPP, both in terms of population (127 million) and GDP ($4.6 trillion). Some analysts argue that Japan's participation in the TPP negotiations has attracted other Asia-Pacific countries and will help achieve the goal of membership expansion. For example, South Korea first expressed potential interest in joining in 2013, a few months after Japan became an official member of the negotiations. Others contend that Japan's entry may have complicated the negotiation process, adding a significant economic counterweight to the United States and perhaps slowing the overall speed of the negotiations.

In total, there are more than 180 preferential trade agreements among Asia-Pacific countries, most of which do not include the United States. The United States Trade Representative (USTR), as well as certain stakeholder groups, view the proposed TPP FTA as an opportunity for the United States to address this rapid rise in preferential trade agreements, with a goal of ensuring that U.S. goods and services remain competitive in the region and that the United States plays a central role in developing a framework for future regional free trade negotiations.

As the largest country in the TPP, both in terms of population and GDP, U.S. trade with TPP partners accounts for much of the trade among TPP countries. Specifically, trade among the NAFTA countries, Canada, Mexico, and the United States, was over $1.2 trillion in 2012\u2014over half of all intra-TPP trade. U.S. trade with Japan, the third largest bilateral trade partnership in the TPP, accounted for nearly $200 billion of total intra-TPP trade. See Table A-2 in the Appendix for intra-TPP trade data for each TPP country.", "Even larger than intra-TPP trade, however, is TPP country trade with the other APEC members not currently party to the TPP negotiations. This goods trade amounted to over $2.7 trillion in 2014. Trade between China and the TPP countries, nearly $1.5 trillion, made up over half of all TPP country trade with the other APEC members. In terms of goods trade, expansion of the TPP to include China and the other APEC members would encompass more TPP country trade than expanding the agreement in any other region including the European Union ($1.3 trillion) and Latin America ($459 billion)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investment Flows", "paragraphs": ["The proposed TPP FTA, like previous U.S. FTAs, is expected to include provisions on investment. As mentioned above, the FTAs the United States already has in place with six of the TPP countries (Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Peru, and Singapore) include investment provisions. However, no other bilateral investment treaties (BITs) exist between the United States and the remaining TPP countries. The most recent available investment data is through 2013.", "Nearly all of the top U.S. investment partners in the TPP are covered by an existing FTA and the stock (accumulated value) of U.S. investment in these countries exceeds their investments in the United States ( Figure 14 ) . Japan, however, does not have an existing U.S. FTA, and uniquely among TPP countries, the stock of Japanese investment in the United States is more than double the stock of U.S. investment in Japan. As discussed above, this pattern can also be seen in U.S.-Japanese services trade through affiliates.", "TPP-U.S. FDI flows in 2013 show that Japan and Canada were the largest U.S. investment partners accounting for 34% and 30% of total inward and outward U.S. FDI with TPP countries. Australia (13%), Singapore (12%), and Mexico (7%) were the other top U.S. investment partners among TPP countries ( Table 7 ). Flows of FDI can vary significantly from year to year. From 2012 to 2013 outward U.S. direct investment in TPP countries declined slightly from $90 billion to $86 billion, while inward U.S. FDI from TPP countries nearly doubled from $37 billion to $69 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tariff Levels", "paragraphs": ["TPP negotiating partners are striving for a high standard and comprehensive FTA that addresses trade barriers beyond tariffs. Traditional tariff barriers, however, still exist among TPP members and can be an impediment to expanded trade. While tariffs are only one form of potential trade barriers, they are relatively easy to compare and can provide a general picture of a country's openness to trade.", "As all TPP members are members of the WTO, one relevant tariff to consider is the applied most-favored nation (MFN) tariff. The MFN concept is a WTO principle that requires member countries to non-discriminately apply their tariff rates to other members. The average applied MFN tariff then is simply the average, among all products, of the tariff rates actually applied to other countries, as opposed to bound rates, which are essentially caps, or the maximum level that may be imposed under WTO commitments. Often, applied rates are well below bound rates. For example, Chile's average MFN applied rate is 6% compared to an average bound rate of 25%. Both levels are important and the proposed TPP FTA aims to eventually reduce and eliminate tariffs at both the applied and bound level.", "The average applied MFN tariffs vary greatly among TPP countries. Vietnam has an average rate of almost 10%, while Singapore charges tariffs on so few items that it has an average rate of 0%. Figure 15 below shows the average MFN tariffs for TPP participants as reported in the most recent WTO tariff profiles. Per capita GDP, a rough measure of economic development, is graphed on the right axis, revealing that, in general, the more highly developed TPP countries tend to be those with the lower tariff levels. Hence, movement towards zero tariff rates will require a greater reduction in applied tariffs among the less developed members.", "Although average tariff rates among all products are below 10% for TPP countries, some industrial and agricultural sectors have relatively high tariffs. For example, the average applied MFN tariff rate on Canadian dairy products is 249%, even though the overall Canadian average applied MFN tariff rate is only 4.2%. Table 8 below provides the product category with the highest tariff rate for each TPP country. These include dairy, clothing, beverages/tobacco, sugar, and electrical machinery. ", "Uniquely among the TPP members, Chile and Singapore have little variation in tariffs at the industry level. Singapore has an average tariff of 0% in every category except beverages and tobacco. Chile has a higher but still uniform tariff structure, with an average tariff of 6% in all but one product group.", "When considering tariff rates, it is useful to consider the overall importance of trade in a nation's economy. Trade-to-GDP ratios, shown in Figure 16 provide one such measure. The figure shows a great range in trade-to-GDP ratios among TPP countries. Singapore's trade-to-GDP ratio of over 366% implies that the country's imports and exports are nearly four times larger than its total domestic production of goods and services. Such a high figure likely reflects Singapore's importance as a regional shipping hub, re-exporting products that merely pass through its borders, as well as its importance in international supply chains, perhaps domestically producing only a portion of the components in the manufactured goods it exports. Given this significant reliance on international trade, it is less surprising that Singapore would have such a low average applied tariff level. The United States, the TPP country with the largest population and economy, and, hence, the largest domestic market, has a trade-to-GDP ratio of 30%, indicating that trade accounts for a smaller share of economic activity in the United States than in any other the TPP countries. The United States, however, has one of the lowest average applied tariff rates among the TPP countries, suggesting that the importance of trade in a country's economy is not the only determinant of its openness to trade. The variation in trade-to-GDP ratios is another indicator of the diversity among the TPP countries, which may ultimately be reflected in their trade policy priorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership FTA would be a significant FTA for the United States and could eventually become the platform for a broader Asia-Pacific free trade area, an area that encompasses 40% of the world's people and over half of global production. TPP would be the largest U.S. FTA based on trade flows, and with the entry of Japan, a significant share of U.S.-TPP trade is not currently covered by an FTA. Due to the great diversity among the TPP participants, there may be challenges in achieving a comprehensive and high standard agreement. TPP countries vary in terms of population, economic development, and geography.", "In goods and services trade, Canada is the top U.S. partner among TPP countries, with Mexico and Japan as the next largest partners in most categories. In terms of FDI flows, Japan was the largest U.S. partner among TPP countries in 2013. Australia, Malaysia, and Singapore are the other top U.S. partners in merchandise trade among TPP countries, and Australia and Singapore are also major U.S. partners in services trade and investment flows among TPP countries. Vietnam, given its significant population and quickly growing economy, may hold the greatest potential for increased economic relations with the United States moving forward. Malaysia, Mexico, Chile, and Peru also represent growing economies that have populations above 20 million. Chile, Peru, and Mexico's potential for increased U.S. economic exchange due to the TPP, however, may be somewhat lessened given their existing FTAs with the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}}
