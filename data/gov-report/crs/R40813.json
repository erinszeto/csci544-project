Among the six gases that have generally been the primary focus of concern, methane is the second-most abundant, accounting for approximately 8% of total U.S. GHG emissions in 2008. Methane is emitted from a number of sources. The most significant are agriculture (both animal digestive systems and manure management); landfills; oil and gas production, refining, and distribution; and coal mining.", "As policymakers consider options to reduce GHG emissions, methane capture projects offer an array of possible reduction opportunities, many of which utilize proven technologies. Methane capture projects (e.g., landfill gas projects, anaerobic digestion systems) restrict the release of methane into the atmosphere. The methane captured can be used for energy or flared. Methane capture challenges differ depending on the source. Most methane capture technologies face obstacles to implementation, including marginal economics in many cases, restricted pipeline access, and various legal issues.", "Some of the leading methane capture options under discussion include market-based emission control programs, carbon offsets, emission performance standards, and maintaining existing programs and incentives. At present, methane capture technologies are supported by tax incentives in some cases, by research and demonstration programs in others, by regulation in the case of the largest landfills, and by voluntary programs. Congress could decide to address methane capture in a number of different ways, including (1) determining the role of methane capture in energy and environmental legislation; (2) determining whether methane capture should be addressed on an industry-by-industry basis; and (3) determining if current methane capture initiatives will be further advanced with legislative action regardless of other facets of the environmental policy debate. What role methane capture would play in prospective regulations to control GHGs is among the issues that Congress faces.", "A few government programs have supported the capture of methane to mitigate climate change. The Methane-to-Markets Partnership, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is an international initiative to reduce global methane emissions.

These strategies and related issues are discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Market-Based Emission Control Programs", "paragraphs": ["One option for policymakers is to include methane emission sources as covered entities in a market-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emission control program. Market-based mechanisms that limit GHG emissions can be divided into two types: those that focus on quantity control (e.g., a cap-and-trade program) and those that focus on price control (e.g., emissions fees, often called a carbon tax). Although each approach has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, both would place a price on methane emissions from covered sources. To the extent that they are able, covered entities (those subject to the cap or fee) would likely pass the emissions price through to consumers. For example, if solid waste landfills were subject to a cap or fee based on methane emissions, the landfill operators would likely raise the price of waste disposal to account for the new cost of emissions. Economic theory suggests that a higher waste disposal price would provide a market incentive for consumers to generate less waste, thus decreasing landfill methane emissions. ", "Cap-and-trade and carbon tax proposals in the 111 th Congress generally did not apply to methane emissions from the primary sources of such emissions. The main rationale for excluding some of these groups involved the administrative costs of covering them under an emissions program. As Table 1 indicates, the number of methane emission sources is relatively large compared to their total contribution to U.S. GHG emissions. This is particularly the case for methane emissions from the agriculture sector. ", "Although an even larger number of sources (e.g., industries, automobiles, buildings) generate CO 2 emissions, the vast majority of CO 2 emissions can be addressed by subjecting a relatively small number of entities to an emissions cap. This opportunity exists for CO 2 emissions, because policymakers could apply the emissions cap upstream of the actual emissions, typically where the emission inputs are produced or enter the U.S. economy. Under this approach, policymakers could address CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and non-energy uses\u2014in aggregate 82% of U.S. GHG emissions\u2014by covering fewer than 2,500 entities. For most methane sources, particularly in the agriculture sector, an analogous opportunity does not exist.", "In addition, some of the source categories identified in Table 1 may be more amenable to emissions coverage than others. For example, roughly 25% of the methane emissions from natural gas systems comes from field production, which may be impractical to monitor and measure accurately. The remaining 75% primarily involves accidental releases sometimes referred to as fugitive emissions. Landfill methane may offer fewer challenges in terms of measurement, but the largest landfills are already reducing methane emissions pursuant to landfill gas reduction requirements established by the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq .).

A carbon offset is a measurable reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of GHG emissions from an emission source not covered by a cap-and-trade system. Most of the cap-and-trade proposals offered in the 111 th Congress allowed offsets (under varying conditions) as a compliance alternative. ", "Offsets would likely make an emissions program more cost-effective by (1) providing an incentive for non-regulated sources to generate emission reductions and (2) expanding emission compliance opportunities for regulated entities. The main concern with offset projects is whether or not they represent real emission reductions. For offsets to be real, a ton of CO 2 -equivalent emissions reduced from an offset project should equate to a ton emitted from a capped source, such as a smokestack or exhaust pipe, and would not have occurred without the regulatory incentive. This objective presents challenges because some offset projects are difficult to measure.", "However, some methane capture projects, such as those from landfills or coal mines, are generally considered to be of higher quality (more credible) than other offset types. These projects are relatively easy to measure and verify, and in many cases would likely not occur if not for the financing provided by an offset market. Therefore, the challenge of proving \"additionality\" is easier to overcome. ", "The advantage some methane capture projects have over other GHG mitigation activities may spur policymakers to control these methane releases directly (via some of the options discussed), instead of encouraging abatement through an offset market. Moreover, allowing certain activities as offsets, while imposing emission controls or caps on others, may raise issues of fairness. For example, why should specific GHG emission sources, such as electricity generators, be capped while other sources, such as landfill or animal feedlot methane, have the potential to generate financial gain for owners and/or operators through the offset market?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emission Performance Standards", "paragraphs": ["Another option for policymakers is to require emission performance standards for particular methane emission sources. This approach has historically represented the core of U.S. federal air pollution policy. New legislation would not be required to pursue the standards approach. The ability to limit methane emissions already exists under various Clean Air Act authorities that Congress has enacted, a point underlined by the Supreme Court in an April 2007 decision, Massachusetts v. EPA . Although the current EPA Administrator has stated a preference for controlling GHG emissions through new legislation, the agency has begun to take actions that could lead to GHG emission performance standards from particular sources.", "Pursuant to Clean Air Act authority, EPA would achieve emission reductions by setting emission performance standards on each source of pollution, or requiring that sources use a particular type of technology, such as the \"best available control technology.\" Although emission performance standards have proven to be effective through decades of experience, source-by-source regulation often cannot achieve, by itself, a desired emission reduction target at the least collective cost. Moreover, performance standards can be difficult to adjust as circumstances (e.g., technologies) change. On the other hand, they may be less expensive where measurement, administrative, or transaction costs are high relative to emission control costs. This approach may be a practical option for certain specific sources of methane emissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintain Existing Programs/Incentives", "paragraphs": ["As discussed later in this report, the federal government currently supports several programs that stimulate methane capture. In addition to these initiatives, which are generally voluntary in nature, since 1996 the Clean Air Act has imposed air emission standards on large solid waste landfills. However, as discussed below, the vast majority of landfills are not covered under the 1996 standards, and there is room to increase the amount of methane captured from solid waste landfills. Moreover, the primary objective of these standards is to reduce the hazardous air pollutants and non-methane organic compounds contained in landfill gas, not to reduce methane emissions for climate-related reasons. Regardless, as mentioned above, the existing Clean Air Act authorities could be used to address a wider universe of methane sources, for the express purpose of controlling GHG emissions, or, as in the case of landfills, for multiple purposes. ", "Because methane can be used as an energy source, the existing marketplace provides some incentive to capture methane for this purpose. If a GHG emission control program were implemented, such a program would increase this incentive by raising the price of traditional high-carbon energy sources (e.g., coal) relative to captured methane.

In general, large amounts of organic waste and high levels of moisture in a landfill lead to greater gas production. ", "Landfill gas is captured at the nation's largest landfills. A 1996 Clean Air Act regulation known as the \"Landfill Gas Rule\" established New Source Performance Standards and Guidelines that require landfills with a 2.5 million metric ton design capacity that accepted waste after November 8, 1987, to capture and burn the gas.

The latter group, numbering in the tens of thousands of sites, poses a particular challenge. Often, there is no responsible party who might implement a methane collection system if the site's original owner is no longer in business. At other sites (e.g., sites owned by local governments), there may be no continuing stream of revenue to support installation and operation of the necessary equipment, since the landfill has closed.

Methane is captured through a series of vertical wells, horizontal boreholes, or gob wells drilled into the mine before or after mining operations. A sizeable portion of the methane captured from degasification systems can be injected into a pipeline directly for energy purposes. Enhanced degasification uses the same approach as degasification systems, but has the capacity to extract lower-quality methane that must be cleaned and upgraded to meet \"pipeline quality\" gas criteria. Ventilation air methane (VAM) systems flush air into underground mines to keep methane concentration levels at or below 1%.

Older leases may not clearly specify whether the owner of the coal rights is also the owner of the coalbed methane. Ownership may lie with the owner(s) of the coal rights, owner(s) of the oil and gas rights, or surface owner(s).
