Agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within the Department of Health and Human Services, among others, have announced changes to their processing of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests due to the pandemic.", "Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways. First, certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration; FOIA requests are to be expedited as soon as practicable in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need. Second, processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave.", "This In Brief report provides an overview of the typical FOIA request process and usual conditions for requesting expedited processing of a request.

Conversely, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has adopted a contrasting policy, saying that CDC would not be able to respond to mailed FOIA requests and that requests should be placed electronically. These examples of differing policies, among others examples not mentioned, when combined with agencies' adoption of additional telework flexibilities , raise questions about how agencies will be responding to FOIA requests in the near future.", "This report provides an overview of the FOIA request process and actual and potential FOIA request processing changes within federal government agencies as a result of COVID-19."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Processing a FOIA Request", "paragraphs": ["FOIA does not require requests for agency information to be submitted in a particular format, only that the request reasonably describes the records sought and complies with agency regulations. Most agencies accept requests via mail, email, web form, or fax. The statute also requires the affirmative disclosure of certain categories of agency information, such as \"substantive rules of general applicability,\" \"rules of procedure,\" and, since 2016, records requested three or more times.", "While the text of FOIA does not specifically dictate the method in which the public must request information from an agency, FOIA does prescribe how an agency is to respond to the request. From an administrative perspective, FOIA directs the amount of time an agency has to respond to a request, defines whether and how an agency may recoup costs for providing services in response to a request, and provides nine instances where an agency may exempt information from public disclosure. ", "After an agency receives a request, the agency is to inform the requester of its receipt. Generally, an agency is to respond to a correctly routed, simple request within 20 days with a determination of the scope of the documents the agency will produce and any exemptions it will apply to withhold records or information. Complex or incorrectly routed requests may be subject to additional days of processing, per the statute (5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7552(a)(6)). Also, agencies managing backlog s of FOIA requests do not always process requests within the statutory period. When completed, a written response may provide the information requested or some of the information requested with redactions per one of FOIA's nine exemptions, inform the requester that the agency does not have responsive records, or deny a request entirely due to one of the nine exemptions. Requesters may administratively appeal an agency's adverse decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "COVID-19 Considerations for Locating Information", "paragraphs": ["Government information requests through FOIA may be impacted by COVID-19 in two ways: (1) certain types of information related to the outbreak may be eligible for expedited consideration; and (2) processes for locating information may change due to employees working remotely or on administrative leave."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expedited Processing of Requests", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7552(a)(6)(E), processing of FOIA requests is to be expedited as soon as practicable in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need.

There are many different officials at these agencies who work hard every day to make sure that the FOIA works. There are the FOIA professionals who search for and process records in response to FOIA requests, FOIA Contacts and FOIA Public Liaisons who work with FOIA requesters to answer questions and resolve concerns, and Chief FOIA Officers who oversee their agency's compliance with the FOIA.", "Because of the decentralized FOIA process at federal agencies, multiple physical and digital systems and many people may be involved in processing a single request. However, given the work flexibilities at many agencies due to COVID-19, some or all of the members of an agency's FOIA team may currently be working offsite.

Six of the identified agencies have additional allowances for expediting requests: U.S. Air Force, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Labor, Department of Veterans Affairs, National Archives and Records Administration, and Office of Government Information Services. Of the six agencies that established additional allowances for expediting requests, five permit expediting cases where due process rights would be impacted, four permit expediting cases where there exist possible questions affecting public confidence in the federal government's integrity, one permits expediting due to humanitarian needs, and one permits expediting at the discretion of the agency's FOIA Officer.
