Recently, money launderers have increasingly turned to a new technology to conceal the origins of illegally obtained proceeds: virtual currency. Virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and Ripple are digital representations of value that, like ordinary currency, function as media of exchange, units of account, and stores of value. However, unlike ordinary currencies, virtual currencies are not legal tender, meaning they cannot be used to pay taxes and creditors need not accept them as payments for debt. While virtual currency enthusiasts tout their technological promise, a number of commentators have contended that the anonymity offered by these new financial instruments makes them an attractive vehicle for money laundering. Law enforcement officials, regulators, and courts have accordingly grappled with how virtual currencies fit into a federal anti-money laundering (AML) regime designed principally for traditional financial institutions.", "The federal AML regime consists of two general categories of laws and regulations. First, federal law requires a range of \"financial institutions\" to abide by a variety of AML program, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements. Second, federal law criminalizes money laundering and various forms of related conduct.", "Over the past decade, federal prosecutors and regulators have pursued a number of cases involving the application of these laws to virtual currencies. Specifically, federal prosecutors have brought money laundering charges against the creators of online marketplaces that allowed their users to exchange virtual currency for illicit goods and services. In one of these prosecutions, a federal district court held that transactions involving Bitcoin can serve as the predicate for money laundering charges. Federal prosecutors have also pursued charges against the developers of certain virtual currency payment systems allegedly designed to facilitate illicit transactions and launder the proceeds of criminal activity. Specifically, prosecutors charged these developers with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses. In adjudicating the second category of charges, courts have concluded that the relevant virtual currency payment systems were \"unlicensed money transmitting businesses,\" rejecting the argument that the relevant criminal prohibition applies only to money transmitters that facilitate cash transactions. Finally, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)\u2014the bureau within the Treasury Department responsible for administering the principal federal AML statute\u2014has pursued a number of administrative enforcement actions against virtual currency exchangers, assessing civil penalties for failure to implement sufficient AML programs and report suspicious transactions.", "As these prosecutions and enforcement actions demonstrate, virtual currencies have a number of features that make them attractive to criminals. Specifically, commentators have noted that money launderers are attracted to the anonymity, ease of cross-border transfer, lack of clear regulations, and settlement finality that accompanies virtual currency transactions. Several bills introduced in the 116th Congress are aimed at addressing these challenges. These bills would, among other things, commission agency analyses of the use of virtual currencies for illicit activities and clarify FinCEN's statutory powers and duties. Commentators have also identified legal uncertainty as an additional challenge facing prosecutors, regulators, and participants in virtual currency transactions. Moreover, a number of observers have argued that existing AML regulations are likely to stifle innovation by virtual currency developers.

However, unlike ordinary currency, virtual currencies are not legal tender, meaning they cannot be used to pay taxes and creditors need not accept them as payments for debt. According to their proponents, virtual currencies (1) have the potential to offer cheaper and faster transactions than traditional bank-centric payment networks, (2) provide inflation-resistant alternatives to traditional fiat currencies, and (3) often involve promising new technologies (such as blockchain technology) that will spur innovation across a variety of fields. However, other commentators have argued that the anonymity offered by certain decentralized virtual currencies\u2014that is, virtual currencies that are not issued or maintained by a central organization\u2014makes them an attractive vehicle for money laundering. These observers have contended that criminals often use such virtual currencies not only to buy and sell illicit goods and services, but also to launder illegally obtained fiat currencies.

An official from the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has similarly indicated that virtual currencies have been \"exploited to support billions of dollars of . . . suspicious activity.\" While such figures represent only a fraction of both global money laundering and virtual currency transaction volume, government officials have identified virtual currencies as a growth industry for money launderers that presents regulators and law enforcement with unique challenges.", "This report provides a general overview of the application of federal anti-money laundering (AML) law to virtual currencies.

Specifically, the guidance explained that users of virtual currencies\u2014that is, persons who obtain virtual currencies to purchase goods or services\u2014are not MSBs because they are not involved in money transmission. By contrast, FinCEN indicated that virtual currency administrators (persons \"engaged as a business\" in putting a virtual currency into circulation and who have the authority to withdraw such currency from circulation) and exchangers (persons \"engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency\") may be \"money transmitters\" and, by extension, MSBs.

Specifically, the defendants argued that because Section 1960 does not define the term \"money transmitting business,\" it must \"borrow\" the definition of that term in Section 5330\u2014the BSA provision establishing federal registration requirements for \"money transmitting businesses.\" The defendants further reasoned that (1) Section 5330 provides that an entity is a \"money transmitting business\" only if it must file currency transaction reports (CTRs), and (2) businesses that do not facilitate cash transactions need not file CTRs. Accordingly, under the defendants' theory, a business like e-Gold that does not facilitate cash transactions does not qualify as a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 5330 and (by extension) Section 1960.

First, the court rejected the defendants' contention that Section 1960 must \"borrow\" Section 5330's definition of \"money transmitting business.\" The court rejected this argument on the grounds that Section 1960 contains its own definition of the term \"money transmitting\" and does not reflect an intent to \"borrow\" the definition of \"money transmitting business\" from Section 5330. The court further explained that because e-Gold was a business engaged in \"money transmitting\" as defined by Section 1960\u2014that is, \"transferring funds on behalf of the public\"\u2014it was a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 1960. ", "Second, the court evaluated whether e-Gold also qualified as a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 5330\u2014an issue that remained relevant because of the federal government's charge that the defendants violated Section 1960 by violating Section 5330's registration requirements . The court concluded that e-Gold was indeed a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 5330, rejecting the defendants' argument that e-Gold did not fall within that category because it was not required to file CTRs. Specifically, the court rejected the argument that a business is required to file CTRs only if it facilitates cash transactions. Instead, the court explained that because the statute imposing CTR obligations imposes such obligations when money transmitting businesses facilitate cash transactions (as opposed to if they facilitate such transactions), all money transmitting businesses have a continuing obligation to file CTRs \"in the eventuality that they ever are involved\" in a reportable cash transaction. The court accordingly concluded that because e-Gold was required to file CTRs and satisfied the other elements of the relevant statutory definition, e-Gold was a \"money transmitting business\" under Section 5330 even though it did not process cash transactions.
