The Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) was established in 1920 and covers only employees hired before 1984. Participants in the CSRS do not pay Social Security payroll taxes and they do not earn Social Security benefits. For a worker retiring after 30 years of federal service, a CSRS annuity will be equal to 56.25% of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of basic pay.", "The Social Security Amendments of 1983 (P.L. 98-21) required federal employees hired after 1983 to participate in Social Security. Because the CSRS was not designed to coordinate with Social Security, Congress directed the development of a new retirement plan for federal workers hired after 1983. The result was the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-335). The FERS has three elements: (1) Social Security, (2) the FERS basic retirement annuity and FERS supplement, and (3) the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).", "The amount of the FERS basic retirement annuity is determined by three factors: (1) the salary base, (2) the accrual rate, and (3) years of service. The salary base is the average of the worker's highest three consecutive years of pay. Under FERS, the benefit accrual rate is 1.0% per year of service, or 1.1% for workers retiring at the age of 62 or later with 20 or more years of service. A worker with 30 years of service retiring at the age of 62 will receive a FERS pension equal to 33% of the average of his or her highest three consecutive years of pay, or about 32% of final annual salary.", "The TSP is a defined contribution retirement plan similar to the 401(k) plans provided by many employers in the private sector. The income that a retired worker receives from the TSP will depend on the balance in his or her account. In 2015, employees covered by FERS or CSRS can contribute up to $18,000 to the TSP. Employees aged 50 or older can contribute an additional $6,000. Contributions of up to 5% of pay made by workers under FERS are matched by the federal government. Workers covered by CSRS can contribute to the TSP, but they receive no matching contributions.", "The TSP is a key element of the FERS, especially for workers at the upper ranges of the federal pay scale. The Social Security benefit formula is designed to replace a greater share of income for low-wage workers than for high-wage workers. The FERS basic annuity will replace about 32% of final salary for an employee retiring at the age of 62 with 30 years of service. Higher-wage federal workers need to contribute a greater percentage of pay to the TSP to reach the same level of income replacement as lower-paid workers can achieve from just the FERS retirement annuity and Social Security. At an annual rate of return of 6.0%, income from the TSP can replace about 33% of final pay for a federal employee who contributes 10% of pay over 30 years."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Federal employees participate in one of two retirement systems.

(See Table 7 .)", "The estimates displayed in Table 6 and Table 7 also show that a worker who participates in the TSP only during the 20 years immediately preceding retirement will achieve a much lower income replacement rate than an employee who participates for 30 years. Table 6 shows that an employee contributing 5% of pay and earning a 6% annual rate of return would be able to replace 13.2% of final pay from his or her TSP account. This is 20 percentage points lower than the 32.2% replacement rate achieved by an employee who contributes 5% of pay over 30 years and earns a 6% annual return. Contributing 10% of pay over 20 years at an annual investment return of 6.0% would raise the employee's replacement rate to 19.8%; however, this is 15 percentage points below the 34.8% replacement rate achieved by an employee who contributes 10% of pay over a 30-year period, assuming a 6.0% rate of return.", "At an 8.0% annual rate of return, an employee contributing 5% of pay each year can achieve a replacement rate of 16.0% from the TSP.

For a federal employee who begins his or her career in 2015 and retires at the age of 62 after 30 years of service, the FERS basic annuity will provide first-year retirement income equal to 31.7% of the worker's final annual salary. For a worker who begins his or her career in 2013 and retires at the age of 62 with 20 years of service, the basic FERS retirement annuity would replace about 21.2% of final earnings, regardless of the GS-level from which he or she retires. In both of these cases, the dollar amount of the annuity will be higher for higher-paid employees, but the replacement rate will be approximately the same, regardless of the employee's final salary level.", "The replacement rate for Social Security benefits, however, declines as a worker's income increases. The percentage of earnings replaced by Social Security is greater for low-wage workers than for high-wage workers. During their years as federal employees covered by FERS, individuals are covered by Social Security. But it may also be the case that the career histories of these federal employees include additional non-federal, Social-Security-covered employment. ", "Based on estimates from the Social Security Administration (SSA), for individuals who retire at the age of 65 in 2014, Social Security benefits would replace about 39.0% of career-average earnings for a \"scaled medium earnings\" hypothetical worker, who has career-average earnings of about $46,787. This earnings profile is similar to a GS-4 federal employee. For a \"scaled high earnings\" hypothetical worker retiring at the age of 65 in 2014, who has career-average earnings of $74,859 and could be compared with a GS-8 federal employee, Social Security benefits would replace about 32.3% of career-average earnings. Finally, GS-12 and GS-15 employees could be compared with a \"steady maximum earnings\" hypothetical worker (with career-average earnings at or above the contribution and benefit base of $117,000 in 2014) for whom Social Security benefits would replace about 25% of $117,000 for retirement at 65 in 2014 ($29,209), based on estimates from SSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workers Who Leave Federal Employment Before Reaching Retirement Age", "paragraphs": ["For employees who switch jobs one or more times over the course of their careers, a defined contribution retirement plan such as the TSP has an advantage over the traditional defined benefit pension in that the value of the accrued benefit can continue to increase until the employee reaches retirement age. All that is required for this to occur is for the employee to refrain from spending any lump-sum distributions that he or she may receive before retiring and for the accrued benefit to remain invested in a tax-deferred retirement account that achieves a total rate of return before retirement that is greater than the rate of inflation.", "Employees who have become vested in a traditional defined benefit pension\u2014including the FERS basic annuity\u2014are legally entitled to the benefit they have earned upon reaching the plan's normal retirement age even if at that time they no longer work for the employer where they earned the pension. In most defined benefit pension plans, including FERS, the annuity is based on the employee's actual earnings during their period of employment with the firm. These salary amounts are not adjusted for inflation between the time the employee leaves the firm and the date of retirement. For example, consider an employee who leaves the federal government for another employer at the age of 40 after 10 years of service in 1993. If this individual's highest three consecutive years of earnings averaged $50,000, he or she would be entitled to an annuity of $5,000 per year beginning at the age of 62. The worker in this example would be eligible to begin receiving the $5,000 annuity at the age of 62 in 2015, 22 years after leaving the federal government.", "In contrast to the example just cited, money held in a defined contribution plan like the TSP can continue to grow throughout an individual's working life, regardless of how often he or she changes jobs. If the employee in the example above had contributed 10% of pay to the TSP each year and the contributions had earned an average rate of return of 6%, the account would have reached a value of approximately $81,000 after 10 years in 1993. If the departing employee were to leave this money invested in the TSP or transfer it to another tax-deferred retirement account, this sum would continue to grow until the employee withdrew the funds.
