The policy interest in mandatory drug testing of individuals who are applying for or receiving UC benefits parallels two larger policy trends. First, some state legislatures have considered drug testing individuals receiving public assistance benefits. While UC is generally considered social insurance (rather than public assistance), the concept of drug testing UC recipients (who are receiving state-financed benefits from a program authorized under state laws) could be interpreted as a potential extension of this state-level interest. Second, over recent years, Congress has considered issues related to UC pro gram integrity, including drug testing, which may be viewed as addressing UC program integrity concerns.", "Under the current interpretation of federal law, and subject to specific exceptions, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) requires states to determine entitlement to benefits under their UC programs based only on facts or causes related to the individual's state of unemployment. Under this reasoning, individuals may be disqualified for UC benefits if they lost their previous job because of illegal drug use. Until recently, the prospective drug testing of UC applicants or beneficiaries has been generally prohibited. However, P.L. 112-96 expanded the breadth of allowable UC drug testing to include prospective drug testing based upon job searches for suitable work in an occupation that regularly conducts drug testing. On October 4, 2019, DOL issued a new final rule on this type of prospective testing after a previous, promulgated rule was repealed using the Congressional Review Act. This new final rule is effective November 4, 2019.", "Stakeholders have made a variety of arguments for and against expanded UC drug testing. Proponents of prospective drug testing cite not only program integrity concerns, but also the importance of job readiness for UC claimants as well as state discretion in matters of UC eligibility and administration. Opponents of the prospective drug testing of UC claimants argue that it would impose additional costs and undermine the fundamental goals of the UC program, which include the timely provision of income replacement to individuals who lost a job through no fault of their own. Some stakeholders also expressed concern that expanded UC drug testing could create barriers to UC benefit receipt among eligible individuals and discourage UC claims filing. Stakeholders have also raised at least two legal concerns with the new final UC drug testing rule: (1) some commenters have argued that the new final rule may violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and (2) some commenters have argued that the new final rule improperly delegates authority to the states to identify occupations that regularly conduct drug testing. Other policy issues to consider related to expanding UC drug testing include administrative concerns, such as state establishment of a drug testing program for UC claimants as well as the potential provision of and funding for drug treatment services.", "For a shorter summary of recent events related to UC drug testing, see CRS Insight IN10909, Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments in States' Ability to Drug Test Unemployment Compensation Applicants and Beneficiaries .

Federal laws and regulations provide some broad guidelines on UC benefit coverage, eligibility, and benefit determination. However, state laws determine the specific parameters, resulting in essentially 53 different UC programs. States administer UC benefits with oversight from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).", "The main objectives of UC are to (1) offer workers income maintenance during periods of unemployment due to lack of work, providing partial wage replacement as an entitlement; (2) help maintain purchasing power and to stabilize the economy; and (3) help prevent dispersal of the employer's trained labor force, skill loss, and the breakdown of labor standards during temporary high levels of unemployment. The UC program attempts to meet these objectives in a number of ways. For example, individuals who receive UC are required to register with the Employment Service and to be able, available and searching for suitable work. ", "Under federal law, all states currently have the option to disqualify individuals for UC benefits if they lost their job because of illegal drug use. In addition, there has been recent and sustained congressional interest in prohibiting individuals who are engaged in unlawful use of controlled substances (whether or not such use was the cause of unemployment) from receiving UC benefits. In the 112 th Congress, states were given the option to require drug testing for UC applicants under specific and limited circumstances. A portion of these circumstances required that DOL issue a rule listing occupations that regularly require drug testing. On October 4, 2019, the new rule was finalized after a previous, promulgated rule was repealed using the Congressional Review Act. This new final rule is effective November 4, 2019. Thus, after this date, nothing in federal UC law would prohibit states from drug testing UC applicants who are searching for employment solely in those occupations listed in this final rule.", "The issue of drug testing in the UC program may be viewed in the context of two larger policy trends.

Furthermore, P.L. 112-96 clarified that drug testing may be included among UC program integrity measures to ensure that benefits are not distributed to individuals who are involved in illegal drug use, presuming that this behavior may impede prospects for future employment.", "This report provides general background on issues related to UC benefits and illegal drug use; discusses recent developments related to the expansion of UC drug testing under state and federal laws as well as federal regulation; and analyzes selected policy considerations relevant to UC drug testing, including arguments for and against expanded drug testing, potential legal concerns, and administrative considerations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "UC Eligibility and Disqualification", "paragraphs": ["The UC program generally does not provide UC benefits to the self-employed, individuals who are unable to work, or individuals who do not have a recent earnings history.

An ineligible individual is prohibited from receiving UC benefits under a state's laws until the condition serving as the basis for ineligibility no longer exists. UC eligibility is generally determined on a weekly basis. State UC programs may also disqualify individuals who apply for UC benefits. In this situation, which is distinct from ineligibility, an individual has no rights to UC benefits until she or he requalifies under a state's laws, usually by serving a predetermined disqualification period or obtaining new employment.

Representative Kevin Brady, a supporter of the measure, argued that although the intent of the UC drug testing provisions in P.L. 112-96 was to provide states the ability to determine how to best implement drug testing programs, the final regulation narrowed the law to circumstances in which testing is legally required (rather than the broader definition of generally required by employer) and removed state discretion in conducting drug testing in their UC programs.

Governmental conduct generally has been found to constitute a \"search\" for Fourth Amendment purposes where it infringes \"an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable.\" The Court has held on a number of occasions that government-administered drug tests are searches under the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, the constitutionality of a law that requires an individual to pass a drug test to receive UC likely would turn on whether the drug test is reasonable under the circumstances.", "Whether a search is reasonable depends on the nature of the search and its underlying governmental purpose. Reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment generally requires individualized suspicion, which often, particularly in the criminal law enforcement context, takes the form of a court-issued warrant based on probable cause that a legal violation has occurred. The purpose of a warrant is to ensure that government-conducted searches are legally authorized, rather than \"random or arbitrary acts of government actors.\" However, the Court has held that a warrant is not \"essential\" under all circumstances to make a search reasonable, particularly when \"the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search.\" ", "The Court has noted, for instance, that \"the probable-cause standard ... may be unsuited to determining the reasonableness of administrative searches\" that are conducted for purposes unrelated to criminal investigations. For these noncriminal, administrative searches, courts typically employ a reasonable suspicion standard, which is \"a lesser standard than probable cause.\" The Court has \"deliberately avoided reducing [the reasonable suspicion standard] to a neat set of legal rules,\" but at a minimum, the standard requires that, in light of the \"totality of the circumstances,\" there is a \"particularized and objective basis,\" beyond \"a mere hunch,\" that a search would uncover wrongdoing.", "Additionally, while a search generally must be based on \"some quantum of individualized suspicion\" to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the Court has held that \"a showing of individualized suspicion is not a constitutional floor.\" \"In limited circumstances,\" when a search imposes a minor intrusion on an individual's privacy interests, while furthering an \"important government interest\" that would be undermined by requiring individualized suspicion, \"a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion.\" ", "The Court has recognized an exception to the typical individualized suspicion requirement \"when special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement, make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable,\" and the government's needs outweigh privacy interests invaded by a search. The Court noted that \"[o]ur precedents establish that the proffered special need for drug testing must be substantial\u00e2\u0080\u0094important enough to override the individual's acknowledged privacy interest.\" The Court has recognized two categories of \"special needs\" substantial enough to justify suspicionless drug testing: in the employment context, where individuals perform activities involving matters of public safety, and the public school setting, involving children in the government's care.", "In instances where the government argues that \"drug tests 'fall within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches',\" courts determine whether such searches are reasonable under the circumstances by balancing the competing interests of the government conducting the search and the private individuals who are subject to the search. Thus, even if special needs exist, government-mandated searches could still run afoul of the Fourth Amendment if they are excessively intrusive or otherwise significantly invade the privacy interests of affected individuals.", "The Court has assessed the constitutionality of governmental drug testing programs in a number of contexts. Three opinions in the employment context seem especially relevant to the question of whether a mandatory, suspicionless drug test for the receipt of UC would be considered an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Additionally, two lower court cases, in which state laws that established mandatory, suspicionless drug testing programs as a condition to receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) (formerly welfare) benefits were successfully challenged on Fourth Amendment grounds, could provide relevant insight into how future courts might assess the constitutionality of a UC drug testing program.

Additionally, the applicable testing procedures were minimally invasive on privacy interests because employees were provided advanced notice of testing procedures; urine samples were only tested for specified drugs and were not used for any other purposes; urine samples were provided in private stalls; employees were not required to share personal medical information except to licensed medical professionals, and only if tests were positive; and the testing procedures were \"highly accurate.\" Therefore, the Court held that the suspicionless drug testing program was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. ", "In contrast, the Court in Chandler v. Miller struck down a Georgia statute requiring candidates for certain elective offices be tested for illicit drug use. The majority opinion noted several factors distinguishing the Georgia law from drug testing requirements upheld in earlier cases. First, there was no \"fear or suspicion\" of generalized illicit drug use by state elected officials. The Court noted that, while not a necessary constitutional prerequisite, evidence of historical drug abuse by the group targeted for testing might \"shore up an assertion of special need for a suspicionless general search program.\" In addition, the law did not serve as a \"credible means\" to detect or deter drug abuse by public officials because the timing of the test was largely controlled by the candidate rather than the state and legal compliance could be achieved by a mere temporary abstinence. Finally, the \"relentless scrutiny\" to which candidates for public office are subjected made suspicionless testing less necessary than in the case of safety-sensitive positions beyond the public view. The Chandler Court went on to stress that searches conducted without individualized suspicion generally must be linked to a degree of public safety \"important enough to override the individual's acknowledged privacy interest\" to be reasonable. At least outside the context of drug testing related to children in the government's care, the Chandler Court seemed to indicate that \"where ... public safety is not genuinely in jeopardy, the Fourth Amendment precludes the suspicionless search, no matter how conveniently arranged.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lower Court Cases Involving TANF Drug Testing", "paragraphs": ["The federal district court ruling in Marchwinski v. Howard , which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit as a result of an evenly divided en banc panel, involved a state program requiring the suspicionless drug testing of TANF applicants. The district court in Marchwinski stated that \"the Chandler Court made clear that suspicionless drug testing is unconstitutional if there is no showing of a special need [] that ... [is] grounded in public safety.\" According to the Marchwinski court, the state's \"primary justification ... for instituting mandatory drug testing is to move more families from welfare to work.\" This legislative objective, however, is not \"a special need grounded in public safety\" that would justify a suspicionless search, in the court's view. The court also noted that allowing the state to conduct suspicionless drug tests in this context would provide a justification for conducting suspicionless drug tests of all parents of children who receive governmental benefits of any kind, such as student loans and a public education, which \"would set a dangerous precedent.\" Thus, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the \"Plaintiffs have established a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their Fourth Amendment claim.\" The state subsequently agreed to halt suspicionless drug testing.", "In another TANF case, Lebron v. Secretary, Florida Department of Children and Families , a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit unanimously affirmed a district court's ruling that a mandatory drug testing law applicable to TANF beneficiaries in Florida was unconstitutional. While \"viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the State,\" the panel concluded that \"the State has not demonstrated a substantial special need to carry out the suspicionless search.\" The panel also determined that the state had not provided evidence to support the notion that drug use by TANF recipients was any different than that of the Florida population at-large, and even if it had, this \"drug-testing program is not well designed to identify or deter applicants whose drug use will affect employability, endanger children, or drain public funds.\" The state did not seek en banc review or appeal the panel decision to the Supreme Court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applicability of Case Law to UC Drug Testing", "paragraphs": ["Whether a government drug testing program comports with the Fourth Amendment may depend largely on the program's purpose and scope. Supreme Court precedent indicates that drug testing programs, unrelated to criminal law enforcement, that only authorize testing based on an individualized, reasonable suspicion of drug use\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as through direct observation of an individual's drug impairment by trained personnel at a UC application site\u00e2\u0080\u0094are more likely to comport with the Fourth Amendment. In the absence of suspicion, the Court has held that governmental drug tests must promote \"special needs\" compelling enough to outweigh the privacy interests of the individuals subject to the test. Under current precedent, the Court has only recognized two contexts where \"special needs\" have justified suspicionless drug tests when balanced against the subjects' competing privacy interests: in cases where individuals were employed in occupations involving public safety concerns; and the public school setting , where the government is responsible for the health and safety of children.", "Although not dispositive, Supreme Court case law also suggests that suspicionless drug testing programs imposed on a subset of the population that has a \"demonstrated problem of drug abuse\" may help tilt the balancing test in the government's favor, especially if the testing program is designed to effectively address the problem. Moreover, drug testing programs that require results to be kept confidential to all but a small group of nonlaw enforcement officials, are not conducted for criminal law enforcement purposes, and only minimally affect an individual's life are more likely to be considered reasonable. On the other hand, programs that allow drug test results to be shared, especially with law enforcement, or that otherwise have the potential to negatively impact multiple or significant aspects of an individual's life, may be less likely to be considered reasonable.", "Given this case law, the constitutionality of a UC drug testing program will likely depend on how the program is structured. Additionally, the constitutional analysis might vary as it applies to each of the two categories of UC applicants that states are permitted to test under Section 303 of the Social Security Act\u00e2\u0080\u0094i.e., the \"regularly tested occupation\" and \"previously terminated\" categories. Specifically, questions of whether individualized suspicion might justify testing appears potentially relevant to certain \"previously terminated\" UC applicants.

", "For example, the strength of the evidence tying an individual's termination to illicit drug use might be relevant. If a UC applicant was terminated from his or her previous position because of a criminal drug conviction or because of a failed employer-mandated drug test, there might be more compelling evidence for a reasonable suspicion analysis than if an at-will employee was fired for a number of reasons unrelated to drugs but also, in part, because he or she was rumored to have used illicit drugs outside of work. If a termination was based on the results of an employer-administered drug test, the relative strength of the test results on a reasonable suspicion analysis might be affected by the reliability of the drug test's results, whether or not the test was conducted pursuant to procedures sufficient to ensure urine or blood samples had not been tampered with, and whether or not those who performed the test were adequately trained. A reasonable suspicion analysis might also be affected by the time lapse between the termination and the UC drug test.

Additionally, there are notable differences between (1) individuals applying for UC benefits while searching for jobs in a \"regularly tested occupation\" and who are tested for illicit drugs by UC administrators and (2) individuals who are currently performing or in the final stages of being hired to perform safety-sensitive duties and who are drug tested by an employer. As discussed below, whether a reviewing court would consider these distinctions to be constitutionally significant is unclear. The remainder of this section first analyzes potentially relevant factors associated with how states might define the \"regularly tested occupation\" category, and then assesses the potentially constitutionally relevant distinctions between employer-mandated and UC administrator-mandated drug testing.", "In the absence of individualized suspicion, the Supreme Court has cautioned that \"where ... public safety is not genuinely in jeopardy, the Fourth Amendment precludes the suspicionless search, no matter how conveniently arranged.\" Absent a court recognizing a new category of special needs that may outweigh an individual's privacy interests, states, at a constitutional minimum, would likely need to define the \"regularly tested occupation\" group to encompass only occupations that involve matters of public safety in accordance with the Supreme Court special needs precedent. The \"regularly tested occupations\" category in DOL's 2019 regulation delineates a number of occupations that appear to be in line with those previously upheld under special needs precedent. These include an occupation that requires the employee to carry a firearm and an occupation that is subject to drug testing under Federal Railway Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, or Federal Transit Administration regulations.", "However, the regulations also do not prohibit states from testing for \"[a]n occupation where the State has a factual basis for finding that employers hiring employees in that occupation conduct pre- or post-hire drug testing as a standard eligibility requirement for obtaining or maintaining employment in the occupation.\" As described below, it might be possible for an occupation to fall within the latter category but not comport with current Fourth Amendment precedent.", "Because the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures only apply to governmental action, drug testing imposed by private employers \"not acting as an agent of the Government or with the participation or knowledge of any governmental official \" are completely \"unguarded by Fourth Amendment constraints.\" Consequently, private employers might regularly impose suspicionless drug tests in some occupations that do not involve safety-sensitive special needs because they are not constrained by the Fourth Amendment. However, Fourth Amendment protections would apply to drug tests imposed on the same individuals to the extent they are mandated by a state as part of a UC program. As a result, state programs that require suspicionless drug tests of UC applicants who are suitably employed in occupations that are regularly subject to drug testing by private employers but, nevertheless, are not related to public safety functions in accordance with Supreme Court precedent could potentially run afoul of the Fourth Amendment.

UC beneficiaries, unlike the plaintiffs in Skinner and Von Raab , are not actively performing or directly being considered for employment to perform duties grounded in public safety by the governmental entity that would be administering drug tests tied to the UC program. To the contrary, these individuals would merely be applying for or receiving unemployment benefits while agreeing not to turn down \"suitable work\" as defined by state law. A reviewing court might find this distinction constitutionally significant and, consequently, consider a UC drug testing program as more akin to the TANF drug testing programs addressed by the Marchwinski and Lebron courts than the testing programs upheld in Skinner and Von Raab . Under this line of reasoning, a reviewing court could conclude that, regardless of how it is structured, the underlying purpose of a UC drug testing program is primarily designed \"to promote work ... and conserve resources\" and, consequently, not sufficiently tied to public safety concerns that would warrant a special needs exception to the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Potentially Relevant Factors", "paragraphs": ["Additional factors that a reviewing court might weigh when balancing the government's interest in conducting a drug test and the individual's competing privacy interests include the prevalence of illicit drug use in the cohort of UC applicants who are subject to suspicionless drug testing; how effectively the drug testing program is designed to identify and eliminate illicit drug use; whether procedural safeguards are in place to ensure that sufficiently trained personnel conduct the test, testing samples are protected from contamination, test results are accurate, and the test subject's medical and other personal information are protected; and the extent to which drug test results are shared beyond the UC program and could negatively affect other aspects of an individual's life.

In U.S. Telecom Association v. Federal Communications Commission , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) explained that subdelegations to outside parties are problematic because \"lines of accountability may blur, undermining an important democratic check on government decision-making.\" The D.C. Circuit further observed that subdelegation increases the risk that an outside party may pursue policy goals that are inconsistent with those of the agency and the underlying statute.", "While subdelegation by a federal agency to an outside party is generally prohibited, courts have permitted some outside party input into an agency's decisionmaking. In U.S. Telecom , the D.C. Circuit concluded that outside party input is permissible when it acts as a reasonable condition for granting federal approval, such as the need to obtain a local license or permit; when the outside party is simply providing factual information to a federal agency; and when the outside party is providing advice or policy recommendations to a federal agency that retains final decisionmaking authority.", "In Fund for Animals v. Kempthorne , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) did not improperly subdelegate its authority when it issued an order permitting state fish and wildlife agencies to kill certain migratory birds without a permit to prevent depredations of wildlife and plants. Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the FWS is authorized to make certain determinations involving migratory birds, including when to allow for their hunting, capture, or killing. The plaintiffs in Fund for Animals , a group of individuals and environmental organizations, challenged the depredation order, arguing that the killing of the relevant birds could only be authorized by the FWS and not a state fish and wildlife agency.", "The Second Circuit contended that the depredation order operated as a \"grant of permission\" that was conditioned on a state fish and wildlife agency's determination that a depredation would occur if action were not taken. Citing U.S. Telecom , the court viewed this kind of determination as permissible outside party input. The court maintained that the depredation order did not represent a delegation of authority, but was an exercise of FWS's permitting authority that incorporated relevant local concerns.", "In light of Fund for Animals , it seems possible to argue that a state's role in identifying \"occupations that regularly conduct drug testing\" should be viewed like the state fish and wildlife agency's role in making determinations about depredations. One might contend that DOL's 2019 regulations are not a delegation of authority to the states, but instead provide for an incorporation of local concerns to identify the relevant occupations. Like the FWS, DOL would arguably be conditioning the drug testing of unemployment compensation applicants, at least for some individuals, on the state's identification of certain occupations.", "Ultimately, a legal challenge of the final regulations seems possible. Opponents of the state's role in identifying \"occupations that regularly conduct drug testing\" would likely maintain that the regulations provide more than a condition for identifying when the drug testing of UC applicants is appropriate, but are a delegation to an outside party without the explicit authorization of Congress.
