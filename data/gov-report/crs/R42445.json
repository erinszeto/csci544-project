Consequently, how to pass a multi-year bill without cutting infrastructure spending, raising the gas tax, or increasing the budget deficit is an underlying theme in the ongoing debate. Other issues such as alternative finance, tolling, public-private partnerships, acceleration of project delivery, and performance management are also being debated in this fiscal context.

However, approximately 90% of trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels, 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel. The HTF consists of two separate accounts\u2014highway and mass transit. The highway account receives an allocation equivalent to 15.44 cents of the gasoline tax and the mass transit account receives the revenue generated by 2.86 cents of the tax. Because the fuel taxes are set in terms of cents per gallon, rather than as a percentage of the sale price, their revenues do not increase with inflation. The fuel tax rates were last raised in 1993.", "The period of sluggish economic performance that began in 2007 and the improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced fuel tax revenues below the optimistic projections assumed in SAFETEA. The highway account has already required three transfers from the general fund totaling $29.7 billion, without which the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) might not have been able to pay states for work they completed. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in its March 20, 2012, HTF baseline projection showed that the Highway account is expected to have a shortfall of $4.6 billion at the end of FY2013.

The states do not actually receive federal money for highway project spending up front. Apportionment is the distribution of funds among the states as prescribed by a statutory formula. Allocation is an administrative distribution of funds (often for specific projects) under programs that do not have statutory distribution formulas. Reimbursement occurs once a project is approved, the work is started, costs are incurred, and the state submits a voucher to FHWA. The reimbursable nature of the highway program is designed to help prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. Contract authority is a type of budget authority that is available for obligation even without an appropriation (although appropriators must eventually provide authority to pay the obligations, known as liquidating authority). Obligation of contract authority for a project by FHWA legally commits the federal government to reimburse the state for the federal share of a project. This can be done prior to an appropriation. Limitation on obligations , known as ObLim or Oblimit, is used to control annual FHWA spending in place of an appropriation. The ObLim sets a limit on the total amount of contract authority that can be obligated in a single fiscal year. For practical purposes, the ObLim is analogous to an appropriation.

Funding in two of these programs, the Urbanized Area Formula Program and the Fixed Guideway (or Rail) Modernization Program, is distributed by formula. The Urbanized Area Formula Program, which accounts for 41% of authorized transit funding in SAFETEA, provides funding to urbanized areas with populations of 50,000 or more. Funds can be used for a broad range of expenses including capital, planning, transit enhancements, and operations in urbanized areas with populations of up to 200,000.

", "The most significant changes to the environmental review process in MAP-21 are those that would be established under Section 1313, \"Accelerated Decisionmaking,\" and Section 1316, \"Review of Federal Project and Program Delivery.\" Under Section 1313, MAP-21 would amend existing environmental review procedures to establish new requirements applicable to \"issue resolution.\" The provisions would establish criteria intended to ensure that all parties to the environmental review process are on schedule to meet project deadlines and to resolve disputes that may delay completion of that process or result in denial of any approval required under applicable law. ", "Under Section 1313, MAP-21 would also establish \"financial transfer provisions\" applicable to an agency that fails to issue or deny a permit, license, or other approval required under any federal law. Under certain conditions, the applicable office of the head of the agency responsible for the delay would be required to transfer $10,000 or $20,000, once a week, to the agency or divisions charged with rendering a decision regarding an application. A transfer would be required on the later of 180 days after an application for a permit, license, or approval is complete; or 180 days after a final project decision is made, pursuant to NEPA. The transfer would not be required if the delay is of no fault of the agency.", "Agencies responsible for issuing approvals or permits for DOT projects vary depending on the impacts of a project, but may include EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or the Department of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. A given divisional, regional, or local program office within one of these agencies may process hundreds of permit applications annually for a range of regulated activities\u2014for projects beyond those applicable to transportation project development (e.g., private land development, mining operations, oil and gas development, cattle grazing). Agency under-staffing or lack of funds is sometimes cited as a cause of delay in issuing necessary approvals or permits.

DOT would be required to report this information to Congress within one year after enactment. No specific funding is authorized to complete the required assessments.", "Determining the time it takes to complete the various NEPA documents, as directed under Section 1316, will likely be challenging. Information indicating when individual EIS preparation begins and ends is available, but is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the time it takes to complete the NEPA process. Little or no data are available for projects processed with EAs or CEs. State DOTs generally do not attempt to track the time it takes to complete the NEPA process or any other environmental compliance obligations. Also, NEPA compliance fits into the overall project delivery process as a subset of one or more major elements of project development. Extracting accurate information about the time it takes to complete activities specific to the NEPA process may not be possible. To meet Congress's directive, DOT may require states to begin tracking this information and report it to DOT. Such a requirement would be an addition to the existing environmental clearance process. ", "MAP-21 provisions applicable to CEs generally involve directives to DOT to change existing regulatory requirements applicable to such projects. The most significant provisions applicable to CEs, \"Programmatic Agreements and Additional Categorical Exclusions\" (Section 1310), would direct DOT to survey state agencies for suggested new CEs. From those suggestions, DOT would be required to promulgate regulations adding projects to the existing regulatory list of CEs. Also, DOT would be directed to change existing CE regulations by moving specific projects listed as requiring documentation and approval from DOT to the list of projects for which no additional DOT approval is required (i.e., to move certain projects from 23 C.F.R.\u00a7771.117(d) to \u00a7771.117(c)). Other CE-related provisions would specify DOT agency roles in meeting NEPA compliance requirements for multimodal projects (Section 1306) and direct DOT to promulgate regulations specifying criteria under which specific projects located solely within the right-of-way of an existing highway may be designated as categorical exclusions (Section 1309).", "Provisions that would continue or amend environment-related programs or procedures established under SAFETEA include the following:", "Assistance to Affected State and Federal Agencies \u2014would continue to authorize the use of federal transportation funds for dedicated staff at a federal agency that would support activities that directly contribute to expediting and improving transportation project planning and delivery.

According to FHWA, CM/GC contracts occupy a middle ground between the traditional design-bid-build construction method and the more innovative design-build method in which a single contractor is responsible for all the design and construction work. With a CM/GC contract, a state DOT employs a general contractor to provide advice during the design phase. If agreement can be reached on price and other details, the same firm may then be employed to build the project. With intimate knowledge of the project, it is believed the contractor is able to enter into such an agreement and can begin construction tasks before the design work is complete, thereby accelerating the delivery of the project. H.R. 7 also provides specific authority for state DOTs to enter into CM/GC contracts.", "Second, MAP-21 would increase the federal funding share (normally 90% for Interstate Highway projects and 80% for other projects) by 5% on highway projects that demonstrate some kind of innovative project delivery method or technology (Section 1304). This applies to projects funded from the National Highway Performance Program, the Transportation Mobility Program, and the National Freight Program (the increased federal share is limited to 10% of a state's apportionments under these programs).
