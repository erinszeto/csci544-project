In September 2009, Senator Kerry introduced S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, which was referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. The committee completed markup of the bill on November 5, 2009, by approving Senator Boxer's \"Manager's Amendment\" as a substitute, and ordered S. 1733 reported. Both the House and Senate bills would establish a cap-and-trade system to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as address energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other energy topics. Among other provisions, both bills would require major reductions in GHG emissions from entities comprising roughly 85% of current U.S. GHG emissions. Covered sectors would include electricity production, natural gas distribution, petroleum refining, and industrial sectors. These and related bills and issues are currently being debated in Congress.", "Although the leading House and Senate climate proposals would not require GHG emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors, provisions in these bills could potentially raise farm input costs for energy, fertilizers, and other production inputs. However, higher production costs could potentially be alleviated by possible farm revenue increases from other provisions that are part of these bills. For example, the cap-and-trade proposals in these bills would distribute tradeable allowances at no cost to certain agricultural industries, such as fertilizer manufacturers. These \"free\" allowances could also dampen the impact of the cap-and-trade system that would otherwise occur. Higher costs might also be dampened by possible farm revenue increases should farmers participate in carbon offset programs for domestic farm- and land-based carbon storage activities. The renewable energy provisions contained in these bills could potentially expand the market for farm-based biofuels, biomass residues, and dedicated energy crops. Both bills also provide incentives for international forestry and related land-based activities. Other provisions in these bills might also affect the U.S. agriculture sectors. These include provisions that would establish a GHG registry for reporting emissions, which might affect certain larger livestock operations, and provisions to implement certain biomass and bioenergy requirements.", "This report describes some of the agriculture and forestry provisions that are included in major energy and climate legislation in the 111th Congress, comparing provisions in the House-passed bill (H.R. 2454) and the Senate-reported bill (S. 1733). Initially, when the House passed H.R. 2454 many in the Senate and in the agriculture community regarded that effort as a \"good starting point\" that still needed additional work to satisfy those in Congress with major agriculture constituencies. In particular, other ongoing efforts in the Senate, such as a bill introduced by Senator Stabenow (Clean Energy Partnerships Act of 2009, S. 2729), would provide for expanded carbon offset provisions benefitting U.S. farmers and landowners, among other provisions.

It provides a brief overview of how the agricultural and forestry sectors could be affected by the proposed cap-and-trade programs in climate titles of these bills. Also included in the proposed cap-and-trade programs are provisions that address which industries are to be considered sources of GHG emissions thus requiring emission reductions; which industries are to be considered as eligible sources of carbon allowances; and what types of domestic and international carbon storage and emission reduction activities might become eligible under a carbon offset credit program. This report also describes some of the carbon energy and biomass provisions pertaining to the domestic agricultural and forestry sectors in the energy titles of these bills.

This builds on the concept, also expressed in the 110 th Congress by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, that emissions reductions and carbon sequestration by the agricultural sector may provide an appropriate source of credits or offsets within a cap-and-trade program. However, in the 110 th Congress, some proposed bills did not allow for offsets, but would have set aside a percentage of allowances for various purposes, including biological sequestration. Participating farmers and landowners who receive these allowances for sequestration and/or emission reduction activities could sell them to facilities that could become covered by a cap-and-trade program. ", "For example, one 110th Congress bill, S. 3036 (Boxer; formerly S. 2191 (Leiberman/Warner)), contained several agriculture- and forestry-based provisions. The cap-and-trade framework outlined in S. 3036 established a tradeable allowance system that included a combination of auctions and free allocation of tradeable allowances. As part of this overall framework, S. 3036 included three design mechanisms that could provide financial incentives to encourage land-based agricultural and forestry activities: carbon offsets, set-aside allowances, and auction proceeds. S. 3036 provided for a range of agriculture and forestry offset projects, including agricultural and rangeland sequestration and management practices, land use change and forestry activities, manure management and disposal, and other terrestrial offset practices. S. 3036 also would have directly allocated 5% of the overall emissions allowances to domestic agriculture and forestry entities, and allocated a set percentage of available auction proceeds to carry out a cellulosic biomass ethanol technology deployment program. ", "Both the distribution of allowances to support agricultural and forestry activities and an offset program could provide opportunities to some farmers and landowners by allowing them to directly participate in and potentially gain a significant part of this emerging carbon market. The offset and allowance provisions could allow farmers and landowners to participate in this market by granting them the use of allowances and credits for sequestration and/or emission reduction activities. These allowances and credits could be sold to regulated facilities (e.g., power plants) covered by a cap-and-trade program to meet their emission reduction obligations. Proceeds from the sale of these allowances, credits, and auctions could be used to further promote and support activities in these sectors that reduce, avoid, or sequester emissions. For more information on the agriculture and forestry provisions in S. 3036 , see CRS Report RS22834, Agriculture and Forestry Provisions in Climate Change Bills in the 110th Congress .", "Also during Senate floor debate of S. 3036 in the 110 th Congress, Senator Stabenow introduced an amendment to the bill that sought to replace the offset provisions in S. 3036 with an even more expansive version of the agriculture and forestry offset program provisions. This amendment was not adopted, but the general provisions of this proposed amendment continue to be promoted by the farm community as a desired option for establishing an offset program as part of a cap-and-trade program.

In fact, the version of H.R. 2454 that passed the House was substantially different than the version that was reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Although H.R. 2454 set the aggregate number of submitted offsets at two billion tons annually, it initially did not identify whether agriculture and forestry activities would be eligible as offsets and did not include a separate title covering domestic agriculture and forestry carbon offsets. Instead eligible domestic offset types would be determined through the EPA rulemaking process. This caused concern among stakeholders in the agricultural community who wanted the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to be the lead agency administering the offset program for domestic agricultural and forestry offsets. In addition, many in the agricultural community were concerned that the committee-reported bill did not include an explicit list of offset practices.", "Just prior to the floor debate, following negotiations between the Chairmen of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Agriculture Committee, the so-called \"Peterson Amendment\" was added to H.R. 2454 . The Energy Committee's June 26, 2009 \"Manager's Amendment\" included a new Title V to H.R. 2454 \u2014\"Agriculture and Forestry Related Offsets.\" Among other provisions, the Peterson Amendment allowed for certain agricultural and forestry activities to become eligible to participate in a carbon offset program, established that this program would be implemented by USDA (rather than EPA), addressed concerns in the agricultural community about existing and evolving renewable energy and certain biomass requirements, and also recognized certain early actions that have already been taken by farmers and landowners to reduce emissions and sequester carbon. ", "The inclusion of provisions that allow for agricultural and forestry offsets as part of a cap-and-trade scheme is generally supported by a broad farm industry coalition. Initially this coalition consists of agricultural groups representing federally-supported crops (such as grains and cotton), livestock and dairy, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the American Farmland Trust, and other agriculture support and utility companies. Former Senators and Majority Leaders Bob Dole and Tom Daschle have also advocated on behalf of the Bipartisan Policy Center that farmers be fully integrated into any cap-and-trade program. Most groups, including many within the environmental community, generally support the inclusion of carbon offset projects within a cap-and-trade scheme since this is likely to help contain overall costs of a carbon reduction program. More recently, however, several farm groups are tending to oppose any climate legislation because of concerns that it will raise production and input costs to farmers.", "In March 2009, the House Agriculture Committee issued a climate change questionnaire, which was distributed to more than 400 organizations, to solicit input on proposals to reduce GHG emissions. The published survey responses are available on the committee's website and highlight some concerns, as well as the potential market opportunities for farmers and landowners.

Specifically, S. 1733 would delegate domestic program authority to the President and international program authority to EPA. S. 1733 also differed in terms of the types of projects and activities allowed, the total allowable quantity of domestic versus international offsets, and agency administration of the program, among other differences.

For example, neither the House-passed bill ( H.R. 2454 ) nor the Senate-reported bill ( S. 1733 ) specifically includes agricultural operations among its \"covered entities\" under a mandatory emissions cap. However, some interest groups continue to question whether certain types of agricultural operations could or should eventually be brought in under some proposals. Some of the bills introduced in the 110 th Congress would have provided authority to EPA to determine covered entities by applying cost-effective criteria to reduction options; other 110 th Congress bills would have covered biogenic emissions resulting from biological processes, which some interpret as potentially including animal agriculture facilities. Although these bills would not require GHG emission reductions in the agriculture and forestry sectors, if enacted, provisions in these bills could potentially raise farm input costs for energy, fertilizers, and other production inputs. As a result, many in the farm community are worried that U.S. farmers could be adversely affected by anticipated climate legislation through generally increasing energy and production input costs.

In addition, USDA has conducted analyses of the effects to agricultural producers from possible higher production and input costs under pending climate legislation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) also conducted an economy-wide analysis of H.R. 2454 . These analyses show that the overall costs of legislation to the agricultural community will be \"modest.\" USDA and EPA's studies further suggest that farm revenues from carbon offsets could result in net economic gains for the U.S. agricultural sectors.", "Several other groups, including land grant universities, non-governmental organizations, industry groups, and advocacy groups also have published studies and estimates, many that focus specifically on the economic effects on the agricultural and forestry sectors.

Almost all of the studies predict that energy costs will rise, though the estimated magnitude of these potential economic effects vary widely. Study results also differ in how higher energy prices will affect farm income. Most of the studies do not provide a complete analysis of the legislation and potentially offsetting cost effects. Most studies only consider the effects of the legislation on energy costs; they do not consider the possible impacts on farm input usage, shifts in crop production and practices, farm-based adjustments and management changes, changes in food prices, as well as farm revenue from biofuel and biomass production, carbon credits and carbon offset activities, or tradeable allowances and/or auction proceeds. ", "Many studies also highlight that higher potential production and farm input costs might be offset by policies that reduce costs (such as allowance provisions that may provide transitional assistance to fertilizer manufacturers and rural energy providers) and/or farm revenue increases should farmers participate in carbon offset and renewable energy provisions in these bills. However, few studies are able to provide quantitative estimates or to precisely predict how such policies and programs might lessen the overall potential economic effects to farms and landowners.", "Several studies also describe the potential negative effects on the U.S. agriculture sectors from climate change, absent policy changes designed to mitigate such effects, with some studies examining the possible economy-wide economic benefits of climate change legislation.

In the case of non-covered entities, those entities may only use the value generated from the sale of their allowances for specific purposes. For example, electricity and natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs) must use the value to mitigate the energy cost impacts of the cap-and-trade program on their customers (either through rebates or through investment in energy efficiency), while states must use the funds for energy efficiency, renewable energy, or other projects.

If the non-climate-related incentives stimulate activities that would mitigate GHG emissions (as a secondary effect) without the support of the offset market, the activity would not likely qualify as additional in terms of carbon offsets. On the other hand, some offset projects may not be economically viable without multiple sources of funding\u2014combining a payment from the offset market with grants from non-climate-related government programs.

In offsets parlance, such occurrences are described as reversals. Reversals are most pertinent to biological sequestration projects, specifically forestry activities.", "Recent cap-and-trade proposals have directed the implementing agency to account for reversals by establishing an offsets reserve (or insurance or other appropriate mechanism). Before offset credits would be issued, the relevant agency would place in the reserve a portion of the offsets to be issued: the number of credits set-aside would be based on the project's risk of reversal. If an unintentional reversal occurred, the agency would cover the loss from reserve credits, and the project developer would likely be required to replenish some portion of the used reserve credits. An offset program would likely have more stringent provisions for intentional reversals. ", "Another approach to address permanence concerns is to allow offset projects to generate temporary offset credits. Under this approach, offset credits would expire at the end of their term, and need to be replaced with emission allowances or unexpired offset credits. This option may allow more opportunities for projects that would have had trouble guaranteeing permanence. However, the degree to which covered entities would utilize this option is uncertain, considering that emission allowances and offset credits would likely be more expensive when the term credit expired.

Both contain allowances, which can be used (1) to build capacity in developing nations to protect their forests and to make REDD offsets feasible, and (2) to supplement U.S. emissions reductions by directly reducing tropical deforestation.

Since that time, there has been confusion about the extent that U.S. agriculture would be affected by that proposed rule. Some farm groups believed that, as part of the notice, EPA was proposing to impose a \"cow tax\" on livestock operations. However, the ANPR did not recommend the use of any particular CAA authority to regulate any emissions, nor did it commit to specific next steps to deal with GHGs, and it did not include a formal proposal to regulate GHGs. Among the options discussed in the ANPR was the potential to use the CAA's permitting program (in Title V) to regulate sources of GHG emissions. Agricultural sources were not singled out or highlighted in this discussion. The ANPR did mention the agricultural sectors, but only as background discussion as a source of GHGs, similar to that for other sectors, such as electric utilities. The Title V permit program does require regulated sources to pay permit fees to states, which could be the source of concern among some that, if EPA were to use the permitting program in the CAA to regulate GHGs, which some claim would automatically result in mandatory fees. EPA noted in its ANPR that the CAA allows considerable flexibility in setting fee schedules. EPA also stated that in the event of future regulation, it would be appropriate for permitting agencies to use that flexibility in setting any permit fees (by lowering fees for GHGs, compared with other pollutants, or setting lower fees for smaller sources, or other means).
