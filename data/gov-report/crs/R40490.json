Thus, adding this mandatory population in Title XIX (1) could be as simple as adding a new eligibility group under Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), plus conforming amendments; or (2) could be used as an opportunity to also \"clean up\" the statute of some obsolete groups by requiring that this new group supersede eligibility groups and rules that are currently used to allow persons with lower income levels to qualify. ", "Although adding a new group to the statute, as described in the former option, would add more complexity to an already somewhat convoluted Medicaid statute, it might also provide states with an opportunity to streamline some of their income counting methodologies.

This could somewhat lighten states' administrative burden. ", "The latter option would standardize eligibility rules across the nation and could improve equity and consistency among the states. However, it could be problematic if the new group has a specified income-counting methodology that is inconsistent with what states currently do. For example, Medicaid currently requires states to cover children age 6-18 up to 100% of poverty, and states are required to disregard certain amounts of income and some types of income entirely. The legislation for the new eligibility group could require an income-counting methodology different than states use. For example, a child who is currently covered as a \"poverty-related child\" at 95% of poverty (FPL) may be at 105% of poverty under a new methodology with fewer or less generous disregards. Thus, although it might seem to simplify the situation for the state to not determine the child's eligibility under the prior income-counting rules, it could lead to some individuals losing eligibility if those existing eligibility categories were dropped. However, the legislation could require states to ensure that no current enrollee lost coverage and/or that no applicant was deemed ineligible because of the change, which raises the next point.", "The latter could also be problematic if the legislation called for the state to make assessments based on its income-counting methods prior to the new group's addition.

Regardless, the state would have to maintain its ability to determine whether these individuals would have been eligible before the addition of the new group.
