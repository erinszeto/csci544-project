If the parties cannot come to a satisfactory arrangement, Congress may be approached to consider the matter.", "Contractors have delivered mail to homes and businesses since 1900. Controversy over this practice arose in 2007 when the NALC alleged that the USPS had expanded the use of contractors into city areas at the expense of unionized membership. Congress held hearings on the matter, and legislation was introduced in both houses. The USPS and NALC came to a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in October 2008 to govern the practice, which appeared to quell the controversy.", "However, the issue was reopened when USPS's collective bargaining agreements with the NRLCA and the NALC expired in 2010 and 2011, respectively. At present, it is unclear whether the parties have come to mutually agreeable arrangements concerning the use of contactors to deliver mail.", "By law, the USPS is obliged to provide for an \"efficient\" system of mail delivery. Federal statute provides the USPS with considerable freedom to enter into contracts with private parties. Wage-earning contractors cost less to employ than wage- and benefits-earning USPS employees. However, federal law also requires the USPS to collectively bargain its employees' compensation.

The PRA requires the USPS to \"maintain an efficient system of collection, sorting, and delivery of the mail nationwide\" (39 U.S.C. 403(b)(1)). To this end, the PRA provides the USPS with considerable discretion over its operations. 39 U.S.C. 5005 authorizes the USPS to \"obtain mail transportation service ... by contract from any person or carrier for surface and water transportation under such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.\" Additionally, Congress provided the USPS with the authorities to (1) \"enter into and perform contracts\" (39 U.S.C. 401); (2) \"provide for the collection, handling, transportation, delivery, forwarding, returning, and holding of mail\" (39 U.S.C. 404(a)(1)); and (3) \"establish mail routes and authorize mail transportation service thereon\" (39 U.S.C. 5203(a)).

However, the law also sets a pay and compensation floor for USPS employees and requires the USPS to collectively bargain with its employees.", "These aspects of postal law come into conflict in the matter of the USPS using private persons or firms to deliver mail. The data above indicate that the USPS has increased its use of contractors over the past 15 years. Yet, the data also indicate that contractors serve only a very small percentage of carrier routes and deliver to very few homes and businesses.", "Whether the use of private persons and firms to deliver mail will arise as an issue of interest to Congress is unclear. The USPS, NALC, and NRLCA may settle the matter through arbitration and ensuing memoranda of understanding.", "In the event that the use of contractors cannot be settled through the parties themselves, there are at least two broad perspectives that might be taken on the situation.", "First, it might be argued that Congress should take no action. Historically, Congress has not enacted specific policies concerning the extent of the USPS's use of contractors to deliver mail. It has left the matter to be decided by the Postal Service and its letter carrier unions through collective bargaining and the grievance process. Congress may continue this practice, reasoning that the USPS has legitimate grounds to pursue cost-savings via the use of contractors. Indeed, it might be further contended that the use of contractors to deliver mail is in keeping with long-time USPS practices. Contractors have been used to collect, transport, sort, and deliver mail; and machines built by private firms do much of the mail sorting work once performed by USPS employees. Letter carriage would not appear to be an inherently governmental function under current procurement policy, so the USPS should be free to outsource this work as it deems proper. ", "Second and alternately, Congress may choose to intervene, viewing the issue as involving an unintended conflict arising out of two national policies\u2014USPS operational efficiency and the rights of unionized, federal employees. From this perspective, it could be argued that the USPS is supposed to be a self-supporting agency; but that does not necessitate that the USPS should be permitted to outsource however much postal work it chooses. It might be further argued that there is a positive societal benefit in the federal government hiring individuals (often minorities and veterans) and compensating them well. Thus, Congress might either ban the practice of using contractors to deliver mail (or perform other mail-movement activities); or it could limit the amount of mail delivery work performed by contractors\u2014perhaps by capping the percentage of routes served by non-USPS employees. Were Congress either to ban or limit the use of contractors, it might wish to consider helping the USPS recoup any lost savings by providing it with additional authorities to increase its revenues or decrease its operating costs."], "subsections": []}]}}
