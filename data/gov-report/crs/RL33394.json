Adamec, 432 F. 3d 90 (2nd 2005), that struck down part of the SSA's interpretation of its fugitive felon regulations, and held that the mere existence of an outstanding arrest warrant does not make a beneficiary a fugitive felon whose benefits may be suspended.

Under the POMS guidance, Fowlkes' intent to flee, or his knowledge of the pending charges, was deemed irrelevant to his suspension of benefits. On appeal, Fowlkes argued that he was not a fugitive felon ineligible for SSI benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(e)(4)(A), because the statutory language requires he have an intention to flee, which Fowlkes argued he lacked prior to March 2000 because he was unaware of the indictments against him in Virginia, and which Fowlkes argued he lacked after March 2000 when he became aware of the indictments because he was financially unable to return to the charging state. In addition, Fowlkes argued that the SSA regulations require a court order finding that Fowlkes was a fleeing felon before the SSA can suspend benefits, and that no such court order existed in his case.", "The circuit court held that the SSA's interpretation of the statute embodied in POMS was in direct conflict with the plain language of the statute and its implementing regulations.

See Black ' s Law Dictionary 670 (8 th ed. 2004) (defining \"flight\" as \"[t]he act or an instance of fleeing, esp. to evade arrest or prosecution\"). Thus, there must be some evidence that the person knows his apprehension is sought. The statute's use of the words \"to avoid prosecution\" confirms that for \"flight\" to result in a suspension of benefits, it must be undertaken with a specific intent, i.e., to avoid prosecution.", "Thus, the court found the SSA's implementing regulation to be consistent with the statutory requirements because the regulation includes a requirement of a finding of intentional \"flight.\" Indeed, the court posited that the regulation \"may be stricter than the statute, insofar as it provides that the effective date of a benefits suspension is the date of issuance of a warrant or order issued by a court or other authorized tribunal on the basis of a finding that an individual fled or was fleeing from justice. Thus, the regulation does not permit the agency to make a finding of flight; rather, it demands a court or other appropriate tribunal to have issued a warrant or order based on a finding of flight.\" The court found that the POMS passages cited by the Commissioner were in direct conflict with the regulation in that they contemplate suspension of benefits without any finding of \"flight\" by a court or other tribunal. The court held that benefits may be suspended only as of the date of a warrant or order issued by a court or other authorized tribunal on the basis of a finding that a person was fleeing or had fled from justice.", "The circuit court remanded the Fowlkes case back to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the court's holding that the SSA is only permitted to suspend benefits because of a person's fugitive felon status as of the date that a warrant or court order finding that a person has fled or is fleeing from justice was issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA's Acquiescence Ruling", "paragraphs": ["On April 6, 2006, the SSA issued an acquiescence ruling that explains how the agency will apply the Fowlkes v.

The acquiescence ruling went into effect on April 6, 2006, however, it can be applied retroactively to the date of the court's decision in Fowlkes , December 6, 2005, if a beneficiary or recipient can demonstrate that the application of the acquiescence ruling would have changed the outcome of his or her case.", "Within the states affected by the Fowlkes decision, the SSA will no longer rely solely on the existence of an outstanding warrant to determine the fugitive status of a beneficiary. Rather, before making a determination that an individual is fleeing to avoid prosecution, and thus is a fugitive felon, the SSA \"must have evidence that the individual knows that there is an outstanding felony arrest warrant, and the outstanding arrest warrant must have been issued on the basis that the individual has fled or is fleeing from justice.\" However, in all other parts of the country, the SSA will continue its policy of suspending benefits based solely on the existence of a warrant, without any consideration of whether the person is actually fleeing or attempting to avoid being captured, as set forth in POMS guidance."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
