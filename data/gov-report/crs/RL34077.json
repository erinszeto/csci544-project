As required, these committees reported reconciliation recommendations producing the required savings to their parent chamber prior to September 10, 2007.", "Each of the aforementioned authorizing committees marked up a bill in June of 2007 with reconciliation recommendations that generate the required savings in mandatory spending. Each chamber also considered a broad set of Higher Education Act (HEA) amendments in conjunction with the reconciliation proposals. Under each bill, the required savings are achieved through cuts in payments to Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program lenders and guaranty agencies. Both bills generate substantially higher levels of savings in mandatory spending than required by the reconciliation directive, and the additional savings offset costs associated with a broad array of new or enhanced student aid benefits.", "On June 25, 2007, the House Committee on Education and Labor reported H.R. 2669, the College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 (H.Rept. 110-210), containing the required reconciliation proposals.

Each committee has looked to reduce mandatory spending on these federal student loan programs to meet the requirements of recent budget reconciliations.

Under the DL program, operated through the U.S. Department of Education (ED), the federal government provides the loans to students and their families, using federal capital (i.e., funds from the U.S. Treasury). The two programs rely on different sources of capital and different administrative structures, but essentially disburse the same set of loans.", "The DL program, established in 1993, was intended to streamline the student loan delivery system and achieve cost savings. While the DL program was originally introduced to gradually expand and replace the long-standing FFEL program, the 1998 HEA amendments removed the provisions of the law that referred to a \"phase in\" of the DL program. Currently both programs are authorized and the two programs compete for student loan business. In FY2007, these programs provided $63.9 billion in new loans to students and their parents.

The fiscal year cost estimates for both programs, under terms of the Credit Reform Act of 1990, are calculated by determining the net present value of the costs to the government over the lifetime of new loans disbursed in the given fiscal year. Under credit reform, an effort is made to capture, in the year in which credit is provided, the multi-year net cash flows associated with a new cohort of direct or guaranteed loans. This calculation establishes a \"subsidy cost,\" which is the estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct or guaranteed loan.", "In calculating the subsidy costs for the two programs, the main cost components are the interest benefits to students in the subsidized Stafford Loan program, the special allowance payments to lenders, and defaults. Subsidy cost calculations are highly dependent on interest rate forecasts over the life of the loans and therefore can vary significantly depending on these forecasts. In order to achieve savings in mandatory spending on the loan programs, Congress has often cut loan subsidies or introduced fees to generate funds that offset mandatory spending.", "Each year the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issues a baseline budget forecasting estimated spending over a 10-year period under current law, assuming no policy changes are enacted over that time period. The CBO baseline serves as a benchmark for budgetary analyses. When legislation that would affect mandatory spending is introduced, its budgetary impact is measured against the CBO baseline. The current CBO baseline projects that over the 2008-2012 period the federal student loan programs would guarantee or disburse about $406 billion in new loans\u2014costing about $21.2 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2008 Budget Reconciliation Provisions", "paragraphs": ["The savings in mandatory spending required by the FY2008 budget reconciliation instructions for the House Committee on Education and Labor, and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and enacted in P.L. 110-84 , are achieved through changes to the FFEL program.
