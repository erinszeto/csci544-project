There is no hold harmless provision in the law that guarantees that a state or territory will see a year-over-year increase in its VR allotment. The increased appropriation in any given fiscal year is distributed solely based on the VR formula, without regard for ensuring that an individual state or territory's allotment will also increase based on the change in the CPI-U.", "In FY2009, four states and one territory received lower allotments than they had received in FY2008. Also in FY2009, 15 states, two territories and the District of Columbia received increases that were less than the growth in the CPI-U that the total appropriation was indexed on.", "The Senate passed legislation in the 108 th and 109 th Congresses that would have partially dealt with this issue by requiring that states and territories that did not receive an increase in their VR allotment that was at least equal to the increase in the CPI-U from the previous year would receive the first priority for any reallotted funds. The RSA currently reallots funds using this method. Advocacy groups have taken this a step further, however, and both the National Rehabilitation Association and the Council of State Administrators of Vocational Rehabilitation (CSAVR) have publicly called for changes to the VR funding process that would ensure that each state and territory receives an annual allotment that keeps pace with the increases in the cost of living."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Formula Does Not Take Into Account a State or Territory's Success at Rehabilitating and Returning Clients to Work", "paragraphs": ["The allotment formula does not take into account a state or territory's performance in returning clients to the workforce and helping them maintain competitive employment. As a result, the Department of Education (ED) is left without a possible tool to encourage compliance with established performance standards and has no way to reward state or territorial agencies that are successful at returning clients to the workforce.", "Section 107(c) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does give the Secretary of Education the ability to withhold VR funding from any state or territory that is not in compliance with its published state plan or that is falling below the performance standards established by ED for the VR program. However, despite the fact that GAO identified two cases in FY2003 in which VR agencies failed to meet these performance standards, ED has never withheld funding from a state or territorial VR agency because of performance.", "GAO cited the inability of ED to establish a means to reward successful VR agencies with increased funding as part of the agency's overall inability to properly monitor and manage the performance of the state and territorial VR agencies that it provides funding to. In addition, the Senate recognized this shortcoming in the current law and Section 421 of S. 1021 in the 109 th Congress provided authorization for ED to provide incentive grants to states that demonstrated success at returning persons with disabilities to the workforce. In its report on S. 1021 , the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions stated", "Based on program data and other sources of information, it is apparent that there is a wide variation in the performance of individual State vocational rehabilitation agencies. In Section 421 of S. 1021 the Committee permanently authorizes the Administration's Vocational Rehabilitation Incentive Grants Program as a method to encourage State vocational rehabilitation agencies to improve their performance. The Committee intends that grant funds be used primarily to encourage State vocational rehabilitation agencies to adopt effective strategies to improve employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities receiving assistance under the vocational rehabilitation program.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that these incentive grants would have cost $13 million in 2006 and $137 million over the period from 2006 through 2010."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Issues for the 112th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Efforts to reauthorize the VR program without significant changes to the allotment formula or other aspects of the program were unsuccessful in the 108 th Congress. The Workforce Investment Act Amendments of 2003 ( H.R. 1261 )\u2014which would have extended the authorization for VR grants through FY2009\u2014was passed by the House and Senate, but could not be reconciled in a conference committee, and a final version was not passed into law.", "In the 109 th Congress, H.R. 27 , the Job training Act of 2005, which would have extended the authorization for the VR program through FY2011, was passed by the House. A subsequent Senate bill ( S. 1021 , the Workforce Investment Act Amendments of 2005) was incorporated into H.R. 27 and passed by the Senate. The bills differed for reasons unrelated to the VR program and no conference committee was ever formed. A final version of these bills was never passed.", "Reauthorization of the program was not considered in the 110 th Congress, although supplemental VR grants were appropriated as part of the Recovery Act. If Congress does consider reauthorization in 2010, it may want to consider making changes to several parts of the VR program. Possible areas for reform include the definition of disability used and the order of selection rules that give preference to persons with the most severe disabilities even though this group may be the least likely to return to work.", "In addition, Congress may wish to consider some method for increasing the overall success rate of the VR program. Currently, the RSA has very little ability to give states and territories incentives to improve the return to work rate of their VR clients or to punish states that fail to meet established expectations for VR agencies. The Senate's reauthorization bill in the 109 th Congress did include a program of authorization grants that could be used to reward states that demonstrate success at returning clients to the workforce, and the Recovery Act supplemental appropriation passed in the 111 th Congress required agencies to report on program performance as a condition for receiving a portion of the funds.", "As discussed in this report, the current formula fails to account for a state or territory's actual population of individuals with disabilities and a state or territory's ability to pay its share of the costs of VR services. In addition, this report has shown that the current formula does not ensure that funding increases due to changes in the cost of living are passed along to individual states and territories. The formula also does not take into account a state or territory's success at returning VR clients to work.", "Finally, this report has also shown the impact of the allotment formula on the VR funding levels of states that have seen significant population growth since the 1970s. States with the largest increase in population since the mid-1970s have also had the largest reduction in VR funding due to the use of the FY1978 funding baseline in the allotment formula. These concerns with the allotment formula are areas that the House and Senate may consider if reauthorization of the VR program is proposed in the 112 th Congress.", "Appendix A.
