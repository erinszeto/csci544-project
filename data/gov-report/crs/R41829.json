However, domestic consumption has been weak since the international financial crisis and global economic downturn in 2008. It also is a reflection of the fact that the United States is a relatively mature economy. Increasingly, the United States has turned to trade, in particular exports, as a means of growing the U.S. economy.", "The Ex-Im Bank, which is charged with supporting U.S. exports and jobs through export financing, is among the federal government agencies involved in promoting U.S. exports. As such, the Ex-Im Bank is a key participant in President Obama's National Export Initiative (NEI), a strategy to double U.S. exports by 2015 to support U.S. employment.

Private lenders and insurers conduct the majority of short-term export financing, whereas ECAs are more heavily involved in medium- and long-term export financing, including financing for complex, multi-billion dollar sales such as aircraft and infrastructure projects. The role of ECAs has become more prominent in recent years due to the international financial crisis and global economic downturn in 2008. With businesses facing difficulty accessing credit in the private sector, there has been a surge in demand for export credit and insurance from ECAs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changing Composition of ECAs and Increasing Export Credit Competition", "paragraphs": ["Since the Ex-Im Bank's inception in 1934, the process of globalization has introduced fundamental changes to the global economy and to the international export credit environment. Traditionally, the United States and other developed countries have been the primary sources of world trade flows and ECA financing. For example, historically the G-7 countries have accounted for about 80% of global medium- to long-term export finance. As members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), these countries are party to the OECD Arrangement on Official Supported Export Credits (the \"OECD Arrangement\"), which is intended to ensure that exporting takes place on a level playing field (see text box, \"International Disciplines on Export Credit Activity\").", "Over the past couple of decades, economic changes associated with globalization have led to the rising wealth of emerging economies and their growing role in the global economy. Currently, a number of emerging market countries operate ECAs. Rising economic powers, such as China, India, and Brazil, are not members of the OECD (though they may have observer status during some OECD meetings and the OECD has offered them \"enhanced engagement\" with a view toward possible accession). As non-member economies, China, India, and Brazil are not party to the OECD Arrangement, and their export credit financing activities may not comply with international standards. For example, they may offer below-market and concessionary financing alternatives with which it is difficult for ECAs of OECD members to compete.", "The growing number of players and volumes of export credit activity in the international export finance market has resulted in greater and varied competition for U.S. exporters, both from developed countries and from rising economic powers as they move up the value chain. In terms of developed countries, although certain types of competition between developed country ECAs that were prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s have been reduced, new forms of competition have emerged. For example, for about 30 years, the ECAs of developed countries generally have not offered officially supported financing for exports to other developed countries. With respect to the aircraft sector, the Ex-Im Bank and the ECAs of the United Kingdom, France, Spain, and Germany (which provide financing to Airbus) have agreed to an informal \"home market rule,\" which limits access to officially supported export financing for the purchase of aircraft in their own domestic market and in each other's \"home markets.\" The competitive landscape appears to be changing, however. Canada currently does not recognize the home market rule, and the Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier, which is supported by Canada's official ECA, has recently entered the large civil aircraft market. This trend is also emerging in other sectors, such as in green energy projects. For instance, the Japanese ECA reportedly recently announced that it was prepared to support its companies on projects in the United States, including the Florida high speed rail project.", "In terms of emerging economies, the increasing volumes of their official export credit activity that fall outside of the OECD Arrangement have raised concerns among OECD members about how level the playing field is for their exporters. According to the Ex-Im Bank, non-OECD countries are expected to continue \"expanding their market share by using exceptional financing methods, that comport with WTO provisions, but that are outside of the purview of the OECD rules, further expanding the scope of unregulated financing vis-\u00e0-vis constant volumes of OECD Arrangement-compliant activity.\" Officially subsidized export credit activity by emerging economies may increase in strategic markets, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, and natural resources extraction. For instance, Chinese ECAs \"have shown strong signs of growing usage of export credits for export promotion purposes, especially in Africa, where they were offering preferential loans either in exchange for much needed resources (e.g., oil) or low cost loans on very extended repayment terms on projects in order to gain market share.\" The rise of emerging economies as financing competitors has renewed concerns about a new \"race to the bottom.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Growth in Publicly Backed Export Credit Support", "paragraphs": ["Comprehensive data on the export finance activities of ECAs are limited and sometimes not publicly available.

What follows are some data that may provide an indication of the levels of international export credit activity. ", "In 2010, Berne Union members (both public and private) provided $1.4 trillion in credit and investment insurance support, covering more than 10% of the value of international trade transactions with their export credit support. Berne Union members generally cover the more risky transactions in which exporters and lenders decide to take insurance to mitigate the risks of trading. The Ex-Im Bank's annual competitiveness report provides estimates of new medium- and long-term (MLT) official export credit financing by the Ex-Im Bank, the ECAs of the other G-7 countries, and selected emerging economies In 2010, new MLT official export credit financing by the G-7 ECAs totaled $65.4 billion. The United States represented 20% of total new MLT financing by the G-7 countries.

A number of the G-7 ECAs have \"lender of last resort\" approaches (i.e., to provide finance where private sector finance is not available and to charge fees for their services), including those of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. Canada's ECA takes a more expansive view of commercial interests than some other ECAs, and focuses on supporting Canadian exports and developing Canada's trade capacity both directly and indirectly. Other ECAs, generally in emerging markets, focus primarily on advancing economic development objectives, such as increasing living standards, and boosting the competitiveness of their firms. Products: ECAs offer a range of products that may include direct loans, guarantees, working capital loans, and tied aid. These products can vary by short, medium, and long terms. Some ECAs offer credit and insurance products directed toward supporting exports, whereas others focus on supporting both exports and overseas investment. In the United States, the Ex-Im Bank provides credit and insurance to support exports, whereas the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), another U.S. agency, provides political risk insurance to support overseas investment. In several other countries, such as Japan and Canada, the same entity (i.e., JBIC and EDC, respectively) conducts both export and investment support and others forms of export assistance. Policies: Some ECAs determine whether or not to support export contracts based on an array of criteria, such as the economic and environmental impact of the proposed transactions or the strategic implications of the financing.

Advocates of the Ex-Im Bank's credit and insurance programs argue that such efforts are critical in addressing market failures (such as imperfect information and barriers to entry) and countering foreign governments' export financing efforts. Others, including some economists, hold that such programs merely shift production among sectors within the economy and do not permanently add to the overall level of a nation's exports, which they argue is influenced by a combination of domestic macroeconomic factors and global economic developments in the long run. Some also may question whether this form of government intervention has crowded out private sector financing.

In contrast, small firms account for about 80% of the number of the Ex-Im Bank's credit and insurance transactions, whereas large firms account for about 20%. Supporters note that the Ex-Im Bank's mission is to support U.S. businesses of all sizes and that the Bank places special emphasis on supporting the exports of small businesses. Some supporters argue that focusing on the dollar value of Ex-Im Bank support to small businesses may be misleading because the larger size of corporations naturally results in a scale of business that requires larger volumes of support.", "Some supporters also contend that Ex-Im Bank data do not reflect all of the small businesses that benefit from Ex-Im Bank services, such as \"invisible\" exporters who provide goods and services used by other companies that directly export. For example, one study identified more than 33,000 SMEs that supplied manufactured parts or services to five larger companies (General Electric, Boeing, Case New Holland, Siemens Power Corporation, and Bechtel) that use Ex-Im Bank financing.

", "Given that the Ex-Im Bank's credit and insurance transactions are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the Ex-Im Bank's exposure cap can be viewed as the maximum amount for which U.S. taxpayers may be liable if the Bank's portfolio experiences severe losses. To date, the Ex-Im Bank's loan loss rate has been low historically, at approximately 1.5%. Some opponents express concern about the potential burden to taxpayers imposed by the Bank's activities. Some argue that risks to the Bank's portfolio have increased with the global financial crisis and the Eurozone debt crisis.

Currently, the Ex-Im Bank is the only ECA in the G-7 to commit systematically to publishing environmental monitoring reports, which includes carbon accounting of projects. In addition, the Ex-Im Bank faces competition from ECAs outside of the OECD, such as those from China, that tend to be less rigorous in their environmental requirements for financing than OECD countries. However, import-sensitive U.S. businesses, labor groups, environmental groups, and other stakeholders contend that the Bank must balance U.S. exporting interests with other policy considerations.", "In recent months, debate about the economic impact of Ex-Im Bank activities has been driven in part by a charge by Delta Airlines and other U.S. airlines, led by the Air Transport Association of America (ATAA), that Ex-Im Bank financing for Boeing aircraft exports to India and other countries has led to an oversupply of airline seats that has had an adverse effect on their businesses. The group also has charged that the Ex-Im Bank's economic impact analysis procedures are inconsistent with the Bank's charter. Delta and these other airlines have filed a legal challenge against the Ex-Im Bank seeking an injunction on Ex-Im Bank loan guarantees to Air India. Following a federal judge's denial for a preliminary injunction that would stop Ex-Im Bank financing of Boeing exports to India, the airlines filed a motion on February 1, 2012, for a judgment on the merits of the case, which is pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tied Aid", "paragraphs": ["As part of its direct lending program, the Bank has a Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund (TACPF), often referred to as the tied aid \"war chest,\" that it uses to counter specific projects that are receiving foreign officially subsidized export financing, or \"concessional\" below-market financing.
