It should be noted that in any given year, not all enrolled veterans obtain their health care services from VA. While some veterans may rely solely on VA for their care, others may receive the majority of their health care services from other sources, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance, and the military health system (TRICARE).

The fourth account, the medical and prosthetic research account, is not funded with an advance appropriation. P.L. 111-81 also required the Department of Veterans Affairs to submit a request for advance appropriations for VHA with its budget request each year. Congress first provided advance appropriations for the three VHA accounts in the FY2010 appropriations cycle. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-117 ) provided advance appropriations for FY2011; the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 112-10 ) provided advance appropriations for FY2012; the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 ( P.L. 112-74 ), enacted into law on December 23, 2011, provided advance appropriations for FY2013; and the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013 ( P.L. 113-6 ), enacted into law on March 26, 2013, provided advance appropriations for FY2014.

The model estimates the amount of budgetary resources VHA will need to meet the expected demand for most of the health care services it provides.

Each component is subject to a number of adjustments to account for the characteristics of VA health care and the veterans who access VA's health care services. The EHCPM makes projections three or four years into the future. Each year, VHA updates the EHCPM estimates to \"incorporate the most recent data on health care utilization rates, actual program experience, and other factors, such as economic trends in unemployment and inflation.\" For instance, in 2011, VHA used data from FY2010 to develop its health care budget estimate for the FY2013 request, including the advance appropriations request for FY2014.

Congress also appropriates funds for construction of medical facilities through a larger appropriations account for construction for all VA facilities. In FY2004, \"to provide better oversight and [to] receive a more accurate accounting of funds,\" Congress changed the VHA's appropriations structure. Specifically, the Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2004 ( P.L. 108-199 , H.Rept. 108-401 ), funded VHA through four accounts: (1) medical services, (2) medical administration (currently known as medical support and compliance), (3) medical facilities, and (4) medical and prosthetic research.

However, in FY2012 VHA expects lower first-party copayments. This estimated decline is \"attributable to fewer veterans with billable insurance and increased numbers of veterans requesting hardship waivers and exemptions from first-party copayments.\" Furthermore, VHA has stated that it continues to experience a decline in third-party collections \"to billings ratios as commercial health insurers shift more responsibility to the patient for health care costs including copayments and deductibles, which VHA cannot collect.\" It should be noted that 38 U.S.C. Section 1729 prevents VHA from billing the veteran if the health insurer does not pay. Additionally, according to VHA, \"FY2012 begins to reflect the shift in workload for Vietnam-era veterans aging to 65 years and older.
