The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental standard-setting body on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), has defined TBML as the process of disguising proceeds of crime and moving value through trade transactions to legitimize their illicit origin. This process varies in complexity, but typically involves the misrepresentation of the price, quantity, or quality of imports or exports. When used by terrorist groups to finance their activities, move money, or otherwise disguise the source and beneficiaries of their funds, TBML schemes are sometimes referred to as TBML/FT. Financial institutions are wittingly or unwittingly implicated in TBML and TBML/FT schemes when they are used to settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions (e.g., through processing wire transfers, providing trade finance, and issuing letters of credit and guarantees).", "In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued two reports related to money laundering: a National Money Laundering Risk Assessment and a National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment . The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment identified TBML as among the most challenging and pernicious forms of money laundering to investigate. Citing information from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Treasury described TBML schemes as capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. A February 2010 advisory on TBML, issued by the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), stated that more than 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) described potential TBML activity between January 2004 and May 2009, which involved transactions totaling in the aggregate more than $276 billion.", "In addition to TBML, criminal organizations and terrorist financiers use the international financial system itself and the physical movement of cash through couriers to disguise their activities. In particular, criminal organizations and terrorist financiers take advantage of the size and complexity of the international trade and finance system to obscure individual transactions through (1) the complexities involved with multiple foreign exchange transactions and diverse trade financing arrangements; (2) the co-mingling of legitimate and illicit funds; and (3) the limited resources that most customs agencies have available to detect suspicious trade transactions. In addition, money launderers have exploited vulnerabilities in the use of letters of credit and other financial arrangements that are necessary for facilitating cross-border trade to launder funds. According to FATF, TBML techniques \"vary in complexity and are frequently used in combination with other money laundering techniques to further obscure the money trail.\"", "In most cases, TBML activities comprise efforts to misrepresent the price, quality, or quantity of goods as they transit across borders or through supply chains. The basic TBML techniques include the following:", "Over - and u nder-invoicing of g oods and s ervices . According to the FATF, money laundering through over- and under-invoicing goods and services is one of the most commonly used methods for laundering funds across borders. By invoicing a good or service below market value, an exporter can shift funds to the importer because the payment to the exporter is less than the value that the importer receives when the goods are sold at market value. Similarly, by invoicing a good or service at a price higher than market value, the exporter transfers value from the importer because the payment to the exporter is greater than the value the importer receives when the goods or services are sold at market value. These types of transactions generally require collusion by both parties and can have significant tax implications. Also, complex products and products that travel through supply chains are more apt to be used in these types of over- and under-invoicing activities because they complicate the ability of customs officials to determine the true market value of such goods and services. Multiple invoicing of g oods and s ervices . By providing multiple invoices for the same transaction, a money launderer or terrorist financier can justify multiple payments for the same goods or services. In addition, by using a number of financial institutions to make these multiple payments, a money launderer or terrorist financier can increase the level of complexity of the transaction and complicate efforts at detection. If the transaction is detected, a launderer can offer a number of plausible explanations that compound efforts by officials to detect the activities. Over- and u nder-shipments of g oods and s ervices . In addition to manipulating the prices of goods and services, a money launderer can misstate the quantity of goods and services that are exported or imported. In the extreme, exporters and importers can collude in not shipping any goods at all but proceed with processing the necessary shipping and customs documents. Banks and other financial institutions may be unaware that these \"phantom\" transactions are occurring. Falsely d escribed g oods and s ervices . Money launderers also can misstate the quality or the type of a good or service that is being traded. Such a misstatement creates a discrepancy between the value of a good that is stated on the shipment or customs forms and what is actually shipped.", "Combining several of these common TBML techniques is a classic scheme involving the laundering of drug proceeds from Latin America, called the Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE). BMPE emerged as a major money-laundering method when Colombian drug traffickers used sophisticated trade-based schemes to disguise as much as $4 billion in annual narcotics profits in the 1980s. For further illustration, see Text Box below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope of the Problem", "paragraphs": ["TBML is widely recognized as one of the most common manifestations of international money laundering as well as a known value transfer and reconciliation method used by terrorist organizations. Nevertheless, TBML appears to be less understood among academics and policymakers than traditional forms of money laundering through the international banking system and bulk cash smuggling. Considering the volume of global trade and the value of such transactions, however, TBML's effects can result in substantial consequences for international commerce and government revenue. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment concludes that", "TBML can have a more destructive impact on legitimate commerce than other money laundering schemes. According to ICE HSI [Homeland Security Investigations], transnational criminal organizations may dump imported goods purchased with illicit proceeds at a discount into a market just to expedite the money laundering process. The below-market pricing is a cost of doing business for the money launderer, but it puts legitimate businesses at a competitive disadvantage. This activity can create a barrier to entrepreneurship, crowding out legitimate economic activity. TBML also robs governments of tax revenue due to the sale of underpriced goods, and reduced duties collected on undervalued imports and fraudulent cargo manifests.", "The global trends that facilitated a quadrupling of global trade over the past quarter century, measured at $16.4 trillion in 2015, are also being used by drug smugglers and other criminal organizations to hide the gains of illegal or illicit activities. In particular, advances in communications and lower transportation costs, combined with the digital revolution, global value chains, and greater urbanization, have produced more interconnected economies and societies that link together national economies and create vast new market opportunities. Reportedly, organized crime has followed these trends and expanded its activities into new markets. ", "According to a research report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), these global markets offer criminal organizations new markets to reduce their overall risks by diversifying into profitable activities with low probability of being detected. According to the OECD's report, \"Illicit trade needs to be presented within the context of global market trends.... Criminal groups adopted new types of activity and trade to overcome the challenge of connecting production to distant consumers. These new synergies created economies of scale and other efficiencies common to legitimate trade, and the opportunity to diversify into new illicit markets.\" The OECD further concluded that such illegal trade and the attendant financial flows not only present a challenge for law enforcement but also potentially could have wide-ranging economic and development consequences, particularly as illegal transfers of money and capital out of developing countries may result in reductions of domestic expenditure and investment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["The potential is vast for criminal organizations and terrorist groups to exploit the international trade system with relatively low risk of detection.

The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (released in 2016) noted that TBML unrelated to terrorist financing also occurs in Trinidad and Tobago. Based on these reports, TBML is often associated with significant losses in potential customs and tax revenue, circumvention of foreign exchange capital restrictions, corruption of customs authorities, exploitation of free trade zones, laundering of proceeds associated with black and grey market goods, counter-valuation among informal money brokers (e.g., hawaladars ), and trade in gold and precious gems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Links to Terrorism", "paragraphs": ["Although a number of anecdotal case studies in recent years have revealed instances in which known terrorist groups and other non-state armed groups, including Hezbollah, used TBML, the Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment concluded that TBML is not a dominant method for terrorist financing. It stated, ", "Broadly speaking, based on an analysis of U.S. law enforcement investigations and prosecutions relating to TF [terrorist financing], two methods of moving money to terrorists and terrorist organizations have been predominate in the convictions and cases pending since 2001: the physical movement of cash and the movement of funds through the banking system.... The physical movement of cash accounted for 28 percent of these cases while movement directly through banks constituted 22 percent, movement through licensed MSBs [money services businesses] 17 percent, and movement by individuals or entities acting as unlicensed money transmitters constituted 18 percent.\"", "The footnote following the sentence quoted above continued: \"The remaining 15 percent were a mix of checks, wire transfers through unspecified financial institutions, and TBML.\"", "In its latest Country Reports on Terrorism , the State Department identified TBML as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, particularly as a technique used by hawala brokers in conjunction with corrupt customs and immigration officials. Hawala refers to an informal method for transferring funds that is commonly used in parts of the Middle East and South Asia where the formal banking system has limited presence. A hawala transfer typically involves a network of trusted money brokers, or hawaladars , who rely on each other to accept and disburse funds to third-party clients on their behalf. Settlement of account balances among hawaladars takes place subsequently, but not necessarily through bank and nonbank financial institutions. Such informal value transfer systems are often preferred because of their perceived quickness, reliability, and lower cost. Unregulated hawala systems, however, are perceived by government authorities as lacking sufficient transparency and investigations have revealed that they are vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. ", "The State Department's 2016 annual report on money laundering and financial crimes also identified some specific countries that may be vulnerable to TBML/FT schemes. For example, the report notes that expanded trade cooperation pursuant to the 2011 Afghanistan/Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement encompasses trade routes that are known for TBML and that \"pass through key locations where insurgent and terrorist groups operate.\"", "In Lebanon, the State Department reports that individuals are involved in a TBML scheme involving trade in vehicles, sometimes co-mingled with weapons, to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah (for further discussion, see case study below on \" Hezbollah-Linked TBML \"): ", "U.S. law enforcement identified money wires coming into the United States from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to various domestic vehicle dealerships. These funds are used to purchase vehicles subsequently exported to Lebanon and Jordan. In some instances, there are weapons secreted within the exported vehicles. The transactions that occur in the United States appear to be legitimate, but the ultimate destination of the vehicles is unknown and the proceeds may be directed back to Hizballah in Lebanon.", "TBML schemes have long prevailed in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area with Brazil and Argentina, where the cross-border cigarette smuggling market, believed to be worth approximately $1 billion per year, is also used for money-laundering purposes, enriching criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and, at least in the past, potentially also terrorist organizations.", "In the United Arab Emirates, the State Department reports that TBML schemes \"might support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Case Studies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hezbollah-Linked TBML", "paragraphs": ["In February 2011, the Department of the Treasury designated the Lebanese Canadian Bank (LCB) as a financial institution of primary money-laundering concern, stating that, according to U.S. government information, Hezbollah \"derived financial support\" from these drug and money laundering schemes, which involved TBML. Treasury noted that an international narcotics trafficking and money laundering network \"move[d] illegal drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East via West Africa and launder[ed] hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts held at LCB, as well as through trade-based money laundering involving consumer goods throughout the world, including through used car dealerships in the United States.\"", "In one such scheme, LCB facilitated wire transfers to U.S. banks to purchase used cars in the United States. Cars were purchased in the United States and shipped to countries in West Africa and elsewhere, and the proceeds from the car sales would reportedly be repatriated back to Lebanon through bulk cash deposits among conspiring exchange houses. In another scheme associated with the same Hezbollah-linked drug trafficking network, Asian-supplied consumer goods were shipped to Latin America and the proceeds were laundered through a BMPE-styled scheme. The funds sent to pay for the consumer goods were reportedly funneled through LCB's U.S. correspondent accounts.

The toy company used the cash deposits to purchase toys from China, which, in turn, were exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos generated by the toy sales in Colombia were used to reimburse the Colombian drug traffickers through the BMPE. Some of the employees of Woody Toys had previously worked for Angel Toy Company, whose owners had also been implicated in a similar toys-for-drugs BMPE scheme.
