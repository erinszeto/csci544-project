The first is that the coastal and island communities did not receive timely warning about the tsunami waves that caused so many of the reported casualties. The second Chilean government response that has been widely questioned was the speed with which the Chilean military was deployed to quell looting and violence in the disaster zone.

Among other items, the Chilean government has requested field hospitals, electric generators, satellite communications equipment, water purification systems, and mobile bridges. Chilean officials have met with United Nations (U.N.) agencies to establish a clear plan for international assistance, and the United States and more than 20 other nations have begun to provide Chile with the aid it has requested.

The declaration, issued following increasing reports of riots and looting, restricts civil rights and liberties and places the regions under military control to maintain order and avoid social conflict. This is the first time that a State of Catastrophe measure has been employed by the Chilean government since its return to democracy in 1990.

The curfew was extended to three cities in the Maule region\u2014Talca, Cauquenes, and Constituci\u00f3n\u2014on March 1. Enforcement of order has led to at least 160 arrests and one death.", "At least two elements of the Chilean government's initial response have been criticized in Chile. The first is that the coastal and island communities did not receive timely warning about the tsunami waves that caused so many of the reported casualties. The first tsunami waves hit the coastal city of Valparaiso (330 kilometers northeast of the epicenter) just 34 minutes after the initial earthquake, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But some claim that the tsunami warnings in coastal areas were not clearly transmitted. The Chilean Navy acknowledged their response was partly at fault and a quicker warning would have saved many lives. According to one report, the Chilean Navy received word of the imminent tsunami threatening the coast just 11 minutes after the initial earthquake. However, no warning was issued locally. The President deflected the criticism saying the time is not right to assign blame. On the morning of the catastrophic quake, the President was unable to communicate with many areas in the country. However, after acknowledging their warning system was faulty, the Navy fired the head of its catastrophic warning unit. Bachelet's successor, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has called for a thorough \"modernization\" of the tsunami warning system as his government comes into office.", "The second Chilean government response that has been widely questioned is the speed with which the Chilean military was deployed to quell looting and violence in the disaster zone. Some critics have argued that President Bachelet moved too slowly, suggesting she was mistrustful of the military because of her imprisonment and torture under General Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship more than two decades ago. She began to deploy troops within 48 hours of the earthquake and increased their numbers during the week to a total of 14,000. Troops were welcomed by Chileans both for restoring order and assisting with the ongoing disaster response.", "The rural poor were the most affected by the earthquake. In some small cities, food was unattainable when poorer customers were priced out of the market because merchants sharply raised prices. Some reports said that services were restored and aid provided first to middle class areas. The urban poor living near Santiago lost their electricity and water for much longer than those living in the capital which recovered quickly. One of the most vulnerable populations in Chile is the Mapuche, Chile's largest indigenous group comprising approximately 4% of the Chile's 16.6 million citizens. The Mapuche live mainly in Chile's central and southern regions with their seat of power in La Araucan\u00eda. They suffered many of the difficulties after the earthquake as other poor Chileans; water and electricity were cut off and houses were destroyed or seriously damaged.", "While critics point to weaknesses in the initial government response, later assessments by disaster managers gave the Chilean government higher marks. Aspects of the response that received special attention included: a careful assessment to target foreign assistance so it would complement Chile's rescue and relief efforts; quick restoration of major roads such as the critical North-South highway; and having the military handle logistics. Within ten days of the earthquake, 90% of homes in the disaster area had regular power and water, 500,000 survivors were getting water trucked in, and relief has been distributed by military helicopter, navy ships, and tractor trailers. Many credited the Bachelet government with success given the scope of the disaster and some labeled it a model. In a post quake poll, President Bachelet received an 84% approval rating, leaving office with the highest level of popular support of her presidency.", "The Chilean government's response to the earthquake has been complicated by the fact that President Bachelet departed office on March 11, 2010, and was succeeded by Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, the leader of a center-right coalition that won the country's recent presidential election. Pi\u00f1era was expected to replace all of Bachelet's cabinet ministers and political appointees, including many of those now overseeing relief operations. Recognizing the need for continuity, Pi\u00f1era had earlier indicated that he would retain the head of ONEMI and would ask some of the subregional authorities of the six regions declared catastrophe zones to stay on temporarily. On March 9, 2010, President-elect Pi\u00f1era named key regulators and regional authorities (or intendants as they are called in Chile) to his government before his inauguration, including a new deputy Interior Minister.

It also cannot be assumed that the funds committed to relief actually represent new contributions, since the money may previously have been designated to provide support for the affected country. It will take time to obtain a more complete picture of the actual costs of the disasters in Haiti and Chile and how they will be shared among international donors. Comparing U.S. and international aid is also difficult because of the often dramatically different forms the assistance takes (in-kind contributions vs. cash, for instance). As the situation in Haiti stabilizes, and attention turns to early recovery and reconstruction, sustaining donor interest in Haiti (and commitment to honor existing pledges) could be a challenge. Moreover, this challenge is compounded by the need to maintain funding priorities and secure funds needed for other disaster areas, such as the recent earthquake in Chile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tsunamis and Early Warning33", "paragraphs": ["Due to the fact that the earthquake in Chile occurred offshore, it generated a tsunami which struck parts of the Chilean coastline and offshore islands, causing damage and fatalities. Tsunami warnings were issued by the National Weather Service Pacific Tsunami Warning Center for Hawaii, Japan, and other regions bordering the Pacific Ocean that may have been vulnerable to a damaging tsunami, although most regions far from the epicenter did not experience any serious damage. A tsunami caused significant damage to the city of Hilo, Hawaii, following the May 1960 magnitude 9.5 earthquake that also occurred along the subduction zone fault about 143 miles south of the February 27, 2010, earthquake. Why the 1960 earthquake generated a tsunami that caused damage and fatalities in Hawaii, Japan, and the Philippines while the 2010 earthquake did not is not yet well understood and is being actively studied. In addition, these studies will likely consider the effectiveness of existing early warning systems.", "Subduction zone megathrust faults generate the largest earthquakes in the world. The Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust that stretches from mid-Vancouver island in southern British Columbia southward to Cape Mendocino in northern California has the potential to generate a very large earthquake, similar in magnitude to the February 27 Chilean earthquake. The fault's proximity to the northwestern United States coastline\u2014approximately 50-100 miles offshore\u2014 also poses a significant tsunami hazard; destructive waves from a large earthquake along the fault could reach the coast of Oregon and Washington in less than an hour, possibly as soon as tens of minutes. ", "The Cascadia Subduction Zone fault forms the boundary between the subducting Juan de Fuca tectonic plate and the overriding North American plate, very similar to the relationship between the Nazca Plate and the South American Plate off the Chilean coast. If the Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust were to \"unzip\" or rupture along a large section of its entire length, it would likely generate a megathrust earthquake near magnitude 9 or more, similar to the 1964 Alaskan earthquake, the 1960 and 2010 Chilean earthquakes, and the 2004 Indonesian earthquake. Scientists have documented that the last time this occurred along the Cascadia Subduction Zone fault was in 1700. The 1700 earthquake spawned a tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean and struck Japan. Because of the tectonic similarities between the Cascadia Subduction Zone megathrust and the Nazca-South American plate megathrust, scientists hope to learn a great deal about the seismic hazard in the Pacific Northwest by studying the unique strong ground motion recordings from the 2010 Chilean magnitude 8.8 earthquake."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing Risk Through Building Codes34", "paragraphs": ["The potential damage to Chile's buildings and infrastructure in urban areas was mitigated by the adoption and enforcement of advanced building codes; these codes include requirements aimed at reducing damage from earthquakes' shaking. Assessments of the damage in Chile will provide valuable information on whether changes to Chile's building codes or their enforcement are in order for better managing seismic and tsunami risks. The National Science Foundation and other U.S. federal agencies are supporting or participating in various engineering teams to collect and analyze data from the February 27 event that could inform improvements to international and domestic model building codes.", "Chile has demonstrated its willingness and capacity to create, implement, and enforce building codes and other hazard mitigation measures to reduce loss and injury. Chile has the mechanisms and technical capacity to learn from the quake to improve its codes and policies to support more resilient structures and communities (e.g., improving tsunami warning and communication technologies and protocols). Construction that complies with location appropriate building codes can make structures more resistant to collapse and damage; however, structures are never earthquake proof, and increased structural resiliency typically increases construction costs. ", "Although the Chilean quake was of a larger magnitude than the January 2010 Haitian quake, Chile's urban centers of Concepcion and Santiago experienced less severe shaking than the violent shaking in Port-au-Prince. A combination of more intense shaking, weak building codes and enforcement, and limited preparedness and response capabilities contributed to Haitians facing significantly higher risk than Chileans. How the United States and other nations provide aid to Chile and Haiti is likely to reflect the understanding that multiple actions can reduce risks, including adoption of building codes, in-country technical capacity building, expert technical assistance, and sharing of preparedness and response knowledge and technology.

The U.S. Government Emergency Response Mechanism for International Disasters ", "The United States is generally a leader and major contributor to relief efforts in response to humanitarian disasters. The President has broad authority to provide emergency assistance for foreign disasters and the U.S. government provides disaster assistance through several U.S. agencies. The very nature of humanitarian disasters\u2014the need to respond quickly in order to save lives and provide relief\u2014has resulted in a rather unrestricted definition of what this type of assistance consists of at both a policy and an operational level. While humanitarian assistance is assumed to provide for urgent food, shelter, and medical needs, the agencies within the U.S. government providing this support typically expand or contract the definition in response to circumstances. Funds may be used for U.S. agencies to deliver services or to provide grants to international organizations (IOs), international governmental and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private or religious voluntary organizations (PVOs). The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the U.S. government agency charged with coordinating U.S. government and private sector assistance. It also coordinates with international organizations, the governments of countries suffering disasters, and other governments.", "The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) in USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) provides immediate relief materials and personnel, many of whom are already abroad on mission. It is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance and can quickly assemble Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) to assess conditions. OFDA has wide authority to borrow funds, equipment, and personnel from other parts of USAID and other federal agencies. USAID has two other offices that administer U.S. humanitarian aid: Food For Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). USAID administers emergency food aid under FFP (Title II of P.L. 480) and provides relief and development food aid that does not have to be repaid. OTI provides post-disaster transition assistance, which includes mainly short-term peace and democratization projects with some attention to humanitarian elements but not emergency relief.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) funds three Dodd humanitarian programs: the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) Program, and Foreign Disaster Relief and Emergency Response (FDR/ER). OHDACA provides humanitarian support to stabilize emergency situations and deals with a range of tasks including providing food, shelter and supplies, and medical evacuations. In addition the President has the authority to draw down defense equipment and direct military personnel to respond to disasters. The President may also use the Denton program to provide space-available transportation on military aircraft and ships to private donors who wish to transport humanitarian goods and equipment in response to a disaster.", "Generally, OFDA provides emergency assistance for 30 to 90 days after a disaster. The same is true for Department of Defense humanitarian assistance. After the initial emergency is over, assistance is provided through other channels, such as the regular country development programs of USAID.", "The State Department also administers programs for humanitarian relief with a focus on refugees and the displaced. The Emergency Refugee and Migration Account (ERMA) is a contingency fund that provides wide latitude to the President in responding to refugee emergencies. Assistance to address emergencies lasting more than a year comes out of the regular Migration and Refugee Account (MRA) through the Population, Migration and Refugees (PRM) bureau. PRM assists refugees worldwide, conflict victims, and populations of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), often extended to include internally displaced people (IDPs). Humanitarian assistance includes a range of services from basic needs to community services.", "Appendix D. Legislation in the 111th Congress ", "S.Res. 431 .
