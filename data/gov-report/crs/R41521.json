However, P.L. 112-4 and P.L. 112-6 reduced funding for some L-HHS-ED programs by a total of about $2.5 billion. The House passed a full-year government funding bill, H.R. 1, on February 19, 2011, which would have reduced L-HHS-ED funding by about $25 billion and included several controversial policy riders.

In contrast to the four CRs enacted in 2010, which largely continued funding at FY2010 rates of operations, the two CRs enacted in March 2011 cut overall discretionary budget authority for FY2011 by selectively terminating or reducing funding for some programs and some earmarks. The two-week CR, P.L. 112-4 , reduced FY2011 annualized funding by $4 billion overall compared to FY2010 levels, and the three-week CR, P.L. 112-6 , cut another $6 billion from the annualized total. Within those totals, discretionary programs funded in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (L-HHS-ED) appropriations act were reduced by approximately $1.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For the FY2011 CDC appropriation, the President requested a $131 million (2.0%) decrease, while the Senate committee recommended a $130 million (2.0%) increase, from $6,453 million to $6,583 million. The committee's increase, however, was more than offset in program-level terms by its recommended $214 million decrease in the funding CDC would receive for certain programs through the PHS Evaluation Tap, discussed above. The request and the committee also differed in the amount they planned to use in funding available from a June 2009 supplemental appropriation for pandemic influenza ( P.L. 111-32 ). At the program level, the request and the committee would provide CDC with increases of 1.3% and 2.1%, respectively, over the FY2010 level. In describing total funding available for CDC programs, the committee also recommended that $663 million be transferred to CDC from the FY2011 appropriation of $750 million that was provided to the Prevention and Public Health Fund created by PPACA. Program-level funding for CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) would increase by about 22% in both the request and the Senate committee recommendation, largely to provide a $79 million increase for the World Trade Center program. The committee shifted $70 million of the funds to come from the appropriation instead of from the evaluation tap. National Institutes of Health (NIH). The President requested a $1.0 billion increase (3.2%) for NIH, which was funded at $31.0 billion in FY2010. The Senate committee recommended the same level as the request, $32.0 billion. The committee noted that NIH faces a \"funding cliff\" in FY2011 (a steep drop in funding compared to FY2010) following the large amount of stimulus funding received through ARRA. About $5.7 billion of ARRA money was obligated in FY2010 in addition to regular appropriations. The committee indicated that the $1 billion, 3.2% proposed increase for FY2011 would match the estimated inflation rate for biomedical research. Within the $1 billion increase, the committee included $50 million to create the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) authorized in PPACA. Its statutory language requires that NIH use only specifically appropriated funds to support the CAN. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). The President and the Senate committee substantially agreed on giving SAMHSA an increase of just over 3%, boosting the appropriation from $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. A 10% increase of about $20 million was included for Substance Abuse Prevention activities. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). AHRQ is funded entirely through the PHS evaluation tap, receiving $397 million in FY2010. The President requested an overall increase of $214 million (54%) to $611 million, which included an increase of $252 million (67%) for patient-centered health research, also called comparative effectiveness research (CER). The Senate committee kept total AHRQ funding at $397 million, with $35 million designated for CER. The committee noted that PPACA created the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to manage CER, and stated that it did not want to duplicate that effort. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The CMS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Initiative, first funded in FY2009, was proposed for a $250 million increase (80%), from $311 million to $561 million. The Senate committee agreed to that amount. The President also requested a $131 million increase (3.8%) for CMS Program Management, from $3.5 billion in FY2010 to $3.6 billion. The Senate committee recommended an increase of $104 million, $27 million less than the request. Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The President requested a decrease of $1.8 billion (35%) in discretionary funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which was funded at $5.1 billion in FY2010. A legislative proposal was offered with the budget request that would provide additional mandatory funding if energy prices increased significantly. The Senate committee agreed with the $3.3 billion discretionary funding request, noting that it assumed enactment of the trigger that would provide an estimated $2.0 billion in additional mandatory funding in FY2011, for a total program level of $5.3 billion. ACF Refugee and Entrant Assistance programs. The President requested $878 million for refugee programs, an additional $147 million (20%) above the FY2010 level of $731 million. The Senate committee recommended an increase of $104 million (14%) to $835 million. ACF Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). The President requested $2,927 million for CCDBG, an additional $800 million (38%) above the FY2010 level of $2,127 million. The Senate committee recommended an increase of $1.0 billion (47%) to $3,127 million to maintain the level of funding provided in ARRA. ACF Head Start program. The Senate committee agreed with the President's request to increase funding for Head Start by $990 million (14%), from $7,234 million in FY2010 to $8,224 million. Administration on Aging (AoA). The President requested $1,625 million for AoA aging services programs, an additional $109 million (7.2%) above the FY2010 level of $1,516 million. The Senate committee recommended an increase of $143 million (9.5%) to $1,659 million. Increases were recommended for various caregiver programs, senior nutrition services, and Lifespan Respite Care, among others. Funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers was reduced by $10 million, the amount of a mandatory appropriation to AoA provided by PPACA. Within the Office of the HHS Secretary, the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) supports a number of preparedness, response, and related public health security functions. Total appropriations for the PHSSEF account, which were $1,346 million in FY2010, were decreased in the President's request by $136 million (10%) to $1,211 million. The Senate committee substantially agreed, recommending a total of $1,197 million in discretionary funding, $14 million less than the request. In addition, both the President and the committee planned to use $330 million in available balances from FY2009 funding for pandemic influenza. Within the PHSSEF, Biomedical Advanced Research and Development was proposed for a $136 million (40%) increase from $340 million in FY2010 to $476 million. The Senate committee agreed with the request. Funding for this activity is transferred from the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund. The funds were originally appropriated as multi-year money to the Department of Homeland Security in FY2004, to remain available until FY2013; in FY2010, the remaining balances were transferred to HHS. Also within the PHSSEF, discretionary funding for pandemic influenza preparedness was $341 million in FY2010. For FY2011, the President requested and the Senate committee concurred in decreasing the amount by $275 million, to $66 million. HHS also plans to use $330 million from supplemental FY2009 funds for pandemic influenza contingencies, available until expended, that were provided in P.L. 111-32 in June 2009. L-HHS-ED acts from FY1998 through FY2009 barred federal funding for needle and syringe exchange programs set up to prevent blood-borne infections in intravenous drug users. The FY2010 appropriations act replaced the ban with a prohibition on funding such programs in any location that local public health or law enforcement agencies determine to be inappropriate (\u00a7505 of P.L. 111-117 , Division D). That language is retained in S. 3686 .", "ARRA provided HHS with an additional $21.9 billion in discretionary funding for FY2009, most of which was obligated by the end of FY2010. Some ARRA funds could be obligated in FY2011, and many programs will continue to outlay ARRA funds for the next several years.

As evidence of the perennial volatility of this issue, these provisions have been subject to periodic revision during the annual consideration of L-HHS-ED appropriations. From FY1977 to FY1993, abortions could be funded only when the life of the mother was endangered. The 103 rd Congress modified the provisions to permit federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest. The FY1998 L-HHS-ED appropriations, P.L. 105-78 , extended the Hyde provisions to prohibit the use of federal funds to buy managed care packages that include abortion coverage, except in the cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. The FY1999 L-HHS-ED appropriations, P.L. 105-277 , continued the FY1998 Hyde Amendments with two added provisions: (1) a clarification to ensure that the restrictions apply to all trust fund programs (namely, Medicare), and (2) an assurance that Medicare + Choice plans (now Medicare Advantage) cannot require the provision of abortion services. No changes were made from FY2000 through FY2004.", "The FY2005 L-HHS-ED appropriations, P.L. 108-447 , added a restriction, popularly referred to as the \"Weldon Amendment,\" that prevents federal programs or state or local governments that receive L-HHS-ED funds from discriminating against health care entities that do not provide or pay for abortions or abortion services. The FY2006 through FY2010 L-HHS-ED appropriations retained the Weldon amendment language and the Hyde restrictions.
