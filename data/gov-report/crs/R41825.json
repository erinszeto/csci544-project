A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer data system capable of capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geographically referenced information. The federal government and policy makers increasingly use geospatial information and tools like GIS for producing floodplain maps, conducting the census, mapping foreclosures, congressional redistricting, and responding to natural hazards such as wildfires, earthquakes, and tsunamis. For policy makers, this type of analysis can greatly assist in clarifying complex problems that may involve local, state, and federal government, and affect businesses, residential areas, and federal installations.", "Examples of how GIS and geospatial data are used within and outside the federal government are growing rapidly. In this report, a few examples are provided that describe the real-time or near real-time data analysis in the case of a California wildfire; policy analysis in support of a Base Realignment and Closure decision in Virginia Beach; and analysis of foreclosure patterns using census and other data for the New York City area.

Most recently, the Obama Administration issued supplemental guidance to Circular A-16 that labeled federal geospatial data a capital asset and referred to its acquisition and management in terms analogous to financial assets. How well these \"assets\" are managed depends, in part, on how the federal government is structured to organize and coordinate its geospatial enterprise. That structure is embodied in the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), comprising 10 cabinet-level departments and 9 independent agencies. OMB Circular A-16, via its revisions and supplemental guidance, as well as Executive Order 12906, issued in 2004, gives the FGDC primary responsibility for developing the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI).

The collection and management of geospatial data are considered by many to be the costliest components of a GIS\u2014some experts attribute close to 80% of GIS total costs to data acquisition. ", "Geospatial data can be acquired using a variety of technologies. Land surveyors, census takers, aerial photographers, police, and even average citizens with a GPS-enabled cell phone can collect geospatial data using GPS or street addresses that can be entered into GIS. The attributes of the collected data, such as land-use information, demographics, landscape features, or crime scene observations, can be entered manually or, in the case of a land survey map, digitized from a map format to a digital format by electronic scanning. Remote sensing data from satellites is acquired digitally and communicated to central facilities for processing and analysis in GIS. Digital satellite images, for example, can be analyzed in GIS to produce maps of land cover and land use. When different types of geospatial data are combined in GIS (e.g., through combining satellite remote sensing land use information with aerial photograph data on housing development growth), the data must be transformed so they fit the same coordinates. GIS uses the processing power of a computer, together with geographic mapping techniques (cartography), to transform data from different sources onto one projection and one scale so that the data can be analyzed together."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geospatial Data from Local, State, and Federal Governments and the Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["Local and state governments provide geospatial data for use in GIS for a variety of public services such as land records, property taxation, local planning, subdivision control and zoning, and others. Local governments often contract with private-sector companies to acquire more recent and higher-resolution data than what is available to the federal government. Whether and how the most up-to-date and detailed geospatial information is made available to users other than the local government for which the data were acquired are long-standing issues. For example, in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, it may be important for the federal government to acquire the most current and detailed geospatial information about the disaster area. In many instances, however, impediments to data sharing such as lack of interoperability between systems, restrictions on use, concerns about data security, and a lack of knowledge about what data exist and where the data can be found could hinder a timely and effective emergency response. ", "The federal government sometimes acquires geospatial data for federal needs, such as for updating floodplain maps from paper flood insurance rate maps to a digital format. Assessing the need to update floodplain maps on a periodic basis is required by law, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has spent over $1.4 billion since FY2003 to convert paper flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) to digital flood insurance rate maps (DFIRMs) and to produce a format usable in GIS. Simply converting paper maps to digital formats does not necessarily improve their accuracy, which often depends on the resolution of the original data. New techniques for collecting more data, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), would help produce more accurate floodplain maps. ", "Geospatial data are increasingly acquired and provided by the private sector, and many companies as well as professional organizations support and promote the role of private-sector data providers. One organization, the Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors (MAPPS), bills itself as the only national association exclusively composed of private geospatial firms.

(See Figure 1 for a schematic representation of data layers in GIS.) GIS has the ability to link and integrate information from several different data layers or themes over the same geographic coordinates, which is very difficult to do with any other means. For example, GIS could combine a major road from one data layer as the boundary dividing land zoned for commercial development with the location of wetlands from another data layer. Precipitation data, from a third layer, could be combined with a fourth data layer that shows streams and rivers. GIS could then be used to calculate where and how much runoff might flow from the commercial development into the wetlands.

It forced the evacuation of 10,000 people and shut down major freeways near the town of Sylmar on the edge of the Angeles National Forest. The speed of the fire's progress made it difficult to know where the fire was heading and to visualize escape routes. In addition, the fire jumped Interstate 210 (I-210) and Interstate 5 (I-5), two major routes of egress, on Saturday, November 15.

The City of Virginia Beach, VA, used GIS in its response to the 2005 BRAC Commission's recommendation to realign Naval Air Station Oceana, located near the population center of the city. The BRAC Commission was concerned that the city's land use was encroaching on the air station; in particular, the city was impinging on the noise zones and accident potential zone (APZ) around the air station. Because the recommended realignment of Oceana would likely cause Virginia Beach to suffer significant economic losses, the city sought to establish a baseline\u2014using GIS\u2014to understand the status of encroachment. In addition, the GIS analysis could inform city leaders about how to modify the municipal land use ordinance to prevent encroachment on the air station and forestall its realignment.
