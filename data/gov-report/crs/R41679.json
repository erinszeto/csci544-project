BP has either directly funded oil spill response operations or reimbursed the federal government for actions taken by various agencies. BP has paid damage claims well above its liability limit and outside the scope of its liable damages.", "Although evidence indicates that the levels of current framework (liability limits and OSLTF) may be sufficient to address the more common mix of spills that have historically occurred, the current combination of liability limits and $1 billion per-incident OSLTF cap is not sufficient to withstand a spill with damages/costs that exceed a responsible party's liability limit by $1 billion. Even if the per-incident cap were increased, the current (and projected) level of funds in the OSLTF may not be sufficient to address costs from a catastrophic spill.", "The options available to address these issues depend upon the overall objective of Congress. One objective\u2014which has been expressed by many in and outside Congress\u2014is to provide full restoration and timely compensation (i.e., through channels other than litigation) for the impacts from the spill, without directly burdening the general taxpayers. If this is the objective, Congress may consider some combination of (1) increasing the offshore facility liability limit and corresponding financial responsibility demonstration; (2) increasing the OSLTF per-incident cap; or (3) increasing the level of funds available in the OSLTF. In addition, policymakers may want to consider an industry-financed fund, akin to the nuclear power industry's fund, that could supplement or potentially replace the current system.", "Another objective might be to maintain the existing system, which may be sufficient to address all but the most extreme scenarios.

Liability limits are not unique to OPA and limits existed in several federal statutes preceding OPA. (For a historical comparison of liability limits see Table A-2 in the Appendix to this report.) However, the limits are not automatic, but conditional. First, the liability limits do not apply to situations involving acts of gross negligence or willful misconduct. Second, liability limits do not apply if the violation of a federal safety, construction, or operating requirement proximately caused the spill. Third, parties must report the incident and cooperate with response officials to maintain their liability caps. According to the National Pollution Funds Center\u2014an office of the U.S. Coast Guard that manages the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund (discussed below)\u2014liability limits are \"not usually well defined until long after response,\" and litigation may be required to resolve the issue. ", "The liability limits differ based on the source of the oil spill ( Table A-2 ). The limits for most sources are simple dollar amounts. ", "Vessel liability limits are generally based on the size of the vessel (measured in gross tonnage). For example, a tank vessel matching the size of the Exxon Valdez (95,000 gross tons) would have a cap of either $304 million (single-hull) or $190 million (double hull). Onshore facility (which includes pipelines) liability is limited to $350 million. Although OPA allows the President to decrease this limit through regulations, this authority has not been exercised. Deepwater port (e.g., Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, LOOP) liability is limited to $350 million. OPA authorizes the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating (i.e., Homeland Security) to adjust this limit to not less than $50 million. This authority was exercised in 1995, setting the liability limit at $62 million, and subsequently increased to $87 million in 2009. Offshore facilities (like the BP oil well involved in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill) have unlimited liability for oil removal (cleanup) costs and a $75 million limit on other damages\u2014natural resources and the five categories of economic damages (listed above). Mobile offshore drilling units (MODUs), like the Deepwater Horizon , are first treated as tank vessels for their liability cap. If removal and damage costs exceed this liability cap, a MODU is deemed to be an offshore facility for the excess amount.", "OPA requires the President to issue regulations to adjust the liability limits at least every three years to take into account changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Despite this requirement, adjustments to liability limits were not made until Congress amended OPA in July 2006 ( Table A-2 ). As of the date of this report, onshore and offshore facility liability limits remain at the same level established in 1990.

OPA does not have an analogous requirement for onshore facilities. ", "The current levels of financial responsibility are related to the current liability limits for various sources (e.g., vessels, offshore facilities) of potential oil spills. The liability limits differ by potential source. In the case of vessels, whose liability limits are a single dollar amount encompassing both removal costs and other damages, the financial responsibility levels are directly tied to the corresponding liability caps. Current law requires responsible parties for vessels to demonstrate the \"maximum amount of liability to which the responsible party could be subjected under [the liability limits in OPA Section 1004; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2704].\"", "Because the structure of offshore facility liability limit is different than vessels (liability for removal costs is unlimited), the corresponding financial responsibility limit provisions differ. Responsible parties for offshore facilities in federal waters must demonstrate $35 million financial responsibility, unless the President determines a greater amount (not to exceed $150 million) is justified (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 2716(c)).

Although such a shift would likely reduce the risk of depleting the OSLTF during a catastrophic spill, the OSTLF would continue to provide multiple functions, including a role as a compensation backstop. Within a system of unlimited liability, the risk remains that the responsible party would fail to meets its compensation obligations (for whatever reason), and the OSLTF would continue to provide funds. ", "Indeed, raising or removing the liability limits would not guarantee that a company would be able to fund all response costs and compensate all affected parties.

Along this line of reasoning, increased liability provisions (and corresponding financial responsibility demonstrations) may preclude (relatively) smaller companies from offshore operations and increase the marketshare of the small group of major oil companies.

At least one proposal from the 111 th Congress included provisions that would have addressed this issue. ", "A related concern shared by some Members of Congress is the time period embedded in the OPA claims process. Before seeking compensation from the OSLTF, claimants must first submit their claim to the responsible party. If the claim is not settled within 90 days, the claimant may either pursue the claim through the OSLTF or seek recourse through litigation. Many argued that the 90-day clock was too long for impacted parties to wait, and several proposals from the 111 th Congress would have altered the waiting period (many shortening the clock to 45 days). At least one proposal in the 112 th Congress would amend this provision.", "During the GCCF claims process, several stakeholders have criticized the \"proximate cause\" language of various GCCF protocols, arguing that such provisions are not consistent with OPA and its claims process. The issue has evolved, with the GCCF Administrator addressing the concerns to some degree. The GCCF's August 2010 Emergency Advance Payment Protocol text read:", "The GCCF will only pay for harm or damage that is proximately caused by the Spill. The GCCF's causation determinations of OPA claims will be guided by OPA and federal law interpreting OPA and the proximate cause doctrine. Determinations of non-OPA claims will be guided by applicable law. The GCCF will take into account, among other things, geographic proximity, nature of industry, and dependence upon injured natural resources.", "In October 2010, Administrator Feinberg announced the GCCF was removing the geographic proximity text (referred to as the \"geographic test\") for claim eligibility that is part of the above protocol. The interim and final claim protocol now reads:", "The GCCF will only pay for harm or damage that is proximately caused by the Spill. The GCCF's causation determinations of OPA claims will be guided by OPA and federal law interpreting OPA. Determinations of physical injury and death claims will be guided by applicable law.", "The relevant OPA provision does not specifically address geographic proximity, but states that \"each responsible party for a vessel or a facility from which oil is discharged, or which poses the threat of a discharge of oil is liable for the removal costs and damages \u2026 that result from such an incident.\" Moreover, neither the implementing regulations (33 C.F.R. Part 136) nor OSLTF claim guidance documents indicates that proximate cause is a consideration. Of course, as a practical matter the OSLTF must apply some cut-off akin to proximate cause so that injuries far down the causal chain of events following a spill are not compensated.", "On this matter, the Presidential Deepwater Commission concluded:", "There is no easy legal answer to the question of how closely linked those lost profits or earnings must be to the spill before they should be deemed compensable. The search for such a rational endpoint for liability has already stymied the Gulf Coast Claims Facility in its processing of claims."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Options for Policymakers", "paragraphs": ["The current combination of liability limits and $1 billion per-incident cap is not sufficient to withstand a spill with damages/costs that exceed a responsible party's liability limit (assuming it would apply) by $1 billion. Even if the per-incident cap were increased, the current (and projected) level of funds in the OSLTF may not be sufficient to address costs from a catastrophic spill.", "The options available to address these issues depend upon on the overall objective of Congress. One objective\u2014which has been expressed by many in and outside Congress\u2014is to provide full restoration and timely compensation for the impacts from a catastrophic spill, without directly burdening the general taxpayers. In the context of this objective, \"timely\" compensation means that an injured party would have access to compensation without going through a court system, which would likely require more of a claimant's time and resources. With that objective in mind, several options are discussed below.", "Potential options for Congress include (but are not limited to) the following, many of which were proposed in various legislation in the 111 th Congress and some of which are included in proposals in the 112 th Congress:", "Increase the liability limits, so that the responsible party would be required to pay a greater portion of the total spill cost before accessing trust fund dollars. Congress may consider different limits for different offshore activities. Precedent exists in OPA for setting different liability limits to account for different oil spill risks: The liability limit for single-hulled tank vessels is approximately 50% higher than for double-hulled vessels. In the outer continental shelf (OCS) oil exploration and development sector, policymakers may consider a wide array of factors that could influence (1) the risk of an oil spill occurring and (2) the risk that the oil spill could not be contained before impacting sensitive ecosystems and/or affecting large populations. Policymakers could then structure the liability limit framework based on certain behavior, the use of specific technologies, and/or the location of the activity. However, CRS is not aware of a comprehensive risk assessment of individual factors (or their combinations) regarding OCS drilling activities. A rigorous analysis of possible risk factors could be instructive to policymakers. Increase the required financial responsibility coverage, either matching the increased liability limit (as OPA requires for vessels) or setting the coverage at a level based on other factors, such as capacity in the insurance market. Congress could increase coverage amounts through a staggered approach, to allow more time for the market to adjust. Remove or raise the per-incident cap on the trust fund. If removed entirely, the fund could be at risk of depletion with one incident. Increase the per-barrel oil tax to more quickly raise the fund's balance. Authorize \"repayable advances\" to be made (via the appropriations process) to the trust fund, so that the fund would have the resources to carry out its functions (cleanup efforts, claim awards). Up until 1995, the fund had this authority, in order to ensure it could respond to a major spill before the fund had an opportunity to grow (via the per-barrel tax). Require industry to establish a pool of funds (of significant magnitude) that would be available to finance response actions, injured party compensation, or both. Such a fund could either replace or complement the existing OPA system of individual liability and support from the OSLTF. This would be analogous to the framework for the nuclear power industry created by the Price-Anderson Act (primarily Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210). ", "Another objective might be to maintain the existing system, which may be sufficient to address all but the most extreme scenarios. Catastrophic spills in U.S. waters have historically been rare. Some may argue that establishing a system that can withstand a catastrophic event would impose costs and yield consequences that would not justify the (expected) ability to address a catastrophic event.", "Interest in issues raised by the 2010 Gulf oil spill has waned in recent months. However, Members in the 112 th Congress have introduced multiple proposals, many of which would address liability and compensation framework issues. Legislative activity in the 112 th Congress may be influenced by several factors, including (but not limited to) assessments of conditions in the Gulf region, reports from other independent inquiries, further information regarding the claims process, and results from the natural resource damage assessment process. Moreover, it may be worth noting that passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 occurred 18 months after the Exxon Valdez spill."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
