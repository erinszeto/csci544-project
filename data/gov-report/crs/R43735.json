GAO has observed that the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has limited authority to question information on the labor attestation form and to initiate enforcement activities. In 2011, GAO identified several weaknesses in the H-1B program's ability to protect workers: (1) oversight that is fragmented between four agencies and restricted by law; (2) lack of legal authority to hold employers accountable to program requirements when they obtain H-1B workers through a staffing company; and (3) expansions that have increased the pool of H-1B workers beyond the cap and lowered the bar for eligibility.", "A 2008 internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigation of H-1B visa adjudications found a 13.4% fraud rate as well as a 7.3% technical violation rate.

The investigation also discovered that some petitioning employers shifted the burden of paying various filing fees to foreign workers. A 2010 DHS investigation found a 14% \"not verified\" rate, which U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officials cited to suggest a reduced level of fraud in the H-1B program.

Others express concern that the L-1 visa has become a substitute for the H-1B visa, noting that L-1 employees are often comparable in skills and occupations to H-1B workers, yet lack the labor market protections the law sets for hiring H-1B workers. These concerns have been raised, in particular, with respect to certain outsourcing and information technology firms that employ L-1 workers as subcontractors within the United States. A related concern is that an unchecked use of L-1 visas will foster the transfer of STEM and other high-skilled professional jobs overseas, as managers and specialists gain experience in the United States before they transfer the operations abroad. After investigating the L-1 visa, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General offered this assessment: \"That so many foreign workers seem to qualify as possessing specialized knowledge appears to have led to the displacement of American workers, and to what is sometimes called the 'body shop' problem.\" Legislation to address these concerns is frequently linked with H-1B reform.", "On the other hand, concern has been expressed about the increase in denials of L-1 visas as well as the increase in requests for additional evidence in order to adjudicate the L petition. Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy analyzed the subset of L-1 petitions for employees with specialized knowledge (L-1B). Over a 10-year period from FY2004 to FY2013, denials of L-1B petitions rose from 10% in FY2004 to 34% in FY2013. The same study reported that requests for additional evidence went from 2% of L-1B petitions to 46% of L-1B petitions. Immigration attorney and former chief counsel at USCIS Lynden Melmed is quoted as saying, \"(I)t is very difficult for companies to make business decisions when there is so much uncertainty in the L-1 visa process.

About half of all employment-based lawful permanent residents (LPRs) have been working in the United States on temporary visas. More specifically, 46% of the foreign nationals who became employment-based LPRs in the United States during the decade of 2000-2009 had formerly held H-1B visas. Over this same time period, almost half (48.6%) of employment-based principals who were deemed extraordinary/priority workers had been L intracompany transferees. ", "More recently, the OPT status may provide the link for foreign students to become employment-based LPRs. Many anecdotal accounts tell of foreign students who are hired by U.S. firms as they are completing their programs. Employers may opt to hire them as OPT to extend their F-1 visas. According to DHS: \"This extension of the OPT period for STEM degree holders gives U.S. employers two chances to recruit these highly desirable graduates through the H-1B process, as the extension is long enough to allow for H-1B petitions to be filed in two successive fiscal years.\" If the temporary foreign workers meet expectations, the employers may also petition for them to become LPRs through one of the employment-based immigration categories. ", "Over 90% of employment-based LPRs are adjusting from a temporary visa category to LPR status within the United States, rather than newly arriving from abroad. Because the INA requires most foreign nationals seeking to qualify for a nonimmigrant visa to demonstrate that they are not coming to reside permanently, these adjustment of status statistics prompt further explanation on the exceptions noted in the law.

(i.e., generally, a foreign national applying for a temporary visa cannot also be seeking an LPR visa). Specifically, \u00a7214(b) of the INA generally presumes that all aliens seeking admission to the United States are coming to live permanently; as a result, most foreign nationals seeking to qualify for a nonimmigrant visa must demonstrate that they are not coming to reside permanently.
