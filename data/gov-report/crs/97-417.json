In most cases, the crops themselves have not been controversial. However, where tobacco is involved, the use of federal funds has been called into question. Taken together, all of the directly tobacco-related activities of the USDA generated net expenditures of an estimated $30.8 million in FY2006, and the budget anticipates net expenditures of $29.5 million for FY2007. Over 90% of this spending is related to crop insurance.", "The federally financed tobacco price support program, once the major form of tobacco farmer assistance and in some years a costly program, was terminated at the end of crop year 2004. The USDA is prohibited by language in the annual appropriations law from spending funds to help promote tobacco exports and to conduct research relating to production, processing, or marketing of tobacco and tobacco products. Other tobacco-related activities have been subjected to congressional scrutiny. The USDA does operate numerous programs that are not tobacco-specific, but are available to farmers that produce tobacco and other crops. These are not examined in this report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Price Support Program", "paragraphs": ["From the late 1930s through the 2004 crop, the USDA operated the tobacco price support program. It was designed to raise and stabilize farm tobacco prices at higher levels than they otherwise would have reached. This was accomplished through a combination of farm marketing quotas and federal nonrecourse commodity loans. Administration was done through the county offices of the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and loan program funding was provided through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). In 1982, legislation was adopted that applied an assessment on all tobacco marketings to be used to offset price support losses and make the loan operations function at no net cost to taxpayers. On two occasions legislation relieved the program of its obligations on large inventories. These actions cost about $1 billion. In addition, Congress made so-called tobacco loss payments of $852 million during FY2000-FY2003 to offset a sharp decline in farm sales to domestic and foreign buyers. Overall, from FY1982 through FY2005, tobacco support net expenditures totaled about $1.57 billion, for an annual average cost of $71 million.", "After Congress enacted the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ), the tobacco support program came to an end. Tobacco quota owners and farm operators were compensated for the diminished value of their farms and the loss of future support with a payment of $9.6 billion over 10 years, funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers. Because of this tobacco buyout, CCC support program expenditures have been eliminated, and it is not anticipated there will be any future ad hoc assistance to tobacco farmers. FSA administrative expenditures associated with the buyout are estimated to be $1.827 million in FY2006, and the budget for FY2007 is zero.", "(For additional information, see CRS Report RS20802, Tobacco Farmer Assistance , and CRS Report RS22046, Tobacco Quota Buyout .)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Crop Insurance", "paragraphs": ["The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, provides farmers with subsidized multi-peril insurance on tobacco and other crops. The insurance covers unavoidable production losses due to adverse weather, insect infestations, plant diseases, and other natural calamities. It does not cover avoidable losses caused by neglect or poor farming practices. Sales and servicing of policies are done by private companies with some federal reimbursement, and most of the net indemnity losses fall upon the government. Additionally, the premiums have been subsidized since 1980 in order to encourage participation and avoid enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance programs. Experimental Crop Revenue Coverage, available for wheat, corn, and soybeans, is not available for tobacco.", "Total net federal expenditures for tobacco crop insurance coverage include outlays for crop loss indemnity payments, plus the premium subsidies, plus sales administrative expenses, less the farmer-paid premiums.

The establishment of uniform standards of quality, with grading by unbiased experts, helps assure that auction markets perform efficiently and fairly. Historically, federal grading provided an assurance of quality for tobacco held as collateral for CCC price support loans. Additionally, imported and domestic tobacco is inspected voluntarily to guard against illegal pesticide residues. Since 1981, the grading and inspection services have been financed through user fees (now set at $0.62 per 100 pounds for grading and $0.85 per 100 pounds for pesticide testing). These fees are sufficient to fully cover the costs of inspection activities as well as the cost of developing and maintaining the standards applied by the inspectors. This has dramatically reduced the use of AMS inspectors. AMS inspection work now is done on imported tobacco, as nearly all of the domestic crop is contracted for sale rather than auctioned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market News Services", "paragraphs": ["The Agricultural Marketing Service provides a market news service for sellers and buyers of tobacco.

Market news services are designed to provide farmers, and others in the marketing chain, with timely, accurate, and unbiased information on market conditions, to help them make better decisions on where and when to sell and buy commodities.

Annual research spending by the USDA averaged about $6.6 million until it was terminated under the FY1995 agricultural appropriations law and subsequent laws. The restriction does not apply to research on medical, biotechnological, food, and industrial uses of tobacco.

The state extension staff, given their close proximity to researchers, continuously trains the county agents and designs and prepares materials for use by the county agents.
