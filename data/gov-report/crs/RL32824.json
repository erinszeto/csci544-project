As crime became more rampant, the federal government increased its involvement in crime control efforts. Over a period of 10 years, Congress passed five major anti-crime bills and increased appropriations for federal assistance to state and local law enforcement agencies. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, however, federal law enforcement efforts have been focused more on countering terrorism and maintaining homeland security. Amid these efforts, however, Congress continues to address many crime-related issues.", "Many have attributed the increased attention the federal government gave to crime issues in the 1980s and 1990s to the rising crime rate. The violent crime rate, for example, began to increase in the 1960s, continuing to rise in the mid-1990s before starting to decline in the late-1990s. The continued decline in the violent crime rate in the early 2000's coincided with national attention being focused away from domestic crimes and more on securing the homeland against terrorism. During this period, Congress began to increase federal funding to homeland security-related activities. In 2005, however, the violent crime rate began to increase and continued to increase in 2006, before declining again in 2007. The increase in the violent crime rate in 2005 and 2006, however, continues to remain at an over 30 year low.", "The 110th Congress is considering a variety of crime-related legislation, some of which has either been enacted, reported out of committee, and/or passed one or the other Chamber.

In addition to the aforementioned legislation, other crime-related issues have surfaced during the 110th Congress that could warrant congressional action, such as the U.S. Sentencing Commission amending the federal sentencing guidelines by lowering the recommended penalties for crack cocaine offenses in an effort to alleviate some of the issues associated with the sentencing disparity in current law between crack and powder cocaine; reforming the Federal Prison Industries; reforming the federal sentencing system; and providing oversight of the various Department of Justice grant programs.

As a result, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had seen an expansion of its role in fighting domestic crime as Congress began to add more crimes to the federal criminal code that were previously under the sole jurisdiction of state and local governments. Within the past several years, however, some federal assistance to state and local law enforcement has declined, and the FBI refocused its resources on countering terrorism as federal post-9/11 law enforcement efforts have focused primarily on protecting the nation against terrorist attacks.", "The policy question facing Congress is what is the role of the federal government in crime control?

The Part I index includes the four major violent crimes of homicide and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The Part II index includes the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson.

The National Crime Victim Survey (NCVS), which is administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), is a comprehensive, nation-wide survey of victimization in the United States. Since not all crimes are reported to local law enforcement, NCVS data attempts to address under-reporting issues in the UCR by asking respondents if they have been victimized any time in the past year. Each year, data are obtained from a nationally representative sample of 77,200 households comprising nearly 134,000 persons on the frequency, characteristics and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States. The NCVS asks respondents if they have been the victim of rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft. NCVS data allows DOJ Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to estimate the likelihood of victimization for the population as a whole as well as for segments of the population such as women, the elderly, members of various racial groups, city dwellers, or other groups.

Before a crime is labeled a hate crime, law enforcement must reveal sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by his or her bias. There is little disagreement that some criminal acts are motivated due to a bias based on race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. There is , however, disagreement with respect to the level of federal intervention. While some argue that greater federal involvement would ensure that such crimes are systematically addressed, others contend that federal involvement would be redundant to the legal prohibitions for these crimes (in their traditional form) that already exist under either federal or state law.", "For several Congresses, attempts had been made to stiffen penalties for crimes of violence motivated by bias.

There has been recent discussion of reinstating parole at the federal level (for non-violent, drug offenders) and creating and enhancing existing programs that are designed to provide assistance for offenders to prepare them for reentry into their communities. Many studies have shown that reentry initiatives that combine work training and placement with counseling and housing assistance can significantly reduce recidivism rates. Within the federal government and the academic community, a broad consensus exists that offender reentry can typically be divided into three phases: programs that prepare offenders to reenter society while they are in prison, programs that connect ex-offenders with services immediately after they are released from prison, and programs that provide long-term support and supervision for ex-offenders as they settle into communities permanently.

In 1995, 1997, 2002 and 2007, the Commission reported to Congress on the disparity in penalties for crack and powder cocaine offenses. In the first report, the Commission called for Congress to equalize the quantities between crack and powder cocaine that trigger a mandatory minimum penalty. However, in their 2002 and 2007 reports, the Commission recommended that the 5-year and 10-year \"trigger\" quantities for crack cocaine be raised, but not to the level of powder cocaine.

The question of whether FPI is unfairly competing with private businesses, particularly small businesses, in the federal market has been and continues to be an issue of debate. At the core of the debate is FPI's preferential treatment over the private sector. FPI's enabling legislation and the Federal Acquisition Regulation require federal agencies, with the exception of the Department of Defense, to procure products offered by FPI, unless authorized by FPI to solicit bids from the private sector.

The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Chapter II of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984; P.L. 98-473 ), in essence, eliminated indeterminate sentencing at the federal level. The act created the United States Sentencing Commission (Commission), an independent body within the judicial branch of the federal government and charged it with promulgating guidelines for federal sentencing. The purpose of the Commission was to examine unwarranted disparity in federal sentencing policy, among other things. In establishing sentencing guidelines for federal judges, the Commission took into consideration factors such as (1) the nature and degree of harm caused by the offense; (2) the offender's prior record; (3) public views of the gravity of the offense; (4) the deterrent effect of a particular sentence; and (5) aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In addition to these factors, the Commission also considered characteristics of the offender, such as age, education, vocational skills, and mental or emotional state, among other things. Prior to the recent Supreme Court ruling ( U.S. v. Booker , see discussion below), the guidelines were binding, and they were also subject to statutory directives, including mandatory minimum penalties for specific offenses set by Congress.", "On January 12, 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury requires that the current federal sentencing guidelines be advisory, rather than mandatory. In doing so, the Court struck down a provision in law that made the federal sentencing guidelines mandatory, as well as a provision that governed the standards of appellate review of departures from the guidelines. In essence, the Court's ruling gives federal judges discretion in sentencing offenders by not requiring them to adhere to the guidelines unless the offense carried a mandatory sentence; rather the guidelines can be used by judges on an advisory basis. As a result of the ruling, judges now have discretion in sentencing defendants unless the offense carries a mandatory sentence (as specified in the law). While some view the ruling as an opportunity for federal judges to take into consideration the circumstances unique to each individual offender, thus handing down a sentence that better fits the offender, others fear that such discretion may result in unwarranted disparity and inconsistencies in sentencing across jurisdictions that led to the enactment of the guidelines in 1984.", "As a result of the ruling, many questioned whether Congress should amend current law to require federal judges to follow guided sentences, or permit federal judges to use their discretion in sentencing under certain circumstances. Possible congressional options include (1) amend the sentencing ranges by increasing the top of each guideline range to the statutory maximum for each given offense; (2) require jury trial or defendant waiver for any enhancement factor that would increase the sentence for which the defendant did not waive his rights; or (3) take no action, thus permitting judicial discretion in sentencing in cases where Congress has not specified mandatory sentences."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintaining the Fugitive Database", "paragraphs": ["On September 18, 2008, the Senate Judiciary Committee amended and favorably reported (without a written report) the Fugitive Information Networked Database Act of 2008 (or the FIND Act; S. 3136 ).
