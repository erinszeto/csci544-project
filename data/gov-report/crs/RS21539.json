All House vacancies are filled by special election. Scheduling for special elections is largely dependent upon the amount of time remaining beforethenext regular elections for the House. When a vacancy occurs during the first session of Congress, a special electionisalways scheduled for the earliest possible time, preferably to coincide with elections regularly scheduled for otherpurposes in the district.", "If, however, a seat becomes vacant within six months of the end of a Congress, some states hold a special election forthe balance of the congressional term on the same day as the regular election.
