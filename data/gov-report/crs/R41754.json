However, the FY2011 estimated average allocation of $1.9 million is a reversal of that recent trend. For FY2011, the average allocation is 34.5% less than the amount appropriated in FY2000. The decline in the average grant amount is both a function of fewer dollars appropriated and an increase in the number of entitlement communities as more cities and counties achieve the population threshold necessary to be designated an entitlement community.
