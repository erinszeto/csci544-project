Numerous proposals were introduced in 2007 that would alter aspects of the current U.S. food safety system; some of these bills could receive consideration in 2008. This report provides an overview of the current system, highlights major issues in the debate to improve it, and describes the bills.", "Reorganization of Food Safety Responsibilities. Critics believe that the current system is fragmented and inefficient, threatening food safety; others believe that, while improvements could be made, reorganization is not the most appropriate response. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 2419, the omnibus farm bill, would establish a commission to recommend changes.", "Food Import Oversight. U.S. food imports have been increasing significantly, raising questions about whether U.S. safeguards, generally established at a time when most Americans obtained their foods domestically, sufficiently protect public health. Pending proposals would variously require foreign countries and establishments to seek U.S. certification before importing into the United States; expand oversight of food imports; and/or charge fees on such imports to cover oversight costs.", "Notification and Recall Authority; Traceability. Generally, neither the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) nor USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has explicit statutory authority to order a recall of adulterated foods, to require a company to notify them when it has distributed such foods, or to impose penalties if recall requirements are violated. P.L. 110-85, which comprises wide-ranging FDA amendments, includes a requirement that FDA establish a registry for reporting potentially adulterated foods. The Senate-passed version of the farm bill contains a similar requirement for FSIS-regulated foods. Still pending are numerous bills containing provisions for mandatory recall authority. Several bills also would require agencies to set up systems for tracing foods from their source of production to final sale.", "State-Inspected Meat and Poultry. Federally but not state-inspected meat and poultry may be shipped across state lines. Both the Senate- and House-passed versions of the pending farm bill would allow state-inspected products into interstate commerce, but under very different approaches.", "Other Proposals.

For example, more than 200 confirmed illnesses and three deaths were linked in the autumn of 2006 to the consumption of bagged fresh spinach grown in California and carrying the bacterium E. coli O157:H7. The incident raised public concerns about the safety of all fresh leafy produce and stimulated a number of industry and government initiatives to limit future contamination. Large recalls of various meat and poultry products due to findings of E. coli O157:H7, Listeria , and other problems occurred throughout 2007. In February of that year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a nationwide recall of Peter Pan and Great Value brands peanut\u00a0butter produced in a Georgia ConAgra plant due to Salmonella contamination, after hundreds of illnesses, dating back to August 2006 and linked to the bacterium, were reported by public health officials.", "At issue is whether the current food safety system has the resources, authority, and structural organization to safeguard the health of American consumers, who spend more than $1 trillion on food each year. Also at issue is whether federal food safety laws, first enacted in the early 1900s, have kept pace with the significant changes that have occurred in the food production, processing, and marketing sectors since then.", "Attention shifted to the safety of food imports in early 2007 when pet food ingredients imported from China sickened or killed an unknown number of dogs and cats and subsequently were found in some hog, chicken, and fish feed. In June 2007, FDA announced that it was detaining all imports of certain types of farm-raised seafood from China (specifically, shrimp, catfish, basa, dace, and eel) until the shippers could confirm that they are free of unapproved drug residues.", "These and other developments made food safety a top issue for a number of lawmakers in the first session of the 110 th Congress. Several of them called for changes in the U.S. food safety system and/or funding increases that they assert are needed to meet current obligations to protect consumers from unsafe food. Perceived gaps in federal safeguards were explored at a number of congressional hearings in 2007. Several reports and studies released in 2007 by the Bush Administration also called for changes or increased resources in the system.", "Bills addressing various aspects of the issue have been introduced. Many appear to focus on ensuring the safety of imported foods, and/or on strengthening the ability of federal agencies to identify and recall contaminated products. Several call for a more sweeping overhaul of existing statutes, including one that would combine responsibility for all food safety under a single new agency.
