The second are those MBSs that are packaged and issued by private market participants (i.e., mortgage companies, savings and loans, and commercial banks), known as private label MBSs. ", "The laws governing the issuance of these two types of MBSs are different. MBSs offered by the GSEs and Ginnie Mae are exempt from the registration requirements and ongoing disclosure obligations contained in the federal securities laws. Private label MBSs do not enjoy a blanket exemption from the federal securities laws and are classified by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a type of \"asset-backed security\" (ABS) that must register under the Securities Act of 1933 ('33 Act or Securities Act) or obtain an exemption and provide continuing disclosures required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ('34 Act or Exchange Act).", "This report will provide an overview of the registration requirements for private label MBSs under the Securities Act. It also highlights the most frequently used exemptions for private label MBSs.

A registration statement consists of two parts: a prospectus, which must be delivered with every offer to sell the securities and contain the information outlined in Section 10 of the Securities Act, and other information which need not be provided to potential purchasers but must be on file with the SEC and available for public inspection. Failure to file a registration statement when one is required results in a violation of Section 5 of the '33 Act and strict liability under Section 12(a)(1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Registration Statement for Private Label MBSs", "paragraphs": ["Sections 4 and 5 of the Securities Act require issuers of securities to register the offerings and provide prospectuses for sales that are not exempt. Sections 7 and 10 of the Securities Act prescribe the information required in the registration statements and prospectuses that are issued pursuant to offerings under Sections 4 and 5. Section 7 requires the registration statement to contain the information and documents outlined in Schedule A (15 U.S.C. \u00a777aa), which is the Schedule under which all issuers that are not foreign governments must file. Section 7 grants the Commission the power to prescribe rules and regulations describing the information and documents to be contained in registration statements if the Commission deems them to be \"necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\"", "Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has designed registration statements, which correspond to the various types of securities and types of issuers of securities. For private label MBSs, issuers must use either registration statement Form S-1 or Form S-3. Form S-3 is the preferable registration statement type for most issuers because it is considered to be less burdensome than other types of registration statements. In order to be eligible for Form S-3, in most cases, the registrant must already have a class of securities registered pursuant to Sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a778 l ), or be required to file reports pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act for at least the preceding 12 months (15 U.S.C. \u00a778o). The Commission included this requirement under the theory that information contained in the disclosures required by these sections could be incorporated by reference into the new MBS registration, thereby reducing the work required to prepare a new MBS registration statement. The registrant must also have filed all reports required in a timely manner within the previous 12 months.", "If the MBS offering qualifies as an offering of investment grade securities, however, the requirements for use of Form S-3 are slightly different. A non-convertible security (such as an MBS) may qualify as an investment grade security if, at the time of sale, \"at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization ... has rated the security in one of its generic rating categories which signifies investment grade; typically, the four highest rating categories (within which there may be sub-categories or gradations indicating relative standing) signify investment grade.\" An offering of investment grade MBSs occurs when MBSs that qualify as investment grade are offered for cash and delinquent assets within the asset pool do not constitute 20% or more of the pool (measured in dollar volume).", "If the offering is an offering of investment grade MBSs, the registrant is not required to have securities registered pursuant to Sections 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a778 l ) or be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a778o) in order to register using Form S-3. The issuer of an offering of investment grade MBSs still must have filed all reports required in the previous 12 calendar months in a timely fashion to qualify to use Form S-3.

This is a popular method of registration for private label MBSs. Mortgage related securities, a subset of MBSs, automatically qualify for \"shelf-registration.\" Even if the private label MBS offering in question is not a mortgage related security, the private label MBS offering may qualify for shelf-registration nonetheless. ", "For private label MBS offerings, the securities may remain on the \"shelf\" for up to three years from the initial effective date. Once the company \"takes down\" the securities for sale, if there has been a change involving the structural features of the MBSs, credit enhancement or other aspects of the MBSs that were not described in the base prospectus, a new registration statement, or post-effective amendment may be required. Some changes do not warrant such labor intensive disclosure, however, and the changes may be described in the final prospectus filed with the SEC.

Regulation AB is tailored specifically to various types of asset-backed securities (like MBSs). The Commission realized that disclosures required by other SEC regulations were not properly tailored to elicit useful information for MBS investors. Other regulations required too much information irrelevant to MBSs and little or no information about other aspects of MBSs that investors needed in order to make informed investment decisions. Therefore, Regulation AB requires more information about the assets in a particular securitized pool, delinquent assets in the pool, the structure of the transaction, the experience of the servicer of the asset pool as well as other parties involved in administering the particular asset pool at issue, and other information unique to offerings of asset-backed securities (like credit enhancements on the asset pool).
