Among its many provisions, the law modified subscriber eligibility for distant and local analog broadcast network television signals. Some satellite television subscribers had to choose between either local or distant broadcast network signals instead of receiving both. This report explains the provisions in SHVERA, and outlines subsequent court decisions involving direct broadcast satellite providers, including EchoStar Communications. It will be updated as necessary."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 1988, Congress has passed several laws concerning television reception via satellite: the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA, P.L. 100-667 ), amendments to the act in 1994, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999 (SHVIA, P.L. 106-113 ) , and the most recent law, the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA). SHVERA was passed as Division J of Title IX of the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( H.R. 4818 , P.L. 108-447 ) in December 2004. A number of changes were made to provisions affecting consumers who receive analog \"distant network signals\" and \"local-into-local\" network signals. Three factors are important in understanding the eligibility criteria for these different signals: signal strength, distant and local signals, and unserved households."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Signal Strength", "paragraphs": ["Signal strength can be visualized as two concentric circles around a TV station's transmitter. Points in the inner circle close to the transmitter can receive a strong, \"Grade A\" television broadcast signal, via an over-the-air antenna (rooftop or \"rabbit ears\"). Points in the outer circle can receive a weaker, \"Grade B\" signal. Beyond the outer circle, where no signal can be received, are \"white areas.\" Over-the-air signal strength is the guiding factor in determining which households are eligible to receive distant network signals via satellite."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distant vs. Local Network Signals", "paragraphs": ["A network broadcast signal is one received by a household located within a network television affiliate's local area. When retransmitted by satellite back into the same local area, such signals are called \"local-into-local.\" A distant network signal is one received from outside the local network affiliate's area. It is referred to as a distant network signal because it originates in one place and is received in another.", "Local-into-local signals were first offered to satellite television subscribers in 1999 under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA). It permitted, but did not require, satellite television companies to offer local-into-local signals. Subscribers who were eligible for distant network signals under SHVIA could also receive local-into-local, if offered in their area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unserved Households", "paragraphs": ["Households are generally defined as either \"served\" or \"unserved\" under SHVERA based on the signal strength they can receive.

Broadcasters filed suit against those satellite television companies. In May 1998, a federal court ruled that a company called PrimeTime 24 had violated the Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) by retransmitting broadcast network television signals to both served and unserved households. The court ruled in favor of the broadcasters, meaning that many satellite TV subscribers would have lost access to distant network signals.", "However, Congress was debating satellite TV legislation (SHVIA) at the time and chose to allow some of those subscribers\u2014called \"grandfathered subscribers\"\u2014to continue to receive the signals for five more years (until December 31, 2004)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Provisions in SHVERA", "paragraphs": ["Under SHVIA, subscribers receiving distant network signals could also subscribe to local-into-local when it became available.
