The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, however, when Congress enacts language providing \"such sums as may be necessary\" to complete a project or purpose. Budget authority may be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis.

Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year.

An example of this is the Federal Protective Service, which is immediately offset in the appropriations tables by an intergovernmental transfer from the General Services Administration. Other discretionary fees offset spending at the agency level and are thus subtracted from the discretionary budget authority of the agency to arrive at the actual appropriated level.

Financially strapped airlines\u2014still recovering from the economic impact of the 9/11 attacks and now facing rising fuel costs\u2014argued that they would likely have to absorb some of the proposed fee increases by reducing ticket prices. Some Members of Congress also voiced concern that the proposed fee increase could cut into the revenues of the airlines, and could have a greater impact on rural airline customers who would pay proportionately more in per-segment fees because fewer direct flights are available to these customers. The Administration, on the other hand, argued that increased fees could help reduce a funding deficit by generating additional revenue to offset expenditures for aviation security, or could free up general tax revenues for spending on broader homeland security needs. The Administration maintained that increasing fees to offset costs is in line with long-standing transportation infrastructure policy to fund these services largely through user fees, as well as its assessment of the original intent of these passenger security fees established under ATSA (P.L 107-71). However, some opponents of aviation security fees contend that aviation security, particularly since September 11, 2001, is vital to national security, and therefore, like defense spending, is the responsibility of all taxpayers. The House Committee on Appropriations noted that amending the statutory fee structure falls under the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee and did not include the proposed fee increases in its bill.

While the Senate also did not recommend any passenger fee increases, language in S.Rept. 109-83 directed the TSA to use its available authority to collect about $448 million from aviation security infrastructure fees paid directly by the airlines. This is the amount determined by a GAO audit that TSA should be collecting annually. However, the TSA has been collecting only about $318 million in these fees, despite assuming that collections would total $750 million for FY2005, thus creating a projected shortfall of more than $400 million.", "Another key issue for the TSA during the FY2006 appropriations process was the proposed creation of SCO.

The Administration offered few details regarding how the proposed SCO would interface with the TSA on several high-profile programs such as Secure Flight and the TWIC program. Citing concerns over disrupting work on these key programs, P.L. 109-90 implements a different approach that integrates these various programs, but keeps them within the TSA under a new Office of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing. The Act establishes a FY2006 funding level of $75 million for the newly created Office of Transportation Vetting and Credentialing, an amount consistent with the Senate-passed bill but $9 million less than the House-passed amount. In addition to these sums, it is anticipated that the office will handle an additional $180 million in credentialing accounts that are expected to be fully offset by user fees.", "Another lingering issue that did not receive much attention during the appropriations process is the coordination between TSA and S&T in light of the transfer of the TSA's research and development activities to the S&T Directorate. One particular oversight issue is how aviation security research needs will be prioritized given that S&T is more broadly focused on all homeland security research and development activities. There may be some concern that aviation security projects could take a back seat to other high-profile initiatives\u2014such as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons countermeasures\u2014that have been the primary focus of S&T to date. Also, while consolidating research and development on explosives and chemical weapons detection\u2014the primary focus of aviation security-related research and development\u2014may help leverage resources for other DHS components, these projects could potentially lose some of the aviation security-specific focus that they received while under the auspices of the TSA. Consequently, Congress may focus on what coordination and interaction between TSA and S&T will be established to ensure that aviation security research and development needs are adequately addressed. House report language specifies that the S&T Directorate is to carry out air cargo research and development pilot programs initiated by the TSA, but expressed frustration over the lack of progress in this area commenting that \"... high unobligated balances give the impression that the TSA does not view air cargo as a serious aviation security vulnerability.\" Consequently, the report contains language that would require the TSA to develop protocols and standards for emerging new technologies to screen cargo, noting past deployment delays occurred because such coordination was lacking.", "Appropriations to the TSA for surface transportation modes raise the issue of determining TSA's role, and in a broader context, the federal government's role, in the security of the non-aviation modes of transportation. While ATSA made TSA responsible for the security of all modes of transportation, it did not direct the TSA to take specific actions to address security needs in modes other than aviation. One view is that the federal government, and TSA in particular, should assume a more dominant, or at least a more prominent role, in the security of surface modes. Proponents of this view hold that the federal Treasury should fund most of the security needs of surface modes. Another view is that the federal role in securing surface modes should reflect or parallel its existing role in financing the infrastructure or operations of surface modes. This view holds that federal funding for the security needs of surface modes should be in partnership with state and local governments or the private sector. For instance, because freight railways are predominantly privately owned and financed, some believe that the freight railroad companies should pay for their security needs. Likewise, in the case of mass transit, in which state and local governments have primary responsibility for infrastructure financing and operations, some believe the federal government's role in securing mass transit should be in partnership with state and local governments rather than having a dominant role, as it does in aviation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "United States Coast Guard82", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for the maritime component of homeland security.

Stafford Act aid is available after the President issues a declaration that federal assistance is needed to supplement the resources of states and localities that are overwhelmed by catastrophes. Federal assistance supported by DRF money is used by states, localities, individuals, and certain non-profit organizations for mass care, restoration of damaged or destroyed facilities, clearance of debris, and certain uninsured needs.", "As shown in Table B -1 in Appendix B , DRF obligations have increased considerably since 1990 in comparison to those recorded in previous decades. The cause of the increase in federal expenditures since 1990 has been the subject of some debate. A report issued by the OIG for FEMA concluded that the increase in federal disaster costs \"is due to a greater number and magnitude of disasters, expansion of the law and eligibility for assistance, and interpretation of the law and regulations.\" Some contend that other factors, notably political considerations, contribute to the costs of disaster relief as well. The author of one study reportedly analyzed data from the insurance industry, climatic study organizations, and DHS, and concluded that \"electoral motivations ... had a dramatic effect on which states were granted disaster declarations.\" More specifically, and less dramatically, the author reports in a published summary of his work: \"The best predictor of a disaster declaration, bar none, is actual need. The question arises in these marginal cases, when it's unclear whether to give or not.\" On the other hand, a study issued by GAO also considered the effects of politics on disaster declarations but arrived at a different conclusion. After examining presidential declaration data from the perspective of the party affiliation of governors and members of state congressional delegations, the authors concluded that there \"were no indications that party affiliation affected White House major disaster declaration decisions.\"", "In considering a gubernatorial request for disaster relief, the President evaluates a number of factors, including the cause of the catastrophe, damages, needs, certification by state officials that state and local governments will comply with cost sharing and other requirements, and official requests for assistance. Neither the Stafford Act nor implementing regulations provide for a congressional role in the declaration process.", "The level of expenditures from the DRF fluctuates from year to year primarily as a consequence of three factors\u2014the number of disaster declarations issued, the extent of destruction caused by the disasters, and the amount of uninsured losses that result from declared disasters. Discussions in Congress on the escalating disaster relief costs move between two policy concerns\u2014the need to control federal costs, particularly at a time of significant deficits, and the need of constituents who have suffered devastating losses.", "During the second session of the 109 th Congress Members may wish to evaluate several options in balancing the needs of disaster stricken areas with budgetary constraints. These options include and are not limited to the following approaches.", "Amend the Stafford Act to determine whether existing statutory declaration criteria are appropriate. Reducing the categories or narrowing their scope would result in cost savings as fewer disasters would trigger federal assistance. Such changes, however, would result in greater financial burdens for individuals and communities in distress. Modify how Congress and the President budget for emergencies. Currently, Congress provides additional funds during the fiscal year, usually in supplemental appropriations, to respond to specific natural disasters and other emergency, or unanticipated, situations. Congress and the President usually designate the additional spending as an \"emergency requirement,\" effectively exempting it from budget constraints associated with the annual budget resolution. Some believe this practice of budgeting for emergencies might lead to unnecessary or wasteful spending. In addition, some believe that the existing budgetary treatment of emergency spending provides an incentive to designate non-emergency spending as an emergency requirement in order to circumvent the existing budgetary constraints. To address these concerns, some have proposed the following two reforms, establishment of a reserve fund or criteria for the designation of an emergency, as follows. Establish a reserve fund for disaster assistance. Proponents of a reserve fund for disaster assistance argue that the average annual amount of overall emergency spending can be projected based on past experience, even though specific emergencies cannot be predicted. Therefore, they further argue that an expected amount of disaster assistance spending should be incorporated into the overall amount of spending in the President's budget and the budget resolution. Proponents of such a reserve fund generally suggest that an historical average of actual disaster assistance spending would provide sufficient funds to meet specific emergencies as they arise. Legislation pending before Congress ( S. 24 ) would establish such a fund in the Treasury. Establish criteria for emergency spending. Proponents of emergency spending criteria argue that any spending for disasters and other emergencies should meet specific criteria to be considered outside the constraints associated with the budget resolution and outside the regular annual appropriations process. Past budget resolutions have required that spending designated as an \"emergency requirement\" meet criteria such as the \"underlying situation poses a threat to life, property, or national security\" and is sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary (for example, see the budget resolution considered by the 108 th Congress, S.Con.Res. 95 , H.Rept. 108-498 ).

The House, Senate, and conference agreement all accepted the other proposed FY2006 consolidations as requested. The FY2006 budget was the first to propose consolidation for the TSA R&D program because the Homeland Security Act, which established DHS, required that TSA be maintained as a single distinct entity until November 2004 ( P.L. 107-296 , \u00a7424).", "The request for the newly created Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) was $227 million. Although funded under S&T, DNDO has been made a freestanding office that reports directly to the Secretary. Noting this fact, the House report provided $100 million less than was requested and stated that \"DHS still needs to clarify its role in regard to other federal agencies ... that have similar and more mature programs.\" The Senate committee, stating that it was \"troubled by the manner in which this initiative has been handled,\" also recommended $100 million less than requested for DNDO, and recommended restricting the obligation of all but $15 million until further details are provided to the appropriations committees. Some DNDO activities were formerly funded by the S&T Directorate's radiological and nuclear countermeasures program, whose FY2006 request was $19 million, down from $123 million. The House provided the requested amount for radiological and nuclear countermeasures, while the Senate provided an increase to $226 million, including $125 million requested under CBP for testing, development, and deployment of radiation portal monitors at ports of entry. The conference agreement provided\u00a0$318 for DNDO, including $135 million for radiation portal monitors and with restrictions on the obligation of another $145 million pending approval of an expenditure plan by the appropriations committees. The conference agreement provided $19 million for radiological and nuclear countermeasures and concurred with the plan to transfer most funding for this activity into DNDO.", "Although the proposed total R&D budget for DHS would have changed from the previous year by less than in any other year since the department's creation, the FY2006 request made substantial changes in several existing programs, as well as the new DNDO. Chemical countermeasures, support for other department components, and efforts to counter the threat from MANPADs (portable ground-to-air missiles) were all roughly doubled. Meanwhile, funding for rapid prototyping (to accelerate the adaptation or development of technologies that can be deployed in the near term) was dropped from $76 million to $21 million, and the consolidated R&D activities currently conducted by TSA were dropped from $178 million to $109 million. The House and the Senate committees and the conference agreement all broadly accepted these proposals, with some modifications, and made various other changes to the request, such as increasing funding for explosives countermeasures. See Table 12 for details.", "The FY2006 budget justification for the S&T Directorate presented program-level data on the directorate's actual FY2004 expenditures, as compared with the program allocations specified in the FY2004 appropriations conference report. These data showed substantial reprogramming. For example, actual expenditures on biological countermeasures in FY2004 were $455 million, versus the enacted level of $197 million. Actual funding for construction of the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasure Center was $4 million, versus $88 million enacted. University centers and efforts to counter MANPADs, two items that were of particular congressional interest and received more FY2004 funding than had been requested, had actual expenditures of $22 million and $17 million respectively, versus $69 million and $60 million enacted. As Congress considered appropriations for FY2006, these FY2004 data raised questions about how the S&T Directorate establishes priorities among its programs and how it handles changes in those priorities after funding decisions have been made.", "Section 546 of P.L. 109-90 rescinds $20 million in unobligated funding for the S&T Directorate from previous fiscal years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related Legislation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "H.R. 2863/P.L. 109-148 Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act of 2006", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 109-148 contains a number of provisions that impact DHS budget accounts.

Beginning with the June 24, 2002 edition of this report, homeland security was included as a part of the analysis. In subsequent years, this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, as distinctions (and account lines) between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. This means that while Table A -1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons, they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis, as outlined above.", "With regard to DHS funding, it is important to note that DHS funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts. In fact, while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within DHS, the DHS homeland security request for FY2006 accounts for approximately 54% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense comprises the next highest proportion at 19% of all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services at 8.8%, the Department of Justice at 6.2% and the Department of Energy at 3.3% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. These five agencies collectively account for nearly 95% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is also important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The legacy agencies that became a part of DHS also conduct activities that are not homeland security related. Therefore, while the FY2006 requests a total homeland security budget authority of $27.3 billion for DHS, the requested gross budget authority is reported as $41.1 billion.
