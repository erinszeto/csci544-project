Institutions may receive Title VII support for such activities as residency programs at medical and dental schools, recruitment and retention initiatives in community-based educational settings, and health workforce data collection and analysis within state health departments. Individuals typically receive direct assistance through scholarships, loans, loan repayments, or fellowships. Title VII authorizes several advisory groups to make recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress on various health workforce programs and Title VII functions. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees programs authorized in Title VII.", "The health care workforce\u2014the backbone of the health care delivery system\u2014includes physicians, nurses, dentists, therapists, and others who deliver health services to individuals in physicians' offices, health centers, clinics, and other community-based health care settings. In 2010, Congress reauthorized Title VII health workforce programs and activities in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148, as amended). The ACA also added several new authorities that aim to build and sustain the health care workforce alongside other provisions for health reform, including health insurance expansion.", "The 113th Congress has held hearings and introduced legislation to address the adequacy of the health care workforce. Health policy experts anticipate that ACA provisions for health insurance expansion could lead to an increased demand for health service utilization, and they expect that this increased demand for services could prompt increased demand for health providers, including physicians and nurses. Other factors causing concern about the adequacy of the health workforce include uneven provider distribution, attrition and retirement, and demands of the aging population. Legislative interest or action may focus on the impact of Title VII programs on education and training in the health professions.", "This report describes and summarizes Title VII programs.

In Title VII, Health Professions Education, the PHSA supports an education and training pipeline for professionals and pre-professionals to work in the medical, dental, public health, and allied health professions. Title VII provides support to both institutions and individuals. It supports institutions to expand the capacity to build and sustain the health workforce through training programs, mainly through grant awards and contractual agreements. For example, institutions may receive Title VII grants to implement residency programs at medical and dental schools; recruitment and retention initiatives in community-based educational settings; and health workforce data collection activities within state health departments. It supports individuals by providing them with direct assistance to support academic preparation in the health professions through scholarships, loans, loan repayments, and fellowships.", "Many Title VII programs and activities were reauthorized in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 , as amended). The ACA also created the National Health Care Workforce Commission for federal health workforce planning, and State Health Care Workforce Development Grants. The ACA also made sweeping changes to health care financing and delivery by restructuring the private health insurance market and setting minimum standards for health insurance coverage.", "Beginning in 2014, the ACA mandates that most U.S. citizens obtain health insurance or pay a penalty. Health policy experts expect this mandate combined with additional changes will increase health insurance coverage to be accompanied by a likely increased demand for health services and health care providers.", "Title VII represents one among several federal efforts to support the development of the health workforce. These authorities, enacted in various statutes, are established to achieve different purposes and consequently receive different levels of support. For example, in FY2012, the Medicare Graduate Medical Education (GME) payments contribute approximately $8.9 billion annually to residents' salaries, teaching compensation, and other direct costs. The Medicare direct GME program is the largest source of federal support for health workforce development, followed by the Medicaid GME payments (both state and federal), which were $1.1 billion in FY2011. Medicare and Medicaid GME payments support education and training mainly for physicians. By comparison, Title VII programs contributed approximately $266 million in FY2012 (the President's FY2014 request is for approximately $212 million) to education and training activities for physicians, physician assistants, dentists, therapists, and other health professionals.
