By comparison, in over seven years from the 9/11 attacks through May 2009, there was an annual average of only two such plots, none of which resulted in attacks. This has not gone unnoticed by many who are concerned that domestic radicalization, previously viewed as a problem largely confined to Europe, is a bigger threat in the United States than originally believed. ", "And what about methods of attack not yet imagined? The Australian scholar Mervyn Bendle asks us to consider one such scenario. The recent catastrophic bushfires in his own country \"alert us to the extreme danger posed by pyroterrorism, especially as global terrorist organizations continue to modify their strategies in the face of increasingly effective counterterrorism measures employed against them. Pyroterrorism can do great harm to valuable natural resources and infrastructure; destabilise and degrade regional economies; kill, maim, terrorise, and radically reduce the quality of life of large populations of people; and even destabilise social and political systems.\" ", "Bendle argues that this is not an \"alarmist, eccentric, or \"Islamophobic\" notion.\" His study documents that pyroterrorism involvement has been suspected or established in Greece, Israel, Spain, and Estonia. Moreover, in the late 1990's, the Earth Liberation Front set fire to various forests, commercial and industrial buildings in the United States including the U.S. Forest Service Headquarters in Oregon. ", "Pyroterrorism is just one example of many alternative hypotheses that homeland security risk managers may wish to consider in order to avoid what was famously described in the 9/11 Commission Report as \"a failure of imagination.\" Threat assessment is a critical component of the risk equation. Risk, in turn, is an important element of the QHSR which will ultimately inform how the department proposes to allocate resources in the future based on the evolving threat environment.", "Therefore, Congress may wish to explore:", "How I&A will support the next step in the Department's QHSR process, the top-to-bottom review that is intended to link strategy to program to budget.
