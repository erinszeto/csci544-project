Since early 2009, the United States has provided virtually no aid to North Korea, though episodically there have been discussions about resuming large-scale food aid. Additionally, the Obama Administration officials have said that they would be willing to consider other types of aid if North Korea takes steps indicating that it will dismantle its nuclear program, a prospect that most analysts view as increasingly remote. As of March 2014, barring an unexpected breakthrough, there appears little likelihood the Obama Administration will provide large-scale assistance of any type to North Korea in the near future. Members of Congress have a number of tools they could use to influence the development and implementation of aid programs with North Korea.", "Food Aid. Large swathes of North Korea's population have suffered from chronic malnutrition since the mid-1990s. Food aid\u2014largely from China, South Korea, and the United States\u2014has been essential in filling the gap between North Korea's supply and demand, though since 2009 donations from all countries except China have dwindled to a minimal amount. Observers and activists attribute the North Korea's malnutrition and occasional starvation problems to food shortages\u2014which at times have been massive\u2014and more fundamentally to the unequal distribution of food caused in large measure by the North Korean government's deliberate decisions and policies. In 2013, an improved harvest appeared to reduce North Korea's chronic grain shortfall to some of the lowest levels since the 1990s. Yet outside food groups reported continued malnutrition among vulnerable sectors of the population, especially children. In 2014, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry on North Korea's human rights conditions found that the North Korean government's \"act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation\" amounted to crimes against humanity.", "Providing food to North Korea poses a number of dilemmas. Pyongyang has resisted reforms that would allow the equitable distribution of food and help pay for food imports. The North Korean government restricts the ability of donors to operate in the country. Additionally, multiple sources have asserted that some of the food assistance is routinely diverted for resale in private markets or other uses. However, it is likely that food aid has helped feed millions of North Koreans, at times possibly staving off a repeat of the famine conditions that existed in North Korea in the mid-late 1990s, when 5%-10% of the population died. South Korean President Park Geun-hye's government has indicated that it would be willing to offer North Korea food aid as part of her plan to foster a \"new era\" in inter-Korean relations. In 2013, the South Korean government donated around $12 million to United Nations humanitarian organizations that supply humanitarian aid, including some food, in North Korea.", "Energy Assistance. Between 1995 and 2009, the United States provided around $600 million in energy assistance to North Korea. The aid was given over two time periods\u20141995-2003 and 2007-2009\u2014in exchange for North Korea freezing its plutonium-related nuclear facilities. In 2008 and 2009, North Korea also took steps to disable these facilities. However, no additional energy assistance has been provided since 2009, when Pyongyang withdrew from the Six-Party Talks\u2014involving North Korea, the United States, China, Japan, and Russia\u2014over North Korea's nuclear program. The move followed condemnation and sanctions by the U.N. Security Council for North Korea's April 2009 launch of a suspected long-range missile and May 2009 test of a nuclear device.", "Denuclearization Assistance. In 2007 and 2008, the United States gave technical assistance to North Korea's nuclear disablement process. In 2008, Congress took steps to legally enable the President to give expanded assistance for this purpose. However, following North Korea's actions in the spring of 2009, Congress rejected the Obama Administration's requests for supplemental funds to use in case of a return to denuclearization. Since then, Congress has not approved and the administration has not requested any funds for denuclearization since North Korea has not agreed to return to the nuclear disarmament process."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Brief History of U.S. Aid to North Korea", "paragraphs": ["For four decades after the end of the Korean War in 1953, U.S. strategy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, commonly referred to as North Korea) was relatively simple: deter an attack on South Korea.

U.S. and United Nations aid officials have continuously wrestled with DPRK authorities over how much freedom foreign workers should be allowed to distribute and monitor food assistance. The regime's restrictions have ebbed and flowed, usually in accordance with the government's desperation for outside food. Twice since 1995 Pyongyang has significantly tightened restrictions.

Despite the improved harvest, and signs that North Korea's economy is improving, especially in Pyongyang, the WFP has reported that malnutrition rates remain high, particularly among young children. The WFP and FAO reports, if they reflect the actual situation in North Korea, indicate that the malnutrition problem is likely due less to food shortages and more to inequities in the distribution system and governmental priorities. On the latter point, Economist Marcus Noland, a North Korean expert with the Peterson Institute of International Economics, estimates that the roughly 40,000 MT gap in grain supply and demand could be filled by less than $20 million in imported food.

In 2013, Seoul donated around $6 million (around $12 million in total) to both the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO), to help fund their programs that provide North Korean children, breast-feeding women, and senior citizens with vaccines, medicine, and food. The Park government has also adopted greater leniency in allowing South Korean non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide aid to North Korea; in 2013 and the first two months of 2014, over a dozen groups were allowed to provide around 9 billion won (more than $8 million) in assistance to North Korea. In a variety of settings, President Obama and other senior Administration officials have indicated their support for Park's general approach toward North Korea, which she has called \"trustpolitik,\" including its humanitarian aid policy. The fact that as of March 2014, such South Korean government aid has been relatively small-scale and has not been provided directly to North Korea may be a factor in U.S. support for South Korea's policy.

Additionally, North Korea is believed to expend little of its foreign currency to import food, relying instead upon the international community. Moreover, since 2007, the government episodically has taken many steps to reimpose state controls over farmers and markets. ", "In a February 2014 report, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry on North Korea's human rights conditions stated that the North Korean government \"has used food as a means of control over the population.\" The Commission argued that the \"decisions, actions, and omissions\" by North Korea's leaders and government \"caused the death of at least hundreds of thousands of people and inflicted permanent physical and psychological injuries on those who survived.\" North Korea's rulers, according to the Commission, by \"knowingly causing prolonged starvation\" were found to have committed to crimes against humanity. In part because of the North Korean government's unwillingness or inability to ensure a more equitable distribution of food, some contend that it is likely that food aid has helped feed millions of North Koreans who may not otherwise have had sufficient access. According to this line of reasoning, food aid possibly staved off a repeat of the famine conditions that existed in the mid- to late 1990s. A number of observers argue that the North Korean people should not be unduly punished for their government's behavior, that diversion to markets helps ordinary North Koreans by lowering food prices, and that measures can be taken to limit the Kim Jong-il regime's abuses of food aid. For instance, the United States generally has shipped its food aid to the Northern provinces, where less desirable classes of people tend to live. In another example, Obama Administration officials said in late 2011 that if they decided to resume food aid, the shipments would be \"nutritional\" products such as high-protein biscuits that are less likely to be diverted than traditional food staples. ", "Additionally, some contend that a well-designed food aid program can facilitate the expansion of markets, which over time will erode the Kim regime's hold over the country, while helping to reduce food prices in North Korea's most vulnerable provinces. Providing food aid also can be used to serve larger diplomatic goals, though many experts caution against explicitly linking food to concessions in the security arena, such as in the Six-Party Talks over North Korea's nuclear programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Ebbs and Flows of U.S. Food Aid to North Korea, 2006-2010", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "North Korea's 2006 Restrictions and the Decline in the WFP's Program", "paragraphs": ["After peaking at over 900,000 MT in 2001, assistance provided by the WFP fell dramatically over the following years until 2008, when a large U.S. contribution brought up the WFP total.

The first was \"donor fatigue,\" as contributing nations objected to the North Korean government's continued development of its nuclear and missile programs as well as tightened restrictions on donor agencies' monitoring of shipments to ensure that food is received by the neediest. The emergence of other emergency food situations around the globe also stretched the food aid resources of the United States and other donors. Whatever the causes, the WFP was unable to fill its goal of 150,000 MT for the 2006-2008 period. During this time, increased bilateral assistance\u2014outside the WFP's program\u2014that China and South Korea shipped directly to North Korea, as well as improved harvests in North Korea, appear to have made up much of the gap, which generally is estimated to be in the range of 1 million MT per year.", "In 2006, the WFP drastically scaled down its program after the North Korean government imposed new restrictions, constraining the organization's size and ability to distribute and monitor its shipments.

North Korea began seeking a new outside source of food. In May 2008, the United States Agency for International Development announced that the United States would resume food assistance to North Korea by providing 500,000 MT for one year beginning in June 2008. Of this amount, 400,000 MT was to be channeled through the WFP. Approximately 100,000 tons would be funneled through nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including World Vision, Mercy Corps, Samaritan's Purse, Global Resource Services and Christian Friends of Korea. The announcement stated that the resumption was made possible by an agreement reached with Pyongyang that allowed for \"substantial improvement in monitoring and access in order to allow for confirmation of receipt by the intended recipients.\" The U.S. move came not long after a breakthrough was reached in the Six-Party Talks.

It allowed WFP to expand its operations into 131 counties, versus an earlier 50, in regions at particular risk of famine. The agreement also expanded the WFP's rights and ability to monitor the shipments of food aid, in order to better ensure that the food was not diverted from its target recipients.

Several months later, however, reports began emerging from North Korea that the food situation was worsening considerably. North Korea then began asking outside donors\u2014including the United States and South Korea\u2014for additional aid. A number of groups operating inside North Korea reported that the prices for staples in semi-official markets, which are the main source of food for those outside the cadre of elite, were soaring due to a severe winter and drops in commercial food imports and bilateral food donations. Some observers speculated that the North Korean government was also motivated by a desire to stockpile food in preparation for celebrations in 2012 to celebrate the 100 th birthday of the late founder of the country, Kim Il-sung (the grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un). While the Obama Administration, as well as many Members of Congress, began debating whether to resume U.S. food aid to North Korea, the WFP in April 2011 launched a new, one-year emergency appeal for over 300,000 MT to feed over 3.5 million vulnerable people. The WFP negotiated a new agreement with its North Korean counterpart that was similar to the 2008 agreement between the two sides in terms of access and monitoring.

Later that month, the WFP decided to launch a new two-year operation in North Korea. Its goal is to help 2.9 million people, primarily children as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women, with slightly over 200,000 MT of food. In a February 2014 report on the status of the program, the WFP stated that donations continued to less than 40% of targeted amounts.

As mentioned above, this appears to be the direction the Obama Administration was following until the breakdown of the Leap Day deal, although officials insist the linkage was made by North Korea, not the United States. In the past, emphasizing geostrategic concerns as a condition for food aid has led to some short-term successes, such as persuading North Korea to return to the bargaining table. However, in nearly all of these cases, it is not clear that the provision of food has induced significant changes in North Korea's long-term behavior on security issues. Additionally, this approach runs the risk of encouraging the North Korean government to believe that concessions on other issues, such as the denuclearization talks, are more important to the United States than demands for improved monitoring of the delivery of food aid. Yet another variant of this approach would be to link food aid to North Korean concessions in the human rights sphere, such as releasing political prisoners. Set explicit \"humanitarian\" linkages by conditioning future food aid on improvements in access and monitoring. For instance, after several years where the United States did not provide food to North Korea, the 2008 program was initiated after Pyongyang and Washington reached an agreement on improved monitoring that provided greater confidence that the food was being received by the intended recipients, women and young children. The U.S. program also shipped only to North Korea's historically poorer and politically marginalized Northern provinces, to help ensure that even if diversion did occur, food would be diverted to markets likely to be used by the most vulnerable, rather than to markets in the wealthier and politically connected locations of Pyongyang and its surroundings. The Administration could also insist that Pyongyang abide by concessions made in 2008, but apparently not fully implemented, such as granting relief workers the ability to bring emergency communications equipment into the country. Decide on whether and how to harmonize policy with Seoul. U.S. and South Korean approaches on food aid to North Korea have not always been in harmony. For much of the 2000s, attempts to convince North Korean authorities to conform to international aid standards were often undermined by large-scale, largely unconditional food aid from Seoul (as well as from Beijing). In contrast, the former South Korean government of Lee Myung-bak (2008-2013) made tougher humanitarian demands on North Korea. It also asked North Korea to make improvements in North-South relations before it would consider providing large amounts of food and fertilizer, a demand that has become firmer in the aftermath of North Korea's November 2010 shelling of a South Korean island that killed four South Koreans. Park Geun-hye's government has indicated that it is willing to provide humanitarian assistance to the North Korean people regardless of the diplomatic situation. It is not clear to what extent Seoul would continue the Lee government's insistence on improved access and monitoring of its assistance. Members of Congress may want to probe whether U.S. and South Korean officials have discussed developing minimum requirements for any humanitarian assistance the two countries provide. Should China be pressured on food aid? Members of Congress and Obama Administration officials could publically and/or privately urge China to insist on some monitoring for its food aid, a topic that does not appear to have been on either the Obama or Bush Administration's crowded list of talking points with China. A fallback position with Beijing could be to call for a continuation of its current policy, which appears to be to provide food assistance only at a subsistence level needed to maintain stability in North Korea. According to the WFP, in 2012, China provided North Korea with over 240,000 MT in food assistance, after providing less than 3,000 MT in 2010 and 2011 combined. Select the mix between the WFP and NGO Channels. If the Obama Administration decides to resume food aid to North Korea, about 30,000 MT will remain from the 2008 program's NGO component and 300,000 from the WFP component. U.S. officials may wish to change this allocation. Since 1995, more than 90% of the 2.2 million MT of food aid the U.S. has provided to North Korea has been shipped via donations to the WFP. One reason the Bush Administration decided to channel one-fifth of the 2008 aid package through NGOs was because several of these private groups appear to have had more success than the WFP in monitoring their assistance, particularly in gaining access to aid recipients and using their own Korean-speaking staff. The smaller operations of these NGOs allow them to deal principally with local North Korean officials, who often have greater incentives to be more cooperative than the central government. The WFP operates nationally and targets millions more."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Other Forms of U.S. Assistance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["From time to time, the United States has responded to humanitarian disasters in North Korea by sending medicines and other emergency equipment.

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, for instance, allows the President annually to provide up to $50 million per country for any purpose. Longer-term initiatives, however, would likely require changes in U.S. law and thereby require congressional action. For instance, the 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-76 ) specifically bans many forms of direct aid to the North Korean government. Many health and emergency disaster relief aid programs are exempt from such legislative restrictions because they have \"notwithstanding\" clauses in their enacting legislation. Additionally, if the Administration were to designate North Korea as a country involved in drug production and trafficking\u2014as some have advocated\u2014then by law North Korea would be ineligible for receiving most forms of U.S. development assistance.
