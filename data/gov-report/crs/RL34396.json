The act responds to concerns that the United States may not be able to compete economically with other nations in the future due to insufficient investment today in science and technology research and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development. The America COMPETES Act is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research, and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. It is designed to focus on two perceived concerns believed to influence future U.S. competitiveness: inadequate research and development funding to generate sufficient technological progress, and inadequate numbers of American students proficient in science and mathematics or interested in science and engineering careers relative to international competitors.", "The act authorizes increases in funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) laboratories, and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008-FY2010. If maintained, the increases would double the budgets of those agencies over seven years. Within DOE, the act would establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E), designed to support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing the economic and energy security of the United States. A new program, Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, would establish multidisciplinary institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations.", "Among the act's education activities, many of which are focused on high-need school districts, are programs to recruit new K-12 STEM teachers, enhance existing STEM teacher skills, and provide more STEM education opportunities for students. The new Department of Education (ED) Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow and existing NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program provide opportunities, through institutional grants, for students pursuing STEM degrees and STEM professionals to gain teaching skills and teacher certification, and for current STEM teachers to enhance their content and teaching skills. The act also authorizes a new program at NSF that would provide grants to institutions of higher education to create or improve professional science master's degree (PSM) programs that emphasize practical training and preparation for the workforce in high-need fields.", "The America COMPETES Act is an authorization act, so new programs established by the act will not be initiated, and increases in the authorization of appropriation level of existing programs may not occur, unless funded through subsequent appropriations. An issue for Congress was whether to fund America COMPETES Act programs at authorized funding levels. The 111th Congress passed the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-8) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (P.L. 111-5) to supplement FY2009 funds. While some America COMPETES Act programs were funded at authorized levels, others were not. The following activities were funded at or above authorized levels: NIST Scientific & Technical Research and Services; NIST Construction & Maintenance; DOE Office of Science; NSF and its Research & Related Activities; Major Research Instrumentation; Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction; and its Professional Science Master's; Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship; and Graduate Research Fellowship programs.

Based on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) model, ARPA-E is designed to support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing the nation's economic and energy security. Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes would be multidisciplinary research institutes located at DOE national laboratories that would apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations. Up to three institutes may be created each fiscal year. The DOE FY2009 budget request did not propose funding for either ARPA-E or the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes.", "Rather than create ARPA-E or the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, the Bush Administration Secretary of Energy issued a policy on technology transfer, and proposed establishing 25-30 multi-investigator Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) at universities or other nonprofit organizations. As a result of the technology transfer policy, DOE now reportedly pools funds from the Office of Science and other programs to fund six collaborations that integrate basic and applied research. Funding for these collaborations are reportedly based on congressional language that required DOE to set aside 0.9% of its applied energy research and development budget for technology transfer. The goal of EFRCs would be to focus on transformative research. The requested FY2009 EFRC budget was approximately $100.0 million, with initial five-year awards of $2.0-5.0 million annually per center. In contrast, each of the three Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes is authorized at $10.0 million annually for a maximum of three years.", "The act also authorizes the establishment of several new STEM education programs at the K-12 and post-secondary level within DOE. These activities include K-12 student and teacher programs such as specialty high schools for science and mathematics pilot program, experiential based learning opportunities (e.g., summer internships) for middle and high school students, and summer institutes for teachers. Post-secondary programs include a nuclear science talent expansion program and a hydrocarbon systems science talent expansion program to enhance existing and create new educational programs in nuclear science and hydrocarbon systems. In addition, the act establishes a new position within DOE to direct STEM education programs across the department, and a Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Fund, that is to include not less than 0.3% of DOE's research, development, and commercial application funding.", "Although the relevant sections in the FY2009 DOE budget submission note the authorization of the America COMPETES Act, DOE did not make clear what specific educational programs within the act to which the request was responding. For example, the FY2009 request for the Office of Nuclear Energy referenced the America COMPETES Act and stated it would designate 20% of its research funds for university research activities as a way to increase support for U.S. nuclear science and engineering education, but it did not cite the act's nuclear science talent expansion program.", "In the section entitled \"Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists\" in the Office of Science budget justification, DOE noted the America COMPETES Act and mentioned many DOE STEM educational programs, but it did not identify any of them as either new America COMPETES Act initiatives or specify if some of the existing programs have been modified to accommodate the act. In addition, the DOE Office of Science did not mention the Early Career Awards for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Researchers program.", "In congressional testimony, however, the Bush Administration identified two DOE STEM education programs and the early career researcher program in the act as included in the FY2009 budget request.
