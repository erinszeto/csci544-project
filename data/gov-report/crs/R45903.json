Retaliatory tariffs have made imports of U.S. agricultural products relatively more expensive compared to similar products from competitor nations. In the short run, U.S. shipments of products to countries with retaliatory tariffs have declined, reducing overall global demand for affected U.S. agricultural products and driving down the prices of U.S. agricultural commodities. Depending on the length and depth of the tariffs and the range of products affected, some experts caution that the long-run trade impacts could inflict further harm as U.S. competitor countries have an incentive to expand their agricultural production.", "In response to U.S. Section 232 and Section 301 actions, China levied retaliatory tariffs on almost all U.S. agricultural products, ranging from 5% to 50%. In response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and Turkey retaliated with tariffs during the summer of 2018 on U.S. fruit, nuts, prepared vegetables and meats, pork, cheese, breakfast cereal, fruit juices, and whiskey. India implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. products after a Presidential Proclamation removed India from the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences program in May 2019. Canada and Mexico levied retaliatory tariffs in mid-2018, but these tariffs were removed in May 2019 after the Trump Administration announced an agreement with Canada and Mexico to remove the Section 232 tariffs on imports from both countries to facilitate ratification of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement\u00e2\u0080\u0094a proposed regional free trade agreement that is meant to supersede the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).", "The total value of exports of U.S. food and agricultural products levied retaliatory tariffs in 2018 was $22 billion, down 27% from $30 billion in 2017. China accounted for about 80% of the total affected trade in both years. Despite the retaliatory tariffs, U.S. agricultural exports rose in 2018 to $140 billion from $138 billion in 2017, partly due to higher imports during the months leading up to the retaliatory tariffs and increased exports to other nonretaliating countries. With the continuation of retaliatory tariffs, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects U.S. agricultural exports to decline about 4% in 2019.", "In the short run, retaliatory tariffs contributed to declining prices for certain U.S. agricultural commodities and reduced exports, particularly for soybeans. Declining prices and exports sales combined with rising input and farm machinery costs contributed to a 16% decrease in U.S. net farm income in 2018, compared with 2017. China's soybean imports are expected to resume growing over the next decade, but a USDA study expects the volume traded to be less than previously anticipated. Because of the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans, USDA projects that Brazil will account for two-thirds of the global growth in soybean exports to China. The United States accounted for 40% of China's total soybean imports in 2016 and 35% in 2017, compared with Brazil's 46% in 2016 and 53% in 2017. In 2018, the U.S. share of China's soybean import market dropped to 19% and Brazil's share was up at 76%.", "To help alleviate the financial loss incurred by U.S. farmers due to retaliatory tariffs, USDA announced $12 billion in financial assistance in 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0094referred to as a trade aid package\u00e2\u0080\u0094for certain U.S. agricultural commodities using Section 5 of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714c). In 2019, USDA announced a second trade-aid package of $16 billion. Increased trade aid to U.S. farmers has generated questions from some World Trade Organization (WTO) members about whether the trade-aid package may violate U.S. WTO commitments.", "While trade-aid packages may provide short-term financial assistance, some studies and critics of the President's actions caution that the long-term consequences of the retaliatory tariffs may present more challenges. Even as China has raised tariffs on U.S. imports, it has improved access to its markets for other exporting countries. Brazil, Russia, and other countries are expanding their agricultural production to meet China's import demand. For example, Russia's investments during the past two decades have resulted in agricultural productivity growth ranging from 25% to 75%, with higher productivity growth along its southern region. Although still at relatively modest levels, China's total food and agricultural imports from Russia increased 61% between 2017 and 2018.", "The continuation of trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs may be of interest to Congress for the following reasons. Trade disputes have disrupted global markets and increased uncertainty in the farm input and output sectors. They may add to production costs, and they have dampened exports, impacted farm income, and triggered additional federal assistance for the farm sector. In the short run, there could be some transient benefits associated with various aspects of the agricultural sector. In the long run, other countries may expand agricultural production, potentially displacing U.S. agricultural exports to become larger food and agricultural suppliers to China."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since early 2018, certain foreign nations have targeted U.S. food and agricultural products with retaliatory tariffs (for more on tariffs, see Box 1 ) in response to U.S. Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and U.S. Section 301 tariffs levied on imports from China. The first U.S. trade action occurred on March 8, 2018, when President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports (with some flexibility on the application of tariffs by country) using presidential powers granted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Section 232 authorizes the President to impose restrictions on certain imports based on an affirmative determination by the Department of Commerce that the targeted import products threaten national security. The targeted exporters, China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union (EU), and Turkey, responded by levying retaliatory tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products, and other goods. India proposed retaliatory tariffs but did not implement them until June 2019.", "A second action occurred in July 2018 when the Trump Administration used a Section 301 investigation to impose tariffs of 25% on $34 billion of selected imports from China, citing concerns over China's policies on intellectual property, technology, and innovation. In August 2018, the Administration levied a second round of Section 301 tariffs, also of 25%, on an additional $16 billion of imports from China. In September 2018, additional tariffs of 10% were applied to $200 billion of imports from China and, in May 2019, these were raised to 25%. On August 13, 2019, the Office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) published two lists of additional Chinese imports that would face 10% tariffs, effective September 1, 2019, and December 15, 2019. The imposition of the Section 301 tariffs on Chinese goods resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China. Additionally, in August 2019, China asked its state-owned enterprises to halt purchases of U.S. agricultural goods. On August 23, 2019, China further retaliated by levying two additional sets of tariffs: 5% or 10% tariffs on U.S. imports, including 695 different U.S. agricultural tariff lines effective September 1, 2019; and another 5% or 10% tariffs on U.S. imports including 184 different U.S. agricultural tariff lines effective December 15, 2019.", "During 2018, China, Canada, Mexico, the EU, and Turkey jointly levied retaliatory tariffs on more than 1,000 U.S. food and agricultural tariff lines. India prepared a list of U.S. products targeted for retaliatory tariffs in 2018 but refrained from implementing them. Then in 2019, India implemented retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. lentils, apples, and tree nuts after the United States removed India from the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program on May 31, 2019. GSP provides duty-free tariff treatment for certain products from designated developing countries. India's removal from GSP is expected to raise duties valued at about $5 billion to $6 billion on goods the United States imports from India\u00e2\u0080\u0094or slightly more than 10% of India's total 2018 exports of $54 billion to the United States.

As China is subjected to the largest set of U.S. tariff increases and has levied the most expansive set of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, this report largely focuses on the effects of Chinese retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural trade. Because almost all U.S. food and agricultural tariff lines are affected by Chinese retaliatory tariffs, the report provides illustrative examples using selected agricultural products. Thus, the report is not a comprehensive review of the effect of Chinese retaliatory tariffs on every U.S. agricultural product exported to China. ", "Retaliatory tariffs have made U.S. products relatively more expensive in China, with the result that Chinese imports from other countries have increased in lieu of U.S. products. This report discusses the short- and long-run economic effects of the changes in trade flows, locally, nationally, and globally. The long-run effects may potentially be more problematic, as China and Russia have increased their agricultural productivity over the past two to three decades, and China has increased investments in other countries to develop potential future sources of imports. Additionally, China has improved market access for imports from other countries while it has increased tariffs on U.S. imports.

Higher retaliatory tariffs represent increases above the World Trade Organization (WTO) Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rates or beyond any existing preferential tariff rates. Retaliatory tariffs for Canada and Mexico are increases from the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) rates, most of which, at zero percent, are below the MFN rates. ", " Table 1 summarizes the retaliatory tariff increases on U.S. agricultural products by comparing tariff increases of September 2018 with the retaliatory tariffs in effect in June 2019. A potential reason for observed changes in applied tariffs rates is that some tariffs are levied based on quantity (such as per ton or per kilograms) and, for purposes of analyses, tariffs are converted to percentage of total import value, ad valorem rates (see Box 2 ). When the price of a traded product changes, the ad valorem tariff rate imposed on a product can change. Additionally, it is not always possible to match the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with the retaliatory country's 8- or 10-digit tariff code (see Box 1 ) . Thus, it may be difficult to link the U.S. Census Bureau trade data with the tariff codes of products affected by retaliatory tariffs. Therefore, this report makes use of both U.S. export data and partner country import data as appropriate to provide the most accurate measure of the magnitude of the affected U.S. trade.

First, the United States is the largest exporter of food and agricultural products, so many countries are able to retaliate against those goods.

The EU imposed tariff hikes on certain prepared vegetables, pulses, breakfast cereals, fruit juices, peanut butter, tobacco products, whiskey, and essential oils. A temporary surge in sales in the months prior to the imposition of duties appears to have offset a slump in sales that coincided with the onset of retaliatory duties later in the year ( Figure 2 ).

Since the second quarter of 2018, EU imports of affected food and agricultural products from the United States declined. As discussed above, beyond the tariff increases, a number of factors may have contributed to this reduction in imports. For instance, when countries first released their proposed lists of products that they targeted for retaliation, some EU importers may have imported larger quantities of the affected products prior to the imposition of the duties, thus boosting EU imports of U.S. agricultural goods in 2018.

The study estimates overall losses in Iowa's gross state product of $1 billion to $2 billion annually (out of a total of $190 billion). ", "Similarly, a study commissioned by the Nebraska Farm Bureau on the short-run economic costs in 2018 for the state from the retaliatory tariffs concluded that Nebraska's general economy would incur costs between $164 million and $242 million in lost labor income, along with the loss of 4,100 to 6,000 jobs. In total, together with the direct agriculture-related costs, Nebraska's overall economic loss in 2018 was estimated at $859 million to $1.2 billion. Retaliatory tariffs in 2018 (on corn, soybeans, and hogs from all retaliating countries) were expected to reduce corn prices by $0.14 to $0.21 per bushel, soybean prices by $0.95 to $1.54 per bushel, and hog prices by $17.81 to $18.80 per head. These estimated price declines would translate into farm revenue losses for each commodity of corn ($257 million to $327 million); soybeans ($384 million to $531 million); and pork ($111 million). ", "The Nebraska Farm Bureau updated its analysis in 2019 and concluded that the ongoing retaliatory tariffs imposed by countries on U.S. agricultural exports would cost Nebraska producers $943 million in lost revenues in 2019. The methodology used for the analysis borrowed USDA's estimates of gross damages that were used in calculating USDA's trade-aid payments. The estimated loss calculation did not take into consideration trade-aid payments that Nebraska farmers may receive in 2019.", "Economists from University of California, Davis, found the short-run effects of the retaliatory tariffs on the 2018 crop for 10 selected specialty crops in four export markets\u00e2\u0080\u0094China, Mexico, Turkey, and India\u00e2\u0080\u0094to be $2.64 billion of lost export value and $3.34 billion of combined U.S. revenue losses. The crops considered are almonds, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, apples, oranges, raisins, sour cherries, sweet cherries, and table grapes. Mexico had retaliatory tariffs on apples and prepared fruit in 2018, but removed them in May 2019.

As discussed in the box \"Key Economic Terms,\" the long-run effects are estimated assuming that the shock to the market, such as tariff increases, remains in place for a few years and sufficient time has passed to provide producers the opportunity to make changes in response to this shock. The studies discussed below assume that the retaliatory tariffs remain in place for three to five years.", "The first study estimated the long-run effects (defined in Box 7 as 3-5 years) of a 25% tariff imposed by China on soybeans and other selected U.S. agricultural products\u00e2\u0080\u0094wheat, corn, sorghum, rice, rapeseed, and beef. This study concluded that U.S. soybean market losses in China would, over the years, benefit Brazil. Given the U.S. soybean industry's large share of China's import market prior to the retaliatory tariffs, the study estimated large price declines and export losses for U.S. soybeans. Other commodities in the study appeared less dependent on the Chinese market, and the estimated losses are relatively smaller. The study predicted that overall economic welfare (see Box 8 ) for both the United States and China would decline, while economic welfare for Brazil would increase.", "The second study examined a scenario in which the USMCA would be implemented but the retaliatory tariffs related to Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs would also exist. The study looked at two separate cases for retaliatory tariffs: (1) retaliatory tariffs were considered only for Mexico and Canada; and (2) retaliatory tariffs from all countries were considered.

Note that Mexico removed the retaliatory tariffs in May 2019. The study simulates multiyear projections over a period of nine years. The study indicates that if the retaliatory tariffs were to continue, U.S. annual exports would decline by 30% for pork and corn, 15% for soybeans, and 1.5% for wheat compared with a baseline scenario that considers the average of the past three-year period. The study estimated that in the short run (which the paper defines as first three years with retaliatory tariffs), trade losses would translate to 26,000 job reductions on average annually in the United States and a decline in labor income of $1.5 billion due to a $5.3 billion reduction in national annual output. In the long run (defined by the paper as year seven through year nine with retaliatory tariffs), the annual impacts were estimated to grow to nearly 60,000 fewer jobs, $3.1 billion less labor income, and a loss of almost $12 billion in national output."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Global-Level Effects", "paragraphs": ["The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) performed a global analysis of the U.S. Section 232 and Section 301 tariffs and the resulting retaliatory tariffs, including retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. The analysis mainly focused on U.S.-China tariff escalation. Regarding agriculture, the study points out that China accounts for more than half of the global imports of soybeans and that the United States is the world's largest soybean producer. The study states that the Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybeans have substantially disrupted world trade of this commodity and observes that increased Chinese demand has resulted in higher prices for Brazilian soybeans. It cautions that while higher price premiums could be beneficial in the short run to Brazilian producers, they may hamper Brazilian procurers' long-run competitiveness. In a situation where the size and amount of the tariffs and their duration are unclear, Brazilian producers may be reluctant to make investment decisions that may turn unprofitable if tariffs are removed. Moreover, Brazilian firms using soybeans as inputs (e.g., feed for livestock) may lose competitiveness because of higher input prices.", "A USDA study released in 2019 found that the United States and Brazil are among the lowest-cost producers of soybeans. While land rental costs and labor costs are higher in the United States, poor soils and tropical ecology require Brazil to use higher levels of agrochemicals. Moreover, the United States has a transportation advantage over Brazil in exporting agricultural products to China. Specifically, the study concluded that transporting soybeans by truck from northern Mato Grosso to Brazil's primary soybean export port of Paranagu\u00c3\u00a1 cost $93 per metric ton (MT) in 2017. During the same period, transporting soybeans from Davenport, Iowa, to the Gulf of Mexico by truck, rail, and barge cost $65 per MT. Shipping soybeans by truck and rail from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, to the U.S. Pacific Northwest cost $68 per MT. The United States, therefore, has lower transportation costs and greater production efficiency (requiring less agrochemicals) compared with Brazil in producing and shipping agricultural products to Asian markets.

Additionally, the U.S. livestock sector is also facing retaliatory tariffs. Similarly, many processed food products that use raw agricultural products as inputs face Chinese retaliatory tariffs.

The president of the National Farmers Union (NFU) echoed the same sentiment, stating that the retaliatory tariffs \"could not come at a worse time for family farmers and ranchers, who are already coping with depressed commodity prices, environmental disasters, and chronic oversupply.\" The NFU president further stated that although temporary relief is appreciated, \"temporary solutions are not sufficient to address the permanent damage the trade war has inflicted on agricultural export markets.\"", "Various U.S. agricultural commodity groups have voiced similar concerns. For example, the American Soybean Association expressed \"extreme disappointment\" over USTR's escalating tariffs on China that led to retaliatory tariffs on soybeans. The National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) stated that the retaliatory tariffs are \"threatening the livelihoods of thousands of U.S. pig farmers.\" Due to African Swine Fever (ASF), China normally would have turned to the United States to meet its pork demand. With retaliatory tariffs in place, U.S. pork is more expensive than products from other sources in the Chinese market. NPPC Vice President Nick Giordano stated that from a U.S. farmer's perspective, China's increased demand for imported pork resulting from ASF in Chinese hogs would have been \"the single greatest sales opportunity in our industry's history.\" According to a report in the South China Morning Post , Iowa State University economist Dermot Hayes estimates that the trade dispute with China has cost American pig farmers $8 per animal, or $1 billion in total losses. The U.S. Dairy Export Council, in turn, stated in 2018 that the retaliatory tariffs that China and Mexico imposed could result in billions of dollars of lost sales for U.S. dairy producers.

A June 2019 USTR hearing for Section 301 tariffs included a diversity of witnesses across 55 panels over a seven-day period. As such, an issue for congressional consideration may be whether compensation for the losses arising from the various trade disputes should extend beyond those producers of agricultural commodities identified in the Administration's trade-aid initiative. USDA, using its authority under the CCC, is administering this assistance. Retaliatory tariffs have arguably affected businesses beyond the farm gate, including agricultural exporters, input suppliers, agricultural shippers, and others, potentially raising the question of whether these industries merit government compensation for tariff-related losses.

Once the formula became public, several commodity groups questioned the rationale for determining payments based on \"trade damage\" rather than the broader \"market loss\" measure. Similar questions have emerged about the 2019 trade-aid package. These questions concern the methodology used to calculate the payment rates, commodity coverage of the direct payments, and the equity of payments across regions and commodity sectors.", "The provision of trade aid has also raised questions regarding U.S. commitments under the WTO and other international agreements.

The United States is one of the most efficient and lowest-cost producers of food and agricultural products. Congress may want to consider whether the current trade dispute could have long-term environmental costs as less productive or more environmentally vulnerable areas are cultivated for agricultural production in lieu of more efficient and less environmentally sensitive U.S. production."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}}
