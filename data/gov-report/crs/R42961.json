{"id": "R42961", "title": "Comparing G-20 Reform of the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets", "released_date": "2013-02-19T00:00:00", "summary": ["Derivatives, or financial instruments whose value is based on an underlying asset, played a key role in the financial crisis of 2008-2009. Congress directly addressed the governance of the derivatives markets through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank; P.L. 111-203; July 21, 2010). This act, in Title VII, sought to bring the largely unregulated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets under greater regulatory control and scrutiny. Pillars of this approach included mandating that certain OTC derivatives be subject to central clearing, such as through a clearinghouse, which involves posting margin to cover potential losses; greater transparency through trading on exchanges or exchange-like facilities; and reporting trades to a repository, among other reforms.", "In the debates over Dodd-Frank and in subsequent years, many in Congress have raised the following important questions: If the United States takes stronger regulatory action than other countries, will business in these OTC derivatives markets shift overseas? Since OTC derivatives markets are global in nature, could derivatives trading across borders, or business for U.S. financial firms that engage in these trades, be disrupted if other countries do not adopt similar regulatory frameworks? The first step in addressing these congressional concerns is to examine the degree to which other major countries have adopted similar legislation and regulation as the United States, particularly in light of commitments from the Group of Twenty nations (G-20) to adopt certain derivatives reforms.", "Following the financial crisis, G-20 leaders (generally political heads of state) established a reform agenda and priorities within that agenda for regulating and overseeing OTC derivatives. The G-20 as an organization has no enforcement capabilities, but relies on the members themselves to implement reforms. According to recent surveys, most members are making progress in meeting the self-imposed goal of implementing major reforms in derivatives markets. Only the United States appears to have met all the reforms endorsed by the G-20 members within the desired timeframe of year-end 2012.", "The European Union (EU), Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States have each taken significant steps towards implementing legislation requiring central clearing. However, in most of these jurisdictions legislation has not yet been followed up with technical implementing regulations for the requirements to become effective, according to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which conducts the surveys. Most authorities surveyed estimated that a significant proportion of interest rate derivatives would be centrally cleared by year-end 2012, but they were less confident of progress for other asset classes. The EU appeared to be making progress in its G-20 derivatives regulatory commitments, particularly in central clearing and trade repository-reporting requirements, but at a slower pace than the United States, according to the FSB. This may be due in part to the need for legislation to be passed by individual national legislatures even when agreed broadly by the EU. As of October 2012, however, only the United States had adopted legislation requiring standardized derivatives to be traded on exchanges and electronic platforms.", "This report examines the G-20 recommendations for reforming OTC derivatives markets and presents the result of self-assessment surveys measuring the performance of G-20 members and some FSB members to date in meeting their commitments. The Appendix to the report presents more detailed information on the status of individual jurisdictions in implementing the G-20-endorsed reforms. The Glossary defines key international bodies and related financial terms and concepts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Financial derivatives are widely used throughout the economy by financial firms, corporations, farmers, and investors to serve a number of different purposes. A broad set of factors are responsible for the 2008-2009 financial crisis, but derivatives played a key role in the crisis by fueling a housing bubble and enabling large-scale systemic risk in the financial system. Congress plays a major role in the derivatives market by passing laws and regulations that define the nature of derivatives market activity and through its oversight role over the major regulators of the derivatives markets.", "The 2008-2009 financial crisis spurred policymakers from a range of countries, spearheaded by the G-20, to commit their countries to reforming domestic and international rules governing the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets. Most assessments generally agree that a broad set of factors played a role in the financial crisis and in the ensuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe. However, actions by investors in the derivatives markets likely aggravated the financial crisis, required billions in government assistance to American International Group, Inc. (AIG) and other financial firms to cover losses associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and played a key role in destabilizing financial markets. In addition, public and congressional attention has continued to focus on derivatives markets as a result of the key role derivatives played in worsening Greece's financial crisis and the roughly $6 billion in derivatives-trading losses in 2012 reported by JP Morgan. ", "According to standard finance theory, derivatives markets benefit financial markets and the wider economy by improving the pricing of risk, adding to liquidity, and helping market participants manage their risks. In particular, derivatives are used by financial firms, corporations, farmers, and investors to hedge against, or speculate on, changes in prices, rates, or indices, or even on events such as the potential defaults on debts. As a result, they have added to liquidity and been instrumental in expanding financial opportunities for a broad range of market participants, particularly in mitigating risks associated with changes in exchange rates and interest rates. Nevertheless, OTC derivatives can add substantial risk to financial markets due to the very nature of derivatives. OTC derivatives contracts often involve lengthy commitments during which time a position can potentially generate a substantial counterparty credit exposure. Also, since OTC derivatives often require a small initial outlay of cash, small changes in the value of the underlying securities of the derivatives can abruptly expand the potential liabilities and raise counterparty credit risk dramatically during periods of market turbulence. In addition, derivatives markets and transactions span national borders and national regulators. Consequently, troubles in derivatives markets can reverberate far beyond the original source of the problem. ", "The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that derivatives contributed to the 2008-2009 financial crisis in three major ways. First, credit default swaps were instrumental in fueling the securitization of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and in the subsequent housing bubble. Next, credit default swaps were essential in creating synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDO), or financial instruments that served as bets on the performance of real mortgage-backed securities, which amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread the losses throughout the financial system. Finally, once the housing boom ended, derivatives were at the center of the crisis due to (1) concerns that losses associated with derivatives would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system; and (2) the lack of transparency concerning the overall size of the derivatives market and the extent of derivatives transactions between systemically important financial institutions that directly added to uncertainty and panic in global financial markets. ", "Perhaps the best known example of problems stemming from large OTC derivatives exposure in the financial crisis came from the near-collapse of the large conglomerate American International Group, Inc. (AIG), which wrote about $1.8 trillion worth of OTC derivatives contracts for credit default swaps. These credit default swaps guaranteed payment if certain mortgage-backed securities defaulted or experienced other \"credit events.\" Many of AIG's contracts did require it to post collateral as the credit quality of the underlying securities (or AIG's own credit rating) deteriorated, but AIG did not post an initial margin, as this was deemed unnecessary because of the firm's triple-A rating. As the subprime crisis worsened, AIG was subjected to margin calls that it could not meet. To avert bankruptcy, with the risk of global financial chaos, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury put tens of billions of dollars into AIG, the bulk of which went to its derivatives counterparties.", "The AIG case illustrates two aspects of OTC markets that are central to derivatives reform proposals. First, as noted above, AIG was able to amass an OTC derivatives position so large that it threatened to destabilize the entire financial system when the firm suffered unexpected losses, and the risks of default to AIG derivatives counterparties grew. In a market with mandatory clearing and margin, in which AIG would have been required to post an initial margin to cover potential losses, there is a stronger possibility that AIG would have run out of money long before the size of its position had reached $1.8 trillion.", "Second, because OTC contracts were not reported to regulators, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) and the U.S. Treasury Department lacked information about which institutions were exposed to AIG, and the size of those exposures. Uncertainty among market participants about the size and distribution of potential derivatives losses flowing from the failure of a major dealer was a factor that exacerbated the \"freezing\" of credit markets during the peaks of the crisis, and made banks unwilling to lend to each other. ", "A basic theme in derivatives reform proposals is to get the OTC market to act more like the exchange-traded futures market\u2014in particular, to have bilateral OTC swaps cleared by a third-party clearing organization.", "Generally, OTC derivatives are used in a variety of ways, including hedging, investing, exploiting arbitrage opportunities, and position-taking. OTC derivative instruments are generally referred to as swaps. Yet swaps have widely differing characteristics and degrees of standardization, and can include bets on a number of different types of assets. The global OTC derivatives markets are dominated by five different types of swaps: foreign exchange swaps; interest rate swaps; equity-linked swaps; commodity swaps; and credit default swaps, as indicated in Table 1 . At the end of 2011, the total notional amounts outstanding of OTC derivatives amounted to $647.8 trillion, down about 8% from the $706.9 trillion in derivatives recorded in June 2011. The notional amount, also called the reference amount, refers to the underlying value of the assets that are being bet on through a derivatives contract. Figure 1 depicts the relative total sizes of the global derivatives market; world assets; world GDP; and the world's official reserves. It demonstrates that the size of the global derivatives market, in terms of notional value, tends to dwarf these other major categories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Derivatives and Global Capital Markets", "paragraphs": ["Financial markets that trade derivatives grew rapidly over the past decade and now serve large trades involving vast amounts of funds, as indicated in Table 2 . According to data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), global trading in OTC foreign exchange derivatives and OTC interest rate derivatives amounted to $567 trillion in 2011, or approximately nine times world gross domestic product (GDP) of $70 trillion. These data do not include trading in equity and commodity-linked derivatives, which likely would boost these numbers substantially higher. In addition, the total notional value, or the total gross nominal value of the underlying assets, of derivatives in 2011 was reported as being more than twice the size of the total value of all stocks, bonds, and bank assets, as indicated in Table 2 . The United States, with the largest gross domestic product (GDP) of any country (and about the same size as the EU's GDP) also had the largest single share of OTC interest and exchange rate derivatives trading in 2011\u2014a share slightly greater than that of the Euro area\u2014in terms of the notional value of the derivatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "G-20 Efforts to Reform OTC Derivatives Markets", "paragraphs": ["The financial crisis of 2008-2009 exposed weaknesses in the OTC markets that contributed to the build-up of systemic risk and threatened to disrupt the functioning of international financial markets. OTC derivatives are traded by a large and diverse group of market participants, including banks, hedge funds, pension funds, other institutional investors, corporations, and government entities. This market, however, is dominated by a limited number of dealers. Such dealers provide liquidity to the market by selling derivatives contracts to customers and managing the resulting risk exposures through offsetting transactions in the underlying assets, exchange traded derivatives, and further trades with dealers and traders in OTC markets. These dealers are highly interconnected through a network of trades and, therefore, are highly exposed to spillover, or contagion, effects from turmoil in other parts of the markets. Such market disruptions can trigger a chain of credit-related losses which, in turn, could result in severe market disruptions and potentially a chain of defaults. According to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), these weaknesses include (1) the build-up of large counterparty exposures between particular market participants through collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps which have not been appropriately risk-managed; (2) contagion risk arising from the interconnectedness of the OTC derivatives market participants; and (3) the limited transparency of overall counterparty credit risk exposures that can precipitate a loss of confidence and market liquidity in times of stress. ", "In November 2008, as the heads of state of the G-20 nations met in Washington, DC, to respond to the financial crisis, they agreed to implement a number of reforms to address the perceived failures in the financial system. The G-20 leaders concluded at that time that major failures in regulation and supervision of financial markets, in combination with increased risk-taking by banks, had created fragilities that threatened to undermine the financial system. In particular, the leaders concluded that the global financial system had become highly interconnected, but that the system lacked a commensurate level of transparency regarding the associated counterparty exposures that was comparable to the level of complexity. The growing interconnectedness of financial markets means that a shock that originates in one country or asset market can quickly affect other markets and other countries, known as contagion. ", "However, while global financial markets have become increasingly interconnected, large and highly complex financial firms have grown to straddle continents and markets. At the same time, regulators and regulations have remained national in scope and have been unprepared to address financial crises with cross-border implications. Due to the challenges of effectively harmonizing all regulations across national boundaries and legal systems, and possibly as a result of few effective institutional mechanisms to ensure such coordination of national regulatory bodies, national regulators have focused on meeting national objectives. At times, this can lead to a lack of uniformity, or even conflicts, between regulatory regimes. Arguably, it can lead to national priorities subsuming concerns about global financial stability. ", "Through successive summits, G-20 leaders have addressed these perceived failures by refining their goals and developing increasingly detailed objectives for the G-20 members to improve financial market infrastructures (FMIs). One of these first steps included \"improving the infrastructure of over-the-counter\" (OTC) derivative markets and credit default swaps. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has argued that providing harmonized standards for FMIs is important to the functioning of the financial system and in fostering stability. The BIS concluded that FMIs, or systemically important payments systems, play a critical role in the financial system and the broader economy by ", "facilitating the clearing, settlement, and recording of monetary and other financial transactions, such as payments, securities, and derivatives contracts.... While safe and efficient FMIs contribute to maintaining and promoting financial stability and economic growth, FMIs also concentrate risk. If not properly managed, FMIs can be sources of financial shocks, such as liquidity dislocations and credit losses, or a major channel through which these shocks are transmitted across domestic and international financial markets.", "In addition, at the November 2008 Washington, DC, summit, the leaders supported actions by regulators to speed up efforts to reduce the systemic risks associated with credit default swaps and over-the-counter derivatives transactions. They also supported efforts to ensure greater transparency for OTC derivatives and an adequate infrastructure to support the growing volumes of OTC derivatives trading. These three objectives\u2014improving transparency, mitigating risk, and protecting against market abuse\u2014continue to drive G-20 reforms of the OTC derivatives markets.", "The G-20 leaders have expressed their support for reforming the OTC derivatives markets in successive G-20 summits. Actions taken by the G-20 leaders at some of the Summits have been particularly noteworthy: ", "At the Pittsburgh Summit in September 2009, G-20 leaders agreed that all standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties (CCPs) by the end of 2012. In addition, they agreed that all OTC contracts should be reported to trade repositories (TRs). The G-20 leaders also tasked the Financial Stability Board with assessing the implementation of the agreed reforms and determining whether those reforms would be sufficient to achieve the main goal of improving transparency in the derivatives markets, mitigating systemic risk, and protecting against market abuse. In October 2010, the FSB published a report containing 21 recommendations for the G-20 nations to assist them in implementing the G-20 leaders' commitments concerning standardization, central clearing, exchange or electronic platform trading, and reporting of OTC derivatives transactions to trade repositories. The FSB then published an updated report in October 2011, a third report in June 2012, and a fourth report in October 2012. These reports detail country commitments in six specific areas of reform: (1) standardization of OTC derivatives contracts; (2) central clearing of OTC derivatives contracts; (3) exchange or electronic platform trading; (4) transparency and trading; (5) reporting to trade repositories; and (6) application of central clearing requirements. In April 2011, the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements published a consultative report on recommendations regarding OTC derivatives data reporting. In January 2012, the committee published its final report. At the Cannes G-20 Summit in November 2011, the leaders adopted the recommendations of the derivatives markets working group and agreed to continue making progress in reforming the OTC derivatives market. The summit final communiqu\u00e9 declared that:", "Reforming the over-the-counter derivatives markets is crucial to building a more resilient financial system. All standardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and centrally cleared, by the end of 2012; OTC derivatives contracts should be reported to trade repositories, and non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital requirements. We agree to cooperate further to avoid loopholes and overlapping regulations. A coordination group is being established by the FSB to address some of these issues, complementing the existing OTC derivatives working group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing G-20 Derivatives Market Reforms", "paragraphs": ["As indicated above, the FSB was tasked by the G-20 with monitoring and reporting on the success of G-20 nations in meeting the year-end 2012 deadline of implementing the OTC derivatives market reforms. These reforms have focused on the three major objectives of the reforms as articulated by the G-20 leaders at the Washington, DC, summit: improving transparency, mitigating risk, and protecting against market abuse. These three objectives have been addressed through five broad areas of reforms: (1) standardizing OTC derivatives contracts; (2) developing international standards and policy for central clearing and for risk management of non-centrally cleared derivatives; (3) developing international standards and policy for exchanges or electronic platform trading; (4) developing the infrastructure to facilitate reporting OTC transactions to trade repositories (TR); and (5) developing and implementing international standards and policies for capital requirements. ", "As a result of self-assessments by G-20 members, except for France, Germany, and Italy, which are represented by the EU in the survey, and such FSB members as Singapore and Switzerland, the FSB offered four general conclusions: ", "Only Japan and the United States had adopted the necessary legislation to reach the goal of having derivatives centrally cleared by the end of 2012, while the EU had reached a political consensus regarding legislation. Most authorities estimated that a significant proportion of interest rate derivatives will be centrally cleared by year-end 2012, but they were less confident of progress for other asset classes and could not make firm estimates when central clearing could be achieved. On the whole, the countries surveyed were markedly behind in implementing commitments that standardized contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms by year-end 2012. According to the BIS, increasing the proportion of the market traded on organized platforms is important for improving transparency, mitigating systemic risk, and protecting against market abuse. Only the United States had passed legislation with requirements for pre- and post-trade transparency and proposed detailed regulations; the EU had made legislative proposals, and the Japanese Diet had approved legislation with provisions to improve the transparency of derivatives markets. The increased standardization of contracts is a core element of the G-20 nations' commitment relating to central clearing, organized trading and reporting to TRs, and increasing the benefits in terms of improved transparency, reduced systemic risk, and greater protection against market abuse. Most countries have made progress in developing legislative frameworks to have all OTC derivatives contracts reported to trade repositories (TRs), although not all members have adopted legislation. The majority of members have published consultative documents regarding the establishment of TRs and the related reporting requirements. The FSB lacked information on capital requirements for non-bank regulated entities, because capital standards related to banks' exposures to central clearing parties are still being developed. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) published a report in November 2011 on capital standards for banks' exposures, and the BIS published a report in March 2012 on collateral requirements for central clearing of OTC derivatives and a report in July 2012 on capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties. The BIS expected that by the start of 2012 the higher capital requirements associated with the higher counterparty credit risk of non-centrally cleared derivatives contracts would have been met internationally for banks through the Basel III standards. The BIS expects that the higher capital standards for non-centrally cleared contracts will provide incentives for standardization and central clearing.", "In March 2010, 14 of the largest derivatives dealers committed to take a number of steps to make derivatives trading more transparent, expand central clearing, improve standardization of derivatives contracts, and manage collateral associated with derivatives trading. These commitments included specific target levels for the central clearing of OTC credit derivatives and OTC interest rate derivatives that were eligible for central clearing counterparties. It was acknowledged, however, that the enhanced clearing targets covered only part of the OTC market, because most derivative contracts were not eligible for central counterparty clearing. In order to address this issue and to implement the G-20 recommendations, the FSB initiated a working group, led by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and the European Commission (EC) to assess and develop policy options for promoting the increased use of standardized products and for implementing at the global level the mandatory clearing of derivatives contracts and the exchange or electronic trading requirements.", "The following sections examine the major issues involved and the progress made to date in the five broad areas of reforms addressed by the FSB surveys: (1) standards for OTC derivatives contracts; (2) central clearing and non-centrally cleared derivatives; (3) exchanges or electronic platform trading; (4) reporting to trade repositories (TR); and (5) capital requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Progress in Standardizing OTC Derivatives Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Issue : Standardization of derivative contracts is a core element in meeting the G-20 commitments for central clearing, organized trading, and reporting to trade repositories (TRs). As indicated previously, 14 major derivatives dealers developed a broad \"roadmap\" for increasing standardization of derivatives products. In a second, 2011 letter to New York Federal Reserve President William C. Dudley, the group discussed this roadmap, consisting of three core initiatives to (1) develop ongoing analyses to benchmark the level of standardization in each asset class; (2) continue ongoing work in standardizing products in each asset class; and (3) work with central clearing parties, trade repositories, and other infrastructure providers to standardize processes in each asset class. ", "Progress : According to the FSB, about half of the surveyed countries have adopted, or have plans to adopt, legislative and regulatory measures to increase the use of standardized derivative products and processes. Those jurisdictions with markets that already are highly standardized reported that they expected to remain at those levels. ", "Latest Developments : The October 2012 FSB progress report concluded that uncertainty over the legislative and regulatory requirements about which specific products and market participants will be covered under new clearing requirements is slowing progress in offering products for clearing and in developing new services to support mandatory central clearing. The FSB also indicated that the lack of standardization of financial products and uncertainty about which features will ultimately be used as the measure for \"standardization\" across jurisdictions is slowing progress in offering new products and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress in Developing International Standards for Clearing and Risk Management for Uncleared Derivatives", "paragraphs": ["Issue : The mandatory clearing of standardized derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) such as clearinghouses stands as the centerpiece of international efforts to improve stability in global financial markets, as it is expected to enhance counterparty risk management. According to recent research, an expanded role for CCPs fills a number of important market roles, as described by the European Central Bank (ECB). First, CCPs are in a unique position to assess the risks that are faced by the financial system as a whole, because they have information on all cleared transactions. Such information enhances transparency and improves the ability of CCPs to assess the risks to existing transactions that may arise from new transactions. Second, since CCPs have a more complete understanding of risk exposures than individual counterparties, they can provide a more accurate assessment of exposures, which improves risk management and the allocation of capital. Third, as independent clearing agents, CCPs have the ability to provide effective insurance against counterparty risk by pooling risks. ", "The growing role of CCPs also entails certain risks. CCPs are arguably systemically important institutions that could become \"too big to fail.\" According to some analysts, this potential for systemic risk argues in favor of the regulation, supervision, and oversight of CCPs. In addition, effectively implementing central clearing is affected by such factors as the size of the market, governance of the market, and the structure of the market. Since pooling risk by a CCP is one of the main benefits of centralized clearing, the size and liquidity of the market are important. Achieving sufficient liquidity may require mandatory central clearing of transactions. Relying on market incentives alone may not be enough to induce individual participants to join in central clearing, because the costs of clearing for an individual participant may outweigh the benefits. The economic benefits of central clearing tend to be fully realized only as the number of participants rises. ", "The ECB also contends that CCPs require outside supervision to ensure that the profit motive of the CCPs does not conflict with the requirement for providing appropriate risk mitigation. In addition, supervising CCPs requires balancing efficiency with safety considerations. Competition between CCPs may decentralize the clearing process, making the process efficient, but having it operate at a level that is less than optimal. On the other hand, concentrated clearing may increase the risks of concentrating excessive risk and present obstacles to adequately overseeing and supervising CCPs, especially for CCPs that operate on a cross-border basis.", "Based on recommendations prepared by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), the BIS proposed a set of standards for the central clearing of derivatives that was adopted by the G-20 members and some FSB members in 2012. According to the FSB, these standards harmonize, strengthen, and replace previously separate sets of international principles for financial market infrastructures. In addition, the standards \"seek to enhance safety and efficiency in payment, clearing, settlement and recording arrangements and, more broadly, to limit systemic risk and foster transparency and financial stability.\"", "According to the BIS, the \"nature of counterparty exposures in OTC derivatives markets is widely considered to have exacerbated\" the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and \"exposures were often inadequately collateralized.\" The BIS also concluded that: \"[C]learing trades centrally can mitigate these structural weaknesses.\" About half of all derivatives contracts are not cleared by a CCP, but are simply settled as bilateral contracts. This has arguably resulted in a proliferation of redundant overlapping contracts, exacerbating counterparty risks and adding to the complexity and opacity of the interconnections in the financial system. ", "CCPs are expected to reduce counterparty credit risk by (1) imposing multilateral netting of exposures whereby market participants net all of their derivative positions with a common counterparty; and (2) reducing risk by enforcing collateralization of exposures. The G-20 leaders agreed that all standardized derivatives contracts should be cleared through central counterparties by the end of 2012 to help mitigate systemic risk. That potentially means a sharp increase in the volume of transactions and in the collateral requirements of central counterparties. Non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital requirements, according to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. These standards also include measures for evaluating the factors that should be taken into account when determining whether a derivative contract is standardized and, therefore, suitable for clearing. According to 2012 data used by the FSB, 40% of interest rate derivatives were cleared through a central counterparty (CCP); but only about 10% of credit default swaps were cleared by a CCP. Except for the United States, few of the G-20 nations were confident that significant proportions of credit or commodity derivatives would be centrally cleared by year-end 2012, and no G-20 country indicated that large proportions of equity or foreign exchange derivatives would be centrally cleared by year-end 2012.", "Progress : The FSB's October 2012 report indicated that the EU, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States had taken significant steps towards implementing legislation that mandates central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives. Other jurisdictions were generally less advanced, but reported making progress. Also, the FSB noted that in many jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, and the EU, legislative changes must be followed up with more technical implementing regulations in order for the requirements to become fully effective. Some jurisdictions have been waiting for the key elements of the regulatory frameworks adopted in the United States, Japan, and the EU before adopting their own regulations. According to the FSB, the basic market infrastructure is in place and \"does not appear to be an impediment to further progress in meeting the G-20 commitments for OTC derivatives trading, central clearing, and reporting.\" The FSB also concluded that regulatory uncertainty remains the \"most significant impediment to further progress and to comprehensive use of market infrastructure.\" As a result, it urged jurisdictions to promptly put in place their legislation and regulations. ", "According to the FSB, most of the jurisdictions in the G-20 countries require CCPs to register or obtain an exemption from registration from the relevant domestic regulators in that jurisdiction in order to provide clearing services to its domestic market participants. This registration requirement applies both where the CCP has a local presence and where it offers cross-border services, which means that CCPs intending to offer services in multiple locations are required to register in multiple jurisdictions in order to provide services to market participants operating in those jurisdictions. These requirements are being felt by some of the largest banks and brokerage firms in the world, with subsidiaries, affiliates, or branches in multiple jurisdictions that serve as clearing members of CCPs.", "Latest D evelopments : In October 2012, the FSB reported a number of conclusions following a survey of the G-20 members on the extent and progress of meeting the year-end 2012 goal of broad-based central clearing of derivatives contracts. The main FSB conclusions are", "1. CCPs are available to clear some OTC derivatives products in each of the five asset classes (foreign exchange contracts; interest rate contracts; equity-linked contracts; commodity contracts; and credit default swaps), with many of the CCPs expected to expand clearing services in the near term. 2. Of the 19 CCPs included in the FSB's survey, 9 are located in different jurisdictions; 5 reported offering services across borders and being registered in multiple jurisdictions, while 13 were supervised in and offered services in the same jurisdiction in which they are located. 3. CCPs apply their membership criteria to applicants located domestically and abroad, but direct clearing members generally are located in the same jurisdiction as the CCP. 4. Timelines for clearing new products vary considerably based on the complexity of the product; in some cases, CCPs were unable to estimate the time for introducing new products because of variation in risk management procedures and regulatory approvals. 5. Approximately half of the CCPs reported operational links to other types of market infrastructure, most commonly organized trading platforms and other CCPs.", "The FSB also published in November 2012 the results of a survey concerning approaches the G-20 and FSB countries expect to take on central clearing. The survey asked the countries whether their approach to central clearing would be based on the use of domestic clearing infrastructure or infrastructure located in other jurisdictions, and whether they would impose mandatory clearing requirements or rely on economic incentives, or some combination of both. According to the FSB survey, the majority of countries indicated that market participants would be able to use either domestic or cross-border CCPs to clear OTC derivatives contracts, while some countries indicated that market participants would use domestic CCPs only due to characteristics specific to a particular domestic market. In addition, the FSB concluded that most G-20 members will adopt mandatory clearing requirements or, as is the case with the United States and the EU, a combination of mandatory clearing requirements and economic incentives, to meet the G-20 commitment to have all standardized OTC derivatives contracts centrally cleared by year-end 2012. ", "Some countries, however, have expressed concern about \"fair and open\" access to central clearing parties. In response, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the BIS produced a set of 24 principles for financial market infrastructures (FMIs), covering such areas as general organization; credit and liquidity risk management; settlement; central securities depositories and exchange-of-value settlement systems; default management; general business and operational risk management; access; efficiency; and transparency. The committee concluded that: ", "Fair and open access to FMI (financial market infrastructures) services encourages competition among market participants and promotes efficient and low-cost clearing and settlement ... participation requirements should therefore encourage broad access, including access by participants, other market infrastructures, and where relevant service providers in all relevant jurisdictions, based on reasonable risk-related participation requirements.", "Also, the FSB identified and is coordinating a set of four safeguards for a global framework to help authorities make informed decisions on the appropriate form of central counterparties (CCPs) to meet the G-20 commitment and to ensure that global CCPs do not introduce new systemic risks into the financial system. These four safeguards are ", "1. Fair and open market access by market participants to CCPs, based on transparent and objective criteria; 2. Cooperative oversight arrangements between relevant authorities, both domestically and internationally and on either a bilateral or multilateral basis, that result in robust and consistently applied regulation and oversight of global CCPs; 3. Appropriate liquidity arrangements for CCPs in the currencies in which they clear; and 4. Robust resolution regimes to ensure that the core functions of CCPs are maintained during times of crisis and that consider the interests of all jurisdictions where the CCP is systemically important. ", "As further guidance on these issues, the BIS published documents relating to the capital requirements for banks dealing with central counterparties and on the recovery and resolution of such financial market infrastructures as CCPs.

These platforms fulfill broadly the same function, but they may differ in the trade execution models they use to affect the transactions. There also may be differences in the participants that are covered by the various platforms: there may be differences in the degree of automation, the scope of asset class of products that are covered, and the geographic coverage.

As of October 2012, only the United States had adopted legislation that requires standardized derivatives be traded on exchanges and electronic platforms. Outside the United States, the derivatives classes for which organized platform trading are most widely available are credit default swaps and interest rate swaps. The FSB argues that, at the very least, requiring transparency in reporting the price and volume of OTC derivatives transactions should serve to inform decisions regarding mandatory organized platform trading.", "Latest Developments . According to the FSB's October 2012 survey, the most commonly cited reason for the lack of more widespread development and use of organized trading platforms is uncertainty about the scope and form of requirements for OTC derivatives to be traded on organized trading platforms. In addition, market infrastructure operators face challenges in creating the appropriate technology to interface with clients and other infrastructure, which could create efficiencies that would create incentives to build links with other infrastructure. The FSB also concluded that:", "1. Trading infrastructure is less developed than infrastructure for central clearing and trade reporting, due to uncertainties about the scope and form of future regulatory frameworks for organized platform trading. 2. Organized trading platforms currently are available for trading certain derivatives products, primarily credit and interest rate swaps. 3. Features of existing organized trading platforms vary, reflecting a range of characteristics. 4. Most of the organized trading platforms are headquartered in Europe or the United States, with global online access and local offices and trading screens in other markets. 5. The extent that organized trading platforms are linked to other infrastructure varies, but is likely to increase. 6. New trading platforms are expected to become operational relatively quickly once regulatory frameworks for mandatory organized platform trading are put in place. 7. Some degree of product standardization is a prerequisite for an OTC derivative to be transacted on an organized trading platform.

This mandate includes (1) assessing systemic risk and financial stability; (2) conducting market surveillance and enforcement; (3) supervising market participants; and (4) conducting resolution activities. In the FSB's October 2012 survey, it concluded that TRs (except for two TRs located in the European Union) predominantly serve market participants located in their home jurisdictions. ", "Progress : The FSB has concluded that currently there is no single, industry-wide format for data reporting, processing, and storage of OTC derivatives trade data. This lack of a common format compromises one of the major objectives of the reporting requirement: the ability to aggregate OTC derivatives data across multiple TRs to support the objectives of supervisory and regulatory authorities. This issue is being addressed in a number of ways, including the development of a global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) system through the FSB, which noted that the finance sector lags behind other industries in agreeing on and introducing a consistent global framework for entity identification. The LEI system is considered to be an important \"building block\" in contributing to and facilitating such financial stability objectives as (1) improved risk management in firms; (2) better assessment of micro and macroprudential risks; (3) facilitation of orderly resolution; (4) containing market abuse and curbing financial fraud; and (5) enabling higher quality and accuracy of financial data overall. As a first step, the FSB proposed the development of a Regulatory Oversight Committee (ROC) charged with responsibility for the governance of the global LEI system. A draft charter for the ROC was approved by the G-20 members in November 2012, and the ROC became operational in January 2013. Currently, the ROC is comprised of 45 authorities, primarily central banks, and 15 observers.

The Basel III reforms concerning OTC derivatives strengthen the capital requirements for counterparty credit risk (CCR), or the risk that the counterparty to a transaction is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations. For non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives, banks will be subject to a credit valuation adjustment charge, or the adjustment that quantifies the potential loss caused by changes in the credit quality of the counterparty.

The capital requirements are meant to ensure that the core functions of central clearing parties, and other types of financial market infrastructures, can be maintained during a crisis, especially when the CCP is considered to be systemically important. ", "In large part, these rules are intended to create incentives for market participants to use CCPs. The interim rules set a nominal risk weight for banks that act as a clearing member of a CCP for their own purposes or on behalf of clients of 2% for trade exposures to a CCP that is supervised, among other requirements. Despite opposition from banks, they will be required to hold capital against the prospect that they may be compelled by market events to draw upon their default fund, something they have not had to do to date. The interim rules also require that banks apply a default risk of 1250% to their default fund contributions of a non-qualifying CCP.", "When the BIS proposed placing capital requirements on banks for exposure to centrally cleared derivatives, it also addressed the issue of risk exposure to non-centrally cleared derivatives by proposing margin requirements. In particular, the BIS argued that such margin requirements on non-centrally cleared derivatives are necessary in order to (1) mitigate systemic risk associated with the large volumes of OTC derivatives that are not sufficiently standardized for central clearing; (2) ensure that collateral is available to offset losses caused by the default of a counterparty; and (3) limit the buildup of uncollateralized exposures in the financial system. The BIS argued further that margin requirements that reflect the higher risk associated with non-centrally cleared derivatives \"complement and support\" the G-20 derivatives market reforms, because they promote central clearing by addressing \"financial incentives that might otherwise induce market participants to customize contracts and thereby avoid the costs of clearing that arise from CCP's requirements for margin.\"", "Latest Developments : The European Banking Authority (EBA) published its final draft regulations on capital requirements for central counterparties on September 26, 2012.

As a result, the regulators agreed to a \"reasonable, limited\" transition period to facilitate the implementation of cross-border regulations in appropriate circumstances and in consultation with other jurisdictions. 4. Areas of Exploration . The regulators agreed to follow one of a number of approaches to regulating cross-border activities when more than one set of rules applies: (1) recognize the rules or oversight of another authority; (2) as part of a registration requirement, allow foreign regulations to substitute for applicable domestic regulations; (3) allow foreign regulations to substitute for compliance with otherwise applicable transaction-level requirements; (4) provide different sets of registration categories or provide for the same regulatory requirements to be observed in different ways based on characteristics and activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Progress in Major Foreign OTC Derivatives Markets", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "European Union", "paragraphs": ["On July 4, 2012, the European Parliament and the European Council approved the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), which entered into force on August 16, 2012, as the main legislative device for reforming the OTC derivatives market in the EU.

While these reforms are being implemented, Congress may choose to monitor them carefully to assess the comparability between regulations adopted in the United States and those adopted abroad in markets that serve as competitors for U.S. financial services firms. The objective of these reforms is to establish criteria for standardizing derivatives contracts and to have those contracts traded on organized trading markets through central counterparties that have a capital base that is sufficient to cover any risk exposure. In addition, the data on standardized contracts are expected to be reported to trade repositories and made available to regulators and policymakers in order to assess the stability and performance of the derivatives market. These reforms are being addressed through regulatory changes in five areas: (1) standardizing OTC derivatives contracts; (2) developing international standards and policy for central clearing and for risk management of non-centrally cleared derivatives; (3) developing international standards and policy for exchanges or electronic platform trading; (4) developing the infrastructure to facilitate reporting OTC transactions to trade repositories (TR); and (5) developing and implementing international standards and policies for capital requirements.

While market participants generally have accepted the fact that the OTC derivatives markets will be reformed, they are closely monitoring how those reforms are implemented and instances of differences in implementation or regulatory arbitrage. As implementation proceeds in both the United States and abroad, Congress may be pressed at times to amend current measures.", "The FSB has been tasked by the G-20 to coordinate and report on the progress its members have made in adopting various derivatives market reforms. According to the latest report, the surveyed countries are making progress in such areas as having derivatives contracts centrally cleared and reported to trade repositories, but lag behind in standardizing contracts, building up capital reserves, and having contracts traded through exchanges or on electronic platforms. Without a generally accepted definition of what constitutes a standardized derivatives contract, data reported to trade repositories will not be comparable, which would greatly reduce the ability of regulators to make assessments of the state of the derivatives markets. Another key issue is the comparability of reforms across the surveyed countries. While countries are ostensibly meeting the reform objectives of the G-20, it is not possible to assess the quality of the current reforms and the potential for regulatory arbitrage. This is particularly true for G-20 members that currently are not hosts to large volumes of derivatives trading and may have relatively under-developed capital markets.", "As a result of a survey of the efforts made to date by G-20 members and some FSB members, the Financial Stability Board concluded in October 2012 that:", "Regulators and derivatives market participants were struggling to meet their commitments to implement market reforms by the end of 2012. While significant progress has been made in constructing the architecture for standardizing, clearing, and reporting derivatives contracts, regulators are juggling sometimes conflicting objectives. In particular, market participants are pressuring regulators to develop a common set of rules to reduce the prospects of regulatory arbitrage and to reduce regulatory uncertainties in cross-border transactions. Regulators in a number of countries surveyed by the FSB are closely gauging their own actions to ensure that any regulations they propose are aligned with those of the market leaders, principally the United States and the European Union. In addition, few of the surveyed countries have adopted measures for building capital reserves. Various countries face impediments in reforming the way derivatives are traded and reported, the most important being uncertainty over the regulatory framework that is being developed in the United States and European Union. As a group, the G-20 countries and the FSB members have committed to adopting legislation and regulations to fully implement the G-20 reforms, but few nations have progressed as far as the United States and most are either drafting or still finalizing regulations. According to the FSB, the market infrastructure is mostly in place for greater coordination of efforts regarding standardizing, clearing, and reporting on derivatives contracts. A lack of regulatory conformity, however, appears to be impeding progress. For instance, market leaders remain uncertain over the definition of what constitutes a standardized derivatives contract and, therefore, are hesitant to adopt regulations on clearing and reporting relative to standardized derivatives contracts. Trade repositories are positioned to report on each of the five asset classes (foreign exchange contracts; interest rate contracts; equity-linked contracts; commodity contracts; and credit default swaps). Nevertheless, there is no single standard format for data reporting and storage, and the majority of TRs use proprietary codes and formats, which make aggregation and reconciliation difficult, thereby undermining one of the main objectives in collecting and reporting data on derivatives contracts.
