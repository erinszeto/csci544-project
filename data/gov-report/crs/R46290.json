The Administration's FY2021 budget proposes reduced funding for the Department of Commerce, NSF, and most of the related agencies, and increased funding for DOJ and NASA. The proposed reduction in overall funding for CJS is partially the result of a proposed $5.886 billion (-77.9%) decrease in funding for the Census Bureau, which, in keeping with past precedent, receives less funding in the fiscal year after conducting the decennial census.

The Administration's FY2021 request includes the following: ", "$8.318 billion for the Department of Commerce, which is $6.903 billion (-45.4%) less than the $15.221 billion provided for FY2020; $32.964 billion for the Department of Justice, which is $358 million (1.1%) more than the $32.605 billion provided for FY2020; $32.994 billion for the science agencies, which is $2.080 billion (6.7%) more than the $30.915 billion provided for FY2020; and $574 million for the related agencies, which is $445 million (-43.7%) less than the $1.019 billion provided for FY2020. ", "The decrease in funding for the Department of Commerce is largely the result of a proposed $5.886 billion (-77.9%) decrease in funding for the Census Bureau. For the past several fiscal years, Congress has increased funding for the Census Bureau to help build capacity for conducting the decennial 2020 Census. In keeping with past precedent, funding for the Census Bureau peaks in the year in which the decennial census is conducted and it decreases sharply in the following year (see the discussion on historical funding for CJS, below). However, the proposed reduction in funding for the Department of Commerce is not only the result of reduced funding for the Census Bureau. The Administration also proposes shuttering the EDA (though the Administration requests some funding to help provide for an orderly closeout of the EDA's operations) and eliminating NIST's Manufacturing Extension Partnership and NOAA's Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. In addition, the Administration proposes reducing funding for several other Department of Commerce accounts, including the following:", "the International Trade Administration (-$36 million, -7.0%); NIST's Scientific and Technical Research and Services account (-$102 million, -13.5%); NIST's Industrial Technology Services account (-$137 million, -84.4%); NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account (-$599 million, -15.9%); and NOAA's Procurement, Acquisition, and Facilities account (-$64 million, -4.2%).", "The Administration also proposes a $32 million (-75.5%) reduction for the Minority Business Development Administration. It proposes changing the agency's focus to being a policy office that concentrates on advocating for the minority business community as a whole rather than supporting individual minority business enterprises.", "The Administration's FY2021 budget includes a proposal to establish a Federal Capital Revolving Fund, which would be administered by the General Services Administration (GSA). The Administration proposes to transfer $294 million from the proposed fund to NIST's Construction of Research Facilities account for renovating NIST's Building 1 in Boulder, CO, which would be repaid by NIST from future appropriations at $20 million per year for 15 years.", "While the Administration proposes increased funding for most DOJ offices and agencies, the budget request would reduce funding for the FBI (-$152 million, -1.5%) and BOP (-$67 million, -0.9%), though these reductions are the result of proposals for reduced funding for construction-related accounts. The Administration proposes reducing funding for two grant-related DOJ accounts, State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance (-$381 million, -20.1%) and Juvenile Justice Programs (-$93 million, -28.9%). The Administration also proposes to eliminate the COPS program as a separate account in DOJ and requests funding for COPS-related programs under the State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance account. The Administration proposes eliminating the Community Relations Service and moving its functions to DOJ's Civil Rights Division.", "The Administration's FY2021 budget request would add two new accounts to DOJ. First, the Administration proposes moving funding for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program to the DEA. Currently, HIDTA funding is administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In addition, the Administration proposes adding a Construction account for ATF. The Administration requested this funding so the ATF can consolidate its laboratory facilities in Walnut Creek, CA and Atlanta, GA.", "The annual CJS appropriations act traditionally includes an obligation cap of funds expended from the Crime Victims Fund (CVF). The Administration's FY2021 budget does not include a proposed obligation cap for the CVF. Rather, the Administration proposes a new $2.300 billion annual mandatory appropriation for crime victims programs. Within this amount, $499 million would be for the OVW, $10 million would be for oversight of Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) programs by the Office of the Inspector General, $12 million would be for developing innovative crime victims services initiatives, and a set-aside of up to $115 million would be for tribal victims assistance grants. From the remaining amount, OVC would provide formula and nonformula grants to the states to support crime victim compensation and victims services programs. Under the Administration's proposal, the amount of the mandatory appropriation would decrease if the balance on the CVF falls below $5.000 billion in future fiscal years. ", "Also, the Administration's budget includes a proposal to transfer primary jurisdiction over federal tobacco and alcohol anti-smuggling laws from the ATF to the Department of the Treasury's Tax and Trade Bureau.", "The Administration's budget request includes increased funding for NASA, but the Administration does propose reduced funding for the Science account (-$832 million, -11.7%) and eliminating the Office of STEM Engagement (formerly the Office of Education). The Administration also proposes renaming three of NASA's accounts: the Space Technology account would be changed to the Exploration Technology account, the Exploration account would be changed to the Deep Space Exploration Systems account, and the Space Operations account would be changed to the Low Earth Orbit and Spaceflight Operations account. Like the Administration's FY2020 budget, the FY2021 budget proposal does not appear to include a realignment of items that would be funded from these accounts, which is what the Administration proposed in its FY2019 budget request. ", "The FY2021 budget request includes reduced funding for NSF (-$537 million, -6.5%), which includes proposed reductions for the Research and Related Activities (-$524 million, -7.8%), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (-$13 million, -5.5%), and Education and Human Resources (-$9 million, -1.0%) accounts. The proposed reductions are partially offset by proposed increases for the Agency Operations and Award Management (+$9 million, +2.6%) and Office of the Inspector General (+$1 million, +8.2%) accounts.", "The Administration requests reduced funding for most of the related agencies, which includes a proposal to close the LSC, though it requests some funding to help provide for an orderly closeout of the LSC's operations.", " Table 1 outlines the FY2020 funding and the Administration's FY2021 request for the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the science agencies, and the related agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Funding for CJS", "paragraphs": [" Figure 1 shows the total CJS funding for FY2010-FY2020, in both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars (more-detailed historical appropriations data can be found in Table 2 ). The data show that in FY2020 nominal funding for CJS reached its highest level since FY2010, though in inflation-adjusted terms, funding for FY2020 was lower than it was in FY2010.", "There is a cyclical nature to total nominal funding for CJS because of appropriations for the Census Bureau to administer decennial censuses. Overall funding for CJS traditionally starts to increase a few years before the decennial census, peaks in the fiscal year in which the census is conducted, and then declines immediately thereafter. Figure 1 shows how total funding for CJS decreased after the 2010 Census and started to ramp up again as the Census Bureau prepared to conduct the 2020 Census.", "Increased funding for CJS also coincides with increases to the discretionary budget caps under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ). The BCA put into effect statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2012-FY2021. Under the act, discretionary spending limits were scheduled to be adjusted downward each fiscal year until FY2021. However, legislation was enacted that increased discretionary spending caps for FY2014 to FY2021. A sequestration of discretionary funding, ordered pursuant to the BCA, cut $2.973 billion out of the total amount Congress and the President provided for CJS for FY2013. Since then, funding for CJS has increased as more discretionary funding has been allowed under the BCA. ", " Figure 2 shows total CJS funding for FY2010-FY2020 by major component (i.e., the Department of Commerce, DOJ, NASA, and the NSF). Although decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce (-47.4%) from FY2010 to FY2013, during years immediately following the 2010 Census, mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations during this time, cuts in funding for DOJ (-8.7%) and NASA (-9.8%) also contributed. Funding for NSF held relatively steady from FY2010 to FY2013.", "Overall CJS funding has increased since FY2014, and this is partially explained by more funding for the Department of Commerce to help the Census Bureau prepare for the 2020 Census. While funding for the Department of Commerce decreased from FY2018 to FY2019, it was partly a function of the department receiving $1.000 billion in emergency supplemental funding for FY2018. If supplemental funding is excluded, appropriations for the Department of Commerce increased 2.5% from FY2018 to FY2019. ", "While increased funding for the Department of Commerce partially explains the overall increase in funding for CJS since FY2014, there have also been steady increases in funding for DOJ (+17.6%), NASA (+28.2%), and NSF (+12.6%), as higher discretionary spending caps have been used to provide additional funding to these agencies.
