DOD opposes any change in this prohibition,arguing that the two programs - military retirement and VA disability payments -were intended for different groups, veterans who are eligible for retirement andveterans who are eligible for disability payments but not for retirement. To ensurethat military retirees with service-connected disabilities do not receive less thandisabled veterans who are not eligible for retirement, the current law permits disabledveterans to choose the larger of the two payments, as long as the veteran waives theequivalent amount of retirement compensation.", "Although both the House and the Senate version of the authorization act eliminated this offset and permitted veterans to receive full benefits under bothprograms, the houses differed in their approach to funding the program. The Senate adopted an amendment, which would have provided that concurrent receipt wouldbe considered an entitlement program that would go into effect on October 1, 2002. That change would have triggered an additional $3 billion in mandatory spending in2002 and $40 billion in spending over the next ten years as well as requiring thatDOD provide an additional $1 billion annually. Under the House version, thisauthorization of \"concurrent receipt\" of the two benefits would have becomeeffective only if the President submitted a budget proposal to offset the mandatoryspending costs of the change in law, and if Congress approved legislation to providesuch an offset.

Until recently, the sixprivate-sector shipyards that build the Navy's major ships were owned by threeorganizations - General Dynamics Corporation (GD), which owned three of theyards, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), which owned two of them, andNewport News Shipbuilding (NNS), which was an independent, publicly tradedshipbuilding company. In the Spring of 2001, both GD and NOC made offers to buyNNS. Implementing either merger proposal would consolidate ownership of the sixyards under two organizations and very likely end a process of consolidation in theownership of these yards that began in 1995. The Department of Defense and theDepartment of Justice reviewed both merger proposals for several months. OnOctober 23, 2001, the two departments announced that they would oppose GD's offeron the grounds that it would reduce competition and innovation in navalshipbuilding, but would not oppose NOC's Northrop's offer. NOC completed itsacquisition of NNS on November 30, 2001. The two competing merger proposalsraised issues for Congress regarding the potential savings they would generate andtheir potential impact on competition in Navy ship acquisition, on the shipyards'employment levels, and on the shipyards' strength in the political process. (See CRS Report RL30969.)", "Navy Live-Fire Testing at Vieques. (This section was prepared by [author name scrubbed].) On June14, 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it had decided to end militarytraining operations at the U.S. naval training range on the small Puerto Rican islandof Vieques by May 2003. The Bush Administration's new plan superceded a January2000 agreement between President Clinton and the previous Governor of PuertoRico, Pedro Rossello, that called for holding a referendum on Vieques (firstscheduled for November 2001, then rescheduled for January 2002) in which voterscould choose to either end the military's use of the range by May 2003 or allow it tocontinue indefinitely beyond that point. To implement the Clinton-Rossello plan,Congress in 2000 approved $40 million in assistance funding for Vieques and otherlegislation as part of P.L. 106-246 ( H.R. 4425 ) and P.L. 106-398 ( H.R. 4205 ). The Bush Administration had previously supported theClinton-Rossello plan as implemented by Congress, but the new Governor of PuertoRico, Sila Maria Calderon, who took office in January 2001, did not and has insteadworked toward an immediate end to the military training operations on the island.", "Congressional Action . The conference report on the defense authorization bill contains a provision (Section 1049) that (1) cancels the requirement for holding theJanuary 2002 referendum; (2) authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to close theVieques range if the Secretary certifies that equivalent or superior training facilitiesexist and are immediately available; (3) requires the Secretary, in making thisdetermination, to take into account the views of Navy and Marine Corps leaders; and(4) transfers the lands to the Department of the Interior if the range is closed.

(This section was prepared by Marcia Smith.) Today,approximately $14.5 billion per year is spent on national security space activities (foran overview, see CRS Issue Brief IB92011, U.S. Space Programs: Civil, Military,and Commercial , by Marcia Smith). Concern about how DOD and the intelligencecommunity manage and execute space programs led to creation by Congress of acommission, chaired by now Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, to assessnational security space program management. In May 2001, Secretary Rumsfeldannounced a number of management changes in the Air Force and DOD toimplement many of the Commission's recommendations. Recommendations madeby two other congressionally created commissions--one on the National Imageryand Mapping Agency (NIMA); the other on the National Reconnaissance Office(NRO)--may also impact the national security space program.", "Among the national security space programs that received attention during the FY2002 budget cycle were space control (the means to deter and defend againsthostile acts directed at U.S. space assets, and against the uses of space hostile to U.S.interests); space-based weapons (lasers or kinetic energy weapons) for missiledefense; and a new early warning satellite system consisting of two sets of satellites,SBIRS-High and SBIRS-Low. Both SBIRS programs have been the subject ofmanagement and technological readiness concerns. SBIRS-Low was transferredfrom the Air Force to BMDO, while SBIRS-High remains an Air Force program.", "Congressional Action . Although the House and Senate sought to codify some of the recommendations of the Space Commission, the final version of the FY2002DOD authorization bill requires only reports to Congress on DOD's actions toimplement the Commission's recommendations. Congress approved the full requestof $33 million for space control in the final versions of the appropriations andauthorization bills. For space-based weapons, the authorizers fully funded the $165million requested for space-based laser (SBL) development and the $20 millionrequested for kinetic energy weapons, but the appropriators cut the SBL request by$120 million, and cut kinetic energy weapons by $10 million. Although SBIRS-Highand SBIRS-Low were both almost fully funded in the authorization bill, theappropriations bill cut all $94 million requested for procurement for SBIRS-High butincreased the $405 million in RDT&E funding for that program by $40 million. ForSBIRS-Low, the appropriations bill cut the entire $385 million requested but createda new line item funded at $250 million which the Secretary of Defense may chooseto spend on SBIRS-Low or development of other sensor technologies. ", "Intelligence. (This section was prepared by Richard Best.) Most of the funding for the nation's intelligence effort isprovided in national defense authorization and appropriations bills. The budget ofthe Central Intelligence Agency, which is separate from the Defense Department, is,from a practical standpoint, overseen by the two intelligence committees, but isincluded in various parts of the defense budget to preclude public disclosure. ", "The work of intelligence agencies that are part of the Defense Department, including the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, theNational Reconnaissance Office, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, isoverseen by armed services and defense appropriations committees as well as by thetwo select intelligence committees. Budgetary allocations for specific intelligenceprograms are usually classified and discussed only in separate annexes to committeereports that are not available to the public, though issues sometimes may becomematters of open debate in Congress.

Changes to specific programs made by the authorizing committees are covered in a separate, classified annex to their reports.", "Radiofrequency Spectrum for DOD. (This section was prepared by Lennard Kruger and Linda K.Moore.) The Department of Defense uses various portions of the radiofrequencyspectrum to support its operations and activities. Many in the wirelesscommunications industry would like to use part of this spectrum for deployment ofa next generation wireless service known as \"3G\". That portion of the spectrum -the 1755-1850 MHz - is currently used by DOD for such applications as satellitesystems, precision guided munitions, tactical radio relay communication systems, aircombat training systems, targeting, intelligence, and other communications systems.", "Citing a shortage of available spectrum for 3G, the Clinton Administration directed the two agencies charged with management of the spectrum - the FederalCommunications Commission for commercial users and the NationalTelecommunications and Information Administration for federal government users- to identify suitable 3G spectrum for commercial services by July 2001, and toauction licenses to competing applicants by September 30, 2002. On June 26, 2001,however, FCC Chairman Michael Powell recommended to Secretary of CommerceDonald Evans the extension of this deadline so that other ways to make additionalspectrum available for advanced wireless services could be considered.", "One option is to relocate DOD to other frequency bands and auction the 1755 - 1850 MHz band for commercial use. To meet requirements in the FY1999 andFY2000 DOD's authorization acts, DOD must be reimbursed for relocation costs andprovided with spectrum that has comparable technical capabilities so there is no lossof mission capability in case of any transfer to the civilian sector. (See CRS Report RL30829, Radiofrequency Spectrum Management: Background, Status, and CurrentIssues, and CRS Report RS20993 , Wireless Technology and Spectrum Demand:Third Generation (3G) and Beyond ).", "DOD now contends that full migration to another frequency band could take many years because satellites currently in orbit cannot be reprogrammed to operateon another frequency. For that reason, they argue that relocation could not occuruntil 2010 for non-space systems, and 2017 for satellite control systems, assumingthat DOD also received alternative, comparable spectrum width and compensation.Thus far, no comparable bandwidth for DOD has been proposed. In a new report,GAO concluded that more analysis is needed before making decisions about the1755-1850 MHz band (GAO-01-795, August 2001).", "Congressional Action.
