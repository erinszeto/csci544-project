Broadly construed, it encompasses a range of issues, including the highly controversial question of legalizing large numbers of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. A historically less controversial, more targeted legalization proposal has been included in \"DREAM Act\" legislation, which seeks to enable certain unauthorized aliens who entered the United States as children to obtain legal immigration status. The name DREAM Act derives from the bill title, Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, but it refers more broadly to a class of measures to provide immigration relief to unauthorized students, whether or not particular bills carry that name.", "Unauthorized aliens in the United States are able to receive free public education through high school. They may experience difficulty obtaining higher education, however, for several reasons. Among these reasons is a provision enacted in 1996 that places restrictions on state provision of certain postsecondary educational benefits on the basis of state residence to aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States, unless equal benefits are made available to all U.S. citizens. This language is commonly understood to apply to the granting of \"in-state\" residency status for tuition purposes. In addition, unauthorized alien students are not eligible for federal student financial aid. More broadly, as unauthorized aliens, they typically are not legally allowed to work and are subject to being removed from the country.", "Multiple DREAM Act bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to address the unauthorized student population. Most have proposed a two-prong approach of repealing the 1996 provision and enabling some unauthorized alien students to become U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) through an immigration procedure known as cancellation of removal. While there are other options for dealing with this population, this report deals exclusively with the DREAM Act approach in light of the considerable congressional interest in it.", "In the 111th Congress, the House approved DREAM Act language as part of an unrelated bill, the Removal Clarification Act of 2010 (H.R. 5281). The Senate, however, failed to invoke cloture on a motion to agree to the House-passed DREAM Act amendment, and the bill died at the end of the Congress. The House-approved language differed in key respects from earlier versions of the DREAM Act. Bills to legalize the status of unauthorized alien students were again introduced in the 112th Congress.", "In 2012, in the absence of congressional action on DREAM Act legislation, the Obama Administration announced that certain individuals who entered the United States as children and meet other criteria would be considered for relief from removal. Under a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memorandum, these individuals can apply for consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals (or DACA, as the program is known) and for employment authorization.", "DREAM Act language was considered in the 113th Congress as part of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The Senate-passed Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744) included DREAM Act provisions. The same DREAM Act language was included in a related bill with the same name introduced in the House (H.R. 15).

Among them, a provision enacted in 1996 as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) discourages states and localities from granting unauthorized aliens certain \"postsecondary education benefits.\" More broadly, as unauthorized aliens, they typically are unable to work legally and are subject to removal from the United States.", "Multiple bills have been introduced in recent Congresses to provide relief to unauthorized aliens who were brought into the United States as children. Prior to the 111 th Congress, DREAM Act bills generally proposed to repeal the 1996 provision and to enable certain unauthorized alien students to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status. In the 111 th Congress, the House approved a different type of DREAM Act measure as an amendment to an unrelated bill ( H.R. 5281 ). Unlike earlier DREAM Act bills, the DREAM Act language added to H.R. 5281 did not include a repeal of the 1996 provision and proposed to grant eligible individuals an interim legal status prior to enabling them to adjust to LPR status. H.R. 5281 died at the end of the 111 th Congress. ", "Bills to legalize the status of unauthorized alien students were again introduced in the 112 th Congress. Some of these bills were similar to the measure approved by the House in the 111 th Congress, while others included more traditional DREAM Act elements. In the 113 th Congress, DREAM Act provisions were incorporated into larger comprehensive immigration reform bills, including the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act ( S. 744 ), and were integrated with other legalization provisions in these bills. The Senate passed S. 744 , but it was not considered in the House and died at the end of the 113 th Congress.

State laws vary and may prohibit enrollment in public postsecondary institutions. To gain entrance to available institutions, unauthorized aliens must meet the same requirements as any other student, which vary depending on the institution and may include possessing a high school diploma, passing entrance exams, and surpassing a high school grade point average (GPA) threshold. Although admissions applications for most colleges and universities request that students provide their Social Security numbers, this information typically is not required for admission.", "Even if they are able to gain admission, however, unauthorized alien students often find it difficult, if not impossible, to pay for higher education. Under the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended, they are ineligible for federal financial aid. In most instances, unauthorized alien students are likewise ineligible for state financial aid.

The conference report on the bill containing IIRIRA did not explain Section 505.

A key issue has been whether it is possible to grant in-state tuition to resident unauthorized students (and not to all citizens) without violating Section 505. Various states have attempted to do this. For example, a California law passed in 2001 makes unauthorized aliens eligible for in-state tuition at state community colleges and California State University campuses. The measure, however, bases eligibility on criteria that do not explicitly include state residency. The requirements to qualify for in-state tuition under the California law include attendance at a California high school for at least three years and either graduation from a California high school \"or attainment of the equivalent thereof.\" In addition, the law requires an unauthorized alien student to file an affidavit stating that he or she either has filed an application to legalize his or her status or will file such an application as soon as he or she is eligible. California officials have argued that by using eligibility criteria other than state residency, the law does not violate the Section 505 prohibition on conferring educational benefits on the basis of state residency. In November 2010, the California Supreme Court upheld the California law. At least one federal court also has considered whether state laws that authorize in-state tuition for unauthorized students violate Section 505.

The eligibility criteria for deferred action for childhood arrivals, or DACA, as the initiative is known, are similar to those for relief in DREAM Act bills.

The program is administered by DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

An RPI applicant could have been subject to additional security screening at the discretion of the DHS Secretary.

And they emphasize that large numbers will be unable to do so unless they are eligible for in-state tuition rates at colleges in their states of residence.", "Advocates for unauthorized alien students argue that many of them were brought into the United States at a very young age and should not be held responsible for the decision to enter the country illegally. According to these advocates, many of the students have spent most of their lives in the United States and have few, if any, ties to their countries of origin. They argue that these special circumstances demand that the students be granted humanitarian relief in the form of LPR status. They further maintain that enacting the DREAM Act would have economic benefits for the United States by adding hundreds of billions of dollars to the economy and promoting new job creation. ", "Those who oppose making unauthorized alien students eligible for in-state tuition or legal status emphasize that the students and their families are in the United States illegally and should be removed from the country. They object to using U.S. taxpayer money to subsidize the education of individuals (through the granting of in-state tuition rates) who are in the United States in violation of the law. They maintain that funding the education of these students should be the responsibility of their parents or their home countries. They also argue that it is unfair to charge unauthorized alien students in-state tuition while charging some U.S. citizens higher out-of-state rates. ", "More broadly, these opponents argue that granting benefits to unauthorized alien students rewards lawbreakers and thereby undermines the U.S. immigration system and the rule of law. Taking issue with the economic benefit argument made by DREAM Act supporters, critics maintain that the legislation would cost money and would take jobs and college spots away from legal residents and give them to people who entered the United States illegally. In their view, the availability of benefits, especially LPR status, would encourage more unlawful immigration into the country."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
