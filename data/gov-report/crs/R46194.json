About 6% of workers in paid employment or self-employment in 2019 were not covered by Social Security. A quarter of state and local government employees and most permanent civilian federal employees hired before January 1, 1984, were not covered, and these groups constituted the majority of noncovered workers.", "For workers whose entire careers are covered by Social Security, the Social Security benefit formula is weighted to replace a greater share of career-average earnings (referred to as the replacement rate ) for low-paid workers than for high-paid workers. However, providing an appropriate replacement rate for beneficiaries whose careers are split between covered and noncovered employment (referred to hereinafter as split-career beneficiaries ) is challenging because years of noncovered earnings are marked as zeros in Social Security earnings records, so split-career beneficiaries appear to have low career-average earnings. Therefore, if there were no adjustment for noncovered earnings, split-career beneficiaries would receive a higher replacement rate than beneficiaries with the same earnings who spent their entire careers in covered employment. The windfall elimination provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula that reduces certain retired or disabled workers' Social Security benefits if they also have earnings not covered by Social Security and are entitled to pension benefits based on those noncovered earnings. The WEP aims to provide split-career beneficiaries with approximately the same replacement rate as similar workers whose entire careers were covered by Social Security.", "Some have argued, however, that the current-law WEP formula generally fails to accurately adjust affected workers' benefits. They say it overadjusts some affected workers' benefits (i.e., it reduces them by too much), giving them a lower replacement rate than similar workers whose entire careers were covered by Social Security. In contrast, they argue it underadjusts some other affected workers' benefits, giving them a higher replacement rate than similar workers whose entire careers were covered. Estimates in 2018 showed the current-law WEP overadjusted 69% of affected beneficiaries' benefits and underadjusted for the remaining 31%.", "Legislative proposals have been introduced to substitute the WEP with a proportional formula that would calculate Social Security benefits based on earnings from both covered and noncovered employment. The proportional formula's supporters have argued it is a more accurate method to treat noncovered employment, because it would provide the same replacement rate for split-career beneficiaries and beneficiaries whose entire careers are covered by Social Security.", "Compared with current law, a proportional formula would increase Social Security benefits for beneficiaries whose current-law WEP benefits are overadjusted and decrease benefits for those whose benefits are underadjusted. It would also decrease benefits for many beneficiaries with earnings from noncovered employment who are exempt from the current WEP reduction because they (1) have 30 or more years of substantial covered earnings, or (2) do not receive a pension based on noncovered earnings.", "Proposals to establish a proportional formula have been discussed since the 1980s. However, applying the proportional formula requires a complete record of earnings from covered and noncovered employment, which were not readily available at that time. To obtain the complete earnings record, the Social Security Administration (SSA) would have needed a massive new operation system requiring extensive data reporting, maintenance, and correction processes, which could not have been accomplished quickly with limited costs. Therefore, the current-law WEP was enacted in 1983 as an approximate approach to adjust Social Security benefits for certain beneficiaries who had earnings in jobs not covered by Social Security. Today, SSA has 35 years of data on earnings from both covered and noncovered employment, implying that the proportional formula is now an option for Congress to consider. In 2019 (the 116 th Congress), H.R. 3934 and H.R. 4540 would replace the current-law WEP approach with a proportional formula for certain individuals who would become eligible for Social Security benefits in 2022 or later."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Social Security provides insured workers and their eligible family members with a measure of protection against the loss of income due to the worker's retirement, disability, or death.

The result is the primary insurance amount (PIA), which is the worker's basic benefit before any adjustments are made for factors such as cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), early retirement, delayed retirement, or noncovered earnings. For workers who become eligible for benefits in 2020, the PIA is based on the formula in Table 1 . The dollar amounts in the table, known as bend points , are adjusted annually for average earnings growth. ", "Under current law, the WEP reduction is based on years of coverage (YOCs)\u00e2\u0080\u0094the larger the number of YOCs, the lower the WEP reduction. For people with 20 or fewer YOCs who become eligible for benefits in 2020, the WEP reduces the first replacement factor from 90% to 40% (referred to as the WEP replacement factor in this report), resulting in a maximum benefit reduction of $480 (90% of $960 minus 40% of $960). A worker with an AIME of $1,500 who becomes eligible for Social Security benefits in 2020 would receive an unadjusted monthly benefit of $1,036.80 if all earnings are covered by Social Security, compared to a WEP-reduced monthly benefit of $556.80 if he or she has 20 or fewer YOCs (see Table 1 ). For each YOC in excess of 20, the WEP replacement factor increases by 5%. For example, the WEP factor is 45% for those with 21 YOCs and 50% for those with 22 YOCs. The WEP factor reaches 90% for those with 30 or more YOCs, and at that point it is phased out (see Figure 1 ).", "The amount of substantial covered earnings needed for a YOC is $25,575 in 2020; the amount is adjusted annually by average wage growth. Workers with annual covered earnings below the level of substantial earnings do not receive a YOC. For example, a worker who earns $5,640 in 2020 (covered earnings) will receive four earnings credits for the purpose of Social Security eligibility, but will not qualify for a YOC for the WEP purpose. In December 2018, of the nearly 1.9 million beneficiaries affected by the WEP, nearly 1.6 million (84%) had 20 YOCs or fewer, and the remaining 0.3 million (16%) had 21-29 YOCs (see Figure 1 ).

", "If a person has earnings not covered by Social Security, those noncovered earnings are shown as zeros in their Social Security earnings records, thus resulting in relatively lower career-average earnings. The regular formula cannot distinguish between workers who have low career-average earnings because they worked for many years at low earnings in covered employment and workers who appear to have low career-average earnings because they worked for many years in jobs not covered by Social Security. Therefore, without a PIA reduction for noncovered earnings, a worker who split his or her career between covered and noncovered employment might receive a higher replacement rate than a worker with the same level of earnings who spent an entire career in covered employment. For example, a low-scaled worker is estimated to have annual career-average earnings of $22,588. If all career earnings were covered, the worker would receive a 60.5% replacement rate in Social Security benefits. However, if the second half of the low-scaled worker's career was in noncovered employment, the worker would receive a replacement rate of 90.0% based on the regular benefit formula before adjusting for noncovered earnings (see Table 2 ). The WEP PIA addresses this problem by reducing the replacement rate for certain workers who have noncovered earnings. For example, the replacement rate would be adjusted from 90.0% to 40.0% for a low-scaled worker if the second half of his career was not covered by Social Security. ", "The WEP's original intent was to ensure that Social Security beneficiaries with some earnings from noncovered employment received the same replacement rate as workers who spent their entire careers in covered employment.

For example, a very low-scaled worker who spent the second half of his or her career in noncovered employment would receive a replacement rate of 40.0% using the WEP formula, which is substantially lower than the replacement rate a very low-scaled worker whose entire career was covered by Social Security (83.3%) would receive. The magnitude of such benefit overadjustment is smaller for affected beneficiaries with relatively higher lifetime earnings. For example, if the second half of a high-scaled worker's career was not covered by Social Security, the worker would receive a WEP benefit replacing 34.4% of covered AIME, which is slightly lower than the replacement rate for high-scaled workers whose entire careers are covered by Social Security (37.2%).

Such underadjustment usually applies to workers with significantly high lifetime earnings and some earnings not covered by Social Security. For example, a taxable-maximum worker who earned the taxable-maximum amount each year of work history is estimated to have career-average earnings of $123,232. If the second half of the taxable-maximum worker's career was not covered by Social Security, the worker would receive a 33.2% replacement rate in Social Security benefits under the WEP, compared to 29.4% if the entire career had been covered by Social Security (see Table 2 ).

Beneficiaries with 30 or more YOCs are exempted from the current WEP, but under the proportional formula, workers with 30 or more YOCs and very few years of noncovered employment (even less than a year) would probably receive proportional reductions in their Social Security benefits. For example, a medium scaled-worker who earned 30 YOCs in his earlier career would not be affected by the current WEP even if he took a noncovered position afterward and was entitled to a noncovered pension (see case [1] in Table 4 ). In this case, the worker would receive an unreduced Social Security benefit of $1,707.30, which would be higher than the proportional PIA ($1,612.00) based on earnings from noncovered employment. SSA's OCACT estimates that, in 2018, roughly 9.4 million Social Security retired-worker and disabled-worker beneficiaries with some noncovered earnings were exempt from the current WEP because they had 30 or more YOCs. Because those beneficiaries have relatively few years of noncovered earnings, their benefit reductions under the proportional formula would be relatively small.", "The other exemption applies to beneficiaries with noncovered earnings who do not receive a pension based on those noncovered earnings. Those beneficiaries could receive a lower benefit under the proportional formula because their earnings from noncovered employment could reduce the proportion of overall career-average earnings from covered jobs. For example, under current law, a medium-scaled worker who worked in a noncovered position from age 55 to age 61 but received no noncovered pension benefits would be exempt from the WEP and receive a Social Security benefit equal to $1,551.10 (see case [2] in Table 4 ). This amount would be higher than the benefit computed by the proportional formula ($1,432.80) because those seven years of noncovered employment would proportionally reduce the Social Security benefit. Estimates from OCACT find that about 8.6 million Social Security retired-worker and disabled-worker beneficiaries with some noncovered earnings and less than 30 YOCs were exempt from the current WEP in 2018 because they had no pension based on those noncovered earnings. ", "In addition, the guarantee provision under current law limits benefit reductions by ensuring that the WEP reduction cannot exceed one-half of the noncovered pension benefit. This provision typically leads to small benefit reductions for beneficiaries who receive small pension benefits based on relatively short careers in noncovered employment. The proportional formula would not limit reductions in this way, so those workers' benefits would be lower under the proportional formula than under the WEP. For example, a low-scaled worker who worked in a noncovered position from age 52 to age 61 and received a monthly benefit from a noncovered pension equal to $100 would receive a WEP reduction of no more than $50 under current law (see case [3] in Table 4 ).

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Years of Coverage", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the exemptions and the guarantee provision, whether a worker with noncovered earnings would receive a lower Social Security benefit under the proportional formula relative to current law also depends on YOCs based on substantial earnings. The number of YOCs determines the WEP replacement factor under current law (see Figure 1 ). In general, the larger the number of YOCs, the higher the WEP replacement factor. Workers who have employment not covered by Social Security also need to earn the substantial covered amount ($25,575 in 2020) to receive one YOC, which is much higher than the earnings required for Social Security eligibility ($5,640 in 2020). Because of the WEP's higher YOC earnings threshold, workers with relatively lower covered earnings who are affected by the WEP may be entitled to Social Security benefits based on earnings credits but not qualify for a YOC for WEP purposes. ", "Although YOCs are a critical factor for determining the PIA under the current-law WEP, they are not relevant for the proportional formula. To compare monthly benefits based on the two formulas by YOCs, Figure 4 shows a medium-scaled worker's monthly benefit amounts under the current WEP PIA and the proportional PIA. If the medium-scaled worker took a job covered by Social Security in the earlier part of her career and the number of YOCs was relatively small (less than 27 for a medium-scaled worker), the proportional formula would provide a higher benefit than the current WEP. However, if the number of YOCs were relatively large (more than 27 for a medium-scaled worker), the proportional formula would provide a lower benefit than the current\u00e2\u0080\u0093law WEP. ", "Two reasons may explain why the proportional formula would provide a lower benefit than the current-law WEP at the higher level of YOCs. First, current law exempts beneficiaries from the WEP if they have 30 or more YOCs, resulting in a higher benefit amount than under the proportional formula. Second, when YOCs are close to 30, the current-law WEP replacement factor is relatively large, such as 85% for 29 YOCs (see Figure 1 ), so the current-law WEP PIA underadjusts and produces a higher benefit than the proportional formula. ", "The monthly benefit difference between the proportional formula and the current-law WEP formula also depends on earning levels. For example, the very low- and low-scaled workers in Figure 5 had fewer than 20 YOCs because their annual earnings were typically less than the substantial earnings required for a YOC. They would receive a current-law WEP PIA based on the lowest WEP replacement factor (40%). Therefore, the proportional PIA for these workers would generally be higher than the WEP PIA, because the 40% WEP replacement factor overreduces their Social Security benefits for noncovered earnings. The proportional PIA would also be higher than the WEP PIA for medium- and high-scaled workers with relatively fewer YOCs, such as Figure 5 's medium-scaled workers with fewer than 29 years of covered earnings and high-scaled workers with YOCs between 11 and 22. However, as YOCs increase, the WEP replacement factor goes up, so the WEP PIA is higher than the proportional PIA for medium- and high-scaled workers with more YOCs.

However, for state or local retirees and certain retirees with foreign pensions, SSA relies primarily on beneficiaries to self-report noncovered pension amounts. Based on the information matched and provided, SSA determines whether and to what extent to apply the WEP. Unreported state and local government pensions lead to improper payments. According to SSA, WEP has been a leading cause of computational errors related to overpayments. For FY2013 through FY2017, WEP accounted for 63% of reported computation overpayment errors, and average overpayments related to WEP totaled approximately $520 million annually.", "In contrast, the proportional formula is applied based on covered and noncovered earnings records, which are reported to SSA on Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2.

In a somewhat different approach, H.R. 3934 and H.R. 4540 in the 116 th Congress would apply the proportional formula to beneficiaries becoming eligible after a certain date, such as December 31, 2021; provide a rebate to beneficiaries affected by the current-law WEP; and mandate a no-benefit-cut provision for some or all future beneficiaries. The above two bills introduced in the 116 th Congress also include provisions to require SSA to show noncovered as well as covered earnings records on Social Security statements and to require studies on ways to facilitate data exchanges between SSA and state and local governments to improve current-law WEP administration."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
