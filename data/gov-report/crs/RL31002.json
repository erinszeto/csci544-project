According to the Administration, this increase would have brought theagency's overall FY2002 full time equivalent level up to 4,982, would have met the agency'sFY2002 baseline funding requirements, and would have allowed ATF to maintain it's FY2001anticipated level of services and activities in FY2002.

Toexpand the YCGII to 12 additional cities in FY2001, Congress provided ATF with $19,078,000 tohire 72 agents and 98 inspectors. This increase brings total funding for this program to $76,400,000and will be used to expand its presence to 50 cities. The objective of the YCGII is to reduce youthfirearm violence and firearms trafficking among youth by making federal resources, such as ATF'sfirearms tracing and ballistics technology, available to state and local law enforcement agencies, andby providing coordination of these efforts. As described above, the House-passed measure wouldhave brought total funding for YCGII to $85,000,000 in FY2002. The Senate-reported measurewould have increased total funding for this program by $5,000,000.

In addition, the House adopted a Customs-relatedamendment offered by Representative Bernard Sander that would prohibit the use of any fundingprovided by the FY2002 Treasury-Postal appropriations act from being used to remove detentionorders placed on imports by the Customs Service, because the agency determined that these importedproducts were mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor.

The first fee program consists of seven conveyance- and passenger-related user feesestablished by the 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) and the userfee for processing bulk cargo from Mexico and Canada established by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The second fee program consists of the commerce-related merchandise processing fee (MPF)established by the 1986 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA). Customs generally has nocontrol over the allocation of MPF fee receipts. COBRA fee receipts, on the other hand, are notappropriated for obligation by Congress, and they account for a substantial portion of fundingavailable to Customs for expenditure each year. From FY1992 to FY1999, COBRA fee receiptshave ranged from about $176,000,000 to $274,000,000.", "There are codified limitations on the use of COBRA fee receipts, and initially they were used principally to pay overtime costs for inspectors and canine enforcement officers. Surplus revenuescould be and were carried over from one year to the next. Such carryover has been used to fundrecurring costs in positions and equipment from previous years. As a result, COBRA fee receiptshave funded an increasing share of permanent inspector positions and information technology costs. In FY2000, however, there were reports of a drop-off in air passenger processing fee receipts. Consequently, the growing reliance on COBRA fee receipts to fund base positions in conjunctionwith a drop-off in receipts may prove problematic in FY2001, as Customs may not have allocatedenough to pay overtime for Customs officers. To address the decline in COBRA fee receipts, theHouse-passed measure would provide $15,000,000 for additional positions. The conferenceagreement was silent on this issue.

Of the total amount appropriated, $3.798 billion is for tax processing,assistance, and management; $3.538 billion for tax law enforcement; $1.563 billion for informationsystems; and $146 million for the earned income tax compliance initiative. In addition, the IRS isreceiving $391.6 million for its Information Technology Investment Account (ITIA) throughSeptember 30, 2004.

These additional resourceswould be channeled into improving customer service, modernizing information systems, andbolstering taxpayer audits and other compliance efforts. A key player in the IRS appropriationsprocess is the IRS Oversight Board. The Board is required by law to review the IRS budget andmake its own recommendations directly to Congress.
