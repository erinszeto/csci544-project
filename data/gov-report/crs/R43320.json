For its part, the House took a different approach to immigration reform. Rather than considering a single comprehensive bill, the House acted on a set of immigration bills that address border security, interior enforcement, employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement, and nonimmigrant and immigrant visas. House committees reported or ordered to be reported the following immigration bills: Border Security Results Act of 2013 (H.R. 1417); Strengthen and Fortify Enforcement (SAFE) Act (H.R. 2278); Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 1772); Agricultural Guestworker (AG) Act (H.R. 1773); and Supplying Knowledge-based Immigrants and Lifting Levels of STEM Visas (SKILLS Visa) Act (H.R. 2131).", "Beyond their work on immigration reform legislation, the House and Senate acted on other immigration-related bills. Among these measures, the 113th Congress passed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-4), which includes provisions on noncitizen victims of domestic abuse or certain other crimes and on victims of human trafficking. Other immigration issues addressed in enacted measures include Iraqi and Afghan special immigrants (P.L. 113-42, P.L. 113-66, P.L. 113-76, P.L. 113-160), refugees (P.L. 113-6, P.L. 113-76), temporary nonagricultural workers (P.L. 113-76, P.L. 113-164), international adoption (P.L. 113-74), and alien inadmissibility (P.L. 113-100).", "Several bills passed one house of Congress, but not the other.

Taking a different approach to immigration reform, the House acted on a set of immigration bills that separately address many of the same areas of immigration policy. House Committees reported or ordered to be reported immigration bills on border security ( H.R. 1417 ); interior enforcement ( H.R. 2278 ); employment eligibility verification and worksite enforcement ( H.R. 1772 ); and immigrant and nonimmigrant visas ( H.R. 2131 , H.R. 1773 ).

Among these, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-4 ) includes provisions on noncitizen victims of domestic abuse or certain other crimes and on victims of human trafficking. The trafficking provisions address the care and custody of unaccompanied alien children (UAC), among other issues. Additionally, in response to the recent surge in arrivals of unaccompanied minors from Central America, the House-passed supplemental appropriations bill for 2014 ( H.R. 5230 ) contains UAC-related provisions, including language that would change the procedures for screening and processing unaccompanied alien children who arrive at the U.S. border from certain countries. Many other UAC-related bills were introduced in the 113 th Congress but have not seen legislative action.", "In addition to P.L. 113-4 , the 113 th Congress enacted multiple immigration-related bills. Enacted appropriations measures ( P.L. 113-6 , P.L. 113-76 , and P.L. 113-164 ) variously include policy provisions on temporary nonagricultural workers, refugees, and special immigrants, among other immigration-related issues. P.L. 113-42 , P.L. 113-66 , and P.L. 113-160 also contain provisions on special immigrants. P.L. 113-74 concerns international adoption. P.L. 113-100 concerns inadmissibility to the United States.

Border security involves securing the many means by which people and things can enter the country. Operationally, this means controlling the official ports of entry (POE) through which legitimate travelers and commerce enter the country, and patrolling the nation's land and maritime borders to prevent illegal entries.", "DHS's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) protects 7,000 miles of U.S. international land borders with Mexico and Canada and 95,000 miles of coastal shoreline. At ports of entry, the CBP Office of Field Operations (OFO) is responsible for conducting immigration, customs, and agricultural inspections of travelers seeking admission to the United States. Between POEs, CBP's U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) is responsible for enforcing immigration law and other federal laws along the border and for preventing unlawful entries into the United States. According to USBP data, apprehensions of unauthorized migrants have declined since FY2005, reaching a 40-year low in FY2011. Although apprehensions remain at historically low levels, there have been increases since FY2011, driven by increased apprehensions of Central American families and unaccompanied alien children (UAC) at the Southwest border (see \" Unaccompanied Alien Children \"). ", "Border security has been an important issue for the last several Congresses. In recent years, some Members of Congress have proposed to strengthen border security as part of a \"comprehensive immigration reform\" bill, while others have argued that Congress should not consider other immigration reforms until the border has been secured. Debate in the 113 th Congress focused primarily on border security strategy and metrics; border personnel, equipment, and infrastructure; improvements to the entry-exit system for tracking aliens' travel into and out of the United States; and DHS's access to federal lands and authority to waive certain federal laws."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Border Security Strategy and Metrics", "paragraphs": ["DHS, CBP, OFO, and USBP all have published strategic plans, but they have not laid out a comprehensive operational strategy for securing U.S. borders or published clear metrics for measuring and evaluating border security. The absence of such a strategy and metrics arguably has contributed to disagreements about the existing level of border security. ", "S. 744 , as passed by the Senate, would require DHS to develop a pair of planning documents: a Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy and a Southern Border Fencing Strategy. The bill includes a detailed list of surveillance equipment and other assets to be deployed in each Border Patrol sector along the southern border as required elements of the Comprehensive Security Strategy. It also requires that the Fencing Strategy describe plans to deploy 700 miles of southern border pedestrian fencing (up from about 352 miles of pedestrian fencing and 299 miles of vehicle barriers today). In general, the submission and implementation of the two southern border strategies are among the \"triggers\" that S. 744 would establish as preconditions for DHS to begin processing legalization applications for certain unauthorized aliens and to begin adjusting the status of such aliens under the bill.", "The goal of the Comprehensive Security Strategy would be to achieve and maintain \"effective control\" of all Border Patrol sectors along the southern border. Effective control would be defined to include \"persistent surveillance\" and at least a 90% \"effectiveness rate.\" The bill would require DHS to report to Congress biannually on implementation of the Comprehensive Security Strategy, with such reports to include sector-level effectiveness rates and information about alien recidivism (i.e., repeat apprehensions). If the DHS Secretary cannot certify that DHS has achieved effective control of all southern border sectors for at least one fiscal year within five years of the bill's passage, S. 744 would require that additional border security recommendations be issued by a Southern Border Security Commission to be composed of the governors or gubernatorial appointees from each of the southern border states (and Nevada), along with congressional and presidential appointees. ", "The Border Security Results Act of 2013 ( H.R. 1417 ), as reported by the House Homeland Security Committee, would likewise require DHS to develop a Strategy to Secure the Border. H.R. 1417 differs from S. 744 in that H.R. 1417 does not describe specific assets or miles of fencing to be included in its strategy. Instead, the House bill includes an extensive list of considerations to be taken into account in the development of the strategy; and it requires that the strategy be designed to allow DHS to gain and maintain operational control of the border within deadlines established by the bill. Operational control is defined in the House bill to include at least a 90% effectiveness rate with respect to illegal border crossing as well as a \"significant reduction in the movement of illegal drugs and other contraband through such areas.\" H.R. 1417 also describes a more comprehensive set of border metrics than those identified in S. 744 , including measures of illegal migration, recidivism, and drug seizures between ports of entry; measures of immigration and drug enforcement as well as crossing times at ports of entry; and immigration and drug enforcement data for maritime borders. The bill would require DHS to collaborate with outside partners in the development and review of these metrics; and it would require DHS and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to submit regular reports to Congress indicating whether operational control of the southern border has been achieved and maintained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Border Security Personnel, Equipment, and Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["Across a variety of indicators, the United States has substantially expanded border enforcement resources over the last three decades. Particularly since 2001, such increases have included border security personnel, fencing and infrastructure, and surveillance technology.", "Senate-passed S. 744 would authorize additional increases in each of these areas. Under the bill, DHS would be required to more than double the number of Border Patrol agents deployed to the southern border (to 38,405, up from 18,462 in FY2013); to increase the number of CBP officers and CBP flight hours; and to deploy the specific surveillance equipment, fencing, and infrastructure assets described in the bill's border strategies (see \"Border Security Strategies and Metrics\"). S. 744 also would direct DHS to continuously deploy unmanned aircraft, along with other surveillance equipment, to ensure surveillance of border areas 24 hours a day, with necessary funding authorized for FY2014\u2013FY2018. And it would support recent CBP efforts to increase the proportion of border crossers subject to criminal prosecutions and other \"high consequence\" enforcement outcomes by setting aside funding to triple the number of border crossing prosecutions in the Border Patrol's Tucson sector, which has accounted for the largest number of illegal crossings in recent years. The bill would support these increases with about $45 billion in direct spending on border enforcement over a 5-10 year period.", "The House-passed supplemental appropriations bill for 2014 ( H.R. 5230 ) would appropriate, or otherwise make available, funds for the deployment of National Guard units and personnel to the southern border to provide support for border operations, particularly in high-traffic areas experiencing substantial crossings by unaccompanied alien children.", "With respect to border security personnel compensation, S. 1691 , as passed by the Senate, would create a new system for determining overtime compensation for Border Patrol agents.

The Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM), formerly known as the United States Visitor and Immigration Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program, is responsible for collecting and storing these data and for providing entry-exit information to other components within DHS and to other federal agencies. The entry-exit system has been a subject of ongoing congressional attention because\u2014in spite of the mandate\u2014DHS collects only biographic data (i.e., it does not collect biometric data) from certain visitors entering the United States, and it does not collect any data from certain visitors leaving the United States.", "Border security and immigration legislation considered in the 113 th Congress would reiterate the entry-exit mandate, with a particular focus on further development of the exit tracking system. In the House, committee-reported H.R. 1417 would require DHS, within 180 days of the bill's enactment, to submit a plan to Congress to implement immediately a biometric exit system at U.S. ports of entry, or to submit alternative plans that would achieve the same level of security within two years if DHS determines that a biometric exit system is not feasible.

(Air and sea carriers currently submit passenger manifest data to DHS.) DHS also would be required, within two years of enactment, to establish a biometric exit system at the 10 U.S. airports with the greatest volume of international travel. Following a report to Congress, DHS would be required to expand biometric data collection to 30 airports and to develop a plan for such data collection at major land and sea ports. S. 744 would further require that DHS ensure that \"reasonably available enforcement resources are employed\" to locate and remove visa overstays identified by the entry-exit system, and that at least 90% of people who enter the United States after the bill's enactment and who overstay their visas by more than 180 days are placed in removal proceedings or otherwise have their cases resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to Federal Lands and DHS Waiver Authority", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Access to Federal Lands", "paragraphs": ["More than 40% of the southern border abuts federal and tribal lands overseen by the Department of Agriculture (USDA) or the Department of the Interior (DOI), including some areas that have been identified as \"high-risk areas\" for marijuana smuggling and illegal migration.

Some Members of Congress have argued that DHS should have more complete access to public lands for law enforcement purposes, though Border Patrol officials have testified that existing MOUs allow USBP to carry out its border security mission.", "Legislation considered in the 113 th Congress would broaden DHS authority on such lands. Senate-passed S. 744 would require USDA and DOI to provide CBP personnel with immediate access to federal lands within Arizona for certain security activities. CBP would be required to conduct its activities, to the maximum extent possible, in a manner that the DHS Secretary determines will best protect natural and cultural resources when acting on federal lands and to prepare an environmental impact statement in connection with its enforcement efforts. More broadly, both House-passed H.R. 5230 and H.R. 2278 , as ordered to be reported by the House Judiciary Committee, would give DHS immediate access to USDA and DOI lands within 100 miles of international land borders; and it would explicitly prohibit USDA or DOI from impeding or restricting CBP's border security activities on such lands.

The requirements with respect to recruitment and referral would apply one year after the date of enactment. The bill also would provide for mandatory reverification of workers with temporary work authorization, which would be phased in on the same schedule as the verification requirements for hiring.

H.R. 1772 would provide for the blocking of social security numbers from use in the verification system in cases of misuse and in other specified circumstances. It also would enable individuals to limit use of their social security numbers or other information for verification purposes.", "In addition, H.R. 1772 includes language to expressly preempt any state or local law that relates to the hiring, employment, or verification of the employment eligibility of unauthorized aliens. At the same time, a state or locality could exercise its authority over business licensing and similar laws as a penalty for failure to use the verification system and a state, at its own expense, could enforce the revised INA Section 274A provisions, under specified terms.

All federal agencies would be required to participate in the EVS on the earlier of the date of enactment, to the extent each agency is required to participate in E-Verify and as already implemented, or 90 days after the date of enactment. Federal contractors would be required to participate in the EVS in accordance with current regulatory requirements to participate in E-Verify. Beginning one year after implementing regulations are published, DHS could direct any employer involved in critical infrastructure to participate in the EVS to the extent the Secretary determines such participation would assist in critical infrastructure protection; these employers could be required to participate in the EVS with respect to newly hired employees as well as current workers.", "The phase-in of the EVS participation requirements for other employers with respect to newly hired employees and employees with expiring employment authorization documents would begin no later than two years after the publication of implementing regulations (for employers with more than 5,000 employees) and would end no later than five years after the publication of implementing regulations (for the last group, tribal government employers).

An employer who hires a worker without using the electronic system when required to do so would be presumed to have violated the Section 274A prohibitions on unauthorized employment. Among the new penalties S. 744 would create, DHS would be authorized to establish an \"enhanced civil penalty\" in cases in which an employer both fails to use the EVS and violates a federal, state, or local law on the payment of wages, work hours, or workplace health and safety.

According to DHS, the VSP provides law enforcement resources not available to consular officers. One of the major tasks for VSP agents is to screen visa applicants to determine their risk profiles. GAO, however, released an evaluation of the VSP that identified several shortcomings. In addition to noting that tensions exist between consular officials and VSP agents, GAO was especially concerned about the lack of standard operating procedures for VSP agents across the various posts. Most importantly, perhaps, GAO stated that ICE has not expanded the VSP to key high-risk posts despite well-publicized plans to do so.
