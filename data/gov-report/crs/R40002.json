Employers violating the INA Section 274A prohibitions on unlawful employment may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties.", "The federal government's approach to immigration-related worksite enforcement has changed over the years. In 1999, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) unveiled an interior enforcement strategy, which, as explained by an INS official at the time, gave priority in the area of worksite enforcement to two types of cases: (1) criminal employer cases, in which there was a pattern or practice of knowingly employing unauthorized workers, and (2) cases of employers who abused their workers and who violated multiple laws. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, interior enforcement priorities again shifted. Resources were redirected from traditional program areas, including worksite enforcement, to national security-related investigations, and the primary focus of worksite enforcement became removal of unauthorized workers from critical infrastructure facilities such as airports and military bases.", "Under the worksite enforcement guidance issued in 2009, homeland security remains a primary concern of ICE's worksite enforcement program. As described by ICE: \"Investigations involving national security, public safety or those associated with our critical infrastructure and key resources sectors receive top priority.\" According to ICE, the agency also prioritizes criminally prosecuting employers who \"utilize unauthorized workers as a business model,\" \"mistreat their workers,\" or \"engage in human smuggling or trafficking,\" among other violations. ", "In recent years, ICE also has placed \"increased emphasis on compliance and outreach\" in conducting worksite enforcement. It has increased its use of inspections, or audits, of business owners' I-9 records (see above) to determine whether they are in compliance with employment eligibility verification laws and regulations.

It seems reasonable to assume that most individuals arrested on administrative charges are non-managerial employees. Criminal arrests include arrests for illegal hiring as well as for identity theft, alien harboring, money laundering, and other criminal violations. Citizens and noncitizens alike can be the subject of criminal arrests, as can non-managerial employees, managerial employees, and employers.", "During each year from FY2003 to FY2008, as shown in Table 2 , the number of administrative and criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations increased; some of the yearly changes, as from FY2005 to FY2006, were marked. In 2008 congressional testimony, then-DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff highlighted the number of administrative and criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations in FY2007 as evidence of the progress being made by ICE on the worksite enforcement front. ", "Between FY2008 and FY2009, as indicated in Table 2 , the number of individuals arrested on administrative and criminal charges plummeted. Since FY2011, there has been a steady decline in the number of both types of arrests. The reasons for the overall decreases in administrative and criminal arrests between FY2008 and FY2014 are unclear, but they may reflect, to some degree, ICE's stated renewed focus on employers.", "In his 2011 House testimony, then-ICE Deputy Director Kibble responded to concerns expressed by some Members of Congress about the diminished number of administrative arrests in worksite enforcement operations:", "The number of administrative arrests at worksites cannot, and should not, be considered in a vacuum. For the past two years, our worksite efforts have been part of a broader enforcement strategy that has seen the removal of more individuals from the United States than at any other time in the agency's history.

Of the 1,647 total worksite enforcement administrative arrests in FY2009, employment position information is available for 1,153 individuals. Non-managerial employees accounted for 1,112 of these 1,153 arrests (96%), while managerial employees with position titles that included owner, manager, and corporate official accounted for the remaining 41 arrests (4%). Of the 1,217 total administrative arrests in FY2010, employment position information is available for 897 individuals. Non-managerial employees accounted for 821 of these 897 arrests (92%), while managerial employees accounted for the remaining 76 arrests (8%).", "With respect to worksite enforcement criminal arrests, employment position information is available for 403 of the 444 individuals arrested on criminal charges in FY2009. These 403 individuals included 289 non-managerial employees (72%) and 114 managerial employees with position titles that included owner, manager, and corporate official (28%). Of the 448 individuals arrested on criminal charges in FY2010, employment position information is available for 385. Non-managerial employees accounted for 189 of these 385 arrests (49%), while managerial employees accounted for 196 criminal arrests (51%). Thus, while the number of overall criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations was quite similar between FY2009 and FY2010, the number of managerial employees among the arrestees increased from 114 to 196. This increase, which is in line with ICE's stated focus in the worksite enforcement area on criminally investigating and prosecuting employers who knowingly employ unauthorized workers, follows a decline in criminal arrests among managerial employees between FY2008 and FY2009. The comparable number of managerial employee criminal arrests in FY2008 was 135, according to ICE. ", "The representation of managerial employees among those criminally arrested varied in FY2012 and FY2013. For FY2012, as for FY2010, it seems that about half of the individuals criminally arrested in connection with worksite enforcement investigations were managerial employees. According to ICE, 240 of the 520 individuals arrested on criminal charges in FY2012 were owners, managers, supervisors, or human resources personnel. For FY2013, managerial employees accounted for about 40% of criminal arrests in connection with worksite enforcement investigations. ICE reports that 179 of the 452 individuals arrested on criminal charges in FY2013 were owners, managers, supervisors, or human resources personnel. ", "Viewed more broadly, ICE administrative and criminal arrests in worksite enforcement operations represent a very small percentage of the potential population of violators. For example, Table 2 shows a high of 5,184 administrative arrests in worksite operations in FY2008.

Both measures then fell markedly between FY2008 and FY2009 and have followed no consistent pattern since. It is difficult to draw direct conclusions from these data about the worksite enforcement program in any particular year. One reason for this is that there can be time lags between arrests, indictments, and convictions.", " Table 4 provides data on criminal fines and forfeitures related to worksite enforcement investigations that were imposed in FY2003-FY2014. ICE characterizes these data as follows:", "Criminal fines and forfeitures include fines imposed by a U.S. District Court as a result of a criminal conviction, seizures made by ICE and forfeited to the U.S. government, payments made to ICE in lieu of the seizure and forfeiture of real or personal property, and restitution payments made by an employer to their unauthorized alien employees as a result of labor law violations.", "As shown in Table 4 , worksite enforcement-related criminal fines and forfeitures have varied dramatically during the FY2003-FY2014 period, although they have remained well above the FY2003 level in all subsequent years. In light of the various types of fines and forfeitures (as indicated in the above description from ICE) and associated time lags, which presumably help explain the great annual variability, it may be that the total for any particular year is less significant than the fact that criminal fines and forfeitures were being pursued. ", "In summary, the data presented here offer an available, but limited, means to examine the performance of ICE's worksite enforcement program. Some measures, namely Final Orders issued and administrative fines imposed, followed a downward trend after 2000 and then an upward trend after FY2006. Other measures, namely administrative arrests, criminal arrests, criminal indictments, and criminal convictions, registered increases from the initial years included here until FY2008, followed by significant decreases from FY2008 to FY2009. From FY2011 to FY2014, there was a steady decrease in both administrative and criminal arrests, while the yearly changes in criminal arrests and criminal indictments did not follow a consistent pattern. The FY2014 values for all four measures were below the FY2011 levels. The data on criminal fines and forfeitures imposed, the remaining measure, reveal no discernible pattern.

That year, as indicated in Table 5 , WHD collected $79.1 million in back wages for FLSA overtime and minimum wage violations for about 109,000 workers.
