The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a framework through which the federal government regulates the use of controlled substances for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes, and prevents these substances from being diverted for illegal purposes. The CSA assigns various plants, drugs, and chemicals (such as narcotics, stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and anabolic steroids) to one of five schedules based on the substance's medical use, potential for abuse, and safety or dependence liability. Schedule I contains substances that have no currently accepted medical use and cannot safely be made available to the public under a prescription, while Schedules II, III, IV, and V include substances that have recognized medical uses and may be manufactured, distributed, and used in accordance with the CSA. The order of the schedules reflects substances that are progressively less dangerous and addictive. To restrict access to chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of certain controlled substances, the CSA also regulates 40 \"listed chemicals.\" Furthermore, the CSA regulates controlled substance \"analogues,\" which are substances that are not controlled but are structurally or pharmacologically similar to substances found in Schedule I or II and have no accepted medical use.", "Unless specifically exempted by the CSA, any person who handles controlled substances or listed chemicals (such as drug manufacturers, wholesale distributors, doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and scientific researchers) must register with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the U.S. Department of Justice, which administers and enforces the CSA. Registrants must keep accurate and complete records of all transactions involving controlled substances, maintain detailed inventories of the substances in their possession, and periodically file reports with the DEA, as well as ensure that controlled substances are securely stored and safeguarded in accordance with DEA regulations.", "Between 10%-11% of all drug prescriptions written in the United States are for pharmaceutical controlled substances. Only licensed medical practitioners (who are registered with the DEA) are authorized to prescribe controlled substances listed in Schedules II-V to patients; such prescriptions may only be issued by a practitioner who is \"acting in the usual course of his professional practice,\" and for a \"legitimate medical purpose.\" The CSA authorizes the DEA Administrator to suspend or revoke a physician's prescription privileges upon a finding that he has \"committed such acts as would render his registration ... inconsistent with the public interest.\"", "While the CSA provides criminal sanctions for illicit possession, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances, the statute also contains a few noteworthy penalty provisions that are specifically applicable to persons who are authorized by the DEA to handle controlled substances lawfully. The CSA sets forth certain offenses involving listed chemicals and DEA registration and other prohibited acts relating to registrants who manufacture, distribute, and dispense controlled substances."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The Controlled Substances Act (CSA or the act) is the statutory framework through which the federal government regulates the lawful production, possession, and distribution of controlled substances.

When a petition is received by the DEA, the agency initiates its own investigation of the drug or substance. The DEA may also initiate an investigation at any time in response to information received from law enforcement laboratories, state and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies, or other sources of information.", "After the DEA's initial investigation, the DEA Administrator (Administrator) requests from the Assistant Secretary of Health of HHS (Assistant Secretary of Health) a scientific and medical evaluation and recommendation as to whether the drug or substance should be controlled or removed from control. The Assistant Secretary of Health in turn solicits information from the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and obtains evaluations and recommendations from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The Assistant Secretary of Health then consolidates the requested information and transmits back to the DEA a medical and scientific evaluation regarding the drug or substance, along with a recommendation as to whether the drug or substance should be controlled and into which schedule it should be placed.", "The Administrator then evaluates all of the relevant data and makes a final determination as to whether the drug or substance should be controlled or removed entirely from control. In making a determination regarding the control of a drug or substance, the Administrator must consider factors such as the drug's actual or relative potential for abuse; scientific evidence of its pharmacological effect; the current state of scientific knowledge regarding the drug or substance; the risk to the public health; and whether the substance is an immediate precursor of a substance already controlled under the act.

These 40 chemicals are referred to by the CSA as \"listed chemicals.\" Listed chemicals are divided into two categories: List I and List II. While both categories of chemicals can be used to illicitly manufacture controlled substances, List\u00c2\u00a0I chemicals are more strenuously regulated than List II chemicals because List I chemicals are \"important to the manufacture of a controlled substance.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Controlled Substances Analogues", "paragraphs": ["Controlled substance analogues are substances that are not controlled but are structurally or pharmacologically similar to substances found in Schedule I or II and have no accepted medical use. A substance that meets the definition of the term \"controlled substance analogue\" and is intended for human consumption is treated as if it were a controlled substance in Schedule I. Controlled substance analogues are different from listed chemicals because such analogues are typically intended for human consumption as a substitute for a controlled substance, whereas listed chemicals are not intended for human consumption but are instead used as \"ingredients\" in the manufacture of certain controlled substances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Synthetic Drugs", "paragraphs": ["Synthetic drugs are chemically produced in a laboratory; their chemical structure can be either identical to or different from naturally occurring drugs, and their effects are designed to mimic or even enhance those of natural drugs.

The DEA has described the movement of a controlled substance from manufacture to the patient as follows:", "[A] controlled substance, after being manufactured by a DEA-registered manufacturer, may be transferred to a DEA-registered distributor for subsequent distribution to a DEA- registered retail pharmacy. After a DEA-registered practitioner, such as a physician or a dentist, issues a prescription for a controlled substance to a patient (i.e., the ultimate user), that patient can fill that prescription at a retail pharmacy to obtain that controlled substance. In this system, the manufacturer, the distributor, the practitioner, and the retail pharmacy are all required to be DEA registrants, or to be exempted from the requirement of registration, to participate in the process.", "All registrants are required by the CSA to maintain complete and accurate inventories and records of all regulated transactions involving controlled substances and listed chemicals, as well as provide adequate security controls to prevent their diversion. Therefore, a particular controlled substance is always under the control of a DEA-registered person until it reaches the patient or is destroyed, and the CSA's regulatory requirements \"ensure that all controlled substances are accounted for from their creation until their dispensing or destruction.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Registration", "paragraphs": ["The CSA defines who must register with the DEA in order to handle controlled substances. Every person who manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, or exports any controlled substance, or who proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, importation, or exportation of any controlled substance, must register with the DEA, unless they are exempt. Generally, all manufacturers, distributors, and practitioners who deal with controlled substances must register. The CSA refers to an individual patient as an \"ultimate user,\" which it defines as \"a person who has lawfully obtained, and who possesses, a controlled substance for his own use or for the use of a member of his household or for an animal owned by him or by a member of his household.\" Ultimate users are not required to register with the DEA because the controlled substances in their possession \"are no longer part of the closed system of distribution and are no longer subject to DEA's system of corresponding accountability.\"", "Manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances must register with the DEA annually, and those who dispense controlled substances must obtain registrations that may not be issued for less than one year or more than three years. Any person who is required to register in order to manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances, but has not yet registered, may apply for registration at any time. Those who already are registered can apply for re-registration not more than 60 days before the expiration date of their current registration. Registrations specify the extent to which registrants are authorized to manufacture, possess, distribute, or dispense controlled substances. The Administrator is authorized to charge reasonable fees relating to the registration and control of the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances under the act. In addition, the Administrator can inspect the establishments of registrants or applicants for registration.", "Registration is granted to applicants only if it would be consistent with the \"public interest\" to do so. The Administrator uses several criteria to assess whether registering an applicant is consistent with the \"public interest.\" The criteria differ depending on the substance involved and whether the applicant is a manufacturer, distributor, or practitioner, but generally include factors such as those relating to public health and safety and compliance with state and local laws.", "The Administrator also has the authority to deny, revoke, or suspend registrations under certain circumstances but must provide adequate grounds for doing so. Before the DEA can deny an application, the agency must provide the applicant with an opportunity to demonstrate why the registration should not be denied. However, the Administrator can suspend without notice any registration in order to avoid imminent danger to public health and safety. A revocation or suspension of a registration may be applicable to a particular controlled substance or class of controlled substances. For example, a manufacturer who has been found to have violated the registration provisions regarding a Schedule II substance will still be able to manufacture controlled substances in Schedules III-V because the revocation or suspension relates only to one class of controlled substances.", "The registration of an individual terminates when the person dies, ceases legal existence, or discontinues business or professional practice. A registrant who ceases legal existence or discontinues business or professional practice must notify the DEA promptly of this occurrence. A registration cannot be transferred to someone else unless the Administrator provides his express, written consent for such a transfer to occur.", "In some instances, applicants must apply for several separate registrations in order to comply with the CSA. Separate registrations are required for each principal place of business or professional practice where controlled substances are manufactured, distributed, imported, exported, or dispensed. For example, a physician who is regularly engaged in dispensing controlled substances at one location must register to dispense controlled substances at other locations if he chooses to dispense controlled substances at these other locations. However, with the enactment of the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, the DEA Administrator must modify existing registrations of pharmacies to authorize them to dispense controlled substances by means of the Internet, unless the Administrator determines that such modification would be inconsistent with the public interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recordkeeping Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to registration requirements, the CSA contains several recordkeeping provisions.

Furthermore, inventories must be available for inspection for at least two years. These records are generally open for inspection by federal authorities and state officers tasked with enforcing state narcotics laws. The CSA declares that is unlawful for any person to \"refuse or negligently fail to make, keep, or furnish any record, report, notification, declaration, order or order form, statement, invoice, or information required\" by the CSA; it is also unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally \"to furnish false or fraudulent material information in, or omit any material information from, any application, report, record, or other document required to be made, kept, or filed\" under the CSA. ", "Certain DEA regulations implementing the CSA also apply to listed chemicals. For example, all registrants authorized to handle listed chemicals (List I and List II) must maintain records of regulated transactions and submit various reports to the DEA.

The form is preprinted by the DEA with the name and address of the purchaser and the drugs must be shipped by the supplier filling the order to the purchaser's registered location. All manufacturers must forward copies of completed order forms to the DEA by the close of the month in which the shipment is made. The CSA also provides for electronic orders of Schedule I and II drugs. Manufacturers must also forward copies of filled electronic orders to the DEA within 2 business days.", "The DEA further monitors the distribution of controlled substances by requiring manufacturers and distributors of Schedule I and II drugs to file reports through the Automated Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS). Certain narcotics listed in Schedules III and IV are also covered by the ARCOS reporting requirements.", "Registered pharmacies that are authorized to dispense controlled substances by means of the Internet must report to the DEA Administrator the total quantity of each controlled substance that the pharmacy has dispensed each month.
