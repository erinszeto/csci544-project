The Convention contains procedures for processing international child support cases that are intended to be uniform, simple, efficient, accessible, and cost-free to U.S. citizens seeking child support in other countries. For many international cases, U.S. courts and state Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies already recognize and enforce child support obligations, whether or not the United States has a reciprocal agreement with the other country. However, many foreign countries will not enforce U.S. child support orders in the absence of a treaty obligation. The United States was the first country to sign the Convention. The other signatories are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the European Union, Norway, and Ukraine. However, the United States has not yet ratified the treaty.", "Although it is not the Senate's role to ratify treaties, it provides its advice and consent to a treaty's provisions. On September 29, 2010, the U.S. Senate approved the Resolution of Advice and Consent regarding the Convention. According to OCSE, the following additional steps must occur before the Convention can enter into force for the United States:", "Congress must adopt, and there must be enacted, implementing legislation for the Convention. Pursuant to the implementing legislation, all states must enact the 2008 version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) by the effective date noted in the legislation. In addition, the implementing legislation would require states to make minor revisions to their CSE state plan. The President must sign the instrument of ratification for the Convention.

H.R. 1896 would amend federal law so that the federal income tax refund offset program is available for use by a state to handle CSE requests from foreign reciprocating countries and foreign treaty countries. It would require states to adopt the 2008 amendments to the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) verbatim to ensure uniformity of procedures, requirements, and reporting forms. In addition, H.R. 1896 would provide for the development of a standard format for data exchange of CSE data.

They contend that a noncustodial parent's residence in a foreign country should not negate his or her children from receiving the child support to which they are entitled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Current Child Support Enforcement (CSE) Program3", "paragraphs": ["The CSE program was enacted in 1975 ( P.L. 93-647 ) as a federal-state program (Title IV-D of the Social Security Act). Its purpose is to help strengthen families by securing financial support for children from their noncustodial parent on a consistent and continuing basis and by helping some families remain self-sufficient and off public assistance. The CSE program has evolved over time from a \"welfare cost-recovery\" program into a \"family-first\" program that seeks to enhance the well-being of families by making child support a more reliable source of income. Child support orders require noncustodial parents to fulfill their financial responsibility to their children by contributing to the payment of childrearing costs. The CSE program provides seven major services on behalf of children: (1) parent location, (2) paternity establishment, (3) establishment of child support orders, (4) review and modification of child support orders, (5) collection of child support payments, (6) distribution of child support payments, and (7) establishment and enforcement of medical support. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. The federal government reimburses each state (and the jurisdictions listed above) 66% of the cost of operating its CSE program. In addition, the federal government pays states (and jurisdictions) an incentive payment to encourage them to operate effective programs. ", "State CSE programs are usually operated at the county-level of government in the human services department, department of revenue, or the State Attorney General's office. States must comply with a comprehensive set of requirements as a condition for receiving federal funds for operating state CSE programs. The CSE program is administered at the federal level by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Domestic Enforcement of Child Support", "paragraphs": ["State CSE programs have authority to use a vast array of methods/tools to collect/enforce the payment of child support. Collection methods used by CSE agencies include income withholding, intercept of federal and state income tax refunds, intercept of unemployment compensation, liens against property, security bonds, and reporting of child support obligations to credit bureaus. All states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands also have civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws. Moreover, the 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ), officially known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA), required states to implement expedited procedures to allow them to secure assets to satisfy an arrearage by intercepting or seizing unemployment and workers' compensation; lottery winnings; awards, judgments, or settlements; and assets of the debtor parent held in public or private retirement funds and financial institutions. It required states to implement procedures to withhold, suspend, or restrict use of driver's licenses, professional and occupational licenses, and recreational and sporting licenses of persons who owe past-due support or who fail to comply with subpoenas or warrants relating to paternity or child support proceedings. In addition, the 1996 law authorized the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports of debtor parents.", "Many CSE administrators contend that the most difficult child support orders to enforce are interstate cases. Family law traditionally has been under the jurisdiction of state and local governments, and citizens fall under the jurisdiction of the courts where they live. Thus, although federal CSE law requires states to cooperate in interstate child support enforcement, problems often arise because of the autonomy of local courts.", "P.L. 104-193 required states to enact and implement the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA). UIFSA was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) and approved by the Commissioners in August 1992. The NCCUSL revised the act in 1996, 2001, and again in 2008. ", "UIFSA limits the jurisdiction that can properly establish and modify child support orders and addresses the enforcement of child support obligations within the United States. When multiple states are involved in establishing, enforcing, or modifying a child or spousal support order, UIFSA is used to resolve jurisdictional issues of the courts in the different states. UIFSA also establishes which state's law will be applied in proceedings under UIFSA, an important factor as support laws vary greatly among the states. UIFSA is designed to deal with desertion and nonsupport by instituting uniform laws in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The core of UIFSA is limiting control of a child support case to a single state, thereby ensuring that only one child support order from one court or child support agency is in effect at any given time. It follows that the controlling state will be able to effectively pursue interstate cases, primarily through the use of long arm statutes, because its jurisdiction is undisputed.", "UIFSA provides procedural and jurisdictional rules for three types of interstate child support proceedings to (1) establish a child support order; (2) enforce a child support order; and (3) modify a child support order. UIFSA implements the \"one-order system.\" This means that only one state's order governs, at any given time, an obligor's support obligation to any child. Further, only one state has continuing jurisdiction to modify a child support order. This requires all other states to recognize the order and to refrain from modifying it unless the first state has lost jurisdiction.", "P.L. 104-193 required that the 1996 version of UIFSA be adopted. It has been adopted in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. As mentioned above, the NCCUSL approved additional amendments to UIFSA in August 2001. However, there is no federal mandate for states to enact the 2001 amendments. To date (almost 12 years later), only 21 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the 2001 amendments to UIFSA. In July 2008, the NCCUSL approved amendments to the 2001 UIFSA (referred to as UIFSA 2008), to integrate the appropriate provisions of the Convention, which were adopted at the Hague Conference on Private International Law on November 23, 2007. Similarly, there is no federal mandate for states to enact UIFSA 2008. To date, 11 states have adopted the 2008 amendments to UIFSA.

Prior to P.L. 104-193 , states used the system that they had developed for interstate child support cases to collect child support on behalf of children whose noncustodial parent lived abroad. According to various CSE documents, the arrangements developed between the individual states and various foreign countries to enforce child support obligations were based on the principles of comity\u2014the voluntary recognition and respect given to the acts of another nation's government\u2014as well as formal statements of reciprocity.

These state-level arrangements were formerly authorized by the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA), and are now authorized pursuant to UIFSA. However, such state-level arrangements may not be as comprehensive as the federal-level agreements. Further, not all states have similar arrangements with all countries; most states have arrangements with only a few countries.

In most foreign countries, jurisdiction in child support cases is based on the habitual residence of the custodial parent.

Such a policy would increase the likelihood that all interstate cases are handled under a similar statutory framework, thus moving closer to the \"one-order\" world in which a child would not be seriously disadvantaged in obtaining child support just because his or her parents do not live in the same state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "(f) State Law Requirement Concerning the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA)\u2014(2) Conforming Amendment to the Full Faith and Credit Child Support Orders Act", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 1896 would clarify current law by stipulating that a state court that has established a child support order has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its order if the order is the controlling order and (1) the state is the child's state of residence or that of any individual contestant or (2) the contestants consent in a record or in open court that the court may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order. The bill would also clarify that a state no longer has continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of a child support order if the state is not the residence of the child or an individual contestant, and the contestants have not consented in a record or in open court that the court of the other state may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order.", "Federal law requires states to treat past-due child support obligations as final judgments that are entitled to full faith and credit in every state. This means that a person who has a child support order in one state does not have to obtain a second order in another state to obtain child support due should the noncustodial parent move from the issuing court's jurisdiction. Congress passed P.L. 103-383 , the Full Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act (FFCCSOA; 28 U.S.C. \u00a71738B) in 1994 because of concerns about the growing number of child support cases involving disputes between parents who lived in different states and the ease with which noncustodial parents could reduce the amount of the obligation or evade enforcement by moving across state lines. P.L. 103-383 required courts of all United States territories, states, and tribes to accord full faith and credit to a child support order issued by another state or tribe that properly exercised jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter. P.L. 103-383 addressed the need to determine, in cases with more than one child support order issued for the same obligor and child, which order to recognize for purposes of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction and enforcement. P.L. 103-383 restricted a state court's ability to modify a child support order issued by another state unless the child and the custodial parent have moved to the state where the modification is sought or have agreed to the modification. The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) clarified the definition of a child's home state and made several revisions to ensure that the full faith and credit laws could be applied consistently with UIFSA.
