The omnibus legislative approach contrasts with incremental revisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that would address some but not all of these elements, and with sequential reforms that would tackle border security and interior enforcement provisions prior to revising legal immigration or enacting legalization pathways.", "Leaders in both chambers have identified immigration as a legislative priority in the 113th Congress. While the House Committee on the Judiciary has ordered reported several distinct pieces of legislation that aim to reform immigration law thus far in the 113th Congress, the debate in the Senate has focused on a single CIR bill: the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act (S. 744).

The bill would mandate new border security strategies and the development of new border metrics that would be designed to achieve \"effective control\" of the Southern border. Most notably, S. 744 would authorize $44.5 billion in spending for additional border patrol agents, border fencing, and an electronic exit system to collect machine readable data at air and sea ports of entry.", "The legislation would also authorize $750 million for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement a mandatory electronic employment verification system to be used by all employers. Furthermore, S. 744 would amend the INA to create additional grounds of inadmissibility and deportability, while broadening judges' discretion to waive some of these grounds. For certain immigration offenses, the bill would increase civil and misdemeanor penalties for first-time offenses and impose felony penalties when aggravating circumstances exist. The bill would amend INA provisions on unlawful reentry to increase criminal penalties. S. 744 would provide additional resources to immigration courts and would encourage alternatives to detention and strengthen detention standards and congressional oversight of immigrant detention. Special provisions would be included to protect children who are affected by immigration enforcement.", "In turn, S. 744 would amend the INA to provide pathways for unauthorized aliens to adjust their immigration status to one of the proposed new statuses\u2014\"registered provisional immigrant\" (RPI) status and \"blue card\" status\u2014and ultimately legal permanent resident (LPR) status after specified border security and interior enforcement criteria are met. In addition to these legalization provisions, S. 744 would also accelerate the admission of an estimated 4 to 7 million foreign nationals who have pending petitions to become LPRs. S. 744 would substantially revise the categories for the admission of LPRs, eliminating the category for siblings of U.S. citizens, shifting the allocation of the other family-based categories, permitting more categories of LPRs to enter without numerical limits, and increasing the number of employment-based LPRs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the changes to the legal immigration system would result in an increase of 9.6 million LPRs in the first decade after enactment.", "Senate-passed S. 744 would revise and expand nonimmigrant (i.e., temporary immigration) programs for high- and low-skilled workers, as well as for tourists, students, and other nonimmigrants. The bill would increase the cap on professional specialty workers (H-1B workers), while also imposing new requirements on businesses that employ H-1B workers, as well as those that employ intra-company transferees (L visas). Reforms would be made to the existing H-2B visa for lower-skilled non-agricultural workers in temporary or seasonal employment, while the H-2A visa for agricultural workers would be phased out. New nonimmigrant visas (the proposed W visas) would be established for lower-skilled agricultural and non-agricultural workers that would be more flexible for employers, while also expanding certain rights for workers. Additional nonimmigrant visa changes would facilitate temporary immigration by doctors, investors, and aliens from certain countries with U.S. trade agreements; encourage tourism within the United States; and strengthen oversight of foreign students and summer-work study exchanges, among other changes.", "An accompanying report, CRS Report R43099, Comprehensive Immigration Reform in the 113th Congress: Short Summary of Major Legislative Proposals, offers an overview of S. 744 as well."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["For several years, some Members of Congress have favored \"comprehensive immigration reform\" (CIR), a label that commonly refers to omnibus legislation that includes increased border security and immigration enforcement, expanded employment eligibility verification, revision of nonimmigrant visas and legal permanent immigration, and legalization for some unauthorized aliens residing in the country.

Some argue, for example, that while supporters of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) promised that a one-time legalization, increased border enforcement, and a prohibition against employing unauthorized workers would solve the problem of illegal migration; some of IRCA's immigration enforcement provisions were incompletely implemented. Partly to allay these concerns, the first sections of S. 744 would make implementation of certain enforcement provisions pre-conditions for the bill's legalization provisions; and S. 744 would directly appropriate funding for certain enforcement measures.

Second , as reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee, \u00a73 generally provided that DHS could not begin adjusting the status of persons from RPI to legal permanent resident (LPR) until certain \"triggers\" are met. Specifically, the DHS Secretary would have been required to certify that four benchmarks have been reached: (1) the Comprehensive Southern Border Security Strategy has been submitted and is \"substantially deployed and substantially operational\"; (2) the Southern Border Fencing Strategy has been submitted and implemented and is \"substantially completed\"; (3) DHS has implemented a mandatory employment verification system to be used by all employers (see \"Interior Enforcement\"); and (4) an electronic exit system to collect machine readable data is being used at air and sea ports of entry (see \" Entry-Exit System \").", "The bill as reported also described an exception to these trigger provisions. If 10 years have elapsed since the bill's enactment and these benchmarks have not been met due to litigation, a Supreme Court ruling that implementation is unconstitutional, or a \"force majeure,\" the Secretary shall permit RPIs to apply for LPR status. It is not clear, however, whether allowing such applications under this condition means that DHS would be permitted to adjust applicants to LPR status, or whether the previous sub-paragraph would prevent DHS from completing such adjustments until the benchmarks are met.", "These triggers would not have appl ied to adjustment of status for certain aliens who entered the United States as children (i.e., DREAMers) under Section 2103 of the bill or for aliens granted agricultural \"blue card\" status under Section 2201 of the bill.

The standard removal process, described in INA Section 240, is a civil administrative proceeding before an immigration judge from the DOJ Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). In some cases, immigration judges may grant certain forms of relief during the removal process, though their discretion is limited with respect to certain grounds for removal.

Some also have expressed concern that, because removal is a civil proceeding, aliens are not guaranteed legal counsel (though aliens do have a right to counsel at no expense of the government), and some aliens may not be competent to represent themselves.", "S. 744 apparently seeks to address these concerns, and generally to ensure that aliens in removal proceedings have adequate opportunities to seek relief. The bill would increase the number of immigration judges by 75 per year for FY2014 through FY2016, and would also increase the number of immigration staff attorneys, paralegals, and Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) staff attorneys. S. 744 would also provide statutory authority for the BIA (currently established through regulations); codify certain standards for immigration judge and BIA decisions; require EOIR to review and improve training programs for immigration judges, BIA members, and their staffs; and require EOIR to ensure adequate resources and services during immigration proceedings. Funding would be appropriated from the CIR Trust Fund to support the new personnel increases, training, and technology.", "Funding also would be appropriated for a pair of programs to enhance aliens' representation during removal proceedings. The Attorney General (AG) would be authorized to provide counsel to aliens in such proceedings at the AG's sole and unreviewable discretion. And the AG would be required to provide counsel, at government expense if necessary, for unaccompanied alien children, persons determined to be legally incompetent due to a serious mental disability, and certain other vulnerable persons. The AG also would be required to maintain an Office of Legal Access Programs within EOIR. The Office would develop legal orientation programs to educate alien detainees and other aliens in removal and asylum proceedings about their rights and to improve access to counsel, including in some cases at government expense. The AG also would assume responsibility, pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-457 ), for providing access to legal representation and appointing independent child advocates to child trafficking victims.

The bill also would make three or more convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) a ground for deportability and inadmissibility A third such conviction would be made an aggravated felony for immigration purposes, and therefore such an alien would be subject to more limited relief from removal. Certain types of immigration-related fraud also would be made grounds for deportability and inadmissibility. And S. 744 would make crimes involving domestic violence, stalking, and child abuse, along with violations of protection orders, grounds for inadmissibility (though these new grounds generally would be more narrow than corresponding grounds of deportability found in current law). As noted elsewhere, withholding information for biometric screening also would be made a ground for inadmissibility (see \" Entry-Exit System \").", "The bill also would expand the grounds for inadmissibility related to torture and extrajudicial killings, and would add war crimes and widespread human rights violations as inadmissibility grounds, though these added grounds would not apply when the acts were committed under duress). The President would be authorized to release the names of persons deemed inadmissible on these grounds. Moreover, the bill would amend the Torture Victims Protection Act to reference some of these added grounds in defining the scope of conduct for which covered entities be held civilly liable. The bill would clarify that sexual abuse of minor is an aggravated felony for immigration purposes regardless of whether the victim's age is established by extrinsic evidence to the record of conviction.

It would strike \"extreme\" from the hardship waiver for the 3- and 10-year bars for aliens who have been illegally present in the United States if they are parents of U.S. citizens or LPRs. And it would give immigration judges discretion to not order certain aliens in proceedings to be removed, deported, or excluded if the judge determined that such actions were against the public interest, would create a hardship to the alien's U.S. citizen or permanent resident immediate relatives, or if the alien appeared eligible for naturalization. This waiver would not be available to individuals subject to removal or inadmissibility based on certain criminal and national security grounds. DHS would have similar discretion to waive grounds of inadmissibility.

This principle is embodied in several provisions of the INA, most notably in provisions defining refugees and asylees. Refugees are aliens displaced abroad who are unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or, under certain conditions, who are in their home country and have a well-founded fear of persecution on one of these grounds. Refugees are processed and admitted to the United States from abroad.", "Foreign nationals also may claim asylum in the United States if they demonstrate a well-founded fear that if returned home, they will be persecuted based upon one of these same five characteristics. Foreign nationals arriving or present in the United States may apply for asylum affirmatively with USCIS after arrival into the country, or they may seek asylum defensively before an immigration judge during removal proceedings.", "S. 744 would increase the flexibility of these asylum and refugee provisions several ways, potentially rolling back some of the changes made by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-208 ). S. 744 would repeal a current provision that requires asylum claims to be filed within one year of an alien's arrival in the United States, and would provide for the reconsideration of certain asylum claims that were denied because of the failure to file within one year. The bill also would authorize the spouse or child of a refugee or asylee who is admitted to the United States to bring his or her own accompanying child, also under a refugee or asylum visa. With respect to aliens found to have a credible fear of persecution based on an interview with a USCIS asylum officer during expedited removal, the asylum officer would be authorized to grant asylum under certain circumstances, rather than referring the alien to an immigration judge. And the bill would require that DHS issue work authorization to asylum applicants after 180 days.", "A new category of \"stateless persons\" would be defined, and such persons would be permitted to apply for conditional lawful status under certain conditions, and to adjust to LPR status after one year, as special immigrants under the employment-based preference category.

In addition, the president, based on a recommendation by DOS, would be authorized to designate certain high-need groups as refugees, facilitating their admission as a refugee. S. 744 would establish requirements for overseas refugee adjudications, including the right to legal counsel (not at government expense), a written record of the decision, and administrative review of a denial.", "S. 744 also includes provisions that would tighten refugee and asylum laws and would be especially aimed at national security concerns. Pursuant to Section 3411 an alien granted refugee or asylum status who returns to the alien's country of nationality or habitual residence would have his or her status terminated unless the DHS Secretary determines that the alien returned for good cause, or unless the alien is eligible to adjust to LPR status pursuant to the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-732).

The status would be granted under the same provisions as the principal alien, for the longer of either three years or the same admission period of the principal alien.

DHS could adjust the status of the abused derivative alien to LPR status if: (1) he or she either meets the admissibility criteria under INA Section 212(a) or DHS can justify his or her presence on humanitarian or public interest grounds or to ensure family unity; and (2) the status under which the principal nonimmigrant was admitted to the United States would have potentially allowed for eventual adjustment of status.
