After running modest profits from FY2003 through FY2006, the USPS lost $45.6 billion between FY2007 and FY2013. Since FY2011, the USPS has defaulted on $22.4 billion in payments to its Retiree Health Benefits Fund (RHBF). The agency reached its $15 billion borrowing limit in FY2012 and has not reduced total debt since that time. In October 2012, the USPS bolstered its liquidity by withdrawing all of the cash from its competitive products fund. This fund has not been replenished.", "While the revenues for the USPS increased in FY2014, expenses have also risen. Compared with FY2013, expenses for FY2014 were $1.1 billion higher while revenues have increased by $500 million.", "The USPS's recent financial difficulties are partially the product of reduced demand. The agency has experienced a 36.3% drop in mail volume during the past 10 years. Additionally, during the past decade the \"mail mix\" has shifted. A growing portion of the mail is advertising mail, which yields low profits. Concurrently, the annual volume of first-class letters, which are highly profitable, has been dropping steadily, at least in part due to mailers shifting to electronic communications. As a result, the Postal Service's revenues in FY2014 were lower than they were in FY2005. Additionally, the Postal Service's liquidity has decreased and its debt has increased since FY2006, partially as a result of the statutorily mandated payments to the RHBF that were made between FY2007 and FY2010. The USPS has not had sufficient liquidity to make the payments since FY2011.", "This report discusses these issues in more detail, and includes financial results through the end of FY2014.

Members of Congress were involved in many aspects of the USPOD's operations, including the selection of managers (e.g., postmasters) and the pricing of postal services.

Of the $8.4 billion expense increase, nearly all of it resulted from the PAEA's RHBF funding requirements.

The non-RHBF deficits since FY2009 total $13.6 billion, an amount nearly equal to the USPS's total borrowing authority.

Competitive products and services are those for which a competitive market exists (e.g., overnight parcel delivery). ", "The USPS may annually raise the rates of products in the market-dominant class by no more than the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The USPS has greater freedom to price competitive products. In January 2014, the USPS raised rates by 1.7% on market-dominant products and services, and an average of 2.4% for competitive products. In addition, the Postal Regulatory Commission approved a 4.3% temporary surcharge on market-dominant products for a limited amount of time. This increase is currently being litigated in federal court following an appeal by the USPS, which believes the increase should not be limited for a specific amount of time.

Despite the revenue growth in FY2013 and FY2014, the USPS's annual revenue remained lower than its revenue 10 years earlier.

In June 2014, the Postal Service announced that a second phase of mail processing realignments would begin in January 2015, culminating in a consolidation impacting up to 82 more processing operations. Additionally, the Postal Service continues to leverage employee attrition, Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) and utilization of non-career employees to the maximum extent permitted by its labor contracts.
