(137)", "A National Academy of Sciences report, entitled Biotechnology Research in an Age of Terrorism: Confronting the \"Dual Use\" Dilemma , published in 2003 and dubbed the \"Fink\" reportfor its chairman, called for greater self-regulation by scientists, using institutional biosafetycommittees at academic and research institutions, for research that could possibly aid terrorists. Italso urged creation of a new federal National Science Advisory Board for Biodefense to provideguidance to nongovernmental researchers. But it did not propose government control of suchresearch.

Shortly after publication on July 1, 2002, in Science magazine online, of acontroversial scientific paper that described the synthesis of an infectious polio virus from mail ordercomponents, Congressman Weldon introduced H.Res. 514 (107th Congress). Itexpressed \"serious concern\" about the paper, which was funded by the Defense Advanced ResearchProjects Agency (DARPA), and called for tighter controls on the publication of certain scientificresearch.

Other agencies haveexpanded the definition of sensitive in various ways, with some agencies including informationexempt from release under FOIA and others including other kinds of information determined to besensitive to a particular agency's activities. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,the Administration instructed agencies to withhold more information when undertaking discretionarydisclosure deliberations under FOIA. Agencies were instructed to balance access to informationwith the needs to protect critical infrastructure information, national security, law enforcementeffectiveness, agency deliberations and decision-making, and related values and interests, and to usespecifically FOIA exemptions 2 and 4. When making such deliberations, they were also told toconsider, on a case by case basis, \"benefits that result from the open and efficient exchange ofscientific, technical, and like information.\" ", "These actions have raised significant policy issues, such as allegations that the terms sensitive and SBU are ambiguous because they are subject to agency interpretation. This, some say, makesit difficult to identify and safeguard such information, while raising questions about the need foruniformity in standards. Some say expanded interpretation of FOIA exemptions 2 and 4 to identifySBU divides those who want increased security of information from those who want public accessto the information now exempted in order to protect public and community oversight, civil liberties,and accountability, to promote the conduct of science, or to monitor private sector activities. Theprocedures mandated in P.L. 107-296 are intended to guide agencies toward the use of similar procedures to identify, share, and safeguard sensitive but unclassifed homeland security information. As will be discussed below, there has been considerable debate about this content of these proposedguidelines. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Controversy About \"Sensitive But Unclassified\"", "paragraphs": ["Even before the terrorist attacks of 2001, there had been considerable controversy about the meaning and use of the term SBU. One position is that agencies should interpret the term morebroadly to categorize and safeguard more information as SBU; alternatively, others say that thiscategory is often imprecise and leads to indiscriminate withholding of information from the public. ", "For instance, a February 28, 1994 report, Redefining Security , by the Joint Security Commission prepared for the Director of the CIA and the Secretary of Defense, which according to the Federationof American Scientists (FAS) \"was the first significant post-cold war examination of governmentsecurity policies and practices,\" (142) estimatedthat as much as 75% of all government-held informationmay be sensitive and unclassified. It recommended that more attention should be paid to protectingsuch information and labeling it as SBU within the defense, intelligence and other sectors ofgovernment as well as \"... information that, while neither classified nor government-held, is crucialto U.S. security in its broadest sense.\" Continuing, it said, ", "We have in mind information about, and contained in, our air traffic control system, the social security system, the banking, credit, and stock marketsystems, the telephone and communications networks, and the power grids and pipeline networks. All of these are highly automated systems that require appropriate security measures to protectconfidentiality, integrity and availability.\" (143)", "In a contrasting position, the aforementioned Moynihan commission report, entitled Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, 1997 , noted that agencies oftenuse different types of mandates to justify protecting unclassified information and these range fromthe very broad to specific. This causes problems because ", "\"... [V]irtually any agency employee can decide which information is to be so regulated;\" there is no oversight of this categorization and agencies controlaccess \"though a need-to know process,\" and \"... the very lack of consistency from one agency toanother contributes to confusion about why this information is to be protected and how it is to behandled. These designations sometimes are mistaken for a fourth classification levels, causingunclassified information with these markings to be treated like classifiedinformation.\" (144)", "As a result, the Commission concluded that more information is protected than is warranted. ", "An attempt had been made in December 1994, the report said, to develop a policy to address sensitive but unclassified information, but it \"met with great resistance by both the civilian side ofthe Government and industry\" because the process was controlled by the Security Policy Board,which dealt largely with classified information and was controlled by the defense and intelligencecommunity. (145) The report also found thatoverzealous labeling of information as SBU could beavoided if more attention were devoted to improving the security of governmentcomputer-information systems (146) to preventunauthorized access.", "Critiquing the wide scope of the current DOE definition of SBU (see above under the section, \"Department of Energy\"), a Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) commissiondealing with DOE laboratories reported in 2002:", "The Department's official definition is so broad as to be unusable. ...There is no ... common understanding of how to control ... [SBU] ..., no meaningfulway to control it that is consistent with its level of sensitivity, and no agreement on what significanceit has for U.S. national security. Sensitive unclassified information is causing acute problems atDOE. ... Security professionals find it difficult to design clear standards for protection. Scientistsfeel vulnerable to violating rules on categories that are ill defined. Without clear definition orstandards for protection, those who oversee implementation for the Department find it extremelydifficult to measure laboratory performance.", "... Yet the Department tends to treat this information as if subject to security measures not unlike those for classified information. It is considered whendeveloping background checks for foreign visitors and when reviewing presentations that mayinvolve sensitive unclassified information. ", "... The lack of management discipline around sensitive unclassified information both hinders the scientific enterprise and reduces the ability of security andcounterintelligence professionals to control information wherenecessary. (147)", "The CSIS commission recommended that DOE avoid using the definition and label \"SBU.\" \"By avoiding these labels,\" it said, \"the Department can depart from treating unclassified informationas if subject to national security controls. The Department should have just three classes ofinformation: (1) classified; (2) unclassified but subject to administrative controls; and (3)unclassified, publicly releasable.\" (148) DOEshould also avoid use of a sensitive subjects list or changeits name, since the list deals primarily with items and technology potentially subject to exportcontrol. (149) \"If information is not classified butrequires administrative control,\" DOE shouldconsider using \"the category of information designated official use only (OUO)....\" \"A single officewithin DOE administers OUO, which has guidelines established in law and unclassified informationcould be reviewed for applicability under the OUO statutes. Existing statutes governing certain typesof sensitive unclassified information could remain unchanged and distinct from OUO (i.e.unclassified but controlled nuclear information [UCNI]), as long as they provide sufficiently clearguidelines for control.\" (150)", "During the 107th Congress, congressional interest in this topic was reflected in a recommendation made by the congressional Joint Inquiry Into September 11, which among otherthings recommended a review encompassing the concepts of sensitive or classified information: ", "Congress should also review the statutes, policies and procedures that govern the national security classification of intelligence information and itsprotection from unauthorized disclosure. Among other matters, Congress should consider the degreeto which excessive classification has been used in the past and the extent to which the emergingthreat environment has greatly increased the need for real-time sharing of sensitive information. TheDirector of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary ofState, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Attorney General, should review and report tothe House and Senate Intelligence Committees on proposals for a new and more realistic approachto the processes and structures that have governed the designation of sensitive and classifiedinformation. The report should include proposals to protect against the use of the classificationprocess as a shield to protect agency self-interest.

It has been argued that \"Several of the newrestrictions on information are not congruent with the existing legal framework defined by theFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) or with the executive order [Executive Order 12598] thatgoverns National Security classification and declassification.\" (152) Some have questioned the authorityof national security directives pertaining to \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information or say thatwhere Congress has statutorily prescribed policy contrary to information management policyprescribed in presidential directives or agency regulations, the supremacy of statutory law wouldseemingly prevail. One critic of the March 2002 White House memo cautioned that the term\"sensitive but unclassified\" may be \"the most dangerous level of secrecy, because it was not defined[in the past] and there were no channels of appeal.\" (153) Similarly, others say that \"... no administrativemechanisms have been developed to allow those who disagree with the decision to withholdinformation to challenge the decision or to seek some remedy to the decision.

Yet these critics share the goal of trying to keeppotential terrorists from obtaining information that could be used to threaten the United States. Some have called for closer cooperation between the scientific and intelligence community to draftguidelines relating to safeguarding scientific information that might be useful to potentialterrorists. (155) These conflicting objectives raiseperplexing dilemmas for policymakers and scientistsalike. Policy options discussed below focus on several parts of this debate, including establishinguniformity in definitions and implementing guidelines; establishing an appeals process for SBUinformation; and the potential to classify or label as SBU more research information.", "Considerations Related to a Uniform Definition of SBU. Since agencies define the term SBU differently, various interpretations couldlead to the possibility that information that should not be released to the public because of itspotential value to terrorists might be released; that agencies might not release SBU information toother agencies, or to state or local officials; or that the public may be denied access to informationwhose release might be permitted. Questions about ambiguities in the definition of the term SBUmay raise interest about legislating, or overseeing the process of developing, uniform criteria forSBU, especially since, in P.L. 107-296 , Congress encouraged nonfederal first responders tosafeguard such information via nondisclosure agreements. (156)", "In order help set standards for SBU and SHSI, and to resolve policy dilemmas surrounding definitions and procedural controls, after release of the Card memorandum in March 2002, the WhiteHouse Office of Homeland Security was reported to have drafted a definition for SHSI, (157) and that\"originally, there was an initiative to issue a Presidential Directive on unclassified but HomelandSecurity-sensitive information.\" (158) This wasnever publically released, but several agencies,including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, utilized it when developing criteria to define SHSIas discussed in the Card and Ashcroft memos. (159) Subsequently the Office of Homeland Securityasked the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the Office ofManagement and Budget to develop guidance, which had been expected to be released in 2002 or2003. An objective of the proposed guidance was to withhold information from persons who shouldnot have access to it, but to allow such information to be shared with those who might have a needfor it, such as law enforcement and emergency response personnel. (160)", "OMB and OSTP met with stakeholder groups, including academics and scientists, to obtain their views about how to develop guidance. (161) During a meeting held in late August 2002, withacademic and scientific officials and others discussing the March 2002 memos, their implementation,and definitions, \"[a]cademic and scientific representatives ... argued [that] basic and appliedresearch, even research performed by the government, should not be subject to [sensitive butunclassified homeland security information] SHSI guidelines and advocated following existing rulesfor the handling of sensitive information, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) guidance for the handling of select agents.\" (162) Academic officials reportedly left the meetingconvinced that the March memo applied only to \"information that was generated and owned by thegovernment, and not university research,\" nor to university research funded by federal governmentgrants. (163) During hearings on ConductingResearch During the War on Terrorism: BalancingOpenness and Security, held by the House Science Committee on October 10, 2002, White HouseOffice of Science and Technology (OSTP) Director John Marburger testified that the Administrationwants \"to ensure an open scientific environment\" while maintaining homeland security. He saidSHSI would apply to federal intelligence, law enforcement and public health information thatgenerally is not made public, but would not necessarily include research results. (164) Several otherwitnesses endorsed this position. ", "According to OSTP Director Marburger, SBU information related to homeland security \"... may be withheld from public disclosure only when it warrants protection under one of the nineexceptions of the Freedom of Information Act.\" (165) The relationship between FOIA and theAdministration's homeland security information policies was the theme of a conference held by theDepartment of Justice's Office of Information and Privacy for FOIA officers during June 25, 2004. (166) The topics of the meeting were summarized in a FOIA Post article, but the discussion summarieswere not released to the public.", "Despite many meetings in 2002 and 2003 with various stakeholders and apparent attempts to draft policy, no SBU or SHSI policy guidance was issued. ", "Before July 2003, the OMB/OSTP guidance had been expected to constitute the President's instructions to federal agencies to \"prescribe and implement procedures\" to \"identify and safeguardsensitive homeland security information that is sensitive but unclassified,\" and to share thisinformation with other federal agencies and appropriate State and local personnel, as required bysection 892 (a) (1) (A)(B) of P.L. 107-296 . The Secretary of DHS was assigned these functionspursuant to Executive Order 13311, July 29, 2003 and the DHS Office of General Counsel was,reportedly, developing the guidelines mandated by P.L. 107-296 . It is not known which perspectiveswill be used in guidance to federal agencies -- the limited definition of sensitive as in the ComputerSecurity Act of 1987, the more expansive, but somewhat limited, conceptualization of SBU in theCard memorandum and attachments, or the broader conceptualization of SBU used by theDepartment of Energy. It is expected that the definition will extend beyond SHSI per se , that is,beyond information not routinely released to the public, such as law enforcement data, personnelinformation, and information on computer vulnerabilities, to include also a conceptualization of SBUinformation that could extend to some kinds of scientific and technical data.", "Some have speculated that the delay in issuing guidance is due to disagreement about whether there should be public comment -- which might involve discussions raised by critics relating toensuring allowing public access to information that could be used to continue to permit public andcommunity oversight of governmental and industrial activities. Another concern that might be raisedby the public in commenting on proposed regulations could focus on penalties for violatingnondisclosure agreements that might affect unsuspecting recipients of SBU information. (167) Otherssay the delay \"... may be ... a recognition of the voluntary restraints the academic community hasimposed on itself,\" referring specifically to professional groups' activities in support of voluntaryself-restraint (168) for sensitive scientificinformation. Although the law does not require publiccomment, an OMB official (169) and a Departmentof Justice release had said that SHSI guidance wouldbe subject to public notice comment before the regulation was implemented. (170) It is not clearwhether the Department of Homeland Security will seek public comment now that it has been givenresponsibility to draft the regulations. (171) Over75 public groups, \"representing journalists, scientists,librarians, environmental groups, privacy advocates, and others\" wrote to DHS Secretary in August2003, urging that he allow public input on procedures to be prescribed and implemented foridentifying, safeguarding, and sharing the sensitive but unclassified homeland security informationreferenced in section 892. (172)", "Factors Agencies Might Use in Developing Nondisclosure Policyfor SBU Information. The Card and Ashcroft memos, together with section 892of P.L. 107-296 , have given agencies a basis to make decisions about restricting access to certainelectronic and hard copy information that previously may have been accessible to the public, butwhose continued distribution might be detrimental to homeland security. But it is unclear whatconceptualizations agencies and the DHS guidance will use. As noted above, agencies havediscretion to identify and withhold from the public, as sensitive or as sensitive but unclassified,information which they determine is subject to nondisclosure (pursuant to both the ComputerSecurity Act of 1987 and the Administration's interpretation of FOIA). Since the basis of thesedeterminations is subject to interpretation, both agency program managers and the public who mightseek access to such information may confront ambiguity in definitions and different kinds ofbalancing tests. There are questions about the uniformity of definitions used by different agenciesand which values or objectives should be encompassed in a risk analysis on which suchnondisclosure determinations might be based. ", "The definition of what information is SBU, at a minimum, is likely to encompass concepts that are defined as sensitive in the Computer Security Act 1987, that is to protect information whosedisclosure \"could adversely affect the national interest or the conduct of Federal programs, or theprivacy to which individuals are entitled under ... the Privacy Act.\" Also, it may encompass theNIST criteria for sensitive information protection: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. (173) Additionally, among the topics the Administration instructed agencies to consider when making\"discretionary disclosures\" of SBU homeland security-related information that could be exempt fromFOIA is the \"need to protect critical systems, facilities, stockpiles, and other assets from securitybreaches and harm -- and in some instances from their potential use as weapons of massdestruction in and of themselves.\" (174) TheAdministration also stressed that agencies, when applyingexemption 2, should consider the needs for an informed citizenry to ensure accountability,\"safeguarding our national security, enhancing the effectiveness of our law enforcement agencies,protecting sensitive business information, and not least preserving personal privacy.\" (175) Also to beconsidered were \" ... benefits that result from the open and efficient exchange of scientific, technical,and like information.\" Criteria for sensitive but unclassified SHSI also are likely to reference thetypes of information P.L. 107-296 identifies as \"homeland security information\" -- \"any informationpossessed by a Federal, state, or local agency that -- relates to the threat of terrorist activity; relatesto the ability to prevent, interdict, or disrupt terrorist activity; would improve the identification orinvestigation of a suspected terrorist or terrorist organization, or would improve the response to aterrorist act\" (Sec. 892 (f)).", "Because of the difficulty of balancing the needs for information with security, some critics of the White House March 2002 memo have focused on the need for developing guiding principles. According to Steven Aftergood and Henry Kelly, \"In deciding how to treat such information, theadministration should enunciate a clear set of principles, as well as an equitable procedure forimplementing them and appealing adverse decisions,\" with the appeals procedure \"outside theoriginating agency.\" (176) They said that \"Theguiding principles could be formulated as a set ofquestions, such as:", "Is the information otherwise available in public domain? (Or can it be readily deduced from first principles?) If the answer is yes, then there is no valid reasonto withhold it, and doing so would undercut the credibility of official information policy.", "Is there specific reason to believe the information could be used by terrorists? Are there countervailing considerations that would militate in favor ofdisclosure, i.e., could it be used for beneficial purposes? Documents that describe in detail howanthrax spores could be milled and coated so as to maximize their dissemination presumptively posea threat to national security and should be withdrawn from the public domain. But not everydocument that has the word \"anthrax\" in the title is sensitive. And even documents that are in someways sensitive might nevertheless serve to inform medical research and emergency planning andmight therefore be properly disclosed. ", "Is there specific reason to believe the information should be public knowledge? It is in the nature of our political system that it functions in response to publicconcern and controversy. Environmental hazards, defective products, and risky corporate practicesonly tend to find their solution, if at all, following a thorough public airing. Withholdingcontroversial information from the public means short-circuiting the political process, and riskinga net loss in security.", "Given the contending values and factors that affect a workable definition and implementing rules, Congress may monitor the guidance that DHS develops to assist agencies in identifyingsensitive homeland security information and SBU. Because of the potential implications of theforthcoming DHS concepts for private scientific publications policy, various constituencies andscientific groups will undoubtedly seek to examine the balance between security and access toinformation in these guidelines.", "The Potential to Classify More Research Information. Several activities have occurred that might increase the amount ofscientific research information that is classified. As noted above, NSDD 189 and Executive Order12958 both prohibit classification of certain kinds of federal scientific research information exceptfor reasons of national security. NSDD 189 deals with basic research and Executive Order 12958applies the prohibition to fundamental, or what it defines as basic and applied, research. During2001 and 2002, the heads of several federal agencies with substantial research responsibilities, whodid not have classification authority under Executive Order 12958, the prevailing executive orderon classifying information, (177) were givenoriginal classification authority. These include theSecretaries of Health and Human Services (178) and of Agriculture, (179) and also theAdministrator of theEnvironmental Protection Agency. (180) Someof the agencies with new classification authority,especially Health and Human Services and Agriculture, support substantial amounts ofcounterterrorism research, as well as of fundamental research in a variety of scientific and technicalareas, often performed on an extramural basis by researchers in colleges and universities. (181)", "New Executive Order 13292, issued on March 25, 2003, amends Executive Order 12958 on classified national security information. The amendment permits classification of \"scientific,technological, or economic matters relating to the national security, which includes defense againsttransnational terrorism \" (new clause in italics, sec. 1.4 (e)). The amendment appears to highlightthat national security-related scientific, technological, and economic information dealing withdefense against international terrorism may be classified. Given that the definition of \"nationalsecurity,\" in the two executive orders is not changed and that definition could have encompassedmatters related to transnational terrorism, it is unclear if the amended order widens the scope ofscientific, technological, and economic information to be classified. (182)", "In addition, the Department of Defense reportedly plans to reissue its guidelines relating to pre-publication review of extramural research that it funds outside of its own laboratories. Recentlyseveral university groups wrote a letter to the Director of the Office of Science and TechnologyPolicy complaining that more agency program officials are inserting pre-publication review clausesinto contracts, including for fundamental research, without explanation as to their justification. Thishas a \"pernicious effects,\" they said, \"not only with regard to the freedom to publish but also withregard to employment of foreign-born students and researchers on federally funded research projects. If the contract clauses require blanket screening of any and all foreign-born scientists, universitieswill object.\" (183)", "Agencies which were given original classification authority in the last few years are now developing implementing guidelines and appointing security officers in operating units. Given thelong-standing federal policy embodied in Executive Order 12598 and in NSDD 189 of notclassifying basic scientific research, except if release would threaten national security, the balancebetween science and security in agency guidelines will remain a topic of interest and concern. Interest in this topic may be heightened because of the recent changes made in Executive Order13292 to the definition of the kinds of scientific, technological, and economic information that maybe classified.", "The scientific and academic communities are expected to pay close attention to these issues. Among the questions that may be raised are: ", "Will new controls be placed on federally funded research, including both intramural research conducted in an agency's laboratories, and on extramural research, that mightbe federally funded but conducted in nonfederal academic and industrial research laboratories?", "Will controls encompass both classification levels and use of designations such as sensitive and sensitive but unclassified?", "Will designation of a controlled research project be made before the award offunds and the start of a project, or after a project is completed and during a pre-publication reviewphase?", "What kinds of requirements will be placed upon nonfederal researchers tosafeguard research information?", "How will such controls affect the conduct of academic research for the federalgovernment? ", "How will such controls differ from the controls on proprietary researchinformation that are deemed acceptable by most academic institutions eager to receive financialsupport from industry?", "Will research agencies with original classification authority modify theirlong-standing policies of encouraging publication and dissemination of federally funded researchresults?", "Under the expanded definition of scientific and technological informationsubject to classification in Executive Order 13292, will agencies classify information that might haveotherwise been categorized as SBU?", "Appeals Process for SBU Information. Anothercontinuing issue is expected to be an appeals process for designating information as SBU. StephenAftergood, with the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), suggested that \" ... An appeals panelthat is outside of the originating agency and that therefore does not have [the] same bureaucraticinterests at stake would significantly enhance the credibility of the deliberative process. The efficacyof such an appeals process has been repeatedly demonstrated by an executive branch body called theInteragency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP).\" (184) Another suggested approach is that\"To solve disputes that develop out of the new category of 'sensitive but unclassified' information,one could allow the Information Security Oversight Office (a part of the Executive Branch) toreceive appeals to review disputes and challenges to executive agency decisions regarding the releaseof documents and reports The Office would oversee the appeals, it would have another set of eyesthat would examine the requested information and review it in a different context that the executiveagency. The ISOO might be able to work with both the agency involved and those requesting theinformation to reach a compromise that everyone could accept. It would also have the effect ofkeeping the oversight of the information in the hands of the executive branch.\" (185)", "Determination of \"Tiered\" Access to SBU Information. Some agencies have discussed developing procedures to permit\"tiered,\" or selective, access to qualified and pre-screened individuals for some scientific andtechnical information, that could be categorized as SBU or SHSI. Reportedly, EPA requiresresearchers to obtain sponsorship from a senior EPA official, have their requests approved inadvance and register before using the Envirofacts database. (186) EPA also has issued instructions toutilities to submit threat or vulnerability assessments to the agency. Using a protocol issued inDecember 2002, reportedly, EPA \"... will keep sensitive information in the assessments secure. Thedocuments will be kept in one location under lock and only individuals designated by EPA will haveaccess to them.\" (187) EPA also will release otheragency information to selected individuals only inhard copy at EPA offices and libraries throughout the nation. (188) The Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) issued a final rule, effective April 2, 2003, which limits release of its criticalenergy infrastructure information on a selective or \"tiered\" basis to members of the public based ontheir need to know and the legitimacy of their need as determined by the Commission. (189) FERC saidit would not alter its responsibilities under FOIA, but appears to be broadening, or at a minimum,reinterpreting implementation of exemptions to disclosure under FOIA. (190) The U.S. GeologicalSurvey has announced that it will implement four levels of control for its information products:", "a. No sensitivity is determined. No restriction is required. b. Product is determined to be sensitive. Do not distribute. c. Sensitivity has beendetermined for a previously distributed product that is widely available. Withdrawal would beineffective. Continue distribution of current version. Restrict distribution of new features to updatesfor l year. d. Product is restricted according to directive from another agency with specific authorityfor public safety or national security. (191)", "The equity of procedures for \"tiered\" or selective access; the need to create public and or private panels to examine controls on the release of some information; and the need to clarify relationshipsbetween the private sector and the government with respect to safeguarding information in scientificpublications to protect the public interest are issues which may be raised in the legislative context.

Atomic Energy Act of 1946, Congress established a special category of information called \"Restricted Data.\" Restricted Data was definedto encompass \"all data concerning the manufacture or utilization of atomic weapons, the productionof fissionable material, or the use of fissionable material in the production of power.\" (193) Thus, byoperation of law, nearly all atomic (nuclear) energy information fell within the definition of RD. TheAtomic Energy Act authorized the AEC to control the dissemination of RD, specifying as aprerequisite to access to this information that an individual must have a security clearance....", "... Two particularly unique and significant aspects ofRD warrant emphasis. First, a positive action is not required to put information into the RD category.If information falls within the Act's definition of RD, it is in this category from the moment of itsorigination; that is, it is \"born classified.\" The government has no power to determine thatinformation is RD ... only the power to declassify RD.

The Act defines RD andprescribes very strict methods for its control without stating that it is \"classified\" information. However, the Act does describe declassification of RD; therefore, by implication, RD is \"classified.\" A second unique aspect of RD is that information does not have to be owned or controlled by thegovernment to be classified as RD. ... The circumstance could even arise in which an individualcould originate RD and then not be allowed to possess it because of lack of security clearance or\"need to know.\" The Atomic Energy Act does not forbid an individual to generate RD, but, onceRD is generated, the Act prohibits its communication to persons not authorized to receive it.", "In 1951, Congress amended the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to make certain atomic energy information available to other countries for purposes of weapons development, but the NationalSecurity Council had to approve these information flows. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 amendedthe 1946 act to include \"an increased emphasis on wider dissemination of atomic energy information,to make more of it accessible to U.S. industry and to the world in order to permit the developmentof nuclear reactors for commercial production of electric power ... as a consequence of PresidentEisenhower's [1953] Atoms For Peace initiative ....\" The Quist document says: ", "With respect to the control of information, the 1954 Act stated: ", "\"It shall be the policy of the Commission to control thedissemination and declassification of Restricted Data in such a manner as to assure the commondefense and security. Consistent with such policy the Commission shall be guided by the followingprinciples: (a) Until effective and enforceable international safeguards against the use of atomicenergy for destructive purposes have been established by an international arrangement, there shallbe no exchange of Restricted Data with other nations except as authorized by section 2164 of thistitle; and (b) The dissemination of scientific and technical information relating to atomic energyshould be permitted and encouraged so as to provide that free interchange of ideas and criticismwhich is essential to scientific and industrial progress and public understanding and to enlarge thefund of technical information. ...[42 U.S.C. sec. 2161.]\"", "... The 1954 Actadded \"industrial progress,\" \"public understanding,\" and \"enlarge the fund of technical information\"as reasons to disseminate atomic energy information. Those additions provided the basis for thesubsequent declassification or downgrading of much atomic energyinformation.", "... The 1946 Act had permitted declassification of RDonly when the AEC determined that it could be published without \"adversely affecting the commondefense and security .... The 1954 Act changed \"adversely affecting\" to \"undue risk,\" therebyshifting the balancing test towards declassification of more information .... The increased emphasisof the 1954 Act in disseminating atomic energy information is further exemplified by a continuousreview requirement...: ", "... Prior to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, privatepersons could not have access to RD for commercial purposes (e.g., development of commercialnuclear power reactors). The only reason for allowing private persons to have access to such datawas on a need-to- know basis, in connection with national defense work. Although the 1954 Actenvisioned the commercial development of nuclear energy, the Act contained no express provisionspermitting access to RD for commercial purposes. This hurdle was overcome in 1956 when the AECused its administrative powers to establish an Access Permit Program ... Under this program, apermitted is able to have access to RD \"applicable to civil uses of atomic energy for use in hisbusiness, trade or profession.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix 2.
