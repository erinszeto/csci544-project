In the 113 th Congress, these provisions were extended as part of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-295 ), signed into law on December 19, 2014. This law made most tax provisions that had expired at the end of 2013 available to taxpayers for the 2014 tax year.

A complete list of these provisions, along with a notation of their status as permanent, extended through 2019, or extended through 2016, can be found in Table 1 . Note that bonus depreciation, which allows a deduction of 50% of equipment investment, would be reduced to 40% in 2018 and 30% in 2019, before expiring. ", "The Consolidated Appropriations Act's extenders provisions cost $628.8 billion over FY2016-2025. It includes as \"extenders\" provisions liberalizing the child credit, education credits, and the earned income tax credit that have not yet expired and had not been included in the previous version of the \"extenders\" bill ( S. 1946 ). If these provisions (accounting for $198.1 billion) plus a small provision temporarily suspending the medical device tax (also not in S. 1946 ) are excluded, the total remaining cost is $426.8 billion. Of that amount, $301.4 billion, or 71%, was due to business-related provisions discussed in this report that were made permanent; $36.1 billion (8.5%) was due to provisions extended through 2019, and $1.4 billion (0.3%) was due to provisions extended through 2016. Overall, of these standard extenders, 79% of the cost was associated with business-related tax provisions discussed in this report. Three provisions made permanent account for 63% of the $426.8 billion total extenders: (1) the research and experimentation credit, accounting for 27%; (2) the small business (Section 179) expensing provision, accounting for 18%; and (3) the deferral of tax on active financing income earned abroad, accounting for 18% of the total. ", "Extending expired tax provisions through 2016, as proposed in S. 1946 , would have cost $96.9 billion over the 10-year budget window, excluding any macroeconomic effects. More than 60% of this cost ($59.5 billion) is from the extension of business-related provisions discussed in this report (see Table 1 ). With macroeconomic effects included, the cost of extending expired provisions, as proposed in S. 1946 , would have been $86.6 billion over the 10-year budget window. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), extending expired provisions affecting businesses, particularly the provision allowing businesses to expense 50% of investments, was expected to increase economic growth in the near term. Thus, the cost estimate when macroeconomic effects are included was less than the cost estimate that does not incorporate macroeconomic effects. Since S. 1946 was projected to increase the federal debt, part of the gain in economic growth from extending expired business-related tax provisions is expected to be offset by higher interest rates, which tend to slow economic growth. ", "Extending expiring provisions retroactively for one year, as was done in the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, cost $41.6 billion over the 10-year budget window. More than half of this cost ($22.3 billion) is from the extension of business-related provisions discussed in this report. The tax extender provision with the largest cost was tax credit for research and experimentation expenditures. The one-year extension enacted late in the 113 th Congress cost $7.6 billion. Table 1 provides information on the revenue cost of the one-year extension enacted as the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.", "In recent years, the House has considered legislation to make permanent certain business-related extender provisions. In the 114 th Congress, America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2015 ( H.R. 636 ), which passed the House on April 13, 2015, would have made Section 179 expensing and the treatment of built-in gains of Subchapter S corporations permanent. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 ( H.R. 880 ), which would have expanded and made permanent the R&E tax credit, was passed in the House on May 20, 2015. The House Committee on Ways and Means had also reported other legislation that would have made certain business-related extenders provisions permanent. Specifically, H.R. 961 would have permanently extended the Subpart F exemption for active financing income and H.R. 1430 would have made permanent the look-through treatment of payments between related controlled foreign corporations. The House Committee on Ways and Means had also approved, in the 114 th Congress, legislation that would have modified and made permanent bonus depreciation ( H.R. 2510 ) and provisions allowing for 15-year straight-line cost recovery for qualified leasehold, restaurant, and retail improvements ( H.R. 765 ). ", "Legislation to make certain business-related extender provisions permanent was also considered in the 113 th Congress. On September 18, 2014, the House passed the Jobs for America Act ( H.R. 4 ), which would have made permanent five of the expired provisions discussed in this report (see Table 1 ). The cost of making permanent these five provisions is $499.3 billion over the 10-year budget window. The total cost estimate for H.R. 4 , which also includes a repeal of the medical device tax and the Save American Workers Act of 2014 ( H.R. 2575 ), was $572.2 billion over the 10-year budget window. ", "During the 113 th Congress, the House Committee on Ways and Means also reported legislation that would have permanently extended two other expiring provisions. H.R. 4429 would have amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend the subpart F exemption for active financing income and H.R. 4464 would have made permanent the look-through treatment of payments between related controlled foreign corporations. These measures did not pass the House.", "The President's FY2016 budget identified several expiring provisions that should be permanently extended (and in some cases substantially modified). Specifically, the provisions addressed in the President's FY2016 budget include (1) the increased expensing for certain businesses under Section 179; (2) the 100% exclusion for qualified small business stock; (3) the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit; and (4) certain employment-related credits (the Work Opportunity Tax Credit [WOTC] and the Indian employment credit). The President's budget also proposed permanently extending the exception under Subpart F for active financing income and the look-through treatment of payments between related controlled foreign corporations (CFCs) as part of a broader reform to the U.S. international tax system.", "For certain cost recovery provisions, the 10-year revenue cost of a permanent extension is substantially greater than the cost of temporarily extending the provision. For example, the revenue cost of temporarily extending bonus depreciation for one year, through 2014, was $1.2 billion. Making bonus depreciation permanent would cost $244.7 billion. This estimate is likely reduced, relative to a stand-alone provision, due to interaction effects with other provisions, most notably Section 179. For example, it was estimated that a permanent extension, as proposed in H.R. 4718 in the 113 th Congress, would have cost $263 billion over 10 years. With a temporary extension, tax liability is deferred, with much of the cost recovered in the later years in the budget window. Even when extended (and phased down) through 2019, as in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2015, the cost of $11.3 billion is less than 5% of the permanent 10-year cost. A similar pattern is observed for the proposed increase in the Section 179 expensing allowances, with a temporary one-year extension having cost an estimated $1.4 billion. A permanent extension, however, would cost $77.1 billion over the 10-year budget window.", "This report does not include provisions that in the past have been classified as charitable, community development, individual, or housing-related provisions.

Since the credit is focused on hiring from targeted groups, and not net job creation, the credit is not necessarily intended to create new jobs or promote recovery in labor markets. Studies evaluating the credit have looked at whether the credit increases job opportunities for targeted disadvantaged individuals, and whether the WOTC is a cost-effective policy measure for achieving this objective. ", "Early evidence on the WOTC suggested that while the credit did offset part of the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training WOTC-eligible employees, it had a limited effect on companies' hiring decisions. More recent studies have found that the WOTC provided benefits to certain groups: increasing the wage income of disabled veterans and increasing employment among long-term welfare recipients, for example. Researchers have also explored whether the credit causes employers to \"churn\" their workforce in order to take advantage of the credit, replacing currently credit-ineligible workers with credit-certified workers.

Eligible small businesses are those with fewer than 50 employees that provide differential wage payments to every qualified employee under a written plan.

Reasons employers may choose to offer differential pay include a show of patriotism or support for troops, or an effort to retain employees after their military duty ends. There is a perception that small businesses may be less able to offer differential pay than larger firms. This provision, by reducing the net cost of providing differential pay for small businesses, should increase the total amount of differential pay being provided by small businesses. If the goal of the provision is to provide income support to National Guard or Reserve members called up to active duty, one might question why the incentive is limited to employers with fewer than 50 employees.", "Not all employees called up to active duty will necessarily be eligible to receive differential pay. Since differential pay is the difference between an individual's civilian salary and military salary, many middle-income individuals will not receive differential pay, as their military salaries are at least equal to their civilian salary. Lower-income individuals usually receive a higher military than civilian salary. Thus, the tax benefit tends to favor employers of middle- to higher-wage earners employed by qualified small businesses. Businesses employing middle- to lower-income wage earners may not have the opportunity to provide differential pay (if their employee's military pay is equal to or greater than their civilian pay), but may face other burdens when employees are called up to active duty (e.g., workforce disruptions)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "International Provisions", "paragraphs": ["In general, income earned abroad by foreign incorporated subsidiaries is not taxed until it is repatriated (paid to the U.S. parent as a dividend).

For passive income (such as interest income) and certain types of payments which can be easily manipulated to reduce foreign taxes, tax rules require this income to be taxed currently (referred to as Subpart F income to indicate where in the code its tax treatment is specified).

These items of income are subject to Subpart F\u00a0because affiliated firms can use them to shift income and avoid tax. For example, without Subpart F a U.S. parent's subsidiary (1 st tier subsidiary) in a country without taxes (e.g., the Cayman Islands) could lend money to its own subsidiary (2 nd tier subsidiary) in a high tax country. The interest payments would be deductible in the high tax country, but no tax would be due in the no-tax country. Thus, an essentially paper transaction shifts income out of the high tax country. A similar effect might occur if an intangible asset is transferred to the no-tax subsidiary, and then licensed in exchange for a royalty payment by the high tax subsidiary. ", "In some cases, a U.S.-based multinational firm might be able to avoid having the earnings of a foreign subsidiary classified as Subpart F income if the high tax (2 nd tier) subsidiary could be treated as an unincorporated entity for U.S. tax purposes. This is not feasible for some businesses that are required, by foreign law, to operate as what are for U.S. tax purposes per se corporations, or those that would face complex challenges and costs in changing their structure.", "Methods of avoiding Subpart F taxation were made easier in 1997, when U.S. entity classification rules (to be a corporate or non-corporate entity) were simplified by simply checking a box on a form. These \"check-the-box\" regulations provided a way to avoid treatment of payments as Subpart F income under certain circumstances by allowing firms to elect treatment as an unincorporated entity. They were originally intended to simplify classification issues for domestic firms and the IRS, but their usefulness in international tax planning quickly became evident. The Treasury issued regulations in 1998 to disallow their use to avoid Subpart F, but, after protests from firms and from Congress, withdrew them.", "In the example above, if the high-tax subsidiary is not a direct subsidiary of the U.S. parent but is a subsidiary of the Cayman Islands subsidiary (i.e., a 2 nd tier subsidiary), the Cayman Islands (1 st tier) subsidiary can elect to treat the high-tax subsidiary as if it were a pass through entity. This treatment would effectively combine the two subsidiaries into a single firm. This outcome can be achieved simply by checking a box, making the high tax subsidiary a disregarded entity under U.S. law. Because there are no separate firms, no income is recognized by the Cayman Islands firm although the high tax subsidiary (2 nd tier) is still a corporation from the point of view of the foreign jurisdiction in which it operates and can deduct interest in the high tax jurisdiction.", "The check-the-box rules did not work in every circumstance. For example, if the related firms did not have the same 1 st tier parent, check-the-box did not apply. In some cases, because of foreign countries' rules about corporate and non-corporate forms, the check-the-box regulations' classification of some entities as per se corporations made this planning unavailable. In addition, other undesirable tax consequences (from the firm's point of view) could occur as a side effect of check-the-box. ", "The look-through rule effectively puts this check-the-box type of planning into the tax code, rather than as a regulation (which could be altered without legislation), but disconnects it from the regulations' creation of a disregarded entity. Related firms do not have to have the parent-child relationship; they can be otherwise related as long as they are under common control. \u00a0\u00a0", "The look-through rules were originally enacted in the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-222 ), for 2006 through 2008, and subsequently extended. ", "The main argument against the look-through rules (and check-the-box as well) is that it undermines the purpose of Subpart F, which is to prevent firms from using passive and easily shifted income to avoid tax. The rules also provide a way to shift and reinvest excess foreign earnings among distantly related operations, or to shift earnings to a tax haven, without first repatriating them to the U.S. parent. This is done by paying dividends directly to related foreign subsidiaries of their parent.\u00a0Thus, it increases the disincentive to repatriate earnings.", "The main argument for the provision is to allow firms the flexibility to redeploy earnings from one location to another without having U.S. tax consequences (foreign tax rules are unchanged). Firms could, for example, accomplish much of the treatment of look-through rules (even in the absence of check-the-box), but that may involve complex planning and inconvenience. An argument can also be made that in some cases (for example, with the payment of interest), the profit shifting is not harming the U.S. Treasury, but rather reducing taxes collected by foreign governments. If profits are shifted to low-tax countries and then eventually repatriated, foreign tax credits will be smaller, and the U.S. tax collected higher (although deferred). At the same time, this planning achieves lower effective foreign taxes in countries with relatively high nominal tax rates and, as a result, encourages investment in those countries compared to the United States.

Active financing income applies to some of the income earned by American corporations from the active conduct of a banking, financing, or insurance business abroad. This income\u2014which includes dividends and capital gains\u2014would otherwise be taxed under Subpart F as passive income. The tax expenditure is therefore the allowance of deferral for this income. Since being enacted in 1997, the temporary provision providing an exception under Subpart F for active financing income has regularly been extended. ", "The original enactment of Subpart F in 1962 had an exception for banking and insurance. The rationale for this exception was that such income (e.g., interest and dividends) was not passive income in the hands of banking and insurance firms. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 105-34 ) eliminated the exception, because firms could locate profits in tax havens that have little economic substance. President Clinton applied a line-item veto to this provision when enacted in 1997, but the line-item veto was subsequently found unconstitutional.", "Industry advocates argue that the purpose of the active financing exception may be to place U.S. financial services businesses on similar footing to their competitors from other countries. Conversely, passive income could be viewed as passive regardless of the underlying businesses. The provision does provide an incentive for U.S. financial service businesses to invest in low-tax countries (as high foreign taxes generally negate the tax benefit provided by deferral). Today, some U.S. corporations not traditionally thought of as providing financial services may, in fact, have significant financial service operations through their subsidiaries.

The schedule of depreciation deductions depends on the life of the asset and the distribution of deductions over that life. Straight-line depreciation is used for structures, where equal amounts are deducted in each year. For equipment, deductions are accelerated with larger amounts deducted in earlier years. Equipment is most commonly depreciated over 5 or 7 years, but some short-lived assets are depreciated over 3 years and some longer-lived assets are depreciated over 10, 15, or 20 years. Non-residential structures are depreciated over 39 years. Aside from the desire for economic stimulus, traditional economic theories suggest that tax depreciation should match as closely as possible economic (physical) depreciation of assets.

Bonus depreciation was intended for a specific, short-term purpose: to provide an economic stimulus during a recession. Most economic stimulus provisions enacted in response to the recent economic slowdown have been allowed to expire. ", "Bonus depreciation was introduced on two occasions: in 2002 (The Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, P.L. 107-147 ) and 2008 (the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, P.L. 110-185 ). The 2002 stimulus was allowed to expire as planned. Thus, bonus depreciation, unlike most other expiring provisions, has not been continuously extended (and therefore might not be regarded as a traditional \"extender\"). Regardless, the bonus depreciation introduced in 2008 was in place for seven years (through 2014), although its size varied over that period. ", "The analysis of bonus depreciation differs for a temporary stimulus provision, compared to a permanent provision that can affect the size and allocation of the capital stock. A temporary investment subsidy is expected to be more effective than a permanent one for the purpose of short-term stimulus, encouraging firms to invest while the benefit was in place. Its temporary nature is critical to its effectiveness. Yet, research suggests that bonus depreciation was not very effective, and probably less effective than the other tax cuts or spending increases that have now lapsed. ", "As a permanent provision, bonus depreciation benefits equipment investments which already are favored over structures, contributing to lower effective tax rates and, in some cases, negative tax rates. Compared to a statutory corporate tax rate of 35%, bonus depreciation lowers the effective tax rate for equipment from an estimated 26% rate to a 15% rate. Buildings are taxed approximately at the statutory rate. Total effective tax rates for corporate assets would be slightly higher because of stockholder taxes. Because interest payments are deducted, effective tax rates with debt financing can be negative. For assets that would be taxed at the firm's effective rate of 35% if they were equity assets (such as buildings), the effective tax rate on debt financed investment is negative 5%. The rate on equipment without bonus depreciation is negative 19%, but with bonus depreciation it is negative 37%. If bonus depreciation were made permanent, U.S. effective tax rates on equipment would be significantly lower than the OECD average.

", "The special benefit for this small business stock appears to have been intended to facilitate the formation and growth of small firms organized as C corporations involved in developing new manufacturing technologies. The provision provides investors an incentive to acquire a sizable equity stake in small firms.", "An exclusion of part (or all) of the gain from small business stock allows for investors in firms of different sizes to face different effective tax rates. Along with the effect on equity, the provision may also reduce economic efficiency through its distortionary effect on the allocation of capital. The provision could, however, increase economic efficiency if it were to correct for capital market imperfections and allow for optimal small business formation and growth.

Qualified domestic manufacturing activities qualify for a deduction equal to 9% of the lesser of taxable income derived from qualified production activities or taxable income. The effect of the deduction is to reduce the effective tax rate on income from qualified activities by 3.15 percentage points, from 35% to 31.85%. The Section 199 domestic production activities deduction is a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). ", "When the Section 199 deduction was enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA; P.L. 108-357 ), the term \"United States,\" as used for the purposes of determining eligible domestic activities, included the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but not U.S. possessions or territories. In 2006, as part of the Tax Relief and Healthcare Act ( P.L. 109-432 ), special rules that allowed Puerto Rico to be considered a part of the United States for the purposes of the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction were temporarily enacted. This temporary provision has recently been extended as part of \"tax extenders\" legislation. ", "The U.S. tax code generally treats U.S. possessions as foreign countries, and Puerto Rico maintains an independent tax system. There are, however, many special rules interconnecting the Puerto Rican and U.S. tax systems. Before 1996, domestic corporations with business operations in the U.S. possessions could generally eliminate their U.S. tax liability on foreign-source income from operations in the possessions using the possessions tax credit. From 1996 through 2005, the Puerto Rico economic activity credit was available for domestic corporations with activities in Puerto Rico. Following the expiration of the possessions tax credit and Puerto Rico economic activity credit, companies with operations in Puerto Rico may find it more advantageous to structure as a controlled foreign corporation (CFC), thus benefitting from the option to defer U.S. tax on active income from those operations. ", "Allowing the Section 199 production activities deduction to be claimed on manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico can be viewed as an effort to provide similar tax treatment to income from manufacturing activities taking place in Puerto Rico and from the rest of the United States. Absent this provision, U.S.-based manufacturers with operations in Puerto Rico, operating in flow-through form (e.g., a branch or partnership), would face a higher effective tax rate on manufacturing activities in Puerto Rico than other domestic manufacturing activities. ", "Allowing the Section 199 deduction for activities in Puerto Rico essentially extends a tax benefit designed for domestic corporations to a possession that is generally treated as a foreign country for tax purposes. This raises the question of why this tax benefit has been provided to Puerto Rico but no other U.S. possessions. Concerns have also been raised that extending Section 199 to Puerto Rico would create an incentive for U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico to adopt a bifurcated structure, with certain activities being undertaken by a CFC with other activities, specifically those that qualify for Section 199, being undertaken in a flow-through structure. Since other domestic businesses do not have this organizational flexibility, this would provide greater potential benefits to manufacturers with operations in Puerto Rico. This could be the intent of the policy, if extending Section 199 to businesses in Puerto Rico is intended, in part, to encourage additional manufacturing activity in Puerto Rico.

Rents, royalties, interest, and annuities (passive income) are generally not considered business taxable income, except when such payments are received from a \"controlled entity.\" ", "The Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-280 ) included special rules temporarily providing that certain payments, including rents and royalties received by a tax-exempt entity from a controlled entity or subsidiary, are not considered unrelated business income. Payments that are in excess of an arms-length price cannot be excluded from UBTI. Since being enacted, these rules have regularly been extended as part of \"tax extenders\" legislation. ", "The purpose of including payments received from controlled entities in business taxable income is to prevent tax-exempt organizations from using separate but controlled entities to avoid unrelated business income taxes. For example, one concern is that a 501(c)(3) charitable organization could set up a controlled subsidiary to engage in a profitable activity (e.g., selling merchandise). If the charity had sold the merchandise itself, the income would be subject to the unrelated business income tax. To avoid the tax, the charity could set up a controlled subsidiary to sell the merchandise, which would pay royalties to the charity (lease the charity's logo, for example). The controlled subsidiary would deduct the royalty payments as a cost of doing business, and the charity would receive royalty income, which would not be considered unrelated business income. In this scenario, the charity would avoid paying tax on business activities. ", "Treating rent, royalty, interest, and annuity payments from controlled organizations as UBTI while similar types of payments from third parties are not taxed may raise questions related to fairness. Tax-exempt entities could claim that as long as tax-exempt parents' dealings with controlled subsidiaries are done at arm's length, the scope for abuse should be limited. It is this logic that led to the enactment of the provision modifying the tax treatment of certain payments to controlling exempt organizations."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
