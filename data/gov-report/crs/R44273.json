Although some provisions make very minor changes, taken together the proposals would arguably somewhat reduce the Fed's independence from Congress. The Fed is more independent than most other agencies, which has traditionally been justified by its monetary policy responsibilities.

The basic governance structure is largely unchanged in recent decades. The Fed is composed of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks overseen by a Board of Governors in Washington, DC. The board is composed of seven governors nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The President selects (and the Senate confirms) a chair and two vice chairs from among the governors. The governors serve nonrenewable 14-year terms, but the chair and vice chairs serve renewable 4-year terms. Board members are chosen without regard to political affiliation. ", "In general, policy is formulated by the board and carried out by the regional banks. Monetary policy decisions, however, are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed of the seven governors, the president of the New York Fed, and four other regional bank presidents. Representation for these 4 seats rotates among the other 11 regional banks. The FOMC meets at least every six weeks to set monetary policy. ", "Aside from its permanent seat on the FOMC, the New York Fed has no special role in the Federal Reserve Act compared to other Fed regional banks. Nevertheless, it has taken on certain prominent roles within the system. It carries out the open market operations that implement the FOMC's monetary policy decisions. During the financial crisis, many of the Fed's emergency programs (discussed in the section below entitled \" Emergency Lending \") were run by the New York Fed. It supervises many of the largest banks because they are headquartered in the New York Fed's District. The New York Fed is responsible for conducting foreign exchange transactions on behalf of the government, and storing the gold of foreign central banks and international agencies. In all of these instances, it is executing, not formulating, policy. By tradition, the FOMC elects the New York Fed president to be its vice chair, a position with no formal powers.", "The Fed's capital is comprised of paid-in capital issued to member banks and retained earnings deposited in its surplus account. Private banks regulated by the Fed buy stock in the Fed to become member banks. Membership is mandatory for national banks, but optional for state banks. To finance the creation of the Fed, the Federal Reserve Act required member banks to purchase stock issued by the Fed. Member banks are required to purchase (\"pay in\") stock equal to 3% of their capital, and the Fed has the option to call in an additional 3%. The stock can be thought of as a risk-free investment; it pays dividends, which was fixed by statute at 6% from 1913, until modified in 2015 (as discussed in the next section). Ownership of stock in the Fed confers more limited rights than common stock in a private corporation. For example, stockholders have no control over Fed policy. ", "Stockholders choose two-thirds of the board of directors at the regional Fed banks, however. Each regional Fed bank has a board that is composed of three Class A directors, required to be representatives of the banking industry chosen by member banks; three Class B directors, representatives of the public chosen by member banks; and three Class C directors, representatives of the public chosen by the Board of Governors. A chairman and deputy chairman of the board are selected from among the Class C directors. The other main difference between the classes of directors is their role in choosing the regional bank presidents. Regional bank presidents are chosen by the Class B and C directors of their boards, not by the President, with the approval of the Board of Governors.", "The Fed's budget is not subject to congressional appropriations. The Fed is self-funded by fees and the income generated by securities it owns. Its income exceeds its expenses, and it remits most of its net income to the Treasury, where it is used to reduce the federal debt.

H.R. 3189 , H.R. 5983 and S. 1484 / S. 1910 would shift responsibility for setting the interest rate paid to banks on reserves from the Board of Governors to the FOMC.

H.R. 2912 was ordered to be reported by the House Financial Services Committee on July 29, 2015. It then was included in the version of H.R. 3189 that passed the House and in H.R. 5983 . It would create a commission whose voting members are composed of four Members of the House from the majority party, two Members of the House from the minority party, four Members of the Senate from the majority party, and two Members of the Senate from the minority party.

The commission would be tasked with studying and recommending whether the 12 Federal Reserve districts should be restructured. The commission is to be funded out of the earnings of the Fed.", "Reduction in Dividend to Member Banks. H.R. 22 ( P.L. 114-94 ), which was signed into law on December 4, 2015, reduced the dividend that the Fed pays on stock held by member banks with more than $10 billion in assets from 6% to the lower of 6% or the most recent yield on 10-year Treasury securities. (For banks with less than $10 billion in assets, the dividend continues to be 6%.) The market yield on 10-year Treasury securities has been below 6% since 2000, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects it will remain below 6% over the next 10 years. Because the Fed's profits are used to pay both dividends to member banks and remittances to Treasury, a reduction in dividends would presumably increase remittances. Thus, the provision was included in \"Title XXXII-Offsets\" of the act and CBO estimated that this provision will raise revenues by $6.9 billion over 10 years. Based on Fed data, 47 national banks and 22 state-member banks have more than $10 billion in assets as of March 31, 2016. ", "Reduction or Elimination of Fed Surplus. \"Title XXXII-Offsets\" of H.R. 22 ( P.L. 114-94 ) included a provision that capped the Fed's surplus (comprised of retained earnings) at $10 billion and required funds in excess of that amount to be remitted to Treasury, where they become general revenues. At the time of enactment, the Fed's surplus was equal to $29.4 billion. CBO estimated that this provision will increase revenues by $53.3 billion over 10 years. CBO assumed that the Fed will finance the transfer by selling Treasury securities, which otherwise would have earned income that would have been remitted to the Treasury in future years. Thus, the provision can be thought of as shifting Fed remittances from the future to the present. H.R. 3189 , as passed by the House, would permanently eliminate the Fed's surplus and transfer its balance to the Treasury. ", "Qualifications for Fed Leadership Positions . H.R. 26 ( P.L. 114-1 ) required the President to \"appoint at least one member with demonstrated primary experience working in or supervising community banks having less than $10,000,000,000 in total assets\" to the Board of Governors. As a result, community banks are the only interest group specifically required to have a representative nominated as a member of the Board. Previously, in making nominations, the President was only required to give \"due regard to a fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical divisions of the country.\" ", "Currently, Class B and C directors of the Fed's regional bank boards are \"elected without discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, or national origin, and with due but not exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumers.\" H.R. 3189 , as passed by the House, would add \"traditionally underserved communities and populations\" to the list of considerations.

For congressional oversight, the Fed has been required by statute to report to and testify before the House and Senate committees of jurisdiction semiannually since 1978. At these hearings, which take place in February and July, the Fed chairman presents the Fed's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress , testifies, and responds to questions from committee members. In addition, these committees periodically hold more focused hearings on Fed topics. On January 25, 2012, the Fed began publishing forecasts for its federal funds rate target and announced a longer-run goal of 2% for inflation. According to the Fed, it hopes greater transparency about its intentions will strengthen financial market participants' understanding of its actions, thereby making those actions more effective.", "Contrary to popular belief, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has conducted audits of the Fed's regulatory and payment activities regularly since 1978, subject to statutory restrictions. In addition, private-sector auditors audit the Fed's financial statements and the Fed has an Office of Inspector General. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ) required an audit of the Fed's emergency activities during the financial crisis, released in July 2011, and an audit of Fed governance, released in October 2011. The effective result of the audit restrictions remaining in law is that GAO can audit the Fed's monetary policy decisions or operations, transactions with foreign central banks and governments, discount window operations, or policies related to bank reserves or securities credit for waste, fraud, and abuse, but cannot evaluate the economic merits of these actions. ", "For Fed disclosure, the Fed has publicly released extensive information on its operations, mostly on a voluntary basis. It is statutorily required to release an annual report and a weekly summary of its balance sheet. The expanded scope of its lending activities during the financial crisis eventually led it to release a monthly report that offered more detailed information. In December 2010, the Fed released individual lending records for emergency facilities, revealing borrowers' identities and loans' terms, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Going forward, individual records for discount window and open market operation transactions have been released with a two-year lag. ", "More recently, some Members of Congress have sought greater disclosure of information related to regulation (including international agreements), and salary and financial information about Fed officials and employees. In its rule-making, the Fed follows the standard notice and public comment process and must consider the burdens and benefits for depository institutions, but is not required to conduct formal or quantitative cost-benefit analysis. The Fed has an ombudsman and an appeals process for its supervisory decisions, such as exam results. The Dodd-Frank Act created a vice chair for supervision who is required to testify before the committees of jurisdiction semiannually; that position has not yet been filled, however.", "For more information, see CRS Report R42079, Federal Reserve: Oversight and Disclosure Issues , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Although oversight and disclosure are often lumped together, they are separate issues and need not go together.

Most economists believe that the Fed's political independence leads to better policy outcomes and makes policy more effective by enhancing the Fed's credibility in the eyes of market participants. The Fed has opposed legislation removing remaining GAO audit restrictions on those grounds. Disclosure helps Congress and the public better understand the Fed's actions. Up to a point, this makes monetary and regulatory policy more effective, but too much disclosure could make both less effective because they rely on market-sensitive and confidential information.

This discretion includes autonomy over what policy tools to use (e.g., whether policy should be carried out by targeting the federal funds rate) and what the stance of monetary policy should be (e.g., at what level should the federal funds rate target be set?).", "Some Members of Congress, dissatisfied with the Fed's conduct of monetary policy, have looked for alternatives to the current regime. Some opponents of Fed discretion argue for a rules-based regime. One example of a monetary policy rule is the Taylor rule, which was developed by economist John Taylor to describe and evaluate the Fed's interest rate decisions. ", "Normally, the Fed carries out monetary policy primarily by setting a target for the federal funds rate, the overnight inter-bank lending rate. The Taylor rule is a simple mathematical formula that, in the best-known version (described in the text box below), relates interest rate changes to changes in the inflation rate and the output gap. These two factors directly relate to the Fed's statutory mandate to achieve \"maximum employment and stable prices.\" ", "Taylor rules are currently used in economic analysis to explain the Fed's past actions or to offer a baseline in an evaluation of what the Fed has done or should do in the future. A Taylor rule (although with different parameters from this example) has been demonstrated to track actual policy relatively well for the period lasting from after inflation declined in the 1980s to the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007. Thus, it can be used in an economic model (which offers a simplified version of the actual economy) to represent the Fed's decisions under normal economic conditions.", "A limitation of the Taylor rule is that it was designed only to be used with the federal funds rate, which was the Fed's primary monetary policy instrument from roughly the early 1990s to late 2008. From December 2008 to October 2014, the Fed did not use the federal funds rate as its primary policy tool because the rate was at the \"zero lower bound\"\u2014it was set near zero, and thus could not be lowered further. Instead, the Fed created new policy tools such as \"quantitative easing\" (QE) to stimulate the economy. The Taylor rule cannot make policy prescriptions at the zero lower bound\u2014different combinations of deflation (falling prices) and output gaps would prescribe a negative federal funds rate under the Taylor rule, but that prescription would not be actionable because the federal funds rate is a market rate. The Taylor rule was devised at a time when interest rates had never fallen to the zero bound before, and it arguably seemed reasonable at the time to assume that the rule would not need to cover this contingency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Economists and policy analysts have debated whether basing monetary policy decisions on a Taylor rule would lead to better economic outcomes than the status quo. The Fed already uses the Taylor rule as a reference tool to help inform its policy decisions. Proponents would like the Taylor rule to have a more formal role in policymaking, either requiring policy to be set by a Taylor rule or requiring the Fed to explain its decisions relative to a Taylor rule. If the Fed desired, it could arguably adopt these proposals voluntarily under current law (e.g., the FOMC could agree to base their vote on a Taylor rule's prescription). Legislative changes would be needed to require the Fed to adopt these proposals, however. ", "The desirability of basing policy on a Taylor rule (whether it takes the form presented above or an alternative form) can be viewed through the prism of the economic debate about the superiority of rules versus discretion in policymaking. Economists who favor the use of rules argue that policy is more effective if it is predictable and transparent. They argue that unpredictable policy results in financial and economic instability. For example, there can be large movements in financial prices when the Fed makes a policy change that \"surprises\" financial markets. A formal role for a Taylor rule could also potentially help Congress in its oversight capacity by providing a clear benchmark against which the Fed's decisions could be evaluated.", "Economists favoring discretion argue that policymakers need flexibility to manage an inherently complex economy that is regularly hit by unexpected shocks. For example, rules might have hindered the Fed's ability to respond to the housing bubble and the financial crisis in the late 2000s. In principle, a Taylor rule need not be limited to inflation and the output gap, but making it more complex would reduce the perceived benefits of transparency and predictability. Likewise, periodically modifying the form that the Taylor rule takes in response to unforeseen events would reduce predictability and increase discretion. Further, how could a Taylor rule incorporate amorphous concerns about, say, financial stability or asset bubbles when there is no consensus on how to quantify them? A Taylor rule requires data points that are easy to measure and accurately embody a larger economic phenomenon of concern. Using forecasts would probably be preferable to using actual data in the Taylor rule since monetary policy affects the economy with lags, but would potentially reintroduce policy discretion (since the Fed would produce the forecast). Further, if perceived policy errors by the Fed were mainly caused by forecasting errors (e.g., the failure to identify the housing bubble), then using a Taylor rule based on forecasts would probably not have prevented them. Any of these issues could be addressed by modifying the Taylor rule, but this would arguably reduce the perceived benefits of a rules-based regime.", "Other practical challenges with formalizing use of the traditional Taylor rule in policymaking include (1) the requisite data are released with lags and later revised; (2) the neutral rate of interest and potential output growth cannot be directly observed and may vary over time, making them difficult to estimate accurately in real time; (3) basing the FFR on only inflation and the output gap would make it more volatile; (4) public comprehension; and (5) addressing the zero bound issue. ", "Rules were originally favored by economists who believed that Fed discretion was responsible for high inflation, but inflation has been low since the 1990s and below 2% by the Fed's preferred measure since 2013. Recently, Taylor rules have been used to support criticism that the Fed has engaged in too much stimulus. Policy rules in general do not inherently have a pro- or anti-stimulus bias, however, as their parameters can be adjusted to meet policymakers' goals. Policymakers who emphasize price stability could put a relatively high weight on the inflation parameter. Alternatively, policymakers who want the Fed to be responsive to (high or low) growth could put a relatively high weight on the output gap parameter. Since the form that a Taylor rule takes involves, in part, value judgments about the goals of monetary policy and the best way to achieve those goals, choosing its form involves political tradeoffs as well as economic modeling.", "As mentioned above, as long as the Fed prefers discretionary policy, it can only be forced to adopt rules-based policy through legislation. It would arguably be difficult, however, for Congress to determine what would be the best form of Taylor rule for the Fed to follow or when the Fed should be allowed to deviate from the rule's prescription. It needs the Fed's cooperation to devise and implement a rules-based policy, but the Fed has little incentive to tie its own hands. If Congress wanted the Fed to adhere to both the spirit and letter of any law that reduced the Fed's discretion, it may need to find legal carrots or sticks to succeed. But exposing the Fed to negative consequences when it does not follow the monetary policy that Congress prefers would be antithetical to the Fed's independence from Congress. It would provide Congress a new avenue to potentially apply political pressure on the Fed's monetary policymaking, even if that is not the proponents' intent. Thus, the challenge for proponents of rules-based policy is how to ensure less discretion without compromising the Fed's independence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Proposals", "paragraphs": ["S. 1484 / S. 1910 would require the Fed to include in a quarterly report to Congress on monetary policy and the economy a discussion of any mathematical rules or other strategies it uses in monetary policy deliberations and how policy has deviated from those rules and strategies.

Using this authority, the Fed created six broadly based facilities (of which only five were used) to provide liquidity to \"primary dealers\" (i.e., certain large investment firms) and to revive demand for commercial paper and asset-backed securities.

There is a long-standing policy debate about how independent regulatory agencies should be from Congress and the Administration, with proponents of independence arguing that it will lead to more technocratic decisionmaking and opponents arguing it leads to opaque, undemocratic, and unresponsive decisionmaking. For decades, the Fed has enjoyed an unusual degree of independence from Congress and the President compared with other government agencies, which has typically been justified in terms of insulating its monetary policy decisions from political pressures. To some extent, a tradeoff between independence and accountability is unavoidable.
