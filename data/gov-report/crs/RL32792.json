It most commonly refers to life expectancy at birth , the median number of years that a population born in a particular year could expect to live. For instance, based on recently released final data, life expectancy at birth in 2003 was 77.5 years. This tells us that, for those born in calendar year 2003 in the United States, 50% will die before that age; the other half will live longer.", "Life expectancy is also routinely calculated for other ages. Life expectancy at age 60, for instance, refers to the additional number of years that a person who has already attained age 60 will live beyond age 60. Life expectancy at age 60 in the year 2003 was 22.2 years in the United States. A person who reached age 60 in 2003 was expected to live an additional 22.2 years, on average, and would die at age 82.2.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, International Data Base, the highest attained life expectancy to date for a national population was that of Andorra in 2006, when life expectancy was 83.5 years for the total population (86.6 years for females; 80.6 years for males). The oldest authenticated female life span thus far recorded was for J. Calment of France, who died at age 122 years, 164 days, and, for a man, C. Mortensen (a Danish immigrant to the U.S.), who died at age 115 years, 252 days.

The long-range projections needed for this assessment depend critically on assumptions for the future course of longevity. According to Steven Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration (SSA), their future mortality assumptions are based on the recorded average annual mortality decline for the total U.S. population aged 65 and older between 1900 and 2000. He asserted that assuming future mortality improvement at nearly the same rate as for the last century\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little more than 0.7% annually\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a reasonable assumption, with a roughly equal likelihood of doing better or worse.

Goss further suggested that \"matching the accomplishments of the past century will not be easy. AIDS, SARS, and antibiotic resistant microbes, along with increasing obesity and declining levels of exercise, remind us that mortality improvements will not be automatic. Gains from replacement organs and genetic engineering will be expensive, and may be difficult to provide for the population as a whole.\" SSA's projections of period life expectancy are shown in Table 4 .", "A benefit of the statistical methods that have emerged to extrapolate historical mortality trends to the future is that they have worked well and are relatively simple and efficient. In addition to being utilized by SSA, similar approaches are also used in Canada and in the United Kingdom (UK). Canada's approach assumes that economic productivity is the overall driving factor for sustained longevity improvements, and projects a relationship between future mortality decline and future real growth in employment earnings. The UK extrapolates trends from 15 years of past data to help define base starting points and establish initial rates of mortality improvement for projections. An assumption is also made that there will be a gradual slowing of rates of improvement after the first 10 years.", "Future mortality and survival are, however, difficult to predict and specialists disagree on not only the level but also the direction of future trends. James Vaupel, director of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, argues that the Social Security projections are too pessimistic. He notes that SSA's forecast is that female life expectancy in the United States will gradually rise from 79.5 years today to 83.4 years in 2050. SSA's projected level of life expectancy in 2050, half-a-century from today, is less than current life expectancy in Japan and France, and is 13 to 14 years less than likely Japanese and French female life expectancy in 2050. Vaupel further suggests that it is unrealistic for SSA to assume that the United States will be unable to match the level of life expectancy in half-a-century that is already attained in other countries today.", "A number of articles suggested that current models may be too pessimistic in their assumptions about mortality and survival probabilities (i.e., Americans may live longer than currently projected). Two of these studies showed that there has been a tendency for international life expectancy to rise linearly by more than two years per decade over the past 40 years or the last 160 years, a more rapid pace than suggested by current models. Also, useful analyses of the contributions of smoking behavior to mortality trends in the United States suggests that slow female gains in life expectancy over the past few decades may be temporary, and that the pace may pick up fairly soon.", "Technological advances also have the potential to expand life.

For the United States, NCHS attributed the increasing gap during these years to increases in male mortality due to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, which were largely the result of men's early and widespread adoption of cigarette smoking. In the mid- to late 1970s, the average gap in life expectancy approximated the average gap seen in developed countries today\u00e2\u0080\u0094roughly seven years.

The answer, which is still being investigated, involves the complicated interplay of a host of biological, social, and behavioral conditions. In addition, it differs according to age and to the underlying disease and mortality profiles for men and women. At birth, boys have a clear advantage. In the United States, 104.9 boys were born for every 100.0 girls in 2003. But, male mortality exceeds that of females in every age group and for most major causes of death, beginning in infancy and continuing through the oldest-old age groups.

In contrast, some say, testosterone, found in greater amounts in males, may make men more likely to engage in violence and risk-taking behavior, especially if reinforced by cultural influences. Women may also gain an additional biological advantage because of their two X chromosomes. If a gene mutation occurs on one X, a woman's second X chromosome may be able to compensate. In comparison, genes on men's sole X chromosome may be expressed, even if they are deleterious without compensation.", "Stindl, however, argues that these classic biological explanations do not withstand critical analysis. He offered an alternative hypothesis that has not yet been subject to long-term scientific scrutiny. He asserts that a strong positive correlation has been reported between sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and male-based mortality, with men being the larger/taller sex globally. A larger body requires more cell doublings, especially due to the ongoing regeneration of tissues over a lifetime. Accordingly, the replicative history of male cells might be longer than that of female cells, resulting in the exhaustion of the regeneration potential and the early onset of age-associated diseases predominantly in males. The underlying mechanism is the gradual erosion of chromosome ends (telomeres). Two recent studies confirm that men do have shorter telomeres than women at the same ages.

Women's social status and life conditions (such as the hardships associated with childbirth) may have nullified American women's biological advantage at the beginning of the 20 th century but are no longer major factors in gender differentials in life expectancy in the United States, though these explanations are still relevant in a number of other countries. Higher male mortality rates have been attributed to greater male exposure to specific risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and occupational hazards. Life expectancy in Russia, for instance, fell by 6.3 years for Russian men during the period 1990 to 1995\u00e2\u0080\u0094a level of decline that was unprecedented both in Russia and in other industrialized countries. In investigating the cause of the sudden drop, a team of researchers from the London School of Economics and the Russian Academy of Sciences observed that excessive alcohol consumption contributed both directly and indirectly to the marked increases in deaths from fatal events (e.g. accidents, injuries, suicides, poisonings) and in deaths from cardiovascular disease.", "The most cited behavioral contributor to higher male mortality rates in the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the subject of considerable research interest\u00e2\u0080\u0094has been the greater male exposure to cigarette smoking. Smoking patterns are an obvious place to look for an explanation of sex mortality differences because the health risks are high and long-lasting; large fractions of the population have engaged in the habit; and smoking patterns differ between the sexes. More specifically, women's uptake of smoking lagged behind that of men. In the 1970s, when the sex differential in mortality was increasing, cigarette smoking was implicated. Now, as the sex differential is narrowing, a new body of research is evaluating the role of cigarette smoking in explaining the trend. Pampel, for instance, documented that the rate of decline in female mortality in the United States has slowed since 1980 or so, while that of males has returned to its earlier trend of relatively rapid improvement\u00e2\u0080\u0094thus resulting in a narrowing life expectancy differential by gender. He concludes that smoking behavior lies behind the changing pace of mortality decline not only in the United States, but also in 20 other industrial nations. Extending Pampel's analysis, Lee showed that the rate of decline for deaths not associated with smoking was actually faster for women (than men) while death rates associated with smoking actually increased for women while decreasing for men. Preston and Wang demonstrate that changes in sex mortality differences in the United States have been structured on a cohort rather than a period basis, and that the cohort imprint is closely related to histories of cigarette smoking. Allowance for the smoking histories of cohorts significantly affects the assessment of mortality trends: national mortality levels would have declined more rapidly in the absence of smoking, and they are likely to decline more rapidly in the future as smoking recedes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Race Differentials54", "paragraphs": ["Life expectancy at birth for whites significantly exceeded that for blacks at the turn of the 20 th century (see Figure 2 and Appendix B Table B -1 ).

Second , genes may be relevant to the study of health differentials through environmental factors, which may vary by racial or ethnic group, and which might interact with genotype to produce different outcomes for different groups."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["One of the most important public health achievements of the 20 th century in the United States was the dramatic and widespread increase in life expectancy that occurred over the past century in the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0094first as a result of the control of the infectious and parasitic diseases that had plagued mostly infants and children in the early part of the century, and later because of medical advances that led to large decreases in adult mortality, especially from two of the most prevalent causes of death\u00e2\u0080\u0094cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular diseases.", "A consequence of the improved survival, coupled with declining fertility rates, is that the United States is in the midst of a profound demographic change: rapid population aging, a phenomenon that is replacing the earlier \"young\" age-sex structure with that of an older population. Hastened by the retirement of the \"Baby Boom\" generation (the cohort born between 1946 and 1964), the inexorable demographic momentum will have important implications for a large number of essential economic and social domains, including work, retirement, and pensions, wealth and income security, and the health and well-being of the aging population.", "Whether the life expectancy improvements will continue is the subject of intense debate. The Social Security Administration (SSA) assumes that the rate of future mortality improvements will be nearly the same as for the last century\u00e2\u0080\u0094a little more than 0.7% annually\u00e2\u0080\u0094while asserting that it may be difficult to match the accomplishments of the past century, especially in light of increasing obesity, declining levels of exercise, and the introduction of new scourges, such as AIDS, SARS, antibiotic resistant microbes. Some demographers, on the other hand, feel that such projections are pessimistic, and argue, based on historical trends and evidence from other developed countries, that American survival will be longer than that projected by SSA. The outcome of the debate has important implications for determining the number of future beneficiaries and ultimately the financial soundness of the Social Security and the Medicare programs.", "This report also highlights the continuing differentials in life expectancy by race and sex in the United States, with black males continuing to be the most disadvantaged group on this measure. Life expectancy at birth in 2003 for black males measured 69.0 years, falling short of the comparable figure for white males by 6.3 years. The gap between black and white men has remained relatively stagnant since the mid-1950s.", "The sources of the racial disparities in life expectancy are complex and require disentangling the complex web of factors connecting the nexus among race, socioeconomic status, behavioral factors, and health. Differences exist on a wide variety of important variables including lifetime income and wealth, marriage patterns, birth weight and childhood nutrition, access to employer-provided health insurance, the strain of physically demanding work, exposure to toxins, risky behaviors (such as smoking, high saturated diet), adherence to preventative health measures (such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercise), and access to and quality of health care. In addition, the experience of racial discrimination may have adverse psychological and physiological effects, in addition to limiting the quantity and quality of health care received.", "Recent research, however, that shows that the leading specific diseases that are the main sources of the racial disparity in life expectancy are largely preventable causes of premature death offers hope that public-health interventions can reduce the racial disparities. Specifically, the leading causes of the racial disparity were hypertension (which contributed 15.0% to the disparity), followed by HIV disease (11.2%), diabetes (8.5%), and homicide (8.5%) in a recent analysis.", "Appendix A.
