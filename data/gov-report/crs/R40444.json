States can set the upper income level for targeted low-income children up to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL), or 50 percentage points above the applicable pre-CHIP Medicaid income level. However, \"(u)nder current statutory and regulatory authority, States are able to effectively expand eligibility of all children under 19 years of age to whatever level they choose.\" For states seeking CMS approval to expand eligibility, CHIPRA reduces federal CHIP payments for certain higher-income CHIP children. Specifically, the regular Medicaid federal matching rate (FMAP), which is lower than the CHIP enhanced matching rate, will be used for CHIP enrollees whose effective family income exceeds 300% of poverty using the state's policy of excluding \"a block of income that is not determined by type of expense or type of income,\" with an exception for states that already had a federal approval plan (i.e., New Jersey) or that had enacted a state law to submit a plan for federal approval (i.e., New York).", "Within these general rules, states may provide assistance to qualifying children in two basic ways. They may cover such children under their Medicaid programs and/or they may create a separate CHIP program for this purpose. (More details on available benefits under each approach are described in the next section.) When states provide Medicaid coverage to targeted low-income children, Medicaid rules typically apply. When states provide coverage to targeted low-income children through separate CHIP programs, Title XXI rules typically apply. In both cases, the federal share of program costs comes from federal CHIP funds (also described in further detail below).", "Title XXI does not establish an individual entitlement to benefits. Instead, Title XXI entitles states with approved state CHIP plans to pre-determined federal allotments based on a distribution formula set in the law (explained further below). Targeted low-income children covered under a CHIP-financed expansion of Medicaid are, however, entitled to the benefits offered under that program as dictated by Medicaid law. No such individual entitlement exists for targeted low-income children covered in separate CHIP programs.", "States may cover targeted low-income children by expanding their Medicaid programs in the following ways: (1) by establishing a new optional eligibility group for such children as authorized in Title XXI, and/or (2) by liberalizing the financial rules for any of several existing Medicaid eligibility categories. Many states with Medicaid-expansion CHIP programs chose the latter, opting to cover targeted low-income children under existing Medicaid eligibility pathways, especially Medicaid's poverty-related child groups, rather than by establishing the Title XXI optional coverage group. Such a strategy reduces the administrative burden of creating and implementing a new coverage group.", "States may also provide coverage to targeted low-income children by creating a separate CHIP program. States define the group of targeted low-income children who may enroll in separate CHIP programs. Title XXI allows states to use the following factors in determining eligibility: geography (e.g., sub-state areas or statewide), age (e.g., subgroups under 19), income, resources (assets), residency, disability status (so long as any standard relating to that status does not restrict eligibility), access to or coverage under other health insurance (to establish whether such access/coverage precludes CHIP eligibility), and duration of CHIP eligibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pregnant Women", "paragraphs": ["Prior to CHIPRA, states were able to cover adult pregnant women (ages 19 and older) in one of three ways: (1) states could apply for Section 1115 waivers to extend coverage to such pregnant women; (2) states could provide health benefits coverage, including prenatal care and delivery services, to unborn children of adult pregnant women through a CHIP state plan amendment (SPA) as permitted through regulation; or (3) states could offer a \"family coverage option\" through a group health plan that may include maternity care to adult females in eligible families.

The upper income level for pregnant women may be as high as the standard applicable to CHIP children in the state. Other eligibility restrictions applicable to CHIP children (e.g., must be uninsured, ineligible for state employee health coverage) also apply. The period of coverage is during pregnancy through the postpartum period (through roughly 60 days after delivery). States are allowed to temporarily enroll pregnant women for up to two months until a formal determination of eligibility is made (referred to as presumptive eligibility). Benefits include all services available to CHIP children in the state as well as prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Infants born to these pregnant women are deemed eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, as appropriate, and are covered up to age one year, at which point eligibility could be redetermined.

For legal immigrants (but not refugees and asylees), the law requires that their sponsor's income and resources for those who have signed a legally binding affidavit of support would be taken into account in determining eligibility. Generally speaking, for federally means-tested programs (e.g., Medicaid, TANF), the affidavit of support required the sponsor to ensure that the new immigrant will not become a public charge and makes the sponsor financially responsible for the individual.", "CHIPRA permitted states to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or CHIP coverage to pregnant women and children who are (1) lawfully residing in the United States and (2) are otherwise eligible for such coverage.

For states that elect to extend such coverage, the provision assured that the cost of care will not be deemed under an affidavit of support against an individual's sponsor. In addition, as a part of states' redetermination processes (i.e., to redetermine eligibility at least every 12 months with respect to circumstances that may change and affect eligibility), individuals made eligible under this provision whose initial documentation showing legal residence is no longer valid will be required to show \"further documentation or other evidence\" that the individual continues to lawfully reside.

Certain states that have covered adults with CHIP funds were permitted to do so almost entirely through the use of these waivers. Adult coverage waivers, which initially are effective for five years, are subject to renewal at least every three years. Prior to 2007, waiver renewals for states with adult coverage waivers were approved, even for those states that were projected to face federal CHIP shortfalls (e.g., New Jersey, Rhode Island).

In addition, states using CHIP funds for employer-based plan premiums were required to ensure that CHIP minimum benefits were provided, CHIP cost-sharing ceilings were met, and the children to be enrolled have not had group coverage for a specified period of time (typically four to six months). Under Medicaid, including a Medicaid expansion CHIP program, states may implement a premium assistance program if the employer plan is comprehensive and cost-effective for the state. Under Medicaid, an individual's enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if paying the premiums, deductible, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations of the employer plan is less expensive than the state's expected cost of directly providing Medicaid-covered services. To meet the comprehensiveness test under Medicaid, states are required to provide coverage for those Medicaid-covered services that are not included in the private plans. In other words, they must provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage. It has proved prohibitive for many employer plans and states to meet all of these requirements. To circumvent these restrictions, most states operating CHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs do so under waivers.", "CHIPRA created a new state plan option for providing premium assistance and required states to include a description of the procedures to provide outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for families of children likely to be eligible for premium assistance subsidies under CHIP. States have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and CHIP-eligible children and/or parents of Medicaid and/or CHIP-eligible children where the family has access to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) coverage, if the employer pays at least 40% of the total premium, the employer's group health plan qualifies as \"creditable coverage\" (as defined by the Public Health Service Act), and the coverage is offered to all individuals in a nondiscriminatory way (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986). Under CHIPRA, a state offering premium assistance may not require CHIP eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan; individuals eligible for CHIP and for employment-based coverage may choose to enroll in regular CHIP rather than the premium assistance program. The premium assistance subsidy will generally be the difference between the worker's out-of-pocket premium that included the child(ren) versus only covering the employee. For employer plans that do not meet CHIP benefit requirements, a wrap-around is required.", "For the child's coverage using premium assistance, no cost-effectiveness test is required regarding the cost of the private coverage (plus any necessary wrap-around) relative to regular CHIP coverage. CHIPRA establishes a separate test for family coverage. If the CHIP cost of covering the entire family in the employer-sponsored plan is less than regular CHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone, then the premium assistance subsidy may be used to pay the entire family's share of the premium. In states that offered premium assistance, CHIPRA requires states and participating employers to do outreach. Under CHIPRA, states are permitted to establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have at least one employee who is a CHIP-eligible pregnant woman or at least one member of the family is a CHIP-eligible child. The law stipulates that the new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid, not CHIP, will apply to children enrolled in a Medicaid-expansion CHIP program. Finally, CHIPRA amends applicable Federal laws to streamline coordination between public and private coverage, including making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for the purpose of purchasing employer-sponsored coverage.

These amounts were adjusted by a geographic adjustment factor and were limited by various floors and ceilings to ensure that a state's allotment did not vary substantially from certain past allotments.", "Rather than dividing a fixed national appropriation on the basis of state survey estimates, a state's allotment is now calculated as described below and if the total of all the states' and territories' allotments does not exceed the national appropriation, that will be the state's allotment.

CRS projections indicated that this particular provision would delay shortfalls until the end of March 2007.
