The pandemic is having a noticeable impact on global economic growth. Estimates so far indicate the virus could trim global economic growth by as much as 2.0% per month if current conditions persist and raise the risks of a global economic recession similar in magnitude to that experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Global trade could also fall by 13% to 32%, depending on the depth and extent of the global economic downturn. The full impact will not be known until the effects of the pandemic peak. This report provides an overview of the global economic costs to date and the response by governments and international institutions to address these effects."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The World Health Organization (WHO) first declared COVID-19 a world health emergency in January 2020. Since the virus was first diagnosed in Wuhan, China, it has been detected in over 190 countries and all U.S. states. In early March, the focal point of infections shifted from China to Europe, especially Italy, but by April 2020, the focus shifted to the United States, where the number of infections was accelerating. The infection has sickened more than 4.5 million people, about one-third in the United States, with thousands of fatalities. More than 80 countries have closed their borders to arrivals from countries with infections, ordered businesses to close, instructed their populations to self-quarantine, and closed schools to an estimated 1.5 billion children. ", "Over the eight-week period from mid-March to mid-May 2020, more than 36.5 million Americans filed for unemployment insurance. On May 8, 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April 2020, pushing the total number of unemployed Americans to 23 million, out of a total civilian labor force of 156 million. The increase pushed the national unemployment rate to 14.7%, the highest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Preliminary data also indicate that U.S. GDP fell by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2020, the largest quarterly decline in GDP since the fourth quarter of 2008 during the global financial crisis. ", "In Europe, over 30 million people in Germany, France, the UK, Spain, and Italy have applied for state support of their wages, while first quarter 2020 data indicate that the Eurozone economy contracted by 3.8% at an annual rate, the largest quarterly decline since the series started in 1995. The European Commission released its economic forecast on May 6, 2020, which projects that EU economic growth in 2020 will contract by 7.4% and only partially recover in 2021. Foreign investors have pulled an estimated $26 billion out of developing Asian economies and more than $16 billion out of India, increasing concerns of a major economic recession in Asia. Some estimates indicate that 29 million people in Latin America could fall into poverty, reversing a decade of efforts to narrow income inequality. ", "The pandemic crisis is challenging governments to implement monetary and fiscal policies that support credit markets and sustain economic activity, while they are implementing policies to develop vaccines and safeguard their citizens. In doing so, however, differences in policy approaches are straining relations between countries that promote nationalism and those that argue for a coordinated international response. Differences in policies are also straining relations between developed and developing economies and between northern and southern members of the Eurozone, challenging alliances, and raising questions about the future of global leadership.", "After a delayed response, central banks and monetary authorities are engaging in an ongoing series of interventions in financial markets and national governments are announcing fiscal policy initiatives to stimulate their economies. International organizations are also taking steps to provide loans and other financial assistance to countries in need. These and other actions have been labeled \"unprecedented,\" a term that has been used frequently to describe the pandemic and the policy responses. ", "As one measure of the global fiscal and monetary responses, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that government spending and revenue measures to sustain economic activity adopted through mid-April 2020 amounted to $3.3 trillion and that loans, equity injections and guarantees totaled an additional $4.5 trillion. The IMF also estimates that the increase in borrowing by governments globally will rise from 3.7% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019 to 9.9% in 2020, as indicated in Figure 1 . Among developed economies, the fiscal balance to GDP ratio is projected to rise from 3.0% in 2019 to 10.7% in 2020; the ratio for the United States is projected to rise from 5.8% to 15.7%. According to the IMF, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom have each announced public sector support measures totaling more than 10% of their annual GDP. For developing economies, the fiscal balance to GDP ratio is projected to rise from 4.8% to 9.1%, significantly increasing their debt burden and raising prospects of defaults or debt rescheduling. According to some estimates, the most fiscally vulnerable countries are: Argentina, Venezuela, Lebanon, Jordan, Iran, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.", "Among central banks, the Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps not experienced since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis to address the growing economic effects of COVID-19. The U.S. Congress also has approved historic fiscal spending packages. In other countries, central banks have lowered interest rates and reserve requirements, announced new financing facilities, relaxed capital buffers and, in some cases, countercyclical capital buffers, adopted after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, potentially freeing up an estimated $5 trillion in funds. Capital buffers were raised after the financial crisis to assist banks in absorbing losses and staying solvent during financial crises. In some cases, governments have directed banks to freeze dividend payments and halt pay bonuses. ", "On March 11, the WHO announced that the outbreak was officially a pandemic, the highest level of health emergency. A growing list of economic indicators makes it clear that the outbreak is negatively affecting global economic growth on a scale that has not been experienced since at least the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Global trade and GDP are forecast to decline sharply at least through the first half of 2020. The global pandemic is affecting a broad swath of international economic and trade activities, from services generally to tourism and hospitality, medical supplies and other global value chains, consumer electronics, and financial markets to energy, transportation, food, and a range of social activities, to name a few. The health and economic crises could have a particularly negative impact on the economies of developing countries that are constrained by limited financial resources and where health systems could quickly become overloaded. ", "Without a clear understanding of when the global health and economic effects may peak and a greater understanding of the impact on economies, forecasts must necessarily be considered preliminary. Similarly, estimates of when any recovery might begin and the speed of the recovery are speculative. Efforts to reduce social interaction to contain the spread of the virus are disrupting the daily lives of most Americans and adding to the economic costs. Increasing rates of unemployment are raising the prospects of wide-spread social unrest and demonstrations in developed economies where lost incomes and health insurance are threatening living standards and in developing economies where populations reportedly are growing concerned over access to basic necessities and the prospects of rising levels of poverty. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres argued in a video conference before the U.N. Security Council on April 10, 2020, that the ", "pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security\u00e2\u0080\u0094potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Forecasts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Global Growth", "paragraphs": ["The economic situation remains highly fluid. Uncertainty about the length and depth of the health crisis-related economic effects are fueling perceptions of risk and volatility in financial markets and corporate decision-making. In addition, uncertainties concerning the global pandemic and the effectiveness of public policies intended to curtail its spread are adding to market volatility. In a growing number of cases, corporations are postponing investment decisions, laying off workers who previously had been furloughed, and in some cases filing for bankruptcy. Compounding the economic situation is a historic drop in the price of crude oil that reflects the global decline in economic activity and prospects for disinflation, while also contributing to the decline of the global economy through various channels. On April 29, 2020, Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell stated that the Federal Reserve would use its \"full range of tools\" to support economic activity as the U.S. economic growth rate dropped 4.8% at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2020. In assessing the state of the U.S. economy, the Federal Open Market Committee released a statement indicating that, \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.\"", "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on March 2, 2020, lowered its forecast of global economic growth by 0.5% for 2020 from 2.9% to 2.4%, based on the assumption that the economic effects of the virus would peak in the first quarter of 2020 (see Table 1 ). However, the OECD estimated that if the economic effects of the virus did not peak in the first quarter, which is now apparent that it did not, global economic growth would increase by 1.5% in 2020. That forecast now seems to have been highly optimistic. ", "On March 23, 2020, OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria stated that", "The sheer magnitude of the current shock introduces an unprecedented complexity to economic forecasting. The OECD Interim Economic Outlook, released on March 2, 2020, made a first attempt to take stock of the likely impact of COVID-19 on global growth, but it now looks like we have already moved well beyond even the more severe scenario envisaged then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. [T]he pandemic has also set in motion a major economic crisis that will burden our societies for years to come.", "On March 26, 2020, the OECD revised its global economic forecast based on the mounting effects of the pandemic and measures governments have adopted to contain the spread of the virus. According to the updated estimate, the current containment measures could reduce global GDP by 2.0% per month, or an annualized rate of 24%, approaching the level of economic contraction not experienced since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The OECD estimates in Table 1 will be revised when the OECD releases updated country-specific data.", "Labeling the projected decline in global economic activity as the \"Great Lockdown,\" the IMF released an updated forecast on April 14, 2020. The IMF concluded that the global economy would experience its \"worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago.\" In addition, the IMF estimated that the global economy could decline by 3.0% in 2020, before growing by 5.8% in 2021; global trade is projected to fall in 2020 by 11.0% and oil prices are projected to fall by 42%, also shown in Table 1 . This forecast assumes that the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that the containment measures can be reversed quickly. The IMF also stated that many countries are facing a multi-layered crisis that includes a health crisis, a domestic economic crisis, falling external demand, capital outflows, and a collapse in commodity prices. In combination, these various effects are interacting in ways that make forecasting difficult. ", "Advanced economies as a group are forecast to experience an economic contraction in 2020 of 7.8% of GDP, with the U.S. economy projected by the IMF to decline by 5.9%, about twice the rate of decline experienced in 2009 during the financial crisis, as indicated in Figure 2 . The rate of economic growth in the Euro area is projected to decline by 7.5% of GDP. Most developing and emerging economies are projected to experience a decline in the rate of economic growth of 2.0%, reflecting tightening global financial conditions and falling global trade and commodity prices. In contrast, China, India, and Indonesia are projected to experience small, but positive rates of economic growth in 2020. The IMF also argues that recovery of the global economy could be weaker than projected as a result of: lingering uncertainty about possible contagion, lack of confidence, and permanent closure of businesses and shifts in the behavior of firms and households.", "As a result of the various challenges, the IMF qualified its forecast by arguing that", "A partial recovery is projected for 2021, with above trend growth rates, but the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound. Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely. This would follow if the pandemic and containment measures last longer, emerging and developing economies are even more severely hit, tight financial conditions persist, or if widespread scarring effects emerge due to firm closures and extended unemployment.", "Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the global economy was struggling to regain a broad-based recovery as a result of the lingering impact of growing trade protectionism, trade disputes among major trading partners, falling commodity and energy prices, and economic uncertainties in Europe over the impact of the UK withdrawal from the European Union. Individually, each of these issues presented a solvable challenge for the global economy. Collectively, however, the issues weakened the global economy and reduced the available policy flexibility of many national leaders, especially among the leading developed economies. In this environment, COVID-19 could have an outsized impact. While the level of economic effects will eventually become clearer, the response to the pandemic could have a significant and enduring impact on the way businesses organize their work forces, global supply chains, and how governments respond to a global health crisis. ", "The OECD estimates that increased direct and indirect economic costs through global supply chains, reduced demand for goods and services, and declines in tourism and business travel mean that, \"the adverse consequences of these developments for other countries (non-OECD) are significant.\" Global trade, measured by trade volumes, slowed in the last quarter of 2019 and had been expected to decline further in 2020, as a result of weaker global economic activity associated with the pandemic, which is negatively affecting economic activity in various sectors, including airlines, hospitality, ports, and the shipping industry. ", "According to the OECD's updated forecast", "The greatest impact of the containment restrictions will be on retail and wholesale trade, and in professional and real estate services, although there are notable differences between countries. Business closures could reduce economic output in advanced and major emerging economies by 15% or more; other emerging economies could experience a decline in output of 25%. Countries dependent on tourism could be affected more severely, while countries with large agricultural and mining sectors could experience less severe effects. Economic effects likely will vary across countries reflecting differences in the timing and degree of containment measures. ", "In addition, the OECD argues that China's emergence as a global economic actor marks a significant departure from previous global health episodes. China's growth, in combination with globalization and the interconnected nature of economies through capital flows, supply chains, and foreign investment, magnify the cost of containing the spread of the virus through quarantines and restrictions on labor mobility and travel. China's global economic role and globalization mean that trade is playing a role in spreading the economic effects of COVID-19. More broadly, the economic effects of the pandemic are being spread through three trade channels: (1) directly through supply chains as reduced economic activity is spread from intermediate goods producers to finished goods producers; (2) as a result of a drop overall in economic activity, which reduces demand for goods in general, including imports; and (3) through reduced trade with commodity exporters that supply producers, which, in turn, reduces their imports and negatively affects trade and economic activity of exporters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Global Trade", "paragraphs": ["According to an April 8, 2020, forecast by the World Trade Organization (WTO), global trade volumes are projected to decline between 13% and 32% in 2020 as a result of the economic impact of COVID-19, as indicated in Table 2 . The WTO argues that the wide range in the forecast represents the high degree of uncertainty concerning the length and economic impact of the pandemic and that the actual economic outcome could be outside this range, either higher or lower. The WTO's more optimistic scenario assumes that trade volumes recover quickly in the second half of 2020 to their pre-pandemic trend, or that the global economy experiences a V-shaped recovery. The more pessimistic scenario assumes a partial recovery that lasts into 2021, or that global economic activity experiences more of a U-shaped recovery. The WTO concludes, however, that the impact on global trade volumes could exceed the drop in global trade during the height of the 2008-2009 financial crisis. ", "The estimates indicate that all geographic regions will experience a double-digit drop in trade volumes, except for \"other regions,\" which consists of Africa, the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. North America and Asia could experience the steepest declines in export volumes. The forecast also projects that sectors with extensive value chains, such as automobile products and electronics, could experience the steepest declines. Although services are not included in the WTO forecast, this segment of the economy could experience the largest disruption as a consequence of restrictions on travel and transport and the closure of retail and hospitality establishments. Such services as information technology, however, are growing to satisfy the demand of employees who are working from home."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic Policy Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The challenge for policymakers has been one of implementing targeted policies that address what had been expected to be short-term problems without creating distortions in economies that can outlast the impact of the virus itself. Policymakers, however, are being overwhelmed by the quickly changing nature of the global health crisis that appears to be turning into a global trade and economic crisis whose effects on the global economy are escalating. As the economic effects of the pandemic grow, policymakers are giving more weight to policies that address the immediate economic effects at the expense of longer-term considerations such as debt accumulation. Initially, many policymakers had felt constrained in their ability to respond to the crisis as a result of limited flexibility for monetary and fiscal support within conventional standards, given the broad-based synchronized slowdown in global economic growth, especially in manufacturing and trade that had developed prior to the viral outbreak. The pandemic is also affecting global politics as world leaders are cancelling international meetings, competing for medical supplies, and some nations reportedly are stoking conspiracy theories that shift blame to other countries.", "Initially, the economic effects of the virus were expected to be short-term supply issues as factory output fell because workers were quarantined to reduce the spread of the virus through social interaction. The drop in economic activity, initially in China, has had international repercussions as firms experienced delays in supplies of intermediate and finished goods through supply chains. Concerns are growing, however, that virus-related supply shocks are creating more prolonged and wide-ranging demand shocks as reduced activity by consumers and businesses leads to a lower rate of economic growth. As demand shocks unfold, businesses experience reduced activity and profits and potentially escalating and binding credit and liquidity constraints. While manufacturing firms are experiencing supply chain shocks, reduced consumer activity through social distancing is affecting the services sector of the economy, which accounts for two-thirds of annual U.S. economic output. In this environment, manufacturing and service firms have tended to hoard cash, which affects market liquidity. In response, central banks have lowered interest rates where possible and expanded lending facilities to provide liquidity to financial markets and to firms potentially facing insolvency.", "The longer the economic effects persist, the greater the economic impacts are likely to be as the effects are spread through trade and financial linkages to an ever-broadening group of countries, firms and households. These growing economic effects potentially increase liquidity constraints and credit market tightening in global financial markets as firms hoard cash, with negative fallout effects on economic growth. At the same time, financial markets are factoring in an increase in government bond issuance in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere as government debt levels are set to rise to meet spending obligations during an expected economic recession and increased fiscal spending to fight the effects of COVID-19. Unlike the 2008-2009 financial crisis, reduced demand by consumers, labor market issues, and a reduced level of activity among businesses, rather than risky trading by global banks, has led to corporate credit issues and potential insolvency. These market dynamics have led some observers to question if these events mark the beginning of a full-scale global financial crisis.", "Liquidity and credit market issues present policymakers with a different set of challenges than addressing supply-side constraints. As a result, the focus of government policy has expanded from a health crisis to macroeconomic and financial market issues that are being addressed through a combination of monetary, fiscal, and other policies, including border closures, quarantines, and restrictions on social interactions. Essentially, while businesses are attempting to address worker and output issues at the firm level, national leaders are attempting to implement fiscal policies to prevent economic growth from falling sharply by assisting workers and businesses that are facing financial strains, and central bankers are adjusting monetary policies to address mounting credit market issues. ", "In the initial stages of the health crisis, households did not experience the same kind of wealth losses they saw during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the value of their primary residence dropped sharply. However, with unemployment numbers rising rapidly, job losses could result in defaults on mortgages and delinquencies on rent payments, unless financial institutions provide loan forbearance or there is a mechanism to provide financial assistance. In turn, mortgage defaults could negatively affect the market for mortgage-backed securities, the availability of funds for mortgages, and negatively affect the overall rate of economic growth. Losses in the value of most equity markets in the U.S., Asia, and Europe could also affect household wealth, especially that of retirees living on a fixed income and others who own equities. Investors that trade in mortgage-backed securities reportedly have been reducing their holdings while the Federal Reserve has been attempting to support the market. In the current environment, even traditional policy tools, such as monetary accommodation, apparently have not been processed by markets in a traditional manner, with equity market indices displaying heightened, rather than lower, levels of uncertainty following the Federal Reserve's cut in interest rates. Such volatility is adding to uncertainties about what governments can do to address weaknesses in the global economy.

Investors have searched for safe-haven investments, such as the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year security, which experienced a historic drop in yield to below 1% on March 3, 2020. In response to concerns that the global economy was in a freefall, the Federal Reserve lowered key interest rates on March 3, 2020, to shore up economic activity, while the Bank of Japan engaged in asset purchases to provide short-term liquidity to Japanese banks; Japan's government indicated it would also assist workers with wage subsidies. The Bank of Canada also lowered its key interest rate.

From March 23 to April 15, the DJIA moved higher by18%, paring its initial losses by half. Since then, the DJIA has moved erratically as investors have weighed news about the human cost and economic impact of the pandemic and the prospects of various medical treatments. For some policymakers, the drop in equity prices has raised concerns that foreign investors might attempt to exploit the situation by increasing their purchases of firms in sectors considered important to national security. For instance, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, urged EU members to better screen foreign investments, especially in areas such as health, medical research, and critical infrastructure.", "Similar to the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, central banks have implemented a series of monetary operations to provide liquidity to their economies. These actions, however, initially were not viewed entirely positively by all financial market participants who questioned the use of policy tools by central banks that are similar to those employed during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, despite the fact that the current and previous crisis are fundamentally different in origin. During the previous financial crisis, central banks intervened to restart credit and spending by banks that had engaged in risky assets. In the current environment, central banks are attempting to address financial market volatility and prevent large-scale corporate insolvencies that reflect the underlying economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. ", "Similar to conditions during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar has emerged as the preferred currency by investors, reinforcing its role as the dominant global reserve currency. As indicated in Figure 4 , the dollar appreciated more than 3.0% during the period between March 3 and March 13, 2020, reflecting increased international demand for the dollar and dollar-denominated assets. Since the highs reached on March 23, the dollar has given up some of its value against other currencies, but has remained about 10% higher than it was at the beginning of the year. According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the dollar accounts for 88% of global foreign exchange market turnover and is key in funding an array of financial transactions, including serving as an invoicing currency to facilitate international trade. It also accounts for two-thirds of central bank foreign exchange holdings, half of non-U.S. banks foreign currency deposits, and two-thirds of non-U.S. corporate borrowings from banks and the corporate bond market. As a result, disruptions in the smooth functioning of the global dollar market can have wide-ranging repercussions on international trade and financial transactions. ", "The international role of the dollar also increases pressure on the Federal Reserve essentially to assume the lead role as the global lender of last resort. Reminiscent of the financial crisis, the global economy has experienced a period of dollar shortage, requiring the Federal Reserve to take numerous steps to ensure the supply of dollars to the U.S. and global economies, including activating existing currency swap arrangements, establishing such arrangements with additional central banks, and creating new financial facilities to provide liquidity to central banks and monetary authorities. Typically, banks lend long-term and borrow short-term and can only borrow from their home central bank. In turn, central banks can only provide liquidity in their own currency. Consequently, a bank can become illiquid in a panic, meaning it cannot borrow in private markets to meet short-term cash flow needs. Swap lines are designed to allow foreign central banks the funds necessary to provide needed liquidity to their country's banks in dollars.

On March 5, the U.S. Congress passed a $8 billion spending bill to provide assistance for health care, sick leave, small business loans, and international assistance.

The German justices argued that the ECB had exceeded its authority by not fully evaluating the economic costs and benefits of previous bond-buying activities, including the impact on national budgets, property values, stock markets, life insurance and other economic effects. The German court also argued that the ECB's lack of a strategy for reducing its holdings of sovereign debt of Eurozone members increased risks for national governments that back up the ECB, and it challenged the ECB's strategy for reducing its holdings of sovereign debt.

U.S. shale oil producers, who are not represented by OPEC, support the move to raise prices. An unwillingness by Russia to agree to output reductions added to other downward pressures on oil prices and caused Saudi Arabia to engage in a price war with Russia that has driven oil prices below $25 per barrel at times, half the estimated $50 per barrel break-even point for most oil producing countries. Rising oil supplies and falling demand are combining to create an estimated surplus of 25 million barrels a day and could soon overwhelm storage capacity and challenge the viability of U.S. shale oil production. In 2019, low energy prices combined with high debt levels reportedly caused U.S. energy producers to reduce their spending on capital equipment, reduced their profits and, in some cases, led to bankruptcies.
