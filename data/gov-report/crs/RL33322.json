Some analysts saythe yuan needs to rise by as much as 40% in order to reflect its equilibrium value. Critics say thatChina's undervalued currency provides it with an unfair trade advantage that has seriously injuredthe manufacturing sector in the United States. Chinese officials counter that they have not peggedthe yuan to the dollar in order to gain trade advantages. Rather, they say the fixed rate promoteseconomic stability that is vital for the functioning of its domestic economy.", "On July 21, 2005, China announced a new foreign exchange system which is intended toallow more flexibility and to permit the international value of the yuan to be established by marketforces. The yuan was increased in value by 2% and a \"managed float\" was introduced. However,the value of the yuan has changed little since then. Despite the publication of many studies, scholarsdo not agree whether or by what percent the yuan is undervalued. The wide range of estimatessuggests that there is no reason to believe that any particular figure is correct. It is not clear that theU.S. trade deficit would be lower or U.S. manufacturers would benefit if China raised the value ofthe yuan. In the short run, U.S. producers might be able to sell higher-priced products to U.S.consumers if the inflow of Chinese goods were reduced. In the long run, though, as long as the United States is a net importer of capital, it would have a trade deficit and other countries wouldultimately replace China as suppliers of low-cost goods to the U.S. market.", "The Treasury Department has strongly urged China in recent years to adopt procedures thatwould allow the yuan to rise in value. Congress is considering legislation that would penalize Chinaif its currency is not revalued. The United States has pursued the yuan-dollar exchange rate issueas a bilateral U.S.-China issue. Other countries are also affected by the presumably undervaluedyuan -- some more than the U.S. -- but they have allowed the United States to take the lead.", "There are at least five ways the United States could deal with the yuan exchange rate issue. Some of these would involve other countries more explicitly in the process. First, the UnitedStates could continue pressing China publicly to raise the value of the yuan on the assumption thatchange will not occur without foreign pressure. Second, it could stop pressing China publicly, on theexpectation that China might move more rapidly towards reform if it is not pressured. Third, theUnited States could restrict imports from China pending action to revalue the yuan. Fourth, the U.S.could ask the IMF to declare that China is manipulating its currency in violation of IMF rules. Fifth,the United States could refer the issue to the World Trade Organization (WTO), asserting that theUnited States has been injured by unfair trade practices linked to the undervaluation of China'scurrency. The WTO, in turn, could authorize trade remedies (tariffs on Chinese goods, for example)aimed at correcting this abuse.

Many believe thatChina's national currency, the yuan or renminbi (RMB), may be seriously undervalued compared tothe dollar and other major currencies. (1) The United States and other countries have urged China to raisethe value of its currency. Chinese officials say they want to make their exchange rate system moreflexible, but they say China also needs long-term stability in its currency value in order to avoidinternal dislocations. Discussion of this question has taken place at the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and at other multilateral fora such as the periodic meetings of the G-8 (the seven largestindustrial countries plus Russia.) The United States and other countries have also spoken directlyto China on a bilateral basis about this issue. ", "The key issue is what -- if the yuan is undervalued -- China and the world should do aboutit. China is undergoing a major shift from a state-dominated to a market-based economy. It haspursued a policy of export-led growth in order to generate the employment and income necessaryto facilitate change in the overall structure of its economy. It has priced its currency in order tofacilitate that policy.", "In July 2005, China adopted reforms aimed at giving market forces a possible role in thevaluation of the yuan. Most observers say the initial changes (a 2% rise in value) were too small andthey note that little change has occurred since. Chinese officials retain firm control over themechanisms which produce the yuan-dollar exchange rate and the criteria they use in this processremain opaque. International discussions have sought to persuade China to accelerate the process but-- while the concerns of other countries may bear weight in the thinking of Chinese officials -- thereare no effective \"teeth\" in the International Monetary Fund that could compel China to change itspolicies and procedures more rapidly than it wishes to do so.", "Many in the United States believe that the large volume of Chinese exports to the UnitedStates is damaging the U.S. manufacturing sector and feeding the U.S. trade deficit. They believethat the undervalued yuan is an important reason why China is able to price its goods socompetitively and why production in many areas is shifting to China. Other analysts believe that --by virtue of its undervalued currency -- China is damaging the world trading system and denyingexport opportunities to other countries whose currencies are more fairly priced. Congress isconsidering legislation which would place countervailing duties or special tariffs on Chinese goodsentering the U.S. in order to offset the trade benefits China presumably gains from its presentexchange rate policies. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "This Report in Four Parts", "paragraphs": ["Events and Issues. This report has four parts. The first part discusses the issues and events surrounding the yuan-dollar controversy. It describesthe actions which Chinese authorities have taken to revalue the yuan and, arguably, to lay thegroundwork for a larger future role for market forces in its valuation. It also describes the methodsthe Chinese authorities have used and still use to hold the value of the yuan at the level they prefer. This section discusses the efforts the International Monetary Fund, the U.S. Government and othergovernments have made to encourage or press China to revalue its currency. It also reviews the U.S.Treasury Department's discussion of China in its semi-annual report on currency manipulation andlegislation currently pending in Congress which would levy special duties on Chinese goods if theyuan is not increased considerably in value.", "Five Questions which Frame the Controversy. The second part of this report looks at five central questions. First, is the yuan undervalued and,if so, by how much? This question may be harder to answer than many people assume. Mosteconomists agree the yuan is undervalued, but the 17 studies reviewed in this report show widelydifferent conclusions. Some say the yuan is slightly overvalued , others say it is 15% or 25% orperhaps 49% undervalued , while several say it is impossible to make an accurate computation. Thedata are poor, China is changing rapidly, and scholars use different assumptions in their studies. Moreover, new economic data published in December 2005 seem to render all previous studiesobsolete, as they give a very different picture of the Chinese economy than was available before. Inrecent studies, IMF experts say the yuan is undervalued but they also say it is impossible to knowhow large the distortion might be. The IMF also says that it is impossible to separate the tradeeffects of that distortion from the other factors (labor costs, productivity, etc.) which also affect theprice of Chinese goods.", "Without some objective way of determining what the \"real\" value of the yuan might be, itmay be difficult for China and other countries to agree what size increase is \"enough.\" Likewise,without knowing the proper rate, it might be difficult to design special U.S. tariffs which the worldwould consider fair and compensatory rather than arbitrary or punitive. It might be helpful if China,the United States and other countries could agree on criteria by which to decide how an appropriateexchange rate for the dollar and yuan might be determined. ", "Second, does China manipulate the value of the yuan? The IMF rules state that countriesmay not manipulate the value of their currency in order to gain unfair trade advantage. The secondsection of this report examines China's behavior in light of the five standards the IMF uses to judgewhether manipulation is taking place. The IMF has not publicly declared that China is manipulatingits currency. China's actions seem to meet four of the IMF's criteria in this regard. The IMF has noevident means other than persuasion to make countries comply with its rules. In this context, it isnot clear that an IMF announcement that China was violating its rules would help or hinder thecurrent discussions aimed at persuading China to raise the value of the yuan. ", "Third, how fast could China revalue the yuan if it wanted to? Theoretically, the People'sBank of China could raise the exchange value of the yuan to any specified level overnight. However, Chinese officials are concerned about the growth and employment effects any change in the valueof the yuan may have on their economy. A too-rapid increase might have serious negative effectson employment, output and growth. Some also worry that \"hot money\" could complicate the processof revaluation and may require China to delay any changes until the perceived speculative pressureabates. Many experts believe that a gradual and measured approach to currency revaluation isappropriate for China. The IMF says, for example, that emerging market countries generally do nothandle rapid and large exchange rate movements well and that serious dislocations can occur. Othersbelieve, however, that basic fairness to other countries requires China to raise the value of itscurrency. Some analysts believe China could suffer serious damage to its economy if it does notchange is economic strategy. Its heavy reliance on export-led growth makes it vulnerable, forexample, to a slowdown in world demand. Higher currency values would stimulate growth of itsdomestic economy. ", "Fourth, has China \"cooked the books\" in terms of its trade surplus? Some analystsbelieve that China's actual net income from trade is many times larger than that which China'spublishes in its official trade statistics. Data published by the IMF show that, while China reportsthat it had a net trade surplus of $41 billion in 2004, its trading partners report that they had acombined trade deficit of $267 billion with China. Some people say that a trade surplus this largeis proof that China's currency is substantially undervalued. ", "Others would ask, however, where -- if China is accruing an extra $200 billion annually intrade income beyond the amounts accounted for in its balance of payments figures -- that moneymight be. It might be hard, for example, for China to hide all this additional income year after yearin secret undeclared foreign exchange reserves without somebody discovering that it exists. ", "Trade data for other countries also show (though on a smaller scale) this same mismatchbetween the amount reported by exporter countries and the amounts reported by those who importtheir products. Bad data collection by individual countries and methodological problems in thereporting system seem to be better explanations for these discrepancies than is the uniform prospectthat exporters fudge their data while importers report their incoming trade data correctly. ", "Fifth, would the U.S. economy benefit if China revalued the yuan? Correcting theinternational value of the yuan may improve the efficiency of international trade. But will it reducethe U.S. trade deficit and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing sector? Most economists believe not. The U.S. and Chinese economies have become increasingly interdependent in recent years. Chinais pursuing a policy of export-led growth and the United States provides a ready market for its goods. Meanwhile, the United States imports large quantities of capital from abroad (by borrowing or byopening its economy to foreign investment) and -- in order (more money chasing the same quantityof goods) to avoid turning that imported money into inflation -- it must also import goods andservices for the imported money to buy. If China raised the value of the yuan, its exports to theUnited States would likely shrink and the amount of money it could place in the U.S. economywould decline. ", "Multinational firms based in the United States are a major presence in the Chinese economyand a large share of China's exports to the United States are produced by or mediated through thosefirms. For them, the undervalued yuan provides major benefits because it keeps down theirproduction costs and it enables them to produce things which might be too costly to produce in theUnited States. U.S. consumers who purchase the output from these facilities in China are able to getmore product at a lower cost than they would be able to get if the products were produceddomestically or if the value of the yuan were higher. These firms say they need to produce someof their output in low-cost places such as China and they would move their facilities elsewhere (butnot back to the United States) if China were no longer available to them. ", "On the other hand, many U.S.-based small and medium size enterprises cannot or wish notto move their operations abroad. For them, the undervalued yuan is a major threat to theircommercial viability and their bottom line. To compete with goods produced in China, they mustreduce their costs (perhaps by economizing on labor or lowering their profit margins), find non-pricebased reasons for consumers to prefer their products to those produced abroad, merge some of theiroperations with similarly affected domestic firms, or seek some type of political remedy to shieldthem from the foreign competition. ", "Temporarily, if exports from China were restricted because of trade legislation, U.S.producers might be able to take over some of the market (albeit at higher prices) previously suppliedby China. From a longer perspective, though, it is likely that multinational firms would shift muchof their production to other low-cost countries and these would ramp up their exports in order tosupply the U.S. market previously supplied by Chinese goods. The inflow of foreign goods mightdecline and U.S. manufactured goods might be more competitive in U.S. and foreign markets if theU.S. savings rate increased, the United States borrowed less and received fewer investments fromabroad, and the international value of the dollar declined. (2) However, this would require major changes in American economicbehavior which cannot be easily legislated. ", "It is difficult to know on a net basis whether the U.S. economy benefits or whether on a netbasis it is hurt from the low cost of products it imports from China. The interests of the large andsmall-to-medium sized firms appear to conflict and the interests of U.S. consumers seem to conflictin some ways with the interests of some U.S. producers of products which compete with Chineseexports. From an economic point of view, the profit margins realized by the Chinese exportersappear to be relatively small whereas the profit margins earned by the distributors of those productsin the United States may be higher. Meanwhile, though the data are not clear, many experts believethat on a trade-weighted basis, the U.S. producers benefit more from their exports to China thanChinese exporters do on their sales to the United States. At the same time, China's investments inthe United States provide badly needed capital which helps spur growth in the American economyat the same time that the growing volume of debt owed to foreigners increases the internationalexposure of the U.S. economy. Weighing all of these factors together in order to determine on anoverall basis whether the undervalued yuan is a benefit or burden to the U.S. economy is a difficulttask. ", "Three Dilemmas for China. The third section ofthis report looks at some of the monetary and financial dilemmas which affect China's views aboutexchange rate policy. First, what should China do about its foreign exchange (forex) reserves? Chinahas $819 billion in foreign exchange reserves (rough 70% in dollars). These are an important sourceof income, influence, and future spending power. However, they are also a problem. For one thing,the growth in China's forex reserves fuels domestic inflation. For every dollar the People's Bank ofChina buys (to hold down the value of the yuan and to increase its reserves), it injects 8 yuan intoChina's economy. China's reserves grew by $100 billion in 2005, so this is a lot of new \"printingpress\" money. The central bank has tried with limited success to bottle up the inflationary effect ofthis money with public debt transactions and tight monetary policy. If China raised the value of theyuan, the growth in its foreign exchange reserves would slow or stop and -- if it relaxed its monetarypolicy -- the growth and reform prospects of its internal economy might be enhanced. ", "On the other hand, revaluation would cost China a great deal of money. If the yuan increasedin value by 20%, the purchasing power of China's foreign reserves would go down corresponding. It would lose, from China's perspective, about 1.3 trillion yuan (about $200 billion) in purchasingpower. If China began withdrawing assets from the U.S. market and converting them to othercurrencies, in order to reduce its exposure, it would lose money because its actions would push downthe value of the securities and the dollars it sold. When it purchased other currencies and foreignassets to replace its former U.S. holdings, it would lose money again because its actions would alsopush up their prices. Chinese officials may want to reduce the inflationary pressure which comesfrom growth in their foreign exchange reserves but they may not be happy about the prospect ofmajor financial losses if they revalue or if they move their current assets elsewhere.", "Second, where is the money coming from that fuels those growing reserves? Many peoplebelieve that exports and incoming foreign investment account for most of the increase in China'sforeign exchange reserves. Some suggest, however, that \"hot money\" -- speculative inflows offoreign funds seeking to profit from revaluation of the yuan -- may account for most of the growthin China's reserves. ", "Depending on the source of the money, the policy implications for China are very different. If trade and investment are the main source of the funds, then -- if Chinese officials want to slow thegrowth in reserves -- they should raise the value of the yuan. However, if speculative inflows arethe primary source, then China's policy choices are more difficult. A large quick revaluation wouldstop the speculative pressure but it might also damage China's economy. Gradual increases wouldallow the Chinese economy to adjust but it might also encourage speculators to bring more moneyinto China in hopes of profiting as the currency goes up in value. A refusal to consider any changein the value might discourage the speculators over a long period of time. But if the status quoprevailed during that period, this would also make China's trading partners angry and give themreasons to doubt whether Chinese officials are sincere when they say they want to revalue the yuan. ", "Third, would revaluation strengthen or weaken China's banking system? China's banksare riddled with bad debt and their competitiveness weakened by years of state control. If the yuanwere increased in value, would the shock cause Chinese banks to strengthen their procedures orwould it put the system at risk? A change in exchange rates which weakened the export sectorwithout simultaneously stimulating domestic commerce could hold bad news for China's banks.", "Some experts point out that Chinese banks hold only a small portion of their assets in foreigncurrencies and the government has recently established asset management companies (similar to themechanisms the U.S. Government used in the 1980s to resolve the U.S. savings and loan crisis) totake bad debt off the books of the banks. However, export-related activities account for a majorshare of the customers in China's banking system. Nevertheless, most experts agree that bad debts(non-performing assets) account for perhaps 30% of the assets of Chinese banks and they say thegovernment will need to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in yuan to recapitalize and restructurethe major banks. The IMF says that the strength of China's banking system should not be animpediment to a gradual increase in the value of the yuan. However, Chinese officials haveexpressed reservations and may not be willing to revalue the yuan very quickly until their concernsabout the impact on their national banking system have been alleviated. External pressure to revaluerapidly might be seen as an effort by foreigners to create more opportunities for their firms to buyailing Chinese banks. ", "Policy Options for the United States. The fourthpart of this report identifies five major options which U.S. policy-makers might consider if theywant to encourage China to revalue the yuan. They are not mutually exclusive, though it might bedifficult for some of them to be pursued simultaneously. ", "First, the United States could continue pressing China publicly for further changes in itsforeign exchange system, in order that the yuan's value would better reflect market conditions andeconomic realities. If Chinese reformers need outside pressure to help them persuade other officialsto consider reform, this strategy might help. Second, as a reciprocal of the first option, U.S.policy-makers might refrain from pressing China to move more quickly with its reforms. This mightbe an effective strategy if the Chinese proponents of change find that outside pressure strengthensthe hand of those resisting reform.", "Third, the United States could levy special tariffs on Chinese imports in an effort toencourage China to be more accommodating in their discussions with the United States about theyuan. However, such duties may violate WTO rules. Also, Chinese exporters may be able to absorbsome of the cost of the new duties. Further, if the yuan were revalued, the price of Chinese exportswould need not increase by the same rate as did the yuan. Chinese exports include a high proportionof inputs imported from other countries. The price of those inputs would not change if the yuan wentup in value. To break even, producers in China would only need to increase the price of their exportsby an amount which reflects the higher dollar-equivalent cost of Chinese-produced inputs and laborpaid in yuan.", "Fourth and fifth, the United States might refer the dollar-yuan controversy to the IMF or theWorld Trade Organization. As noted above, this issue has been discussed at the IMF for some time. Proposed changes in the power of the IMF might give it more authority over country exchange ratepolicies, including authority to address problems of manipulation. Whether China would be themain country affected, whether the United States and other countries would allow the IMF todetermine their exchange rates, and what impact these rule changes might have on the policies of thecountries with the world's largest economies are matters for speculation.", "An appeal to the WTO might be based on the grounds that China's undervalued currencyallegedly constitutes a subsidy to its export sector. The WTO can evaluate trade disputes and it canauthorize countries to levy trade penalties in order to enforce its decisions. However, it has noauthority to judge exchange rate issues. The WTO and IMF have an agreement, though, specifyingthat any exchange rate issues which arise in WTO deliberations shall be referred to the IMF and theIMF's decision shall be final. In effect, the WTO would be the enforcer if the IMF decided that acountry was manipulating its currency to gain unfair trade advantage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues and Events", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Yuan-Dollar Exchange Rate Issue", "paragraphs": ["The Controversy. In 1994, the People's Bank ofChina (PBC) lowered the value of its currency from 5.8 to about 8.7 yuan to the dollar. The rategradually settled by 1997 to 8.3 and was locked at that rate during the Asian financial crisis. In thepast dozen years, China's economy has grown substantially, both in size and in the level ofmodernization, and the proportion of its economy oriented towards exports has increasedconsiderably. One might expect that these changes would have had an impact as well on the relativeexchange value of China's currency, particularly its rate compared to the U.S. dollar as the UnitedStates became China's most important single export market. However, the value of the yuanremained largely unchanged during most of that period and it remained fixed at 8.3 yuan to the dollarafter 1997 as the People's Bank of China (PBC) sold yuan into the market in order to keep the yuan'svalue constant. Many argue that this constitutes manipulation.", "Arguments Pro and Con. Many argue that Chinais manipulating the value of its currency in order to gain unfair trade advantage. (3) They believe this has seriouslyinjured the manufacturing sector in the United States and contributed significantly to the U.S. tradedeficit. ", "The act of currency manipulation is often hard to see. However, the effect of manipulationon currency prices is more apparent. Critics of China's exchange rate policies argue that China'scurrency is perhaps 25% to 50% undervalued compared to the U.S. dollar. They cite various studieswhich support their view. They say the undervalued yuan adds to the U.S. trade deficit and hurtsU.S. output and employment. Many have urged the Administration to put pressure on China in orderto make it stop manipulating the yuan. They say China should either raise the value of the yuan byofficial action (\"revalue\") or let it trade freely in foreign exchange markets (\"float\") so that the freemarket can determine its real international value. ", "The issue of manipulation is controversial. The IMF says, in its Articles of Agreement(Article IV), that countries shall \"Avoid manipulating exchange rates or the international monetarysystem in order to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair competitiveadvantage over other members.\" (4) Member countries are supposed to comply with this requirement. In addition, the U.S. Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 requires that the Secretaryof the Treasury determine whether other countries \"manipulate the rate of exchange between theircurrency and the United States dollar for the purpose of preventing effective balance of paymentsadjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade.\" (5) ", "Chinese officials say they are not trying to gain unfair trade advantage with their foreignexchange policies. Rather, they are seeking economic stability. China is experiencing rapid andfar-reaching economic changes, they say. Major reforms in China's economic policies andinstitutions have taken place, in this view, but more are yet needed. The economy has grown rapidlyin the past decade, they say, but the distribution of the benefits has been uneven and the strainsbetween the needs of the old economy and the new economy are great. Meanwhile, they say, theexport sector is the engine of growth for the Chinese economy. ", "Chinese officials acknowledge that China's foreign exchange policies stimulate economicgrowth. However, they say, the goal is not the attainment of unfair trade advantage but rathercontinued growth in the export sector. Many Chinese export industries operate on very thin profitmargins, they report, and an increase in the value of the yuan would lead to widespread bankruptcies. China's export sector is the engine driving the growth and modernization of China's nationaleconomy. A downturn in that sector would lead to a slowdown in growth or even a decline in thenational economy as a whole. This could lead to widespread instability, they say, with potentiallyserious consequences. Thus, they believe, China's exchange rate policy is aimed at promotingstability in the country's export sector and economy as a whole. Achieving trade advantages throughundervaluation of the currency is only an instrumental means towards the achievement of this goal. From this point of view, efforts by foreigners to raise the exchange rate for China's currency areaimed not merely at the elimination of this trade advantage but at undercutting China's economic andpolitical stability and at thwarting its emergence as a great power.", "Chinese officials have not entered into the debate concerning the \"real\" value of China'scurrency, though some say there is no convincing evidence that the yuan is undervalued. They couldcite econometric studies (see below) which support the view that China's currency is slightlyovervalued or perhaps only a little undervalued compared to the dollar. ", "Many economists doubt that China's actions have had any appreciable impact on thelong-term value of the dollar. The dollar plays a broad role in international finance and the amountof dollars in circulation globally is very large. A recent survey by the world's leading central banksindicated that the daily trading of foreign currencies totals more than $1.9 trillion, 90% of which isin dollars. (6) ", "China Announces a Change. On July 21, 2005,China's central bank announced a new exchange rate system for China's currency. First, it increasedthe value of the yuan, which rose from 8.28 to 8.11 to the dollar. (7) Second, the yuan would bereferenced, not just to the dollar but to a basket of currencies, and it would be allowed to vary by0.3% each day above or below a central parity. Third, the central bank said that \"the closing priceof...the US dollar traded against the RMB [yuan]...after the closing...of the market each working day\"would become \"the central parity for the...following working day.\" (8) This seemed to be anexchange system which economists call a \"crawling peg.\" ", "If the new procedure had been allowed to function as announced, the yuan could haveincreased in value by 30% in five months. On July 27, 2005, however, the central bank announcedthat no further changes in the value of the yuan should be expected. Rather, it said, China's newsystem would be a \"managed float.\" The central bank would compare the value of the yuan to a\"basket\" of currencies issued by its major trading partners. However, the Chinese authorities madeit clear that they would decide what the value of the yuan would be and they would determine whenand how liberalization might occur. The yuan might fluctuate compared to other currencies, butthey said its dollar value would be fixed. ", "Too Small? To many observers, the 2% increasein the value of the yuan announced in July 2005 was too small and the process for possible futureincreases was too obscure and uncertain. Some might argue that the changes in the new systemreflect the current debate about economic policy within the Chinese leadership. Some Chineseofficials may believe that reform, including liberalization of the yuan, is in China's best interest. Others may believe that China must continue the policy of export-led growth and the advantages ofthe old system should not be disposed of lightly. ", "From this perspective, some might say the new system was adopted in order to buy time, todelay reform, and to forestall outside pressure. China was scheduled to discuss its exchange ratepolicies with the IMF executive board in August 2005 and the advent of a new system gave theChinese something new to present. The IMF board was critical of China's exchange rate policies in2004 and IMF staff had strongly urged China in mid-2005 to introduce market forces into China'sexchange rate regime. The change was also announced just before Congress was scheduled toconsider several bills which sought to put pressure on China if it did not revalue its currency. Arguably, a series of ambiguous steps which seemed to herald change might buy China time toconsider its options and lay its plans. It might give the IMF board a reason not to press for fasteraction and it might persuade Congress to postpone action on the pending bills. (9) ", "Alternatively, instead of seeing the new system as the product of internal debate, one mightsay that it is obscure because it seeks to confuse and frustrate speculators. The inflow of speculative\"hot money\" is serious. An official with China's State Administration of Foreign Exchangereportedly observed that \"Whether we [can] effectively refrain speculation on yuan is the key to thesuccess or failure of the reform.\" (10) If China wants to avoid instability and sharp changes incurrency prices, its actions must not invite speculators to bring in more foreign currency and buymore yuan. In effect, China faces a challenge of doing what the speculators expect -- increase thevalue of the yuan -- without encouraging them to capitalize on their expectations. ", "The old system offered speculators a one-way, no-risk bet, since there was little chance theyuan would fall in value whereas there seemed a real possibility that the value would eventually rise,perhaps substantially. This offered potentially large rewards to those who owned yuan oryuan-denominated assets. (11) The inflow of speculative money puts pressure on China torevalue the yuan to reduce the flow. (12) However, if the increase were not sudden and massive,speculators might be encouraged to buy more yuan in hopes of profiting as it goes up in value. Aslong as there is a general expectation that the yuan is underpriced and as long as these speculativeflows continue, Chinese officials are reluctant to allow the market to determine the yuan's value. They worry that it might increase too much in value (\"overshoot\") if it were opened suddenly tomarket forces and this could also have negative consequences for the Chinese and world economies. ", "New Initiatives Since July 2005. More recently,the Chinese authorities have taken other steps that could allow market forces to eventually play a rolein the valuation of the yuan. In mid-2005, they created a system of non-deliverable forwardcontracts which let individuals take positions and make predictions as to the future value of theyuan. (13) ", "In January 2006, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) authorized 13local and foreign banks (14) to buy and sell yuan for dollars in the yuan spot market. Anexperiment allowing some banks to trade yuan for euros and Hong Kong dollars had begun in 2005. The new arrangement is supposed to improve liquidity and allow market forces a role in thevaluation of the yuan. Under the new rule, the opening price for the yuan would be determined bythe average closing price of the 13 banks (with the two most extreme eliminated.) In principle, thiswould allow yuan to move up or down in value in response to market forces. However, observersassert that the central bank remains the biggest trader in the yuan-dollar market and any bank whichquotes too high a rate will be vulnerable if it floods the market with yuan in order to keep the rateat its preferred price. ", "In December 2005, the Chinese authorities took two additional steps that would either reducethe demand for yuan or increase the demand in China for dollars. The central bank announced thatit was raising the interest rate for deposits held in U.S. or Hong Kong dollars, widening the gapbetween those rates and those paid for accounts denominated in yuan. (15) This was aimed atdiscouraging speculators from buying yuan in hopes they can turn a profit by converting them backinto dollars if, in the near future, the yuan should increase substantially in value. ", "The central bank also announced that it would soon scrap the existing limits on the amountsthat Chinese firms could take out of the country. (16) This could marginally push down the value of the yuan whenChinese firms sold their national currency in order to purchase the dollars needed to expand theiroverseas operations.", "Market Expectations.

More flexibility is needed, they said, to avoid disruption of thedomestic economy.

A simple method would have one look at the price of asingle product in world markets, on the theory that properly functioning currency markets shouldadjust to equalize product costs. One example is the Economist 's well known \"Big Mac Index,\" alight-hearted procedure which compares the cost of McDonald's hamburgers around the world. (47) By its calculation, basedon the price of hamburgers sold in both markets, the yuan is 59% undervalued compared to the U.S.dollar. Most economists agree that this index provides only a general suggestion of the relativevaluation of currencies. (48) The disparity in hamburger prices around the world can also beread as a comment on the valuation of the U.S. dollar. The Economist says that the index shows thatthe U.S. dollar is more overvalued now, compared to most other currencies, than at any time sincemeasure was introduced 16 years ago.

He found in a later study (using the next year's data) that the yuan was5% overvalued in 2004. Another analyst found, using the same data, that the yuan was only slightlyundervalued in 2004. By contrast, other scholars have found, using essentially the same statistics,that the yuan has been substantially undervalued in recent years. One team concluded, for example,that the yuan was pegged (in a study using 2002 data) at a rate that 18%-49% and (in another studyusing 2003 data) 23% below its \"real\" value. Another researcher found, in a study using 2000 data,that the yuan was undervalued by 35% that year.

The claims by some that China's currency is grossly undervalued are incorrect, theyargue.

In the pastthirty years, the role of the IMF in the international financial system has changed. Until the early1970s, the IMF had a central role in determining world exchange rates. All currencies had a fixedvalue (\"par value\") compared to the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar was worth a specified amountof gold. If countries wanted to change their par value compared to the U.S. dollar, the IMF had tofirst approve. Since 1976, however, with passage of the Second Amendment to the IMF Articles ofAgreement, each country is free to determine the exchange rate system it will use. Some countrieshave floated the value of their currency in world money markets, others have fixed the value of theircurrency to that of another major country, and others have pursued a mixed strategy. ", "IMF Surveillance. The IMF is no longer thearbiter of world exchange rates. Rather, in the modern world, it exercises surveillance over exchangerates in order to encourage and to help countries comply with the basic rules. Article IV of the IMFcharter prohibits countries from manipulating their exchange rates in order to gain unfair tradeadvantage. It also says that \"the Fund shall exercise firm surveillance over the exchange rate policiesof members, and shall adopt specific principles for the guidance of all members with respect to thosepolicies.\" Its current principles for surveillance were adopted by the IMF executive board in 1979and have been revised periodically since. (58) The principles say that countries may peg the value of theircurrency to another currency but they cannot do this in ways which violate the requirements ofArticle IV. Basically, the pegged rate needs to reflect a country's underlying economic realities.These include, for example, changes in the volume and composition of its domestic output, in thesize, composition and direction of its foreign trade, in its domestic rates of growth and nationalincome, in the size of its reserves and in shifts in its domestic fiscal and monetary policies, relativerates of productivity and of change and technological advance.", "Countries are allowed, under the guidelines, to use their exchange rates to promote growthand development. The IMF rules for surveillance say the Fund's appraisal of country policies \"shalltake into account the extent to which the policies of a member, including its exchange rate policies,serve the objectives of the continuing development of orderly underlying conditions that arenecessary for financial stability, the promotion of sustainable economic growth, and reasonablelevels of employment.\" However, countries are also required to \"take into account in theirintervention policies the interests of other members, including those of the countries in whosecurrencies they intervene.\" In other words, countries can use exchange rate policy to help sustaingrowth and employment in their domestic economy but they cannot use an unrealistic exchange rateto prevent balance of payments (BOP) adjustment or to gain unfair trade advantages. Adjustmentincludes such things as increased imports, capital inflows to fund BOP deficits or outflows to offsetBOP surpluses, increased domestic interest rates or price levels, and the accumulation of excessreserves. If one country does not adjust its BOP imbalance, the burden of adjustment will be thrownupon its trading partners through monetary contraction, unemployment and the like. ", "China and Manipulation. The IMF has six criteriawhich might be used to identify situations where countries are manipulating their currencies in orderto gain unfair trade advantage. Any one of the criteria would be sufficient to note the likelypresence of manipulation. It appears that China's foreign exchange practices are congruent with atleast four of the IMF criteria. (59) ", "Persistent Intervention. The IMF says (its criterionnumber 1) that \"protracted large-scale intervention in one direction in the exchange market\" is oneindication that a country may be manipulating the value of its currency. Countries may intervenein foreign exchange markets to counter short-term disorderly conditions that cause disruptiveshort-term movements in the exchange value of their currencies. However, the IMF guidelines saythat persistent one-way intervention\"might indicate the need for discussion with a member.\" (60) ", "If China's currency were properly priced and the goal were exchange rate stability, the centralbank would intervene in the market in both directions, buying and selling yuan in order to dampenthe effect of temporary shocks and to spread the effects of change over a longer period of time. Instead, China routinely sells yuan in order to keep the market price from rising. It rarely buys yuanto keep the market price from sinking too low. This would seem to be the kind of \"protractedlarge-scale intervention in one direction\" which the IMF specified in its first operational definitionof manipulation.", "An Unchanging Peg. The IMF's second criterionwhich indicates that a country might be manipulating its currency is \"behavior of the exchange ratethat appears to be unrelated to underlying economic and financial conditions including factorsaffecting competitiveness and long-term capital movements.\" Countries may peg the value of theircurrency to another currency but the pegged rate needs to reflect the country's economic realities.These include, for example, changes in the volume and composition of its domestic output, in thesize, composition and direction of its foreign trade, in its domestic rates of growth and nationalincome, in the size of its reserves and in shifts in its domestic fiscal and monetary policies, relativerates of productivity and of change and technological advance. ", "The yuan-dollar exchange rate was largely unchanged from1994 to 2005. Since reformswere announced in mid-2005 it has changed very little. Some might argue that the fact that Chinaheld its exchange rate constant during this period is evidence that China was not manipulating theyuan through fine-tuning of its valuation. However, manipulation can be as much a lack of changeas an act of change. (61) ", "Whether an unchanging exchange rated is a violation of Article IV depends on the way thecountry holds the rate constant. China did not have to micro-manage the daily rate for its currencyin order to maximize its export opportunities. They merely sold yuan whenever the yuan-dollarexchange rate increased beyond the level the central bank desired. Chinese authorities used domesticmonetary policy and other domestic economic practices to offset the effects of the fixed yuan-dollarrate.", "Economic conditions have changed markedly in China since 1994. Production andconsumption patterns changed. Import and export patterns changed. The relative value of goods andservices and the relative value of labor, capital and other factors of production changed. Theinternational value of China's currency should have changed as well to reflect these changes. Amongother things, this would have produced price signals that could have changed consumption andproduction patterns, promoted efficient and effective utilization of resources, and improved theChinese people's standard of living and level of real income. The behavior of the yuan-dollarexchange rate after 1994 \"appears to be unrelated to underlying economic and financial conditions\"and is therefore consistent with the IMF's second criterion for identifying currency manipulation. ", "Prolonged Foreign Lending. The IMF's fourthcriterion says that \"excessive and prolonged short-term official or quasi-official lending for balanceof payments purposes\" can be evidence that currency manipulation is taking place. Prolongedborrowing for the same purpose is also evidence of manipulation.", "Since 1994, China's foreign exchange reserves have grown sixteen-fold, from $53 billionto $819 billion. Some of the funds in China's foreign exchange reserves are equity investments. Most, however, are loans to foreign governments or private borrowers. For example, China'sinvestment in U.S. Government debt has more than tripled in the past five years, from $71 billionin 2000 to $242 billion in 2005. By definition, these are loans to the U.S. Government and they areshort-term, in the sense that they can be liquidated at any time through sales in security markets.They help the United States cover its balance of payments (current account) deficit and they helpChina adjust its balance of payments in a way which does not require it to spend its internationalincome on purchases of goods and services from abroad. At least on the part of China, this appearsto be the kind of behavior \"to prevent effective balance of payments adjustment\" (in the words ofArticle IV) that meets the IMF's fourth test for currency manipulation. ", "Influence on Capital Movements. The IMF's fifthcriterion says that a conversation with a country might be in order if it evidences \"the pursuit, forbalance of payments purposes, of monetary and other domestic policies that provide abnormalencouragement or discouragement to capital flows.\" Many observers say that the growing size ofChina's reserves shows that its government is promoting an abnormal outflow of capital for BOPpurposes.", "The Chinese government purchases large amounts of foreign exchange in order to maintainthe price of its currency. Thus, foreign money is less available to Chinese citizens and firms thanit might be otherwise. Consequently, instead of being cleared on the current account through importsand other current activity, China's balance of payments is cleared through the capital account by largeadditions to China's foreign exchange reserves.", "Many analysts agree that China's reserves are larger than its normal trade or financial needswould require. They are larger, for example, than any need China is likely to face if its internationalincome suddenly declined -- as a result, for instance, of an economic shock originating elsewherein the world economy -- and it needed money for a while to pay for imports or to service debt. Inthis light, many would argue with reference to the IMF criterion noted above, that continuedexpansion of China's foreign exchange reserves is not just an encouragement for the outward flowof capital but an encouragement for \"abnormal\" flows as well.", "Some would argue in addition that the continued growth of China's reserves is inconsistentwith provisions of the IMF charter. Article IV also stipulates that all members shall \"seek topromote stability by fostering orderly underlying economic and financial conditions and a monetarysystem that does not tend to produce erratic disruptions.\" Every dollar that China adds to its reservesis a dollar that some other country adds to its foreign debt. Arguably, the accumulation of largereserves and large debts does not enhance the stability of the world financial and trading system. Countries with large foreign exchange reserves do not import as much as they could and debtorcountries have difficulty retiring their foreign obligations by trade. In that sense, high reserves arenot a formal trade barrier but they have the same effect. They hamper \"the expansion and balancedgrowth of international trade\" (one of the purposes, stated in its Articles of Agreement, for whichthe IMF was created.) China is not the only country accumulating large reserves but many wouldargue that its practices are a source of concern.", "China's View. Chinese officials say they are notseeking unfair trade advantage. They only want exchange rate stability to protect their economyfrom destabilizing change. The result, however, is the same. Chinese officials say that, whateverthe technicalities might be, the economic benefits of stability are important and are shared by manycountries. Moreover, they could argue, their efforts to influence exchange rates through interventionin currency markets differ little in their effect from similar action which countries with floatingexchange rates take to influence their currencies' exchange rates -- changes in interest rates and otherpolicies, for example. Furthermore, they might say, Japan and other Asian countries also buy dollarsin order to keep down the value of their currencies and to stimulate their exports. Arguably, theywould argue, it is unfair to single out China in this regard when others do the same thing and theirtrade impact on the U.S. economy is at least as great as that of China.

If nothing is done to slow the growth of China's foreignexchange reserves, for instance, inflation may eventually push up domestic prices in China and raiseits export prices.

China could not have spent thismoney on imports, as it would have then shown up in the trade statistics of the exporter countries. It seems unlikely that Chinese exporters would have brought this additional foreign currency backinto China. If they had, the People's Bank of China would have had to spend three times more yuanthan the amount officially announced to keep the yuan at the pegged rate.

This would require the cooperation of Chinese officials, since it would mean that roughly80% of China's trade income each year does not come back to China. It seems unlikely that Chinahas been giving the money away, since this would make it the world's largest foreign aid donor (tentimes the size of the United States) and international effects of its generosity would be evident. Possibly, if the money exists and is not the product of a methodological flaw, the government ofChina might have accumulated it annually into secret foreign exchange reserves. This would mean,again if the money exists, that China has perhaps $1 trillion in clandestine funds invested in othercountries (over and above its announced official reserves.) Even if China were only using thismoney to acquire revenue, not influence, it would be difficult to hide. If the assets were registeredas Chinese at the time of purchase, for instance, they would likely show up in host country statistics.", "As another possibility, if the government of China does not control the money, then it mightbe held by Chinese citizens and companies. In any other country, the fact that people prefer to holdforeign currencies rather than their own currency might be taken as evidence of capital flight. Itmight suggest that people \"in the know\" believe the yuan is overpriced and likely to crash. Keepingtheir assets in foreign currencies would be a way of protecting themselves against that eventuality. For China, however, the general view is one suggesting that the yuan will be going up in value andforeign currencies will go down in value compared to it.

This generates a continual inflow of foreign funds intothe United States. The inflow of funds, in turn, helps generate more demand for imported goods. TheU.S. current account deficit equals about 6% of GDP and requires the United States to import morethan $2 billion daily from abroad.

Profits and employments in those firms would likely increase. If China's trade balance declined,under this scenario, its rate of investment in the United States would also likely decline. In that case,many economists believe, U.S. interest rates would probably increase. This would likely have anegative impact, they expect, on the housing market and (with interest taking a larger share ofhousehold income) on consumer purchases.", "Over the longer run, foreign production is likely to shift from China to other low-costcountries.

The United States could also use other U.S. trade lawsto impose special \"safeguard\" restrictions on Chinese goods if the growth in Chinese imports isfound to have caused (or threatens to cause) market disruption to U.S. domestic produce. (97) Measures of this sort areallowable under WTO rules on a temporary or limited basis but it is less clear that they may be usedacross the board or for longer periods.

The price of the final product would only needto increase by an amount sufficient to recover the higher cost of the producer's that weredenominated in yuan. Depending on the products and methods of production, it is possible that theoverall increase in product costs would be modest and the volume of Chinese exports to the UnitedStates would be large even after the value of the yuan increased.", "It is uncertain what the Chinese authorities and Chinese firms would do if faced withrestrictive import legislation of this sort. They might cut prices and trim profits in order to keepunchanged their share of U.S. markets. They might retaliate against U.S. exports, setting off a tradewar between the United States and China. They might also ask the WTO for authority to levy tradesanctions, on grounds that the United States was not complying with the WTO rules on internationaltrade. Alternatively, they might raise the value of the yuan in hopes that this will eliminate the newU.S. tariffs on their goods. ", "The WTO trade rules allow countries to levy countervailing duties to offset any subsidiesforeign exporters might receive from their home governments. WTO rules do not allow countriesto impose tariffs or restrictions merely for the purpose of excluding foreign goods. If the UnitedStates hopes to persuade other countries that its special levies on Chinese imports are fair andcompensatory, it will likely need to show that the size of the levies match the degree of subsidywhich Chinese producers receive through the undervalued yuan. It might be helpful in this regardif there were more agreement among scholars and the affected countries as to whether and by howmuch China's currency is undervalued.", "If the United States put special levies on Chinese goods, China might ask the WTO to rulethat the United States acted in a manner inconsistent with its obligations. (98) The countervailing dutiesand anti-dumping penalties allowed under WTO rules are usually applied to specific goods ratherthan to all exports coming from a particular country. Exchange rate manipulation might be seen asa type of general across-the-board subsidy for a country's exports. Nevertheless, there is littleprecedent (but see below) at the WTO for considering exchange rates from this perspective. TheWTO may be concerned that the rules governing world trade would be harder to enforce if countrieswere free to impose countervailing duties whenever they decided unilaterally that the currencies ofother countries were undervalued.", "If the WTO agreed with China's petition, it could authorize China to retaliate by withdrawingtariff concessions on U.S. goods. The WTO dispute settlement process is adjudicated with referenceto the WTO rules and there seems little room for political pressure by the United States and othercountries. Other countries could, however, submit briefs in support of the U.S. or the Chineseposition. Countries likely will give some thought to the potential impact that a trade dispute betweenthe United States and China might have more broadly on world trade negotiations.", "If the volume of Chinese exports to the United States declines because of new tradelegislation, the profits of foreign firms located in China which produce those goods will likely godown as well. Exporters could shift their production facilities further to the west in China, wherelabor costs are lower than on the coast. This might reduce costs enough for Chinese exporters to paythe new tariff and leave their prices unchanged. Alternatively, Chinese companies and internationalfirms might shift production to other countries where the costs of production have become lowerthan those in China because of yuan revaluation. In that case, these countries might replace Chinaas major suppliers of manufactured products to the United States.", "If the United States wants to keep out foreign products (not just Chinese products) whichundersell U.S. manufactures, then new legislation would be needed to penalize other countries asthey ramp up to take China's place. This would violate WTO rules and the terms of internationaltrade agreements to which the United States is a party. Because the U.S. economy needs to importforeign goods of similar value to the foreign capital it imports each year, it may be hard for the U.S.government to stop countries from expanding their exports to the United States. role. If the volumeof imports declines, however, prices for manufactured products in the United States may increase,giving U.S. producers some relief.

In late September 2005, Treasury Under Secretary Adams demandedthat the IMF crack down on countries that violate the prohibition in Article IV against currencymanipulation, though it is not clear what tools he thought the IMF should use. (99) The IMF was, he said,\"asleep at the wheel\" and it should confront China concerning the deficiencies in its exchange ratepolicies. IMF Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato rejected that charge. (100) The IMF wasaddressing all aspects of the issue, he replied. The IMF had already investigated and rejectedsuggestions that China's currency policies warrant the use of \"special consultations.\" Rather, hesuggested, the United States should act more vigorously to straighten out its own budget andeconomic policies rather than blaming other countries for its problems. ", "According to IMF sources, special consultations between IMF management and a countryhave occurred twice previously in response to formal complaints by another country that it wasmanipulating its currency. In the 1990s, the United States made a complaint about Korea andGermany filed a complaint about Sweden. The two countries eventually adjusted their currencyvalues, though they may have done this for their own reasons rather than in response to IMFconsultations.", "In January 2006, Adams maintained that the IMF should play a stronger role enforcingexchange rates and preventing currency manipulation. (101) The IMF should demonstrate strong leadership on multilateralexchange rate surveillance, he said. \"A strong IMF role in exchange rate issues is central to thestability and health of the international economy,\" he remarked. The IMF's leaders \"should endorsesuch an enhanced role for the IMF, restoring its central role on exchange rates.\" While Adams didnot mention China by name, he said the IMF should identify countries \"whose exchange rate policiesmight not be in accord with Fund principles\" and it should \"seek to identify problematic orinappropriate exchange rate behavior.\" ", "However, IMF Managing Director Rato told a session at the World Economic Forum inDavos, Switzerland that he does not consider China to be a currency manipulator. He rejectedproposals that the Fund should put greater pressure on China. He said \"there is a trade-off betweenour role as confidential adviser in our surveillance work and our role as a transparent judge.\" (102) He noted that the IMFhad been the first international body to urge China to move from its fixed peg to a more flexibleexchange rate process. Rato also said the IMF should not take a proactive role on exchange rates,in response to Adam's question what the IMF should do about countries \"that are attempting tothwart balance of payments adjustments.\"", "On February 9, 2006, Rato outlined his future plans for the IMF. He said the IMF should putmore emphasis on surveillance but he raised several reservations about the Fund's taking the centralpolicing role Adams had proposed.

The IMF cannot force countries to haveexchange rate policies which mirror underlying economic conditions, even if they might benon-compliant with IMF rules. However, continuing discussion at the IMF and at other internationalmeetings serves to focus attention on the issue. At the least, it puts Chinese officials in a situationwhere they need to explain or justify their policies and to respond in some way to internationalpressure. Arguably, it has caused them to take steps towards liberalization that they otherwise mightbe reluctant to take -- or they might have taken more slowly -- if these conversations had not takenplace. ", "If the IMF were given the broader authority contemplated by Adams and others, thefundamental structure of the world exchange rate system would change and many countries, inaddition to China, would have to seriously revise their domestic and international economic policies.

In 2004, the China Currency Coalition and 30Members of Congress petitioned the U.S. Trade Representative separately asking the Administrationto take action of this sort. The undervalued exchange rate for the yuan is a kind of subsidy forChinese exports, they argue. It lowers the cost of production in China and enables Chinese exportersto sell products abroad at prices lower than their real costs of production should allow. They believethis is an unfair practice which is inconsistent with the rules of the world trading system and theyappear to believe that a WTO dispute settlement panel would support that view if the issue were putbefore it. The Administration rejected the two petitions, however. (104) Officials expresseddoubt that the United States could win a case of this sort in the WTO, though they did not detail thereasons for their doubt. They also said that action to challenge China's exchange rate and tradepolicies in the WTO might be \"more damaging than helpful at this time.\" (105) ", "The WTO and IMF have a formal agreement between them which specifies that certain kindsof international finance issues shall be referred to the IMF for judgment, if they come up in thecontext of WTO deliberations, and the IMF's findings will be considered conclusive. (106) The scope of theagreement is discussed below. China's critics acknowledge that the WTO has no authority toadjudicate exchange rate issues. Some believe, however, that if the United States complained to theWTO that China was manipulating its currency in order to gain unfair trade advantage and the IMFagreed, the WTO could authorize the United States and other countries to put special tariffs onChinese goods. These would stay in effect until China raised the value of its currency. ", "This section discusses whether appealing this issue to the WTO is a feasible alternative. First, this section examines the question whether export subsidies arranged through exchange ratemanipulation are a \"subsidy\" as the WTO defines the term. The WTO's list of prohibited practicesis specific and limited in scope. Complaints that China is subsidizing its exports through currencymanipulation are actionable in the WTO dispute settlement process if currency manipulation is notconsidered to be covered by the agreement. Second, this section discusses two ways the UnitedStates might seek to change the rules of the world trading system so as to make currencymanipulation actionable in the WTO context. There are several contexts within the WTO where theUnited States could raise the issue and seek international agreement to revise the rules andobligations of members of the organization. In some cases, consensus or unanimity is required. Inone instance, however, a very large majority can change the requirements of the WTO in way thatapplies the changes so that new requirements apply to all member countries, even those which didnot approve its adoption.", "The WTO's dispute settlement process is a quasi-judicial procedure that is intended to resolvetrade disputes between countries which cannot be resolved through conciliation or negotiation. Ifa complaining country so requests, a three member panel is appointed. The panel reviews the factsand arguments in the case and renders judgment based on the facts and WTO rules. (107) The WTO AppellateBody may review the initial panel's findings and, unless the panel and Appellate Body's findings areset aside by the WTO membership by consensus, the disputing parties are expected to implementthe panel decision, together with any modifications made by the Appellate Body. If a country doesnot comply within a reasonable period of time, the WTO may authorize the complaining country toimpose retaliatory duties on the non-compliant country's goods or take other retaliatory action thecomplainant proposes. Those duties or barriers remain in force until the country complies or untilthe disputing parties otherwise resolve the issue. (108) ", "There are several issues with the China scenario discussed above. First, some critics maymisconstrue the nature and extent of the agreement between the IMF and the WTO. The agreementhas to do with temporary trade restrictions, not with exchange rate policies or currency manipulation. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General Agreement on Trade inServices (GATS) include provisions which allow countries to impose temporary trade barriers inorder to safeguard their external financial situation. Certain financial and balance of paymentsconditions must be present, however, in order for countries to be justified in taking these steps. TheIMF has the final word as to whether those conditions prevail. (109) Currency manipulationfor the purpose of gaining unfair trade advantage and exchange rate policy are not mentioned in theinteragency agreement between the WTO and IMF or in the text of the GATT itself. (110) ", "Second, the key issue is not so much whether China's exchange policy gives it unfairadvantages in international trade but whether this is a kind of subsidy which is prohibited by WTOrules. When Chinese officials say they need to keep their currency at roughly its present rate becausean increase might bankrupt large sectors of China's export economy, they are admitting that theirexchange rate subsidizes exports. However, the WTO has a specific definition as to the types ofthings which are subsidies and therefore prohibited under its rules. Currency manipulation is notincluded among them.", "When the core rules and obligations of the world trading system were laid down in 1947,with the adoption of the GATT, the world was on a fixed-parity exchange rate system managed bythe IMF. It was difficult, during this period, for countries to manipulate their exchange rates in orderto gain unfair trade advantage. During the 1970s, the fixed rate system broke down and the rulesof the IMF were changed to allow countries to have floating, fixed or whatever other types ofexchange rate systems they desire. (111) The IMF was given the task of monitoring (\"surveillance\")exchange rates but, as discussed above, it was given no effective means of enforcing its rule (ArticleIV) against currency manipulation. For its part, the GATT did not amend its rules when the IMFprocedures changed to take into account the possibility that countries might use exchange ratemanipulation as a trade policy tool. The WTO likewise took no steps when it was formed to fill thisapparent lacuna in the rules and obligations of the world trading regime. ", "The WTO defines the concept \"subsidy\" in very specific terms. If a government's actions donot meet the terms of the definition, even if they benefit exporters or cause trade injury, they are notactionable (subject to challenge) for purposes of the WTO dispute adjudication process. Further,to be actionable, subsidies must be specific to an industry (\"specificity.\") The WTO Agreement onSubsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) expressly prohibits (112) export subsidies, whichare defined as \"subsidies contingent...upon export performance.\" The ASCM deems export subsidiesto be per se specific. Domestic subsidies are not prohibited but may be challenged if they cause tradeinjury, as specified in the ASCM. ", "Subsidies that are not directly export contingent are also not allowed if (1) the governmentmakes a financial contribution and (2) it benefits the recipients. Government financial support cantake a variety of forms, such as direct payments to the exporter, the waiver of tax payments or otherrevenue that would otherwise be collected from the exporter, or special government purchases or theprovision of low-cost goods and services (other than general infrastructure) which lowers the costof production. Tax subsidies to broad categories of exporters, through mechanisms such as foreignsales corporations, also meet the test for specificity. ", "The WTO agreement makes no mention of subsidies provided through exchange ratepractices or monetary policy. All of the subsidies mentioned in the agreement occur on the fiscalside of the government's ledger and involve a direct cost to the government. Some legal analystsbelieve that, though doing so would be difficult, it might be possible to challenge China's actions inthe WTO. (113) Benitah suggests, for instance, that if the United States were able to show that China's fixedexchange rate is a de facto export subsidy it could take advantage of the per se specificity language. He also suggests that China's fixed rate might be viewed as a form of \"in kind\" subsidy similar tothat prohibited by the ASCM. Other legal commentators believe, however, that the likelihood thatthe WTO would view China's exchange rate practices as a prohibited subsidy are at best veryslim. (114) ", "Some critics of China's exchange rate policies have sought to circumvent this difficulty byarguing that China pays a direct subsidy to Chinese exporters through its exchange rate policy. Thedirect financial support occurs, they say, because Chinese exporters receive more yuan in exchangefor the dollars they earn from trade than they would if the yuan were valued correctly. An exportermight receive 8 yuan from the central bank today when it exchanges its dollars for yuan, whereas itmight receive 7 yuan instead if the yuan were valued appropriately. That extra yuan is a subsidy toexporters, the theory holds, and it is therefore a direct violation of WTO trade agreements. (115) ", "The idea that exports can be subsidized in this fashion seems to contradict the normallyaccepted concepts about international monetary transactions. Moreover, the effects on the worldtrading system would be considerable if the idea were accepted and applied to all countries. TheChinese are perhaps more blatant in the way their official actions effect currency values, but mostgovernments do things from time to time which influence the value of their national currency. If acentral bank lowers interests rates and the exchange value of its currency declines, one could arguethat the central bank is making its national exports more competitive and increasing the amount (inlocal currency) that its national exporters earn from trade. Likewise, an increase in exchange ratesmight be seen as an effort to purchase goods from other countries for less than their true value or toreduce the price that a country's foreign investors would need to pay in real terms for foreignacquisitions. If every change in the exchange rate for a currency is deemed to provide a subsidy orraise a barrier to trade, then the current rules of the world trading system would be unworkable ina world of floating (or inaccurately fixed) exchange rates. ", "Some would also argue that the concept that exchange rate differences can provide a subsidyto exporters is fundamentally flawed. Regardless of the exchange rate, the exporter receives a dollar'sworth of its local currency whatever the current rate might be. When the local currency goes up invalue, the exporter receives less local currency but each unit is more valuable than before. Importedgoods would also be cheaper and a dollar's worth of local currency would buy more foreign goodsthan before. Firms that use imports as part of their commercial process would see their costs declineproportionally.", "In any case, the presumed subsidy implicit in the yuan exchange rate is not paid solely toexporters, as likely would be necessary for it to be found in violation of the direct payment andexport contingency provisions of the ASCM. Anybody -- exporters, tourists, banks, or personswishing to buy yuan in order to make foreign investments in China -- receives the same exchangerate for their money.", "It is also not clear that the exchange rate \"subsidy\" is paid by the government or at thegovernment's behest. Many organizations in China buy and sell currency and -- while the centralbank continues to have a substantial effect on currency prices -- market forces determine the contextin which the central bank exerts its influence. If an exporter sells dollars to a commercial bank, theimplicit subsidy in the transaction would be paid by the bank and not the government. If Chineseexports were priced in yuan, the purchaser would have to sell dollars and buy yuan in order to settleits bill. In that case, the purchaser would pay any subsidy that is implicit in the transaction. ", "It appears that a strict interpretation of the WTO's current rules would provide little latitudefor a finding that China's exchange rate practices constitute a \"subsidy\" for exports insofar as thatterm is used within the WTO. The United States has taken a \"strict construction\" view of the WTOrules. Special Trade Representative Susan Schwab told Congress in May 2006, for example, that\"the United States has emphasized the necessity for strict adherence to the Rules negotiating mandate... which requires that the effectiveness and basic principles of the WTO Antidumping and SubsidiesAgreements must be preserved.\" (116) Efforts by other countries to interpret the rules more broadlyor flexibly have been met, she said, by vigorous U.S. attacks. ", "Schwab also said that \"initiating a WTO case on this matter [currency manipulation] wouldplace China in the position of defending, rather than reforming, its currency regime.\" (117) This would be the firstoccasion where the WTO was asked to resolve a currency dispute, she said, and it \"would thereforehave an unpredictable outcome and take a relatively long time to reach completion.\" Some suggestthat a WTO decision against the U.S. position could have the effect of making currency manipulationan implicitly acceptable practice under the WTO, a result quite contrary to U.S. goals. Schwab saidthat continued dialog with China about its currency regime would likely be a more constructivemeans for resolving this concern. ", "Article IV of the IMF charter prohibits countries from manipulating their exchange rates forthe purpose of gaining an unfair trade advantage. Giving the IMF the authority to enforce thatprovision of its charter would be one way of addressing the currency manipulation problem. However, as noted above, this could require major changes in the structure of the world financialsystem and it could give the IMF new authority over the economic policies of its member countries. Many countries might be reluctant to adopt far-reaching changes of this sort merely to address theexchange rate aspects of a controversy about international trade.", "It might be possible to address this issue through adjustments in the rules governing worldtrade. It could be argued, for example, that restrictions on currency manipulation should be includedin the rules of the WTO in order to make its procedures consistent with the requirements of theArticles of Agreement of the IMF. The IMF may not have the effective authority to enforce theprohibition in its Articles of Agreement against currency manipulation for the purpose of unfair tradeadvantage. This does not mean, however, that the world must live with the problem of currencymanipulation and contrary effects it may have on the relative efficiency of international productionand the patterns of international trade. The WTO could choose instead to incorporate this sameprohibition against currency manipulation into its own text in order to take deleterious trade effectsinto account. ", "There are two ways the United States might seek to make exchange rate manipulationactionable within the WTO dispute settlement framework if it wished to pursue the issue. First, itcould raise the issue during the Doha Round trade negotiations. Second, it could raise the issueseparately at the WTO Governing Council or the WTO Ministerial Conference in hopes of garneringa sufficient majority to reinterpret the WTO rules or to amend the trade agreements. In both cases,the goal would be adoption of changes in the WTO language in order to make exchange ratemanipulation a prohibited trade practice. ", "First, the United States might broach the issue in the current world trade negotiations. TheDoha Round of trade negotiations is currently discussing major changes in the basic ground rulesfor world trade as well as possible adjustments in tariff rates. The United States could ask that thecurrency manipulation issue should be added to the agenda. There are already many difficultsubjects on the agenda, however, and the WTO members have not yet agreed on a framework fornegotiating the most contentious issues before them. Adding another controversial issue to theagenda may not make the task of the negotiators any easier. On the other hand, nobody knows atthis point how many countries might want to make currency manipulation actionable under WTOrules. ", "Alternatively, the United States could raise the issue of currency manipulation in the WTO'sGoverning Council and in the biannual meeting of its Ministerial Conference. The Doha roundnegotiations seem to be in trouble and it may be too late, as a practical matter, to add anothercontroversial issue to the agenda. The Ministerial Conference consists of the trade ministers of allthe WTO member countries. These are the top policy making bodies of the WTO. Positive actionby them could lead to a change in WTO treatment of the exchange rate issue, either throughreinterpretation of the existing WTO rules or through amendment to the international agreementsthemselves. (118) ", "Article IX of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement)says that decisions shall be made by consensus. However, it says, when consensus cannot beachieved, decisions shall be made on the basis of a majority of the votes cast, each country havingone vote. Interpretation of the charter and of international trade agreements and amendments tothose documents require a higher majority, however, to be effective. Article IX of the WTO chartersays that the General Council and Ministerial Conference have exclusive authority to adoptinterpretations of the WTO Agreement and the multilateral trade agreements such as the GATT,GATS, TRIPS, ASCM, etc. Interpretations are to be based on recommendations of the Council andrequire an affirmative vote of three-quarters of the entire WTO membership. ", "In theory, a three-quarters vote of the General Council and Ministerial Conference couldinterpret the existing trade rules in such a way as to make exchange rate manipulation for the purposeof gaining unfair trade advantage actionable under WTO rules. However, Article IX says that theinterpretation clause should not be used to undermine the amendment clause (Article X) of the WTOcharter. The procedural difficulties of using Article IX are daunting. A three-quarters vote of theentire membership is required, yet at most meetings of the WTO less than that share of themembership is in attendance at any one time. Nevertheless, there are sections of the GATT whichmight be considered anew in terms of their contemporary relevance. Article XV says, for instance,that the contracting parties \"shall not, by exchange action, frustrate the intent of the provisions of thisAgreement, nor, by trade action, the intent of the Articles of Agreement of the InternationalMonetary Fund.\" Whether this could be interpreted as meaning that members of the WTO shouldnot violate Article IV of the IMF charter by manipulating their currency might be a matter for debate. ", "The United States could also propose that the WTO Agreement should be amended. ArticleX of the WTO Agreement says that any country may propose to the Ministerial Conference that theWTO charter or the multilateral trade agreements should be amended. Amendments can also beproposed by the WTO General Council or its subsidiary bodies. The Ministerial Conference mayadopt amendments to these documents by consensus. If consensus is not reached, then theConference may recommend by a two-thirds vote of the entire membership to submit a proposedamendment to the WTO's member countries for their consideration. Generally, amendments becomeeffective if they are ratified by two-thirds of the WTO's member countries. Amendments to a fewarticles of the WTO charter and the multilateral trade agreements require a unanimous vote. However, none of these seem to involve exchange rate issues or questions of export subsidy. Theimpact of any amendment to the WTO Agreement or the multilateral trade agreements may belimited, however. Article X says that any amendment which affects member rights and obligationsshall apply only to the countries which ratified it. One prominent WTO legal scholar, John H.Jackson, says that, in practice, this means that any changes of a substantive nature would apply onlyto the countries which endorsed them. (119) It would seem likely, then, that an amendment which said thatcurrency manipulation for the purpose of achieving unfair trade advantage was not an acceptabletrade practice would apply only to the countries which endorsed it.", "The Ministerial Conference can also decide by a three-quarters vote of the entiremembership, however, that an amendment shall apply to all countries even if all countries have notratified its adoption. Article X says that the Ministerial Conference may decide that a country whichdoes not accept an amendment within a time period specified by the Conference \"shall be free towithdraw from the WTO or to remain a Member with the consent of the Ministerial Conference.\" Presumably, serious negotiations would predate any decision that a country would be allowed toremain a WTO Member without accepting the application of a new amendment to itself. ", "It cannot be known in advance whether the United States and other countries that areconcerned about the trade effects of currency manipulation would succeed in gaining the votesnecessary to reinterpret or amend the trade rules. This is a very steep requirement. While theUnited States and its associates were lobbying the membership to consider the change, China andother countries which employ that practice would presumably be lobbying the membership to votethe other way. The result would likely depend on the strength of the arguments brought forth insupport of the initiative and the number of countries that believe that currency manipulation for thepurpose of gaining unfair trade advantage is injuring their interests or is otherwise undesirable. ", "It may not be possible to achieve the three-quarters positive vote needed to reinterpret theWTO agreement or to adopt amendments which are mandatory for all member countries. Nonetheless, discussion of this issue within the WTO may have salutary effects. It would requirethe countries which favor use of this trade practice to defend their policies and to explain why theybelieve currency manipulation is an appropriate tool of trade policy. The countries which might beamenable to changes in the WTO rules might also be identified. This information may be usefulif the United States decides to seek a negotiated arrangement during a later phase of the Doha tradenegotiations or in some future round of talks.", "A strategy of taking the Chinese currency issue to the WTO is not likely to lead to a promptresolution of the controversy. It seems doubtful that adequate grounds can be found, given thecurrent language of the WTO agreement and the accompanying multilateral trade agreements, tosuccessfully address the question in the WTO dispute settlement process. Addressing the questionin the WTO policy process may offer opportunities for building support for changing the rules andguidelines used by organization, however. Discussion in the General Council and MinisterialConference would offer the United States an opportunity to discuss why, as a general principle,currency manipulation should not be a legitimate tool of national trade policy. It need not bediscussed, in this context, as an issue affecting only China. Obtaining the three-quarters vote tochange the language or prevailing interpretation of the WTO agreements would be difficult. Discussion in this context may help identify potential supporters and lay the groundwork for possiblyincluding currency manipulation as an additional agenda item in future trade negotiations."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
