Experts point to a growing body of evidence of the health care system's failure to consistently provide high-quality care to all Americans.", "In a November 2008 report outlining its goals for health reform, the National Priorities Partnership, representing all the major stakeholder groups in the health sector, identified four major challenges to the delivery of high-quality care. The first is to improve patient safety by eliminating medical errors and other adverse events. These errors mostly result from faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead to mistakes. The second challenge is to eradicate disparities in care. Racial and ethnic minorities and low-income groups face disproportionately higher rates of disease, disability, and mortality, largely because of variations in access to care, and quality of care. The third challenge is to reduce the burden of chronic disease, which affects almost half of all Americans and accounts for three-quarters of health care spending. The final challenge is to eliminate unnecessary and ineffective care that compromises quality, drives up costs, and neglects the needs of patients. According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), an estimated 30%-40% of health care spending is wasted on unnecessary and even unsafe care."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Health Care Delivery Reform", "paragraphs": ["While primarily focused on health care financing issues, the health reform debate has generated a number of proposals to address these challenges and improve the delivery of health care services.

Delivery reform proposals focus on (1) expanding the primary care workforce, (2) encouraging the use of clinical preventive services, and (3) strengthening the role of chronic care management. The current system places a high value on specialty care, rather than primary care. Patients with multiple chronic conditions often receive care from several providers in different settings. Among other things, this can compromise patients' understanding of their conditions and ways to manage them. And the incomplete or inaccurate transfer of information among providers can lead to poor outcomes. Care coordination is seen as an important aspect of health care that helps avoid waste, and the over- and underuse of medications, diagnostic tests, and therapies.", "Health workforce policy has emerged as an important component of the health reform debate. Transforming the nation's health care delivery system\u2014from one that is focused on fragmented specialty care for acute illness to one that places a greater emphasis on primary care, disease prevention, and the coordination and management of care for chronic illness across settings\u2014will require significant changes in health professions education and training. While some advisory groups have warned of a future physician shortage, based on the growing patient demand for services, others caution that simply adding more physicians to the current health care system will increase costs and not improve accessibility or quality. Currently, the number of physicians per capita varies significantly across the country. But that variation is largely driven by where physicians like to live and practice, rather than by patient need. Moreover, higher physician supply is not necessarily associated with better patient outcomes or satisfaction, or improved quality of care. Instead of focusing on overall physician supply, health policy analysts recommend a workforce policy that couples the training of more primary care physicians (and other primary care providers) with the promotion and development of integrated systems of care.", "Expanding the use of clinical preventive services is a key goal of delivery reform and often touted as having the potential to reduce health care costs. Such services include immunizations and other interventions that prevent the onset of disease (known as primary prevention), and screening tests that detect the presence of an incipient disease (known as secondary prevention). While there is clear evidence that clinical preventive services can improve health and may be cost-effective (i.e., providing good value for their cost), few of these interventions are projected to be cost-saving.", "Proponents of delivery reform have also embraced the concept of a medical home, intended to improve the quality of care through partnerships between patients and specially trained primary care physicians. The physician helps the patient manage his or her own care and coordinates services across settings (specialists' offices, hospitals, and laboratories) and types of care (acute, chronic, and preventive). Concern about the rising costs of treating chronic disease and the lack of coordination of care also has generated keen interest in disease management programs. These programs, typically focused on a specific disease such as diabetes, help patients manage their own care. Program elements include patient education, symptom monitoring, and adherence to treatment plans. Disease management programs share similarities with the medical home concept. But whereas the medical home is built around a physician-patient partnership, disease management programs typically are run by health plans or specialized vendors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drivers of Reform", "paragraphs": ["Health care delivery reform cannot happen unless mechanisms are in place to drive change in the systems of care.

Most health policy experts concede that improvements in the quality of health care will not be fully realized unless providers have financial incentives to modify the way they deliver health care services. Under fee-for-service, the predominant method of payment, physicians are paid based on the volume of billable services, rather than the value or quality of care they provide. Increasingly, public and private payers are linking a portion of provider payments to their performance on a set of quality measures. Policymakers are interested in expanding these pay-for-performance initiatives to incentivize other changes to the health care delivery system.", "The use of performance measures to track the quality of care is growing in both the private and public health sectors, though concerns about the development and use of such data remain.

It encompasses interoperable electronic health records (EHRs)\u2014including computerized systems to order tests and medications, and support systems to aid clinical decision making\u2014and the development of a national health information network to permit the secure exchange of electronic health information among providers. The promise of HIT comes not from automating existing practices, but rather its use as a tool to help overhaul the delivery of care. HIT has the potential to enable providers to render care more efficiently; for example, by eliminating the use of paper-based records and reducing the duplication of diagnostic tests. It can also improve the quality of care by identifying harmful drug interactions and helping physicians manage patients with multiple conditions.

"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Health Workforce", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare Graduate Medical Education Payments", "paragraphs": ["Medicare pays the costs of graduate medical education (GME) by making two types of payments to teaching hospitals. First, direct graduate medical education (DGME) payments help cover the costs of the residency training program, including resident salaries and benefits, supervisory physician salaries, and administrative overhead expenses. DGME payments are calculated based on the product of three factors: a hospital-specific per resident amount, a weighted count of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents supported by the hospital, and the hospital's Medicare patient share. Second, indirect medical education (IME) payments, which vary with the intensity of a hospital's residency program, are intended to compensate hospitals for the higher costs of patient care in teaching hospitals. Those costs are the result of such factors as having sicker patients and the fact that inexperienced residents may order more tests. The IME adjustment is a percentage add-on to a hospital's Medicare payments for inpatient care and is based, in part, on the hospital's resident-to-bed ratio. Medicare includes the time that residents spend in both patient care and non-patient care activities, including didactic activities, when calculating DGME payments. When calculating IME payments, however, only the time spent in patient care activities is included. In 2008, Medicare DGME and IME payments totaling an estimated $9 billion were paid to more than 1,100 teaching hospitals to educate and train about 90,000 residents, equivalent to approximately $100,000 per resident. Health policy analysts view Medicare GME payments as a potentially important instrument for shaping future health workforce policy; for example, by linking the subsidies to delivery system reform and by structuring them to encourage the training of more generalists and to increase the amount of time residents spend in non-hospital settings such as community health centers (CHCs) and rural health clinics.", "With certain exceptions, Medicare caps the number of residents used to calculate GME payments for individual teaching hospitals at the level reported at the end of 1996. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 permitted a one-time redistribution of up to 75% of a teaching hospital's unused resident positions to hospitals seeking to increase their medical residency programs, according to specific priorities. Medicare does not set targets for the type or mix of resident physicians that a hospital trains, nor are Medicare GME payments linked to promoting or fostering specific goals in medical education.", "Medicare allows teaching hospitals to receive DGME and IME payments for the time residents rotate in non-hospital settings provided (1) they are performing patient care, and (2) the hospital pays all or substantially all (i.e., 90%) of the costs of the training at the non-hospital site, which include the resident stipends and fringe benefits and the costs associated with supervising physicians. Time spent in non-patient care activities in the non-hospital setting is not counted when calculating either type of payment. A hospital that jointly operates a residency program with another hospital cannot include the time spent by residents working at a non-hospital site if it incurs all or substantially all of the costs for only a portion of the residents in that program at the non-hospital site. Additional regulatory requirements discourage rotations in non-hospital settings. Moreover, hospitals have a financial incentive to retain the often lower-cost clinical labor that residents provide. While experts see value in having residents gain experience in non-hospital settings such as CHCs and nursing facilities (NFs), residency programs today are largely based in inpatient, acute-care teaching hospitals.

Congress has addressed the issue of abuse in institutional settings since, at least, the early 1960's when the Senate Special Committee on Aging initiated its first investigations. Since then numerous hearings and Congressional reports have been authored concerning the need for a federal response to abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly. As a result, Congress has implemented modest reforms, including federal assistance to state Adult Protective Services programs through the Social Security Block Grant (SSBG) and amendments to the Older Americans Act to provide separate funding for elder abuse prevention and vulnerable elder rights protection activities, including establishment of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. While Congress has enacted comprehensive legislation to address child abuse and neglect under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) ( P.L. 93-247 ) in 1974 and domestic violence under the Violence Against Women's Act (VAWA) of 1994, legislation addressing abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at a national level has not been enacted.", "Recognizing the need for a coordinated federal effort with a multidisciplinary approach that combines law enforcement, public health, and social services to combat abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly, Congress first introduced the Elder Justice Act of 2002 ( S. 2933 ) in the 107 th Congress by then Senator John Breaux. The Elder Justice Act represents Congress' attempt at comprehensive legislation on this issue. Similar measures were introduced in both the Senate and the House in the 108 th ( S. 333 ; H.R. 2490 ), 109 th Congress ( S. 2010 ; H.R. 4993 ), and 110 th Congresses ( S. 1070 ; H.R. 1783 ). Provisions regarding elder justice were also incorporated in the 2006 reauthorization of the Older Americans Act (OAA) of 1965 ( P.L. 109-365 ). In the 111 th Congress, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the Elder Justice Act of 2009 ( S. 795 ) on April 2, 2009, a companion bill ( H.R. 2006 ) was introduced in the House by Representative Peter T.
