The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been engaged in a project to reduce such base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) in which firms use tax-avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules to artificially shift profits to low- or no-tax locations. In October 2015, the OECD published its final list of 15 BEPS action items. The OECD framework was endorsed by the G-20 Finance Ministers in February 2016.", "All OECD and G-20 countries agreed to implement four minimum BEPS standards:", "1. Action 5, countering harmful tax practices (mostly aimed at patent boxes); 2. Action 6, preventing treaty abuse (largely about arranging payments to flow through countries with treaties that reduce withholding taxes on dividends and other passive payments); 3. Action 13, country-by-country (CbC) reporting; and 4. Action 14, increasing the effectiveness of dispute resolution.", "These action items have led to limited changes to U.S. companies because of either a lack of relevance (no patent box regime exists in the United States) or existing practices, although CbC reporting requires additional information from U.S. multinationals.", "Although implementation of some items can be done through regulation, others would require legislation or treaty amendments, which must be approved by the Senate. Other than the four agreed-upon standards, the remaining proposals are not specific recommendations because there was no agreement among the countries.", "Action Item 1 contains an extensive discussion of the digital economy, but its proposals relate only to the value added tax (VAT), which the United States does not have. Action Items 2-4 and 7-10 relate to profit shifting by multinational firms via a variety of mechanisms, including locating interest deductions in high-tax countries or through transfer prices of the sales of goods and services between related corporations. The United States has generally adopted few changes, although present practices in many aspects already embody the standards. One instance in which U.S. rules appear at variance with OECD proposals are check-the-box rules, which create hybrid entities with, for example, interest deducted in one country but not taxed in another.", "The OECD standards for transfer prices stress that the allocation of income should reflect functions, assets, and risks that are controlled and assumed, rather than contractual arrangements. Cost-sharing arrangements commonly used in the United States, which allow foreign subsidiaries to provide financing for research in the United States in exchange for a share of profits, is also an area in which U.S. practice appears inconsistent with BEPS proposals. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), in a study of the transfer-pricing issues, while indicating that a move from contract to content would reduce profit shifting, argued that risk could not be transferred between related firms in the same way as between unrelated firms.", "The United States and other countries would benefit by gaining revenues from reductions in base erosion and profit shifting which, according to Action Item 11 on measuring and monitoring BEPS, costs between 4% and 10% of global corporate tax revenues. There have, however, been concerns that the United States risks losing some revenue and companies paying additional taxes if other countries inappropriately increase their taxation of U.S. firms, eventually generating foreign-tax credits that offset U.S. income tax. These effects might occur through changes in the definition of permanent establishment and through the use of CbC data to move to an effective formula-based approach to taxation, which could produce double taxation. At the same time, a uniform set of standards and reporting requirements may be beneficial, as many countries were proceeding to enact unilateral changes and reporting requirements prior to the OECD project.", "Concerns have also been expressed by firms regarding confidentiality and compliance costs of CbC reporting.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been engaged in an ongoing project to reduce BEPS. In October 2015, the OECD published its final list of 15 BEPS action items to equip governments with measures to address tax avoidance (although some updated or additional material has been provided).", "Some of these proposals can be (or have been) implemented in the United States and in other countries through administrative actions, and others would require legislative action. Some would require modifications of international tax treaties. U.S. multinational firms will be affected not only by actions taken by the United States but also by actions undertaken by other countries. The OECD framework was adopted by the G-20 Finance Ministers in February 2016.", "All OECD and G-20 countries agreed to implement four minimum BEPS standards: ", "1. Action 5, countering harmful tax practices (mostly aimed at patent boxes); 2.

Action 13, country-by-country (CbC) reporting; and 4. Action 14, increasing the effectiveness of dispute resolution. ", "The BEPS project presents opportunities and concerns. One opportunity is that the United States could gain from more multinational cooperation to deal with profit shifting, which has been estimated to cause a loss in revenues of billions of dollars. The BEPS action items address the main methods of achieving profit shifting, including Action 4 (excessive interest deductions in high-tax countries) and Actions 8-10 (transfer pricing, that is, the price of purchasing and selling between related companies, in which pricing of intangibles is thought to be the major method used to accomplish profit shifting). ", "In contrast, the United States risks losing some revenue if other countries increase their taxation of U.S. firms, even if that income was previously in low-tax jurisdictions, because the United States has a worldwide tax system that taxes income of foreign subsidiaries when repatriated but provides a foreign tax credit (i.e., credits for foreign taxes paid offset U.S. tax on foreign source income). Concerns have been expressed, in congressional hearings and in articles, about claims to U.S. multinationals' income tax bases by other countries that may be viewed as inappropriate. The Senate Finance Committee requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) study BEPS actions; GAO's study focused on transfer pricing guidance and documentation, including CbC reporting. The concern is that CbC reporting, which will share data with other countries about the activities of U.S. multinational firms, may be used by countries to effectively implement a formula-based approach to taxation. The United States has adopted CbC reporting for 2017 (a year behind most countries), even though all of its sharing agreements are bilateral, with a country-by-country agreement, whereas most countries signed a multilateral agreement. ", "Companies are also concerned about confidentiality, and there have been proposals to make CbC reports public. The United States will share these data only through confidential bilateral agreements. ", "In addition, some are concerned about the permanent establishment (which generally determines whether a country has any right to tax any profits under an income tax) issues in Action Item 7 and the use of an expanded permanent establishment treatment to allow foreign taxation of U.S. firms' income that is not appropriately allocated to the foreign sources. ", "Some concerns about capturing revenues by other countries have been heightened by the European Union's (EU's) actions against several U.S. multinational corporations (among them Apple in Ireland) calling for back tax payments and by the United Kingdom's (UK's) and Australia's enactments of diverted profits taxes (sometimes referred to as the \"Google tax\"), which addresses profits of firms without permanent establishments, as well as the allocation of profits for firms with permanent establishments. ", "At the same time, a uniform set of standards and reporting requirements may be beneficial to U.S. multinationals, as many countries might otherwise have enacted unilateral changes in rules and reporting standards. In particular, the uniform CbC reporting may be beneficial in that it forestalled unilateral enactment of reporting requirements that vary from country to country and that may have been more burdensome to firms than the uniform reporting rules. ", "Although the United States has adopted the four minimum standards, other countries are in the process of adopting additional standards in various action items. The OECD's recent progress report highlighted increased transparency in rules, reduced opportunities for treaty abuse, curtailment of harmful tax practices via patent boxes, eliminating high returns to \"cash boxes\" addressed in the transfer pricing action item, and CbC reporting. ", "Europe has a general constraint in which EU rules prohibit laws that discriminate against cross-border restrictions on trade. Such a restriction is what BEPS measures are sometimes targeting, as in the Controlled Foreign Corporation, or CFC, rules (Action 3), which are designed to prevent artificial shifting of income into low-tax foreign subsidiaries, and limitations of benefits (LOB) in the multilateral instrument (Action 15).", "Many of the action items may not be relevant to certain countries that already have achieved the standards (such as CFC rules or limits on interest deductions); also, many actions require legislative changes that may be difficult or time consuming. For the United States, proposed actions in Action 1 (the digital economy) or most provisions under Action 5 (harmful tax practices) would not be relevant because they apply to value added taxes (or VATs) or special regimes (such as patent boxes) that do not exist in the United States. ", "Many of the other standards are already partly or fully captured in U.S. law and practice, even though in some cases U.S. practices are at odds with the BEPS standards. Notably, although the United States has strong CFC rules, its check-the-box and temporary look-through rules conflict with BEPS standards. Its restrictions on interest deductions are weaker than those suggested by BEPS. An important approach used by multinational corporations, cost-sharing arrangements, also appears incompatible with the transfer pricing guidelines. These issues are discussed in further detail below. ", "This report first reviews the basics of international tax rules. It then discusses the various action items organized into Action Item 1, which relates to the digital economy and proposes standards only with respect to VATS; Action Items 2-5, 7, and 8-10, items related primarily to profit shifting; Action Item 5, which relates to harmful tax practices; Action Item 6, regarding tax treaties; and Action Items 11-15, which are primarily administrative in nature."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brief Overview of International Tax Rules", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Territorial or Worldwide", "paragraphs": ["Under a territorial or source-based tax, all income earned within a country is taxed only by that country regardless of the nationality of the firms. Alternatively, under a worldwide or residence-based system, a tax would be imposed on foreign source income and a credit allowed for foreign taxes paid. For purposes of the corporate profits tax, most countries have a territorial system (although most have some type of anti-abuse rules, as discussed below in reference to CFC rules).", "The current U.S. tax system is a hybrid. It has some elements of a residence-based or worldwide tax, in which income of a country's firms is taxed regardless of its location, and some elements of a source-based or territorial tax. The provisions that introduce territorial features are deferral and cross-crediting.

Some income, however, is taxed currently. Income that is not part of corporate profits, such as royalties and interest payments, and income earned by foreign branches of U.S. firms are taxed currently. ", "In common with many other countries, the United States has anti-abuse rules to tax income that is easily shifted on a current basis. Internationally, they are called CFC rules, but in the United States they are commonly referred to as Subpart F rules, after the section of the tax code containing the rules. The rules apply to foreign firms in which U.S. shareholders own at least 50% of the voting power or value, for U.S. shareholders owning at least 10% of the voting interest. Many CFCs are wholly owned by a single U.S. parent. ", "Subpart F rules currently tax passive income (such as interest) received by a subsidiary, income of sales and services subsidiaries in foreign countries where the production and consumption of those goods and services take place in other countries, and income from insurance of risks outside the country (or within the country if receiving the same premiums). Income invested in U.S. property (including lending to the parent) is taxed currently (to prevent a way to repatriate without paying dividends). There are de minimis exclusions (for small amounts or shares or tax rates more than 90% of the U.S. rates) and full inclusion rules (when Subpart F income is more than 70% of total income). ", "Other countries have similar rule features that trigger current taxation, such as type of income and tax rate. EU member countries are constrained in applying CFC rules to other EU member states. ", "Since the late 1990s, the scope of Subpart F has been reduced by the adoption of check-the-box rules. Check-the-box was a regulatory provision, but it has been codified and extended through the temporary look-through rules, set to expire after 2019. The provision allows a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. parent to elect to disregard its own (second tier) subsidiary, incorporated in a different country, as a separate entity. If the second tier subsidiary borrows from the first tier subsidiary, it can deduct the interest in the country of incorporation; normally, the payment of interest would be considered Subpart F income and taxed currently. Under check-the-box, the payment is not recognized because there is no separate entity. If the first tier subsidiary is in a no-tax jurisdiction, the interest will be deducted, but not taxed currently. This type of arrangement creates what is referred to as a hybrid entity, which is characterized differently in different jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Tax Credit and Cross-Crediting", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. tax system allows a credit against U.S. tax due on foreign source income for foreign income taxes. This foreign tax credit is designed to prevent double taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Thus, firms are not levied a combined U.S. and foreign tax in excess of the greater of the foreign tax or U.S. tax due if the income were earned in the United States. If the foreign tax credit had no limit, a worldwide system with current taxation and a foreign tax credit would produce the same result, for firms, as a residence-based tax, because the tax effectively applying would be the tax of the country of residence. Firms in countries with a higher rate than the U.S. rate would get a refund for the excess tax, and firms in countries with a lower rate than the U.S. rate would pay the difference. However, to protect the nation's revenues from excessively high foreign taxes, the credit is limited to the U.S. tax due. ", "Cross-crediting occurs when credits for taxes paid to one country, that are in excess of the U.S. tax due on income from that country, can be used to offset U.S. tax due on income earned in a second country that imposes little or no tax. If the limit were applied on a country-by-country basis, a firm would pay the minimum of the U.S. tax or the foreign tax in each country.", "Cross-crediting also allows income subject to a low tax to have its U.S. income tax offset by credits on highly taxed income. For this reason, foreign tax credit limits are applied to different categories of income, or baskets. The main baskets are passive and active baskets. Notably, however, royalties on active business operations are classified in the active basket, and because they are typically not taxed in the country of source, they can benefit from excess credits against U.S. tax from foreign taxes on active income. There are also restrictions on the use of excess credits generated from oil and gas extraction, which is often subject to relatively high foreign tax rates. ", "The combination of deferral, which allows firms to choose the income to be subject to tax, and cross-crediting means that multinational firms on average have relatively little U.S. tax; the effective U.S. residential tax is estimated at 3.3%. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Allocation of Income", "paragraphs": ["The first right of taxation goes to the source country, regardless of whether the residence country has a territorial tax or a worldwide tax with a foreign tax credit. ", "To assess some of the actions considered in the allocation of income, whether suggested or rejected, it is important to consider the fundamental definition of a tax on profits (or income from capital). Income from capital is created by investment, which involves forgoing resources in the present to obtain income in the future. The return can simply be the cost of waiting or opportunity cost (because resources could earn interest elsewhere) in the form of a riskless return and a risk premium that compensates for uncertainty and variability of the future return. Presumably, then, the profit representing waiting should accrue to the owner of the asset or the entity that gave up resources to make investments, and the profit representing risk should be borne by the person subject to the risk. When firms, especially closely related firms, are located in different taxing jurisdictions, the allocation of profits, whether returns to waiting or returns to risk, can become complicated. ", "Successful innovations can also result in excess returns (beyond the amounts necessary to attract capital), either because of patent protection or other features that incur a degree of monopoly power over some time period. Because the returns are the upside of risk bearing, they should accrue to the party bearing the risk. ", "Note that under an income tax, the returns should accrue based on the investment; the size of the market (i.e., the provision of customers) is not a source of value, although the prospective market size is a factor in a decision to undertake an investment. This view is embodied in the basic international rules. ", "As discussed later in this report, risk bearing is an important issue in the BEPS standards as well as in the GAO review of the transfer pricing issues addressed by BEPS.

A U.S. firm that exports abroad, without taking part in an activity within the country it is exporting to, is not subject to profits taxes by that country. To establish the right to tax, a firm has to have nexus, or connection, with the country, which requires a permanent establishment. A permanent establishment is generally viewed as having a physical presence, which means that some assets are in the country (and a profits tax is a tax on the return to assets). Obviously a firm that manufactures abroad or has retail stores abroad has a physical presence, but other circumstances with a minimal presence are less clear. If nexus is established, then the amount of income sourced in that country must be determined. ", "In the U.S. tax law, this establishment of a presence is termed effectively connected income and generally must require a physical presence or be derived from assets that are used in the United States. Tax treaties (discussed below under Action 6) also contain provisions on permanent establishment.", "Because most income sourced abroad is not subject to U.S. tax on a current basis, U.S. firms can benefit by recognizing profit in low-tax-rate jurisdictions.

", "To shift profits through leveraging, firms locate their debt in high-tax countries, including the United States. This technique involves both U.S. multinational firms locating their debt in the United States rather than abroad and foreign parents of U.S. subsidiaries locating debt in their U.S. subsidiaries. As noted above, the creation of a hybrid entity by check-the-box can also lead to reducing profit taxable by the U.S. system, although it is not clear whether the United States or other high-tax countries lose revenue.", "The tax code contains general provisions (called thin capitalization rules) to restrict large interest deductions, disallowing deductions that exceed 50% of income before interest, depreciation, and certain other deductions. There is also a safe harbor, so that the limit does not apply if the debt-to-equity ratio is not greater than 1.5 to 1. Recently, new regulations issued under Section 385 would require some debt between related entities to be reclassified as equity. ", "The second method of profit shifting is through transfer pricing methods that determine the price associated with a transfer of goods and assets. The standard for transfer pricing is that goods and assets bought and sold between related firms should reflect arm's length pricing, that is, the price that would be paid by two unrelated firms. If a U.S. firm sells a good or asset to its foreign subsidiary for a price that is too low, profit in the United States is reduced and profit abroad is increased. ", "Most of the transfer pricing issues arise due to intangible assets that are often unique, so there is not a market to observe arm's length prices. A variety of different methods are used to determine transfer prices. When an intangible asset is transferred abroad (such as the right to sell a mobile phone or to sell advertising for a search engine), there is sometimes a buy-in payment by the foreign subsidiary, followed by cost-sharing payments. The subsidiary pays for a share of the research costs in the United States in return for a share of the rights (to future technological advances).

It refers to numerous online activities, such as advertising, broadcasting and media, production monitoring, retailing, and tracking, as well as financial services, remote education and health care diagnosis and records, software, and cloud computing.

Economic presence might be measured by sales, having a local domain name or website, having a local payment option, the volume of data collected, contract conclusion with customers, and monthly active users.

A physical presence in a country would require some amount of capital assets (such as a building or equipment), but a digital presence would not. The adoption of economic rather than physical presence as a basis for nexus could have consequences for U.S. firms in that other countries might increase taxes imposed, which might ultimately be credited by the United States.", "Standards were not provided specific to the digital economy with respect to profits taxes and passive income from capital.

If the German subsidiary were a separate entity for U.S. tax purposes, Subpart F rules would treat the interest income paid by the German subsidiary to the Cayman Islands subsidiary as currently taxable.

Traditionally, a permanent establishment has been considered to be a physical presence. Tax authorities in many countries and cases have not been able in court to address profit attribution because of the lack of a permanent establishment (which meant they did not have standing).", "This action item addresses several issues in avoiding permanent establishment. The first is avoiding the permanent establishment status through the use of a commissionaire arrangement, which is an arrangement in certain civil law countries (such as France and Germany). In a commissionaire arrangement, a firm (the agent) would sell products in its own name but on behalf of a foreign enterprise (the principal) that owns the products. Legal title passes directly from the principal to the customer. Customers, however, have only a contract with the commissionaire and can only sue the commissionaire; the commissionaire has a contract with the principal. The principal can substitute for a distributor and avoid having a permanent establishment. The firm owning the products does not have permanent establishment and thus does not pay tax on profits. The commissionaire pays taxes only on a commission that is set by contract usually based on a cost-plus formula or a percentage of sales value. This treatment can reduce the amount of profit taxes in the country where products are sold, which could be larger if the sales were made by a subsidiary or related company established in the country of sales. ", "In a related strategy, a clause in the OECD Model Tax Convention, Article 5(5), provides there is no permanent establishment if contracts are not concluded in the state where sales take place, and Article 5(6) provides there is no permanent establishment where the person who habitually exercises the authority to conclude contracts is an independent agent.", "This measure would modify Articles 5(5) and 5(6) to include as a basis of permanent establishment circumstances where the agent habitually concludes contracts or plays the leading role or when the independent agent acts almost exclusively for the principal where it is closely related (based on all the relevant facts and circumstances). ", "The second issue to avoid permanent establishment status is due to a list of exceptions to business operations that were considered to be preparatory or auxiliary. A concern is that these activities, in the digital age, may now be considered core (as discussed in Action 1). (An example might be a warehouse for storing and delivering goods that the enterprise sells online.) Another concern is fragmentation, in which firms divide operations into several smaller ones to make the argument that the activities of each are preparatory or auxiliary. The action item would add language to define what is preparatory or auxiliary in light of the core activities or the firm and to consider the whole of activities. ", "This action item also addresses other strategies, such as those that split up contracts into shorter periods of less than a year with different companies so that they do not meet the standards for permanent establishment. It notes that the principal purposes test, or PPT (discussed below in Action 6), would address splitting up of contracts as well. The action item mentioned, but did not address, the use of a network of agents to sell insurance.", "The OECD subsequently released a discussion draft on the attribution of profits to permanent establishments, even though this issue is addressed in Actions 8-10 on transfer pricing. These changes in determining permanent establishment are to be included in the multilateral instrument discussed in Action 15. Note also that Actions 8-10 also limit intragroup interest paid to companies without sufficient substance to a risk free rate.", "Why permanent establishment revisions should be an important part of BEPS is a concern, because a significant amount of profit shifting would be unlikely. These limited business involvements would seem to imply modest, if any, profit reallocations. U.S. firms are concerned that permanent establishment status may open the door to inappropriate assignment of profits to what are, essentially, countries that are the target of exports (concerns that may have increased given some actions in the EU state aid cases, with Apple and other firms, and the enactment of diverted profits taxes and equalization taxes that impose taxes on firms without permanent establishments).

The second is that legal ownership alone does not necessarily generate a right to the return from exploiting an intangible. This latter concern specifically mentions cost-contribution arrangements (discussed earlier) that are used in the United States, referred to as cost-sharing arrangements.", "In addition, the items note that a capital-rich member that provides funding but does not control the risks will be entitled to no more than a riskless return or less (e.g., if the transaction is not rational). The OECD documents sometimes call these cash boxes, which are also limited by other BEPS action items. The CbC reporting in Action 13 (discussed below) provides information that assists in the risk assessment and other transfer pricing issues.", "These action items stress that outcomes based on contracts do not necessarily reflect reality.
