Congress responded with the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA; P.L. 107-252). HAVA created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), established a set of election administration requirements, and provided federal funding, but it did not supplant state and local control over election administration. Several issues have arisen or persisted in the years since HAVA was enacted.", "Some observers have criticized the EAC for being obtrusive, slow, ineffectual, or even unnecessary. Others believe that the agency is an important resource for improving the election administration. The EAC lacked a quorum of commissioners between 2011 and 2015.", "HAVA requires computerized state voter registration systems, and its voting-system requirements promote the use of electronic voting systems. However, those systems, especially the kinds that record votes directly into a computer's memory (DREs), raise concerns about security and reliability. In response, many states have enacted requirements for paper ballot records that can be verified by the voter and used in recounts.", "All states now use paper-based optical scan systems for at least some voters, and most use them in at least some polling places. DRE systems are also used in most states, in many cases to meet HAVA accessibility requirements, but in several states to serve as the primary voting system in at least some jurisdictions. Several states also have jurisdictions that still use hand-counted paper ballots.", "Both DRE and optical scan voting systems are computerized, with votes counted electronically. All computerized systems, whether used in the polling place or the election office, are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access aimed at stealing, deleting, or modifying the information that the systems store or process. Such vulnerabilities apply not only to systems with Internet connectivity but also those that can be accessed electronically through other means, such as memory cards.", "Documented intrusions into systems of state and local election offices and political organizations in 2016 have amplified concerns about attempts by nation-states such as Russia, or by nonstate actors, to use tampering or disinformation campaigns to influence the election. The Department of Homeland Security and the EAC are providing assistance to states to help them secure their systems. Whether such actions will be sufficient is a subject of ongoing debate, although many observers expect that the risk of tampering is minimal.", "HAVA's limited voter-identification provisions did not resolve the longstanding controversy over whether broad identification requirements are needed to prevent voter fraud, or whether such requirements would create an unacceptable risk of disenfranchising legitimate voters. Many states have enacted requirements that voters present identification documents at polling places. Also, while HAVA's voter-registration requirements may have improved that process, some observers have argued that more automated registration systems are needed to make further improvements.", "HAVA authorized $3.65 billion in payments to states to replace voting systems and meet the requirements of the act. Congress appropriated $3.28 billion of that amount between FY2003 and FY2010. Altogether, more than $3.5 billion of HAVA funds were appropriated through FY2016: the $3.28 billion in election reform payments to states, $196 million for the EAC and its programs, and more than $129 million in accessibility payments to states, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. Numerous bills to amend HAVA have been considered in Congress, but none have been enacted except the 2009 MOVE Act, which made some amendments relating to uniformed services and overseas voters.", "In the 114th Congress, H.R. 195, reported by the Committee on House Administration, would eliminate the EAC and transfer its functions to the Federal Election Commission. House-passed appropriations bills for FY2014 and FY2015 would have defunded the EAC, but the agency has received about $10 million in final appropriations for each fiscal year since FY2012.

Nevertheless, DREs constituted about 70% of all voting equipment used in the 2014 election. That is because a jurisdiction using DREs as the primary voting systems needs many more units of voting equipment than a jurisdiction using optical scan. For each polling place using DREs, each machine serves as a voting station, so several units may be required to accommodate the number of voters, whereas a jurisdiction using optical scan will often need only one counting machine at each polling place, and none if the ballots are scanned at the elections office rather than at the polling place.

They can reduce the risk of some types of tampering historically associated with paper ballots, but many observers believe that they pose a greater security risk overall than optical scan systems.

Each voter selects and marks ballot choices and casts the ballot via a computer interface, and the voting machine records the votes directly to an electronic memory. The choices the voter sees on the face of the machine are ephemeral\u2014they are reset after the voter casts the ballot.

In ten of those states all of the machines produce a VVPAT, but in the others, some or all jurisdictions use DRE devices without VVPAT as their primary polling place voting systems. Seven states use DREs as the standard voting system in all polling places, with two of those using VVPAT. Altogether, about 20% of jurisdictions with DREs as standard equipment use VVPAT.

In addition to attacks that can disrupt access, compromise ballot secrecy, or even delete or modify ballots, even the authentication of voters online can be a challenge. However, the risk of adverse impacts from an attack varies substantially, depending on the role of the Internet in the voting process and the proportion of voters using the option.

Those factors contributed to the use of obsolete voting technology that is thought to have been a significant source of problems associated with the 2000 presidential election. ", "HAVA payments to states of almost $3.3 billion (see \" Funding under HAVA \") resulted in most states replacing or updating their voting systems within a few years after enactment. Most of those payments are available until expended, along with interest earned by states from them. More than 90% of HAVA payments to states were appropriated in FY2003 and FY2004. States had spent 70% of available funds by the end of 2008 and 89% by the end of FY2015, with all but eight states having funds remaining at that time, ranging from $45,000 to $45 million, with a median of $2.4 million\u2014about 7% of the median amount expended per state.", "The 2014 Presidential Commission report, among other sources, expressed concerns about the aging voting systems bought with HAVA funds. The useful life of a computer tends to be less than 10 years, on average, with private-sector and government organizations often using a 4-year life cycle for planning. Many of the electronic voting devices, ballot counters, and supporting information systems in use by election jurisdictions are approaching or have already exceeded those projected lifespans, and there appear to be significant barriers to the development, certification, and acquisition of replacement systems. Such aging systems are at greater risk of breakdowns and other technical problems, but they may also be more vulnerable to tampering via cyberattack or other means. The costs of updating those systems are difficult to estimate but may well exceed the unexpended HAVA payments of most states.

", "In 2010, consolidation of the voting-system market led to the dissolution of Premier Election Systems, the second-largest vendor at the time. The attempted acquisition of Premier's assets and customers by Election Systems & Software (ES&S), the company with the largest market share, raised antitrust concerns that led the Department of Justice to require a partial divestiture by ES&S. Dominion Voting, a Canadian firm, acquired the divested resources, and later acquired what was then the third-largest U.S. vendor, Sequoia Voting Systems.", "The entrance of Dominion into the U.S. market caused little debate, but other attempted acquisitions and mergers involving foreign-owned companies have been more controversial. An earlier attempt involving Sequoia and a company with some ties to Venezuela was withdrawn following public outcry, and the 2012 acquisition by a Spanish enterprise of a Florida company that provides some election-related software also caused controversy.", "In 2016, documented intrusions into systems of state and local election offices and political organizations have amplified concerns about foreign influence. The Director of National Intelligence has stated that the \"U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations,\" and that those compromises and subsequent disclosures \"are intended to interfere with the US election process.\" With respect to the intrusions into systems of election offices, the Director stated that \"most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company\" but noted that \"we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government.\" In addition, just as cybercriminals and other adversaries have stolen information on customers and employees from businesses and government agencies, they might also target elements of the election infrastructure to obtain personal information on voters.", "However, in addition to well-established cybersecurity measures that can be taken by election jurisdictions, election administration as currently practiced in the United States would appear to create substantial barriers to intrusions with widespread impact. Some observers have pointed in particular to the longstanding pattern of decentralization and diversity that characterizes the U.S. election administration infrastructure, as well as a range of layered defenses that election jurisdictions have long had in place to protect the integrity of elections from a variety of risks. For those and other reasons, many observers expect that the risk of impacts of attempted intrusions is minimal at present. The Intelligence Community and the Department of Homeland Security have found that for those reasons, \"it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion.\"", "Nevertheless, some observers believe it feasible that a persistent, experienced adversary with sufficient resources, such as a nation-state, could in fact perform cyberattacks that affect an election and are difficult to detect. Successful attacks could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of election information or processes. That could create problems in elections in several ways. For example, voter registration lists could be deleted or altered. Information obtained illegally from cyberattacks could be used to misinform voters. Other information systems used by election officials could be disrupted or even destroyed. Disinformation could be disseminated to influence public opinion\u2014a tactic used by Russians in other countries.", "Such attacks could erode public confidence in the administration of elections, by causing disruptions at polling places or delaying post-election certification of the results, for example. However, disruptive attacks are arguably likely to be detected quickly and unlikely to directly affect the outcome of the election. A potentially more worrisome threat could arise from attacks aimed at modifying electronic vote counts in favor of a particular candidate or ballot choice, especially in a close contest. Both DRE and optical scan voting systems are potentially vulnerable to such attacks. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defensive Measures Against Cyberattacks", "paragraphs": ["Broadly speaking, defensive measures range from those aimed at prevention of an attack or other incident, to detection and response, to recovery after an attack. In the past, most attention was given to prevention, including measures such as ensuring that voting systems meet current technical standards such as the VVSG and that procedures to prevent tampering are followed by election workers. However, it is now generally recognized among cybersecurity experts that preventive measures are insufficient by themselves and that an adversary with enough motivation, resources, and expertise, such as a nation-state, can often overcome them. In many cases, successful attacks might not be discovered until months later, if at all, depending on the skills and motivations of the attacker. Such attacks could be especially serious if aimed at manipulating vote counts to change the outcome of an election. Effective defense requires ways of detecting, responding to, and recovering from successful intrusions. ", "It is for such reasons that some experts propose that election systems have ways of auditing results that are independent of any software used in casting and counting the votes. The most well-known way to achieve that would be to require that all voting systems produce paper ballots that can be verified by voters and that will serve as the official record of the votes for any recount. In the case of states permitting absentee voting by electronic submission of completed ballots, that could be accomplished by requiring that the ballot also be sent by postal mail. Such a system would permit manual audits that could be effective at ensuring that the actual outcome of the election can be determined even if there is a cyberattack, equipment malfunction, or other incident or flaw that changes the electronic count. What should trigger such an audit? Various criteria have been suggested, with some observers arguing that manual audits should be performed routinely for a subset of cast ballots. ", "However, such views remain controversial within the broader community of election professionals, with at least some arguing that layered security and other safeguards can make DRE and optical scan systems sufficiently safe from tampering. Overall, good security practices involve assessing and responding to risks over the entire life cycle of an election, avoiding overemphasis on any one segment (such as voting in the polling place) or set of components (such as voting equipment).", "In light of the documented breaches and concerns about security, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has offered assistance to states in addressing the security of their election systems, in addition to the efforts of the EAC. DHS has formed a working group that includes some chief state election officials. Federal intelligence agencies are also reportedly involved in efforts to counter any foreign threats to U.S. elections. Some observers have suggested that state election systems be designated as critical infrastructure under federal law (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)), although others have expressed concern about implications for state control of such a designation.

In the 109 th Congress, the House passed legislation to require photo identification and proof of citizenship when voting in federal elections, but no further action followed. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an Indiana statute requiring photo identification for voting. The degree of restrictiveness and kinds of identification accepted have been controversial in some cases, with debate focusing on the degree to which voter fraud is a significant issue that such ID requirements can address, and the proper balance between protecting against such fraud and minimizing the risk that otherwise qualified voters would be disenfranchised by the requirements.
