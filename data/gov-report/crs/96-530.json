Instead of a former Member forfeiting all of his or her pension annuities as under the Hiss Act, the House bill disallowed credit for service time as a Member of Congress if that person, while a Member, had committed acts that led to a felony conviction under several anti-corruption statutes.

Under the pension forfeiture provisions in HLOGA, a Member of Congress would lose all of the creditable service as a Member for pension purposes if that person engaged in the prohibited conduct while in Congress. The STOCK Act expanded that provision so that a Member of Congress would lose the credit for service as a Member for pension purposes if convicted of one of the numerous corruption offenses for conduct engaged in not only during the time such person served as a Member of Congress, but also during the time such person served in office as the President, the Vice President, or as an elected official of a state or local government.

Chief Justice Marshall explained simply and clearly that an ex post facto law \"is one which renders an act punishable in a manner in which it was not punishable when it was committed.\"", "Although Congress may not increase the penalty or \"punishment\" for an that has already occurred, the Court has allowed certain legislation that it deemed to be \"regulatory\" rather than punitive in nature and intent, which did in fact affect the rights or property of individuals based on pre-enactment conduct. However, a lower federal court in the celebrated Alger Hiss case found that the Hiss Act, if applied retroactively to deny Alger Hiss his pension, was punitive in nature and not regulatory, and was therefore a prohibited ex post facto law adopted by Congress after Hiss had engaged in the subject conduct:", "The question before us is not whether Hiss or Strasburger are good or bad men, nor is it whether we would grant them annuities if we had unfettered discretion in the matter.

We hold that as applied retroactively to the plaintiffs the challenged statute is penal, cannot be sustained as regulation, and is invalid as an ex post facto law prohibited by the Constitution.", "It would therefore appear from the judicial precedents that the application of any provision to deny a pension to a Member of Congress for the commission of a crime deemed to be a felony under federal law could be prospective only.

As to any future annuity payments affected, even those \"earned\" or expected prior to the commission of the particular crime in question, judicial precedents have provided a clear indication that future annuity payments to be provided by the government for its officers, employees, veterans or others do not create a current property right or interest in such future payments, but rather create a mere \"expectancy\" or \"government fostered expectation\" that may be modified, revoked, or suspended by the authority granting it through subsequent legislation. That is, as specifically found by federal courts, \"even where ... there has been compulsory contribution to a retirement or pension fund the employee has no vested right in it until the particular event happens upon which the money or part of it is to be paid,\" and thus a \"pension granted by the Government confers no right which cannot be revised, modified or recalled by subsequent legislation.\" There would thus appear to be no violation or abrogation of any specific \"contract\" by increasing the penalties for the violations of certain specific crimes to include forfeiture or partial forfeiture of anticipated federal annuity payments, even those future benefits that had accrued (or for which credit had been \"earned\") prior to the commission of the crime. It should be noted that the current provisions of the so-called \"Hiss Act,\" originally adopted in 1954, operate in the manner questioned. A federal officer's or employee's annuity payments, even those that were \"credited\" to him or her or \"earned\" over the course of many years, may be forfeited upon the subsequent conviction of one of the particular national security-related crimes designated in the Hiss Act, in a somewhat similar manner as the loss of \"creditable service\" for a violation of one of the anti-corruption provisions in the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loss of Pension Annuities and the 27th Amendment", "paragraphs": ["The pension forfeiture provisions of HLOGA took effect upon enactment, September 14, 2007, and apply to any crime committed after that date. The question has arisen as to whether, because of the 27 th Amendment to the United States Constitution, the law would require a delayed effective date so the new pension forfeiture provisions could not apply to Members until after the end of the 110 th Congress. From the history of the amendment, and the relatively little case law, it does not appear that the new pension forfeiture law would be required to specifically include a \"delayed\" effective date to comport with the 27 th Amendment, for several reasons.", "Initially, it should be noted that the 27 th Amendment is self-executing and does not require a specifically stated delayed effective date. This constitutional provision does not prohibit the enactment of a law that would change the compensation for services of a Member during the current Congress, but rather states that no law so enacted \"shall take effect\" until an election of Representatives has intervened. Even if new pension forfeiture provisions were found to vary the \"compensation for the services\" of a Member, the constitutional provision merely provides that the law would not \"take effect\" until after the next election. A retired Member of Congress who had committed an offense newly covered under the law while a Member (after the passage of the new law), who had committed such offense during the Congress adopting such legislation (110 th Congress), and who sought to have his or her pension annuities not diminished by forfeiting \"creditable service,\" could thus raise the 27 th Amendment defense and, in the event that a court agrees with the interpretation that the law had varied the \"compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives\" during this current Congress, the court could then find that the loss of creditable service would not take effect until after the next election.", "There is, however, an underlying question as to whether the 27 th Amendment would apply, in any event, to a change in the pension laws applicable to former Members of Congress. The 27 th Amendment expressly applies only to \"compensation for the services\" of Senators or Representatives. As noted by the sponsor of the provision, James Madison, and in the states ratifying the provision, the intent of the constitutional restriction was to prevent current Members from obtaining the \"particular benefit\" of increasing their own salaries. It thus might be argued that the provision appears to apply to salaries (or fees) as compensation for services, as opposed to a future annuity or pension, or other such potential retirement benefits provided only upon certain contingencies to those who are former Members of Congress. In a case dealing with a procedural \"standing\" issue, dismissing a challenge under the 27 th Amendment to the automatic cost-of-living adjustments for Congress which, it was argued, would affect the future pension of a Member of Congress, the United States District Court in Colorado expressly noted:", "The Twenty-seventh Amendment does not deal with congressional pensions. Plaintiffs cite no authority that indicates congressional pensions fall under the Twenty-seventh Amendment....\"", "While there is a substantial question as to whether a future pension to be paid to a former Member of Congress only upon certain qualifying contingencies (e.g., age and years of service) is \"compensation\" to a current Member as contemplated by the 27 th Amendment, the issue has been mooted and is no longer relevant since the end of the 110 th Congress with respect to HLOGA, and will be after the end of the 112 th Congress for the STOCK Act amendments."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
