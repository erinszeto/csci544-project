In the 110th Congress, proposals included a number of legislative initiatives to increase domestic oil production. These proposals fell into two broad categories: (1) to open areas of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which were under a leasing moratoria; and (2) to encourage companies holding oil and gas leases to diligently develop leases to bring them into production. Two bills were introduced that would have denied new leases to those lessees who were not developing their leases or producing oil or gas (H.R. 6251 and H.R. 6515). The two bills, which included similar provisions, were introduced under suspension of the rules in the House and both failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds support. Comparable legislation was introduced in the Senate (S. 3239).", "As the 111th Congress begins, Congress is faced with issues such as enhancing domestic energy supply and security while assessing areas of environmental concern.

The recent congressional action approving the Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2009 (P.L. 110-329, enacted September 30, 2008), that continued the funding of government activities through March 6, 2009, or until a regular appropriations bill is enacted, omitted language that provided for the congressional OCS moratoria along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Those areas may now be made available for preleasing, leasing, and related activity that could lead to oil and gas development.

This act was said to promote an \"expeditious and environmentally responsible\" development of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPRA) and would have denied new leases to lessees that were not diligently developing their leases, producing oil or gas, or relinquishing non-producing leases. Proponents of this bill argued that many of the lessees are \"sitting\" on federal leases, and not producing oil or gas.", "Although both bills, H.R. 6515 , and H.R. 6251 , retained the 10-year primary oil and gas lease term, language removed from an earlier version of H.R. 6251 would have reduced the primary lease term (for onshore and deepwater offshore) from a 10-year term to five years (with extensions possible).

It is unclear how much, and how quickly, additional production would take place on non-producing leases. Some critics of \"use it or lose it\" proposals argued that these proposals could create a disincentive for companies to seek leases, and/or result in lower bonus bids on new leases. A \"use it or lose it\" policy, critics of the bills argued, would not necessarily lead to additional production sooner; it might, in fact, undercut that objective. As noted, implementation of \"use it or lose it\" legislation could result in fewer bids or lower bid offers if a more stringent timeline were to be imposed on all leases held. However, by maintaining the 10-year primary term, as both bills would have done, more federal funds might be appropriated for permitting, and other required environmental reviews.", "A similar bill in the Senate ( S. 3239 , Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act) would have denied lessees new leases unless lessees were producing oil or gas on currently held leases; if lessees did not diligently develop each lease, they would have been required to relinquish them.

EIA projected that offshore crude oil production would increase from about 1.4 mbd to 2.2 mbd by 2030. When the EIA included access to the OCS, without the leasing moratoria, production was projected to rise by an additional 200,000 barrels per day by 2020 with no significant impact on prices. Based on mean resource estimates by the MMS, an ICF International report prepared for the American Petroleum Institute estimates an increase in OCS production of 286,000 barrels per day in 2030 with increased access to the OCS. When ICF assumed a much larger resource base for the OCS (and without the leasing moratoria), oil production was estimated to increase 900,000 barrels per day in 2030. ", "An anticipated rise in U.S. domestic production on federal lands is seen as coming primarily from deepwater offshore areas as shallow water and onshore oil fields are in decline. According to the MMS, deepwater oil already accounts for more than 70% of offshore production and 18.5 % of total U.S. crude oil production. Since 2002, shallow water lease sales have dropped from 418 to 264 while deepwater lease sales rose from 281 to 633. Deepwater lease sales spiked in 1997 at 1,110, following the Deepwater Royalty Relief Act of 1995. Further, it is notable that there has been increasing exploration activity and an increase in reported finds in the Gulf of Mexico in very deep waters since 2003.

In the Undiscovered Technically Recoverable Resources category, the MMS estimates oil resources to be near 86 billion barrels.

Bush, and extended to 2012 by President Bill Clinton. The Congressional ban began in 1981 and was expanded and continued through the annual appropriations process since that time. Each year Congress must approve language that would prohibit funding for pre-leasing and leasing activity in designated areas of the OCS. However, separate withdrawals might be enacted legislatively, such as provided in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA, P.L. 109 - 432 ) which placed nearly all of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico under a leasing and drilling moratorium until 2022. The Eastern Gulf of Mexico was not part of the Executive OCS ban that was recently lifted by President Bush or the annual congressional ban that Congress allowed to expire on September 30, 2008. Over the past several years, there have been many legislative proposals to lift the congressional ban, some of which have been successful, on part or all of the OCS. For example, GOMESA removed a small section of the Central Gulf of Mexico (an area south of lease sale area 181; under a previous boundary configuration, the area was located in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico). In 2003, Congress omitted language from the FY2004 Interior appropriation bill that would have prevented lease sales in the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area of Alaska.
