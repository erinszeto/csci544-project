Virtually all working men and women in the United States are covered by Social Security\u2014about 96% of the labor force pay payroll taxes.", "Social Security is financed primarily on a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO hereafter) basis, in which today's workers pay for the benefits of today's retirees. The primary revenue source is a payroll tax paid by current workers and their employers.

Financial projections of the trustees also show that the trust funds will be exhausted in 2041, at which point 75% of scheduled annual benefits would be payable with income revenue.", "A primary factor underlying Social Security's long-term financial problem is the program's PAYGO financing structure in combination with the demographics of an aging society, specifically the looming retirement of the large baby boom cohort (persons born between 1946 and 1964), along with rising longevity and a low birth rate. Demographics are important because PAYGO systems, such as Social Security, are sensitive to the ratio of workers to beneficiaries, which is declining in the United States. Presently, there are about three covered workers for every beneficiary, and according to the Social Security trustees, this ratio will eventually fall to less than two to one. Between 2010 and 2030, the number of individuals age 65 or older is projected to grow by 76%, while the number of workers supporting the system is projected to grow by 6%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Social Security Debate", "paragraphs": ["The longer it takes to address Social Security's financing challenge, the greater the changes will need to be. There are, however, fundamentally diverging views on reform. One approach would maintain the current program structure and make relatively modest changes to restore the system's long-term solvency, such as increasing the retirement age, reducing the cost-of-living adjustments, or raising the amount of earnings subject to the payroll tax. A second approach would change the program's underlying structure and create a partially or fully funded system based on personal savings and investments in individual retirement accounts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Debate and the Chilean Case", "paragraphs": ["As policymakers consider how to address Social Security's challenges in the United States, other countries' experiences with retirement reforms have gained attention. Much of this attention has been directed toward countries that have adopted some sort of individual accounts program as part of their retirement system. The case of Chile, the first country to introduce a fully funded individual retirement accounts system in 1981, is often cited by both proponents and opponents of individual accounts.", "Policymakers who advocate introducing individual accounts in the United States have tended to point to Chile as a successful case. Adopting a Chilean-type system, some argue, would put the Social Security system on a path of sustainable solvency beyond the traditional 75-year projection period, since a fully funded system is not sensitive to changes in the number of workers per beneficiary. These proponents believe government-run, PAYGO systems are unsustainable in aging societies. They argue that a fully funded system, such as Chile's, would reduce future demands on the government for financing the growing costs associated with an increasingly elderly population.", "In addition, advocates of individual accounts maintain that a Chilean-style model would change the way Americans save for retirement, providing workers with a sense of ownership over their retirement savings. Individual retirement accounts, proponents maintain, would strengthen the link between contributions and benefits and thus would provide more incentives for workers to save for retirement. Moreover, American workers may earn significant returns on their contributions under an individual retirement accounts system, because their capital would be invested in stocks and bonds.", "By contrast, policymakers who advocate a more traditional approach to reform have tended to highlight the risks of a Chilean-type system. They argue that individual accounts would expose workers to the risk of investment market volatility. Implementing individual retirement accounts, others maintain, would also erode the social insurance nature of the U.S. system, which is designed to pool risk and protect workers and their families against loss of earnings due to retirement, disability, or death. A Chilean-type model, it is pointed out, would eliminate the system's progressive benefit formula, which replaces a higher share of earnings for lower earners than for higher earners. Under an individual accounts system, benefits would become strictly a function of workers' earnings and the returns achieved by their plan's investments. As a result, some workers could be worse off for reasons including poor investment decisions or downturns in financial markets. Some also argue that individual accounts do not necessarily provide the annuity features of the current U.S. system. Furthermore, critics may cite problems facing Chile's individual retirement accounts system, such as coverage gaps and high administrative costs, as evidence that implementing individual accounts in the United States would be problematic.", "Another concern raised by opponents relates to the transition costs from switching from a PAYGO to a fully funded system\u2014that is, the cost of paying accrued obligations while funding individual accounts. Adopting a Chilean-type funded system would require today's younger workers to save for their own retirements while continuing to pay taxes to cover current retirees' benefits. Others contend that, depending on the funding mechanism, an individual retirement accounts system could worsen the U.S. program's financial outlook and exacerbate current budget deficits. For example, diverting revenues from payroll taxes into individual accounts, such as carve-out accounts, would only reduce the system's long-term financing problem to the extent that the benefit offset (from lower benefits) is greater than the diverted revenues."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Chile and the United States in Comparative Perspective", "paragraphs": ["Before examining how Chile's individual retirement accounts system works, it is important to note some of the major demographic, political, and economic differences between Chile and the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basic Demographics", "paragraphs": ["Chile has a relatively small population compared to the United States (roughly 16 million compared to 300 million respectively), and a smaller share of persons 65 or older (see Table 1 ).

According to many analysts, this allowed the Chilean government to implement far-reaching pension reforms quickly and without a great amount of political consensus building. A democratic government was reinstated in Chile in 1990 and has continued the individual retirement accounts system.", "The fiscal conditions of Chile prior to the 1981 privatization reforms and the United States today are very different. A large budget surplus (e.g., 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1980) helped the Chilean government cover the transition costs to the new system. By contrast, in 2006 the U.S. federal budget recorded a deficit of $248 billion (representing 1.9% of GDP). Moreover, Chile used individual accounts to help develop its financial markets. Such markets are already well established in the United States.", "Another difference between the countries is the condition of the PAYGO retirement system. Chile's PAYGO system was insolvent at the time that their retirement system was overhauled. In 1980, the program had a deficit equivalent to 2.7% of gross domestic product, and general revenues financed roughly 28% of outgoing payments. The U.S. Social Security system, by contrast, currently has a surplus (1.4% of GDP in 2006) and is projected to remain solvent until 2041. Moreover, in Chile, factors such as government mismanagement, high rates of contribution evasion, and public distrust, among other reasons, helped set the stage for replacing their PAYGO system. By contrast, the U.S. Social Security program is well-managed, covers almost the entire labor force, and enjoys broad public support.", "The two countries differ in the size and scope of their economies. Chile is a relatively small developing county recognized for its robust economic performance in the Latin American region since the 1980s.

Chile has a large number of self-employed workers (around 27% of the labor force), many of whom are part of the informal sector\u2014a segment that did not participate widely in the PAYGO system or in the current individual retirement accounts system. In contrast, the United States has a very small informal sector and the self-employed must contribute to Social Security.", "Finally, the definition of social security in Chile, as in many countries, includes sickness and maternity insurance, work injury insurance, unemployment and family allowances in addition to old-age, survivors and disability insurance.

While the program grew in size and complexity between 1924 and 1980, its basic structure remained relatively unchanged.", "Several major problems associated with Chile's PAYGO retirement system set the stage for pension reforms in 1981. It was highly fragmented, with more than three dozen different retirement schemes, each with different eligibility requirements and contribution rates. In 1973, for example, the combined employer/employee payroll contributions ranged from 19.5% to 26.0% of wages, depending on occupational type. The system was also vulnerable to political manipulation and was widely seen as inequitable. White-collar workers tended to fare better than those on the lower end of the economic spectrum. The multitude of plans and contribution rates resulted in another difficulty: high administrative inefficiencies and expenses.", "In May 1981, Chile replaced its state-run, PAYGO system with a private, fully funded individual retirement accounts system.

When an AFP has \"excess returns\" based on a defined percentage, they must put the funds into a reserve fund. Regulations also require that AFPs hold a margin account equal to 1% of the fund's value. If an AFP does not achieve a minimum return, it makes up the difference from the aforementioned 1% and excess returns funds. It should also be mentioned that from the beginning of the program to March 2000, each AFP was permitted to offer only one fund.

Under the multi-funds system, plan members are also permitted to allocate their contributions between two funds within the same AFP.

Measuring changes in the savings rate is difficult as estimates depend on assumptions of the savings levels that would have existed if no reform had taken place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System Financing", "paragraphs": ["A primary rationale for moving to a fully funded system in Chile was that it would help the retirement system achieve solvency. The transition to an individual retirement accounts system from a PAYGO system, however, has proved fiscally expensive for Chile in the short term. During the first five years of the reforms in Chile, total transition costs\u2014expenditures for current pensioners and for those who remained in the old system, plus the costs of redeeming recognition bonds\u2014ranged from 4.2% to 4.7% of GDP per year, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Transition costs peaked in the late 1980s, and during the 1990s averaged roughly 4.1% of GDP annually. The entire transition period in Chile is not expected to end until about 2050\u2014the year that benefits to those who stayed in the old system are projected to cease completely.", "Another area of concern relates to new fiscal burdens on the government resulting from the growth of minimum pension guarantees (not including the proposed expansion of the program). As Chile's individual retirement accounts system matures, forecasts project that an increasing number of future retirees will qualify for a minimum pension guarantee as many current workers are not accumulating enough in their mandatory individual accounts to fund at least a minimum pension at retirement. The share of individual account holders requiring a \"top up\" benefit to provide a minimum pension level is projected to increase to more than 30 percent as the system matures, costing the government up to 1% of GDP.", "It is worthwhile to point out several strategies that helped the Chilean government finance the transition costs, especially during the early and most expensive years of implementation. These included increasing taxes on consumption, selling a large array of state-owned enterprises, borrowing from the public, and tightening spending. These methods helped Chile build a substantial budget surplus prior to the reform (5.5% of GDP in 1980). According to the CBO, \"in general, the Chilean privatization has been quite successful in managing the transition from a pay-as-you-go to a fully funded privatized retirement system.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efficiency and Costs to Participants", "paragraphs": ["Chile's switch to individual retirement accounts was also intended to improve the efficiencies of the old system. However, among the current system's greatest problems are high administrative costs. The extent of administrative costs has become a focal point of controversy in Chile because management fees reduce a workers' net investment over their working lives and hence their final pension from the individual account. If administrative costs are reduced, more of workers' contributions can be invested (in their IAs) and therefore raise the accumulated capital in their individual accounts.", "Studies have shown that the cumulative impact of administrative charges on a workers' final capital accumulation and pension in Chile may be substantial. Over time it has been estimated that administrative fees have consumed a quarter (25%) of the accumulations of an average Chilean worker who began contributing in 1982 and retired in 2002. Administrative charges also reduce workers' rate of return. Estimates from the Superintendent of Pension Fund Management Companies (SAFP) have indicated that when commission fees are considered, average annual returns on Chilean pension funds between July 1981 and August 2001 decline from 10.83% to 7.33% for low earners and 7.59% for high earners. The disparity between high and low earners stems from a flat-fee on monthly contributions that exists in most AFPs. Unlike proportional fees, fixed charges tend to be regressive.", "There are a number of reasons for high administrative costs in the Chilean system. Given pension fund managers' incentive to entice plan members to their AFP, the system, especially in the 1990s, experienced high marketing costs and a dramatic growth in sales personnel. Increased advertising and sales representatives also led individual participants to change AFPs excessively, thereby increasing total operating costs. A lack of competition and market transparency may also contribute to high administrative costs. From the inception of the program until present, there has been a concentration of assets in a few AFPs. In July 2006, two out of the six total AFPs controlled roughly 66% of all fund assets. High administrative costs and industry concentration may have resulted from government regulation in the AFP system (e.g., regulation of fee structure, legal barriers to entry such as start-up requirements or minimum reserve fund).", "Furthermore, many Chilean workers do not to appear to be well-informed about the fees associated with their individual retirement accounts. A high level of knowledge about administrative charges, some argue, may boost competition in the AFP system by encouraging more plan members to shop around for the AFP with the lowest fee structure. A recent analysis conducted by two Chilean pension experts shows that only 3.7% of plan members were aware of variable commissions charged by AFPs (and hence unable to compare fees and performance), and 52% did not know what percentage of their income went toward contributions into an individual retirement account.", "The administrative costs reported in Chile would not necessarily be replicated in other countries given the diverse factors that drive such costs. For example, whether administrative functions are managed by the government or private entities and whether administration tasks are covered by a single entity (centralized) or diverse entities (decentralized) may play a role in administrative costs. A centralized management system of investment funds could build on the existing tax collection and record-keeping systems of the government, generate economies of scale, and spread administrative costs over more workers, thereby lowering total costs. The relatively low administrative costs in the U.S. government employees' Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is often cited as evidence of the cost advantages of a centralized single, private entity. By contrast, Chile has a decentralized structure of private pension fund management companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coverage", "paragraphs": ["The individual retirement accounts system was expected to improve participation rates in Chile, in part by linking benefits more tightly to contributions. However, active participation in the new system remains lower than expected. Whereas almost the entire Chilean workforce is enrolled in the AFP system, the share of persons actively contributing to their accounts is much smaller (see Table 5 ). In 2003 approximately 62% of the Chilean labor force, or 68% of those employed, are estimated to have contributed to their individual retirement accounts. This figure is roughly similar to the level of coverage provided under Chile's old PAYGO retirement system in the mid-1970s.", "Furthermore, not all of those that actively contribute to their accounts at one point in time will contribute to them regularly over their working life. One study estimates that an average Chilean worker entering the labor force at 20 years old and retiring at 60 years old will have 21 years of contributions. Another study estimates that an average plan member makes contributions for about 54% of his/her potential working life. While around one fifth of plan members make contributions nearly 100% of the time over their careers, a substantial portion of the population does not make regular contributions. Individuals may not contribute regularly for various reasons, such as interruptions in employment or job seasonality, non-employment, and low wages in relation to daily expenses over a lifetime.", "These trends reflect a growing concern in Chile that the current system does not cover the entire labor force and provides inadequate benefits to an important segment of workers. According to a Chilean government's study baseline projection, nearly 40% of workers affiliated with an AFP will accumulate enough capital to fund a benefit above the minimum level, 10% will qualify for a minimum benefit \"top up,\" and nearly half will reach retirement with less than the minimum pension and fewer than 20 years of contributions.", "Several factors help explain why participation in the Chilean individual retirement accounts system has not been greater. The labor market in Chile has a high share of self-employed workers, roughly 27% of the labor force, and a large informal sector. The participation rate for self-employed workers (which is voluntary) dropped from 12% to 7% between 1986 and 2003, while salaried workers rose from 63% to 76%. Chilean men contribute to their accounts almost 40% more months than women, who work fewer years, experience interrupted periods of employment due to child rearing and have lower lifetime earnings. Another factor may be the minimum pension guarantee, which may create incentives for lower income workers to contribute just long enough to qualify for the minimum pension (20 years), and soon thereafter stop making contributions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Obtaining knowledge of other countries' experience with reforms in their social insurance programs has gained importance in recent years as policymakers contemplate how to address Social Security's long-term financial challenges. It is difficult, however, to draw general lessons from one country's experience, as there is no universal solution to reform. Social security systems operate differently in different countries; each faces its own unique set of political and socioeconomic conditions and has a different set of income support programs for the elderly. Moreover, what is viewed as successful or desirable in one country may not be in another. Nevertheless, information of reformed retirement systems around the globe can provide valuable insight to policymakers.", "The performance of Chile's individual retirement accounts system is mixed. Individual retirement accounts have contributed to the Chilean economy in a number of ways and the returns on pension fund investments have been greater than expected. The system seems to work well for workers with stable jobs who contribute regularly to their accounts over their working lives. However, the transition to an individual retirement accounts system has proved fiscally expensive for Chile. Concerns remain about low participation rates, especially among women and low-income workers, including members of the informal sector. Analysts also agree that administrative costs have been too high.", "In an attempt to address these problems and improve the system, a pension reform bill was sent to the Chilean Congress for consideration in 2007. The bill aims to reduce administrative costs, increase benefits, and expand coverage to supplement the shortfalls in the existing system's safety net. This development suggests that the Chilean individual retirement accounts model continues to evolve after 26 years of existence."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
