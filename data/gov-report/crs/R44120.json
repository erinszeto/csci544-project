Over the next decade, in response to the demands of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress increased the authorized personnel strength of the Army and Marine Corps. Some of these increases were quite substantial, particularly after FY2006, but Congress began reversing these increases in anticipation of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2011, the drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan which began in 2012, and budgetary constraints. End-strengths for the Air Force and Navy have been generally declining since 2001. In FY2015, authorized end-strengths were as follows: Army (490,000), Navy (323,600), Marine Corp (184,100), and Air Force (312,980). Given the budgetary outlook, including the future impact of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), the Army plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 420,000 and 450,000 by FY2017, while the Marine Corps plans to reduce its active personnel strength to between 175,000 and 182,000 in the FY2017-2019 timeframe.

Much of this can be attributed to the reductions in Navy Reserve strength during this period. There were also modest shifts in strength for some other components of the Selected Reserve. For comparative purposes, the authorized end strengths for the Selected Reserves for FY2001 were as follows: Army National Guard (350,526), Army Reserve (205,300), Navy Reserve (88,900), Marine Corps Reserve (39,558), Air National Guard (108,022), Air Force Reserve (74,358), and Coast Guard Reserve (8,000).

It would also have maintained the cap on the pay of officers in the O-7 through O-10 paygrades at the Executive Schedule level II rate for 2014, thereby ensuring that no general or flag officers receive an increase in basic pay.", "On August 28, President Obama sent a letter to Congress invoking 37 U.S.C. 1009(e) to set the pay raise for 2016 at 1.3%.

However, USERRA specifically exempts types of duty from counting towards the five year limit, for example, reservist activations under the long-standing activation authorities known as Full Mobilization, Partial Mobilization, and Presidential Reserve Call-Up. In 2011, Congress created two new mobilization authorities for reservists in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 ( P.L. 112-81 ). Codified at 10 U.S.C. 12304a and 12304b, these new activation authorities allow 120-day activations of certain reservists for disaster response and 365 day activations for preplanned missions in support of the combatant commands (12304a).

However, not all types of service are considered active military service for this purpose. In general, active service means full-time service, other than active duty for training, as a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard; as a commissioned officer of the Public Health Service; or as a commissioned officer of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or its predecessors. Active service also includes a period of active duty for training during which the person was disabled or died from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty and any period of inactive duty for training during which the person was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from certain health conditions incurred during the training. Additional circumstances of service, and whether they are deemed to be active military service, are set out in law (38 U.S.C. 101).
