Current law weights the allocation of immigrant visas heavily toward aliens with close family in the United States and, to a lesser extent, toward aliens who meet particular employment needs. The diversity immigrant category was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by the Immigration Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-649) to stimulate \"new seed\" immigration (i.e., to foster new, more varied migration from other parts of the world).", "To be eligible for a diversity visa, the INA requires that the foreign national must have a high school education or the equivalent, or two years experience in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience. The foreign national or the foreign national's spouse must be a native of one of the countries listed as a foreign state qualified for the diversity visa lottery. Diversity lottery winners, like all other aliens wishing to come to the United States, must undergo reviews performed by Department of State consular officers abroad and Department of Homeland Security immigration officers upon entry to the United States. These reviews are intended to ensure that the aliens are not ineligible for visas or admission under the grounds for inadmissibility spelled out in the INA.", "The diversity lottery currently makes 50,000 visas available annually to natives of countries from which immigrant admissions were lower than a total of 50,000 over the preceding five years. The formula for allocating visas is based upon the statutory specifications; visas are divided among six global geographic regions according to the relative populations of the regions, with their allocation weighted in favor of countries in regions that were under-represented among immigrant admissions to the United States during the past five years. The INA limits each country to 7%, or 3,850, of the total and provides that Northern Ireland be treated as a separate foreign state.", "The regional distribution of the source countries for diversity immigrants has shifted over time in the four years selected for comparison (FY1994, FY1999, FY2004, and FY2009). Foreign nationals from Europe garnered the overwhelming share of the diversity visas in FY1994 and maintained a plurality share in FY1999. By FY2004, foreign nationals from Africa received a share comparable to those from Europe. In FY2009, foreign nationals from Africa gained the plurality share.", "Some argue that the diversity lottery should be eliminated and its visas used for backlog reduction in other visa categories. Supporters of the diversity visa, however, argue that the diversity visa provides \"new seed\" immigrants for an immigration system weighted disproportionately to family-based immigrants from a handful of countries. Critics of the diversity lottery warn that it is vulnerable to fraud and misuse and is potentially an avenue for terrorists, citing the difficulties of performing background checks in many of the countries eligible for the diversity lottery. Supporters respond that background checks for criminal and national security matters are performed on all prospective immigrants seeking to come to the United States, including those winning diversity visas."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The purpose of the diversity immigrant visa lottery is, as the name suggests, to encourage legal immigration from countries other than the major sending countries of current immigrants to the United States.

In the 1980s, some Members of Congress began expressing concern that the U.S. legal immigration admissions were skewed in favor of immigrants from Asia and Latin America after the 1965 amendments. The first legislative response occurred in \u00a7314 of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA), which allowed an extra 5,000 immigrant visas a year for FY1987 and FY1988 to natives of 36 countries that had been adversely affected by the 1965 changes to the INA. Over 1 million people applied for what was then called the NP-5 visa lottery. Natives of Ireland were the big winners in the random lottery. In 1988, Congress extended the NP-5 visa lottery for two more years, making 15,000 immigrant visas available each year in FY1989 and FY1990.", "What is now known as the diversity immigrant category was added to the INA by the Immigration Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-649 ) and went fully into effect in FY1995. The 1990 act established temporary or transition diversity visas for FY1992-FY1994. Most notably, \u00a7132 of P.L. 101-649 provided 40,000 visas a year for a transitional program during FY1992-1994 for certain natives of foreign states that were adversely affected by the 1965 changes to the INA. At least 40% of these visas were earmarked for natives of Ireland. The current diversity visa category has had an allocation of 55,000 visas annually since FY1995. ", "While the diversity visa category has not been directly amended since its enactment, P.L. 105-100 , the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (NACARA) temporarily decreases the 55,000 annual ceiling. Beginning in FY1999, this ceiling has been reduced by up to 5,000 annually to offset immigrant numbers made available to certain unsuccessful asylum seekers from El Salvador, Guatemala, and formerly communist countries in Europe who are being granted immigrant status under special rules established by NACARA. The 5,000 offset is temporary, but it is not clear how many years it will be in effect to handle these adjustments of status."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligibility Criteria", "paragraphs": ["To be eligible for a diversity visa, the INA requires that an alien must have a high school education or the equivalent, or two years experience in an occupation which requires at least two years of training or experience.

While there is no cost to apply for the diversity lottery, the funding for the diversity visa lottery is covered by the fees that the lottery winners pay. The $305 immigrant visa fee and the $440 diversity visa fee go to the Department of State. There is also a $985 fee (plus $85 biometric fee, if applicable) paid to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to process the I-485 petition to adjust diversity visa holders to LPR status.

These reviews are intended to ensure that they are not ineligible for visas or admission under the grounds for inadmissibility spelled out in the INA. These criteria for exclusion include the following categories: health-related grounds; criminal history; security and terrorist concerns; public charge (e.g., indigence); illegal entrants; and aliens previously removed.

Europe sent 10% of all LPRs in FY2009, but made up 28% of all diversity immigrants.

Asia included many top sending countries for LPRs, such as the People's Republic of China, India, and the Philippines. Yet it also included nations that qualified for diversity visas, such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Turkey.

Indeed, Figure 4 shows that diversity immigrants were more likely to obtain LPR status as they begin their working years than were LPRs overall. The immigrant population of the United States is typically more likely to be in the prime working age group than the native-born population, and the youthful skew of the diversity immigrants' age distribution in FY2009 is even more striking. ", "Diversity immigrants were somewhat less likely to be married than LPRs generally in FY2009, perhaps a function of their relative youth. Over half (54%) of diversity immigrants were single, in contrast to 37% of LPRs overall. Few of either group were likely to be widowed, divorced or separated.
