The majority of breaches are carried out against point-of-sale (POS) systems, and are facilitated by what many consider to be the weak link in the U.S. retail sales payment process: the continued use of magnetic stripe cards (also referred to as stripe-and-signature cards). These cards are still what most U.S. consumers think of when referring to financial cards.", "In much of the rest of the world, cards that provide a much higher level of security for conducting sales transactions have been used for many years: EMV cards, named for the coalition of card brands Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (the EMV Coalition or EMVCo) that developed the specifications for the system in the 1990s. EMV cards store card information on an embedded microchip and are more commonly called chip cards. With these cards, instead of swiping and signing to make a payment, the cardholder inserts the card into the POS machine, then either enters a personal identification number (PIN) or signs to verify the transaction.", "On October 1, 2015, the liability for fraudulent transactions involving magnetic stripe cards shifted to the entity\u2014card issuer (e.g., bank, credit union) or merchant\u2014that had not yet made the transition. The transition makes U.S.-issued cards compatible with POS systems and automated teller machines in much of the rest of the world. On October 1, 2016, a new liability shift will occur: automated teller machines (ATM) that accept MasterCard branded cards must be EMV operational.

Between 1997 and 2011, card payments rose from accounting for 23% of payments to 48%. During the same period, payment by cash and checks dropped from 70% to 35%. In 2011, consumers made 49 billion debit transactions totaling $1.8 trillion and 26 billion credit transactions totaling $2.1 trillion. This shift makes card security and fraud prevention more important than ever.", "In 2012, MasterCard and Visa\u2014also called \"payment brands\" \u2014set October 1, 2015, as the date by which U.S. card issuers\u2014banks and credit unions\u2014would need to have replaced existing credit and debit magnetic stripe cards with chip cards, and for merchants to begin accepting them. Chip cards are formally known as \"EMV\" cards, named for the coalition of three companies, Europay, MasterCard, and Visa, that developed the specifications for the standard. EMVCo membership has now expanded to include the payment brands of American Express, JCB, Discover, and UnionPay. ", "There were four significant drivers of EMV adoption in the United States:", "L iability Shift. The October 1, 2015, deadline that shifted liability to the party that has not switched to chip cards is seen as a strong incentive for merchants and issuers to make the switch. Increasing Financial Impact of Fraud. In 2012, credit card losses in the United States totaled $5.33 billion, an increase of 14.5% from 2011. Between 2004 and 2010, fraud using U.S.-issued bank credit cards rose 70%. Merchants, card issuers, and consumers are adversely affected by increases in fraud. Increasing Concern o ver Data Breaches. Although the number of breaches dipped significantly between 2011 and 2012, there has been a modest increase between 2012 and 2013. Although the number of incidents in 2013 (198) is small compared to 2011 (855), a lot of attention has been paid to those breaches in the news. That attention appears to have created the perception that the number of breaches is increasing more than it actually is, raising concern among consumers, as well as policymakers. Better Security for Cards and Transactions. Chip cards make data stolen in a breach much more difficult to use: Counterfeiting is significantly more difficult than with stripe cards. Most observers, including the Federal Reserve Bank, agree that chip cards, \"regardless of the verification method used, will provide a more secure payment environment.\"", "The cost of a complete transition in the United States is expected to be at least $6 billion, but the costs for issuers and merchants that do not meet the adoption deadline could be even greater: Now that the deadline has passed, the liability for fraudulent transactions will shift to the party that has not switched to chip cards. For example, if a merchant does not accept chip cards and the customer has a chip card, the transaction will still be processed using the magnetic stripe still present on the back of the card, but the merchant will bear responsibility for any fraudulent activity. If the merchant has a chip point-of-sale (POS) terminal, but the bank has not issued a chip card to the customer, the bank will be liable. If neither or both parties have complied, the fraud liability will remain the same as it is today. Historically, the issuer has paid about 60% of losses and retailers have paid 40%. Issuers picked up most of the losses when the card was present but was fraudulent, while merchants picked up the bulk of losses when cards were not present.", "Now that October 1, 2015, has passed, exploring and understanding the ramifications of the transition\u2014or the failure to transition\u2014is likely to become increasingly important for Congress, especially if additional major breaches occur.

The scale of the theft can range from small, such as stealing a wallet, to large, such as skimming or a data breach. Data breaches can be carried out in more than one way (and for reasons other than committing fraud), but the most common method is hacking into a POS system used to make card-based purchases. These breaches are called \"POS intrusions.\" In 2013, 75% of breaches in the travel/hospitality sector and 31% in the retail sector were POS intrusions aimed at stealing credit and debit card data. ", "POS intrusions and the ensuing card fraud are facilitated by what many consider to be the weak link in the U.S. card payment process: the continued use of magnetic stripe cards that carry unencrypted data. A hacker can gain access to a company's POS systems in a number of ways. Sometimes the hacker will use a \"brute force\" approach, systematically checking all possible keys or passwords until the correct one is found, or exploiting inadequately managed Internet connections to the POS system. Another common way is through the use of stolen third-party (vendor) credentials (sign-on information). For example, some POS system vendors do not change the default password to access the system. That password is often included in the system documentation, making it easy for anyone, especially a hacker, to find the information online.", "Once the hacker has gained access to the computer system used to manage the POS system, he or she installs malware that copies the unencrypted data on cards as they are swiped. The most common type of malware used in POS intrusions is called a \"RAM scraper,\" so named because it allows the hacker to \"scrape\" data out of the memory of the POS system.

Three of the five countries studied in the report experienced decreases in both the rates and total amounts of card fraud ( Figure 5 ), with some exceptions attributed to factors other than the security of the chip itself. For example, when the United Kingdom began issuing chip cards, the cards continued to carry a magnetic stripe, too.

The merchant, the cardholder, and the card issuer all must use the system for it to work. In 2013, only about 3% of U.S. merchants employed an authentication method based on 3-D Secure.", "The 3-D Secure protocol allows the card issuer to define what those credentials will be. For example, the cardholder might be required to enter a password. The password can be permanent or transaction specific. Transaction-specific passwords can be generated in a number of ways. Issuer-generated passwords can be sent via text message and email to the cardholder's registered mobile device and email account. This method can be used with both stripe and chip cards. With a chip card, the cardholder can generate a password by inserting the card into a cardholder-owned reader and entering the card's permanent PIN. The reader will then generate a one-time PIN for use with that specific transaction. In Europe, about 30 million people use chip cards and readers for Internet transactions. ", "Although 3-D Secure provides an extra layer of security for CNP transactions, it still has vulnerabilities. For example, in the past, hackers successfully used malware to direct cardholders signing up for 3-D Secure to a fake enrollment window, allowing theft of the card data.

For instance, when the United Kingdom transitioned to EMV cards, credit and debit cards were issued with both a chip and a magnetic stripe, which rendered them as easy to exploit and clone as stripe cards. The stolen data could then be used to manufacture counterfeit stripe cards for use in places such as the United States, where the transition had not yet begun. To mitigate the chance that this vulnerability will exist, cards issued in the U.K. now include a small \"flag\" on the magnetic stripe to indicate that the card has a chip on it.

EMV Adoption for Credit Cards in the United States: Past Controversies and Impediments", "paragraphs": ["The cost of the EMV transition, the slow pace of adoption, and other issues may have hampered both issuer and retailer efforts to meet the October 2015 deadline. ", "Disagreements over transaction verification methods for credit transactions, chip programming, and the fee structure for debit transactions all played roles in delaying EMV transition planning and adoption. Most issues have been resolved through industry negotiation or litigation. ", "There have been four impediments to EMV adoption in the United States: ", " High Cost of Implementation . Both card issuers and merchants in the United States have balked at transitioning to chip cards. They have already made significant financial investments in existing technology, and the transition will impose immediate, short-term costs on them. The cost of the transition to chip cards for financial institutions and businesses that use POS readers will be significant. Although opinions differ greatly as to the actual amount, most industry observers agree that it will cost between $6 billion and $8 billion. Of that amount, 75% is likely to be paid by merchants, making the transition three times as expensive for them as for the issuers. Costs for Card Issuers: Chip and Card Production . Some analysts have stated that manufacturing chip cards costs between $1.00 and $4.00 per card\u20142 to 16 times as much as traditional stripe cards, which cost about 25\u00a2 to 50\u00a2 each. Adding to that cost, personalizing the card with the holder's name and other details is about twice as expensive with chip cards as with stripe cards. While the issuing institution would pay initially for the chip and personalization of the card, those costs might be passed down to the consumer. Issuers will also face consideration of the one-time and ongoing costs associated with each type of implementation. Costs for Merchants: POS System Replacement . In addition to the costs to issuers of producing the cards, merchants have to purchase new POS equipment (i.e., chip readers) to process chip card transactions. In 2015, cost estimates ranged from about $100 to $600 each, depending on the number ordered and specific product features. Stripe readers cost approximately $50 to $100 when purchased individually, but less than $20 when purchased in bulk. Estimates prior to the transition were that only 25%-44% of retailers would meet the deadline, with the majority of those being the larger retailers. Minimal Implementation Prior to October 1, 2015 . There are about 1.1 billion credit and debit cards in use in the United States. At the time of the transition, estimates of the share of cards with EMV chips stood between 7% and 15%. Some believe that issuers would have had to replace, on average, about 2 million cards every day until the deadline to achieve 100% transition. Despite the slow start, some experts have predicted that by the beginning of 2016, 90%-95% of cards could be chip cards. About 33% of POS machines are now EMV compliant and that figure would have to increase significantly before the benefits of the chip cards can be realized. Transaction Verification: PIN versus Signature. Despite initial resistance from the retail community, which asserted that PIN verification would be far more likely to reduce fraud, card issuers largely decided to implement chip-and-signature. This could change, however. First, in a June 2015 speech, Federal Reserve System Governor Jerome H. Powell expressed his support for the use of PINs. Then, on November 17, 2015, nine state attorneys general asked leaders at companies including MasterCard, Visa, Discover Financial Services, Bank of America, Capital One, Citigroup, American Express, and JP Morgan Chase\u2014who have collectively begun the nationwide transition to a chip-and-signature card\u2014to move to full chip and PIN technology as soon as possible. This latest renewed interest could indicate a possible shift in the future. Dual Debit Applications . Visa and MasterCard use one proprietary debit processing application, and the major PIN debit networks use another. After lengthy negotiations, both sides finally agreed to cross-license their applications in July 2013, resolving most of the technical issues hampering transition planning. This issue is no longer a matter of contention. Debit Transaction Fees: Delay in Regulatory Certainty . In 2010, as part of a larger financial reform law, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) was charged with developing rules setting maximum transaction fees (\"interchange fees\") that merchants can be charged for debit card transactions. In addition, the law specified the framework the FRB was to use in developing those rules. The rules went into effect in October 2011, but the National Retail Federation, representing merchants, appealed the ruling, stating that it believed the fee ceiling had been set too high. ", "In July 2013, a judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (D.C.) rejected the FRB's regulations, stating that the agency had set the cap too high on debit-card transactions, and that it had disregarded congressional intent in its proceeding. However, in March 2014, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and upheld the FRB's rules. The merchants again appealed the decision, this time to the U.S. Supreme Court, filing for a writ of certiorari in August 2014. On January 20, 2015, the Court denied the merchants' petition, allowing the FRB's original rules to go into effect. ", "Because of the long-running court case and the other problems described, card issuers lost more than three years of planning time to meet the October 2015 deadline for debit cards (credit cards are unaffected by the fee structure under consideration by the Court). Some issuers were thought to be hesitant to replace their stripe-based debit cards until the issue was resolved. The delay has the potential to cause a lag between when chip-based credit cards are issued and chip-based debit cards are issued. Issuing debit and credit chip cards simultaneously was cited by the FRB as a key to maximizing the benefits of chip cards in reducing fraud:", "Based on the experiences of chip-and-PIN migrations in other countries, it is imperative that all card-based products should be migrated at, or near, the same time to have a positive impact on reducing face-to-face fraud within a country's borders. As witnessed in Canada, migrating credit before debit resulted in a significant increase in fraud perpetrated with debit cards, ultimately resulting in a minimal reduction of total card fraud. If the United States migrates to chip-and-PIN without market consensus, agreement, or in a timely and concerted effort; those issuers, networks, or merchants who are slow to migrate will see increased fraud levels and the impact on overall fraud levels could be minimal.", "Ultimately, it remains to be seen what impact the court case will have on debit card replacement."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
