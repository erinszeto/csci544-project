The Administration projected that defense spending would decline modestly,adjusted for inflation, in FY2002 and would then be essentially level, again adjustedfor inflation, through FY2005. Longer term White House projections, not shownhere, assume that national defense budget authority will remain flat, adjusted forinflation, through FY2009. Although this represents an end to the decline in defensespending that had been underway since the mid-1980s, many argue that the defensebudget should increase, at least at a modest pace, over the next few years in order tomaintain readiness and permit an increase in weapons modernization (see below fora further discussion). Indeed, Secretary Cohen and other senior officials have agreedthat weapons procurement budgets, in particular, should turn up substantially in thefuture. Long-term Administration defense plans, however, still assumed that budgetswould be flat for the foreseeable future.", "Compared to the previous year's Administration plan for FY2001: In February 1999, when it presented its FY2000 budget request toCongress, the Administration projected FY2001 funding of $300.5 billion for thenational defense budget function and of $286.4 billion for the Department ofDefense.

The funding increasesincluded $2.2 billion to cover increased costs of military contingency operations(mainly peacekeeping in Kosovo) and $1.4 billion to cover increased fuel costs.

As a result, adecision on the remaining 25,000 positions will be deferred pending the outcome ofthe next QDR, to be carried out in 2001. Secretary Cohen explained that ArmyGuard and Reserve forces have taken on much greater responsibility forpeacekeeping and other missions recently.", "Army \"transformation:\" The Army has undertaken a major effort to develop and field a more flexible and more easily deployed \"mediumweight\" force structure. This entails, (1) as an interim step, buying an existingmedium-weight armored vehicle to equip redesigned brigades; (2) acceleratingseveral other weapons programs, such as the Line-of-Sight Anti-Tank missile, theHigh Mobility Artillery Rocket System, the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, anda number of command, control, and communications programs; and (3) acceleratingdevelopment of the Future Combat Vehicle (FCV). It also entails reducing otherprograms to offset at least part of the increased costs. Major program reductions,which were a matter of congressional scrutiny, included slowing and redesigning theCrusader artillery program, and eliminating, among other things, the Grizzly engineervehicle and the Wolverine Heavy Assault Bridge. ", "Submarines and other ship-building programs: DOD also made some adjustments in Navy shipbuilding programs - though they were not asextensive as some Members of Congress had expected in the autumn of 1999. Following a Joint Chiefs of Staff review of attack submarine (SSN) force levels,DOD agreed to maintain 55 SSNs in the force, rather than shrink to 50, as had beenplanned. The new FY2001-2005 shipbuilding plan included a reserve of $1.1 billionfor either refueling overhauls of existing SSNs or to convert Trident missilesubmarines into attack submarines carrying large numbers of cruise missiles. Regarding surface combatant ships, the Navy extended development of the newDD-21 destroyer by one year, through FY2005, and it stretched out procurement ofremaining, current-generation, DDG-51 destroyers until then. In a program ofcontinuing interest to Congress, DOD requested no money for LHD amphibious shipprocurement, even though Congress provided partial funding of $356 million for oneship, the LHD-8, in the FY2000 budget.", "Aircraft programs: DOD made no major changes in fighter aircraft programs, but changes in cargo aircraft procurement were significant. DODrequested 12 C-17 aircraft, rather than 15, as had been planned. Officials expectedthat the decline in U.S. purchases could be made up by British procurement. DODalso requested funds for 4 C-130 aircraft in order, officials said, to avoid temporarilyshutting down the production line, which would cost an estimated $600 million torestart. Some have argued that this vindicates Congress's decision to add funds forC-130s in recent years.

As Congress directed in the FY2000 defense bills, DODincluded separate funding lines for the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense(THAAD) system and for the Navy Theater Wide (NTW) program - both are highaltitude, long-range TMD programs for defense against short- to intermediate-rangemissiles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The $60 Billion Procurement Target and the Defense \"Train Wreck\" Debate", "paragraphs": ["In presenting the FY2001 defense plan to Congress, Secretary Cohen and other senior officials emphasized one key aspect of the request - the request includes $60.3billion for weapons procurement. The $60 billion weapons budget is particularlyimportant because it has become a litmus test of support for a strong defense. In1995, the Joint Chiefs of Staff urged an increase in procurement funding - then atabout $45 billion - to $60 billion a year beginning in FY1998. This was, theyargued, the minimum level necessary over time to \"recapitalize\" an inventory ofweapons that would otherwise begin to age very rapidly. The Administrationoriginally committed to reach that level by FY2000, but fell short as money wasreallocated to maintain short-term readiness. Achieving the $60 billion target inFY2001, therefore, became a matter of some political significance.", "As it has turned out, the $60 billion procurement level is now seen by many defense proponents in Congress as wholly inadequate. In the congressional defensecommittees the issue has been how far short of necessary levels the budget remains,with answers ranging from $20 or $30 billion a year at the low end to $100 billionshort of what is needed at the high end. Early in the year, much of the discussion wasshaped by a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS),entitled Averting the Defense Train Wreck in the Next Millennium , (2) which calculatedthat procurement budgets would have to average $164 billion per year (in FY2000prices) over the next decade to replace the weapons in the current inventory withmore advanced versions as systems reach the ends of their planned service lives. ", "The CSIS study made a number of assumptions that have been questioned. Not all parts of the weapons stock will be replaced any time soon (strategic nuclearmissiles and bombers, for example, are not projected to be upgraded in theforeseeable future, and some will be retired if there is a START III agreement); Armytanks may be replaced some time after 2010, but possibly not with similar types ofweapons; costs of tactical aircraft and of Navy ships may be unlikely to grow as fastin the future as CSIS assumes, since the services will be required to reduce weaponsperformance if necessary to stay within budget constraints; modern precisionmunitions ought to be able to replace older ones on much less than a one-for-onebasis, and many of the newer munitions are much cheaper than older ones; and manyweapons may simply be kept in the inventory much longer than nominal service lifeestimates call for, perhaps with upgrades that are less costly than buying newsystems.", "Several less extreme estimates of required procurement levels, however, still show a shortfall of some magnitude. The Center for Strategic and BudgetaryAssessments calculated that the Administration's procurement program would costabout $80 billion a year (in FY1999 prices) by the later part of the decade. (3) TheCongressional Budget Office testified in 1999 that it would cost about $90 billion ayear (also in FY1999 prices) to sustain a \"steady state\" procurement rate - i.e., a rateat which enough major weapons would be bought every year to maintain roughly thecurrent number of weapons in the stock, on the assumption that parts of the force willbe allowed to grow older than has historically been the goal. (4) Most recently, CBOcompleted a broader study of what it called a \"steady state\" budget - i.e., the amountneeded over the long term to maintain a force of the current size and composition. (5) CBO estimates that a \"steady state\" budget over the next 15 years would have toaverage about $340 billion a year, in FY2000 prices, of which, as CBO calculated ayear earlier, about $90 billion a year would be for procurement. ", "For its part, the Defense Department has acknowledged that procurement budgets may have to grow further in the future, but senior civilian officials havedisputed the various projections by outside analysts. In congressional testimony inFebruary 2000, Secretary of Defense Cohen stipulated that procurement budgets willhave to grow substantially beyond $70 billion a year in the period after FY2008,when several planned weapons programs are scheduled to begin full scaleproduction. But in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee onSeptember 21, DOD Comptroller William Lynn insisted that the CBO overstatesrequirements because it assumes a one-for-one replacement of current generationweapons with like systems in the future, which is not likely given efforts to transformthe force. (6)", "A corollary issue concerns whether it will be possible to increase funding for weapons procurement over the next several years without a substantial increase inoverall defense spending. The Clinton Administration assumes that spending onoperation and maintenance (O&M) will level off over the next several years and thatsavings from improved efficiency will be allocated to weapons procurement. Historically, however, projected O&M savings have seldom materialized, and O&Mcosts have continued to grow from year to year. It remains possible that increasedprocurement spending could be financed by reducing the size of the force. For thepresent, however, each of the military services has complained that it is beingoverstretched by the demands of the post-Cold War international environment -debate has focused on whether and how much to increase selected elements of theforce, rather than on where to make cuts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Service \"Unfunded Priorities Lists\"", "paragraphs": ["For the past several years, the military services have submitted to the congressional defense committees lists of programs that would be candidates for anyadditional funds made available.

The original House-passed budget resolutionprovided $306.3 billion in budget authority for national defense, just $1 billion morethan the request. The Senate Budget Committee recommended a level of $305.8billion, $500 million above the request.

Theconference agreement also included a provision that establishes a point of order inthe Senate against measures that would exceed specified levels of funding for defenseand for non-defense discretionary spending - in effect reestablishing so-called\"fire-walls\" between defense and non-defense appropriations. In the end, thisprovision was, in effect, moot, because Congress later lifted caps on discretionaryspending to accommodate both defense and non-defense increases.", "Congressional Action: In the past two years, the appropriations committees used a number of devices to increase defense spending substantially while formallyadhering to caps on total discretionary spending. In final action on FY1999appropriations bills, for example, appropriators included in the FY1999Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, P.L. 105-277 , about $21 billion inemergency supplemental appropriations, of which $8.3 billion was for theDepartment of Defense. Last year, in action on FY2000 bills, appropriatorstook several steps to provide additional funds for defense and non-defenseprograms, including (1) providing $1.8 billion in funding for FY2000 pay raisesas emergency appropriations in an FY1999 supplemental appropriations bill; (2)moving the last pay day of the fiscal year for military personnel into FY2001;and (3) designating $7.2 billion in the FY2000 defense appropriations bill asemergency funding. ", "This year, appropriators have taken some similar steps. As noted above, the House added $4 billion in emergency defense funds to the FY2000supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 3908 , all of which wasmade available through FY2001 - in effect, an addition to the FY2001 defensebudget. The conference agreement on the supplemental (which is included in H.R. 4425 , the FY2001 military construction appropriations bill),includes $1.8 billion of that amount along with some additional funds - see Table A8 in the Appendix for a detailed account of all DOD funds in thesupplemental. The conference agreement on the supplemental also moves thepay date for military personnel back into FY2000, thus freeing up additionaloutlays within the FY2001 discretionary spending caps. Senator Grammobjected to this step and some other related provisions in the supplemental andinsisted that they be reversed. This held up final Senate action on the FY2001defense appropriations bill.", "The conference agreement on the FY2001 defense appropriations bill also includes additional measures to squeeze extra money into the budget withoutformally violating spending caps. In particular, the bill provides $1,779 millionin emergency FY2000 appropriations. Of this amount, $1.1 billion is for theOverseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund that provides money foroperations in Kosovo, Bosnia, Southwest Asia and elsewhere, and the remaining$679 million is mainly for programs that were in the House-passed version ofthe FY2000 supplemental but that were removed in conference. The bill alsoincludes a general provision that eliminates $1.1 billion in FY2001 funds for theOverseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. So, in effect, the bill providesFY2001 money for contingency operations as in the form of FY2000 emergencyappropriations. If the FY2000 emergency funding is not counted as part of theFY2001 appropriations bill, the conference agreement provides $3.3 billionmore for DOD than the Administration requested.

Then, if a decision wasmade to go ahead, the system could begin operation another three years later. As theplan evolved, the so-called \"Deployment Readiness Review\" (DRR) was scheduledfor June 2000, and the potential date for an initial deployment was pushed back tocalendar year 2005. This year's debate over national missile defense focused mainlyon whether the President should go ahead with the formal DRR as scheduled orwhether, in view of a series of test failures, the President should leave a decision tohis successor. After a test failure in January and some delays in other parts of theprogram, the DRR was pushed back to late in the summer. Another test failure onJuly 7 further intensified the debate. Finally, on September 1, 2000, PresidentClinton announced that he would leave a decision on the program to his successor. ", "Early in the year, much of the discussion in Congress was shaped by two official reports that raised serious questions about the pace of the NMD developmentprogram. The \"National Missile Defense Review,\" a panel study headed by formerAir Force Chief of Staff General Larry Welch, warned last November that the NMDprogram continues to be a high risk development effort and that additional delayscould further compress the decision-making schedule. The Welch panel did notrecommended deferring the DRR, however. The annual report of the Pentagon'sDirector of operational testing, released in February, was more critical, saying thatthe NMD program was being driven by an \"artificial decision point.\" More recently,a bitter debate arose about the adequacy of planned tests of the planned NMDsystem's ability to discriminate between warheads and decoys. MIT scientist TedPostol and others have argued that the test program has been deliberately \"dumbeddown\" to avoid challenging tests of discrimination.", "The international reaction to the U.S. NMD deployment plan was also a matter of debate. The Administration has pursued negotiations with Russia on changes inthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty that would be necessary to permit adeployment without abrogating the agreement. The new Russian leadership hascontinued to oppose deployment, however, and some congressional leaders havepromised to resist any measure that would extend the ABM Treaty. TheAdministration has also had a hard time persuading key allies of the wisdom of anNMD deployment.

A recent review by the Congressional Budget Office projects somewhat higher deployment costs than theAdministration has estimated. CBO estimates that the initial, limited system that theAdministration is planning would cost about $30 billion, in FY2000 prices, todeploy and operate through FY2015 - a comparable Administration cost estimate,according to CBO, is about $26 billion. CBO also estimates that the expanded\"Capability 2\" and \"Capability 3\" systems that the Administration is planning wouldincrease total costs to about $49 billion through FY2015, with an additional $10-11billion needed for a space-based infrared sensor system that has other uses as well - there is no comparable Administration projection.

The conference agreement on the appropriations bill provides $135 millionmore for risk reduction. The authorization conference agreement provides $129million for risk reduction.
