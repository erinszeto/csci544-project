For example, in 2009 the United States experienced a 2.8% decline in real gross domestic product (GDP). The European Union (EU) as a whole experienced a 4.4% decline, and nine of its then-27 member states experienced a decline in real GDP exceeding 6% (Estonia, Finland, Hungry, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovenia).

There was also general agreement that SMEs often had a difficult time accessing capital for a host of reasons (such as the business was relatively new or the owner did not have sufficient collateral). As a result, many European nations and financial institutions, including the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund, implemented programs and policies to assist SMEs. They each also crafted their own size standard definitions to determine which businesses would qualify for assistance reserved for SMEs.", "In March 1985, the EU's Council of Ministers indicated its support of policies designed to assist SMEs as a means to create jobs and promote economic growth.

On May 28, 1992, the commission proposed \"limiting the proliferation of definitions used\" by its member states to determine SME status. It recommended a single, EU-wide size standard based on four criteria: (1) number of persons employed, (2) turnover (revenue), (3) balance sheet-total and (4) independence (to ensure that the small business is not controlled by a large business or jointly controlled by several large businesses). The European Commission solicited input from its member states, interested organizations, and financial institutions as it determined the specific thresholds to be used for each of the criteria.

Paying specific attention to SMEs' financing needs , including encouraging member states to \"provide incentives for investing revenue in equity, keeping in mind that the needs of entrepreneurial growth companies and established mainstream European SMEs are different and particular attention should be paid to the problem of financing the first growth phase of firms.\" 3. Taking a broad-based approach to enhancing market access for SMEs, including measures to facilitate cross-border payments and a single set of rules regarding a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base to make it simpler for SMEs to expand their activities within the single market. 4. Helping SMEs to contribute to a resource-efficient economy , including developing incentives to encourage energy and resource audits and promoting low-carbon technologies and resource-efficient innovation. 5.

For example, COSME's Loan Guarantee Facility and Horizon 2020's InnovFin SME Guarantee programs, like the SBA's 7(a) and 504/CDC loan guaranty programs, provide loan guarantees to financial institutions to encourage lending to small businesses that otherwise would not have access to credit.

In contrast, the United States is a republic that is based on a federal system of government. This difference in governmental structure and organizational principles also helps to explain some of the differences between the United States' and the EU's approaches to small business policy. For example, given its supranational structure and deference to the independence of its sovereign member states, the European Commission's Small Business Act for Europe, unlike the United States' Small Business Act, is not legally binding on its member states. Instead, the European Commission must rely on its member states' goodwill in voluntarily adhering to the Small Business Act for Europe's 10 guiding principles.

To the extent an industry displays \"differing industry characteristics,\" a size standard higher, or in some cases lower, than an anchor size standard is supportable.", "Before a proposed change to the size standards can take effect, the SBA's Office of Size Standards undertakes an analysis of the change's likely impact on the affected industry, focusing on the industry's overall degree of competition and the competitiveness of the firms within the industry. The analysis includes an assessment of five industry factors: (1) average firm size, (2) degree of competition within the industry, (3) start-up costs and entry barriers, (4) distribution of firms by size, and (5) small business share in federal contracts. The SBA also considers several other secondary factors \"as they are relevant to the industries and the interests of small businesses, including technological change, competition among industries, industry growth trends, and impacts on SBA programs.\"", "The SBA currently uses employment size to determine eligibility for 508 of 1,045 industries (48.6%), including all 364 manufacturing industries, 25 of 29 mining industries, and all 71 wholesale trade industries. Most manufacturing industries have an upper limit of 500 employees (98 of 364 classifications, or 26.9%), 750 employees (92 of 364 classifications, or 25.3%), or 1,000 employees (90 of 364 classifications, or 24.7%). Some manufacturing industries have an upper limit of 1,250 employees (58 of 364 classifications, or 15.9%) or 1,500 employees (26 of 364 classifications, or 7.2%). All 25 of the mining industries that use employment to determine eligibility have an upper limit of 500 employees. All 71 of the wholesale trades industries have an upper limit of 100 employees.", "The SBA currently applies one of nine employee-based industry size standards when determining an industry's small business size threshold (no more than 100, 150, 200, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250, and 1,500 employees). ", "The SBA uses average annual receipts over the three most recently completed fiscal years to determine program eligibility for most other industries (531 of 1,045 industries, or 50.8%). The SBA also uses average asset size, as reported in the firm's four quarterly financial statements for the preceding year, to determine eligibility for five finance industries, and a combination of number of employees and barrel per day refining capacity for petroleum refineries. ", "The SBA currently has 16 receipt based industry size standards in effect, ranging from $0.75 million or less to $38.5 million or less. In some instances, there is considerable variation in the size standards used within each industrial sector. For example, the SBA uses 10 different size standards to determine eligibility for 69 industries in the retail trade sector. In general, ", "most administrative and support service industries have an upper limit of either $15.0 million or $20.5 million in average annual sales or receipts; most agricultural industries have an upper limit of $0.75 million in average annual sales or receipts; most construction of buildings and civil engineering construction industries have an upper limit of $36.5 million in average annual sales or receipts, and most construction specialty trade contractors have an upper limit of $15.0 million in average annual sales or receipts; most educational services industries have an upper limit of either $7.5 million or $11.0 million in average annual sales or receipts; most health care industries have an upper limit of either $7.5 million or $15.0 million in average annual sales or receipts; most social assistance industries have an upper limit of $11.0 million in average annual sales or receipts; many professional, scientific, and technical service industries have an upper limit of $15.0 million in average annual sales or receipts, but range from $7.5 million to $38.5 million; and most finance and insurance industries have an upper limit of $38.5 million in average annual sales or receipts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "European Commission's Size Standard", "paragraphs": ["When designing its size standard during the 1990s, the European Commission decided not to make distinctions, as the United States does, to account for differences in circumstances among particular industries. Although it recognized advantages to employing a sector-by-sector approach (e.g., taking into account variations across sectors), the European Commission decided to adopt a less complex and more readily understood size standard. As a 2012 European Commission report evaluating its size standard's methodology noted, \"the sectoral approach does add a certain amount of complexity to the calculation and revision of ceilings and means that it is not possible to cite a simple, straightforward criterion that apply across the board.\" ", "After deciding to take an across-the-board approach, the European Commission examined existing small business definitions of other countries and its member states. After receiving recommendations from its member states, the European Commission focused on four criteria: (1) number of persons employed, (2) turnover (annual revenue), (3) balance-sheet total, and (4) independence (to ensure that the small business is not controlled by a large business or jointly controlled by several large businesses).", "The European Commission stated in its communication announcing its SME size standards in 1996 that \"the criterion of number of persons employed is undoubtedly one of the most important and must be regarded as imperative but that introducing a financial criterion is a necessary complement in order to grasp the real importance and performance of an enterprise and its position compared to its competitors.\" It dismissed a threshold of 500 employees because, in its view, 500 employees \"is not truly selective, since it encompasses almost all enterprises (99.9% of the 14 million enterprises [at that time]) and almost three-quarters of the European economy in terms of employment and turnover.\" It also dismissed a threshold between 250 and 500 employees because, in its view, businesses of that size not only \"often have very strong market positions but they also possess very solid management structures in the fields of production, sales, marketing, research and personnel management, which clearly distinguish them from medium-sized enterprises with up to 250 employees.\" For these reasons, adopting a threshold of 250 employees was viewed as the most appropriate threshold, especially given that a threshold of 250 employees was already \"the most prevalent threshold among the definitions used\" by its member states at that time. ", "The threshold for turnover (revenue) for the last approved 12-month accounting period was initially set at \u20ac40 million because \"according to Eurostat figures, the turnover of an enterprise with 250 employees does not exceed \u20ac40 million (1994 figures).\" The threshold for balance-sheet total was initially set at \u20ac27 million because that amount reflected the average ratio at that time between turnover and balance sheet total for smaller enterprises. It was anticipated that the ceilings would be amended \"as the need arises\" and \"normally every four years from the adoption of this recommendation to take account of changing economic circumstances in the Community.\"", "Because the SBA's size standard for most manufacturing and mining businesses is 500 employees (or higher), it was initially thought by many observers that the SBA's size standards were \"more generous\" than the European Commission's size standard. However, while the SBA's employment ceilings for manufacturing and mining industries exceed Europe's 250 employee threshold, the SBA's employment ceilings for wholesale trade (100 employees or fewer) and average annual revenue ceilings for services, retail, construction, and agriculture industries are lower than in Europe. The aforementioned 2012 European Commission report on its size standards concluded that ", "clearly in opting for a single set of criteria for all sectors covered, the EU has in effect reduced the ceiling in manufacturing, but increased it in services. Given the relative weight of services in the modern European economy, it is not altogether clear, therefore, which definition is more \"generous\" at the international level. ", "Moreover, an economic analysis conducted on behalf of the European Commission found that the United States has \"an industrial structure where, taking employment as a reasonable proxy, a greater part of the overall economy takes place in larger enterprises than is the case in Europe.\" That analysis found that more than 40% of people in the United States work for firms with 300 or more employees, \"as compared with 33% for firms with more than 250 in the EU.\" The analysis concluded that because of this difference, \"the ceilings for defining small business are likely to be higher [in the United States], if the objective is to promote a similar degree of competitive pressure.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The Small Business Act for Europe was the product of the political and economic context in which it was created. For example, its emphasis on creating jobs and targeting SME assistance to industries deemed essential to Europe's competitive position in world commerce was largely a reaction to the growing realization that its economic future was no longer going to be primarily decided by how well its member states competed against one another, but by how well Europe as a whole competed against the rest of the world, particularly with the United States, Japan, and China. ", "In addition, its emphasis on assisting businesses engaged in research and innovation reflects the prevailing view in Europe that the nature of economic commerce is changing and that government has a role to play in helping European businesses adapt to an increasingly global and technological, knowledge-based economy. As the first sentence of the Small Business Act for Europe put it, \"Managing the transition towards a knowledge-based economy is the key challenge for the EU today.\"", "Given Europe's economic circumstances, and lacking the legal authority to impose small business policies on its member states, the European Commission examined the small business policies in other nations, especially in the United States and Japan, and crafted 10 guiding principles it considered to best fit Europe's needs in an increasingly interdependent and global economy\u2014emulating some policies (e.g., access to capital) and taking a different direction in others (e.g., size standards). Of course, given their differing political and economic circumstances, what works well for Europe may not work as well in the United States, and vice versa. Nevertheless, as the Europeans have demonstrated, examining what other developed countries are doing to assist smaller enterprises can be useful as each nation considers which policies may work best for them."], "subsections": []}]}}
