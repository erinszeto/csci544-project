{"id": "RL34162", "title": "Renewable Energy: Background and Issues for the 110th Congress", "released_date": "2008-12-10T00:00:00", "summary": ["Renewable energy can be used to produce liquid fuels and electricity. A variety of funding, tax incentives, and regulatory policies have been enacted to support renewables as a means for addressing concerns about energy security, air pollution, international competitiveness, and climate change. This report reviews the background for renewables and describes the current congressional debate.", "Budget and funding issues are key concerns. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 authorized several new renewable energy demonstration and deployment programs, but most of them have not been funded. Further, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) authorized several new renewable energy programs that have not yet received appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2008 (P.L. 110-161) increased Department of Energy (DOE) renewable energy funding by $31.4 million (7%). The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2009 (P.L. 110-329, H.R. 2638) continues DOE funding at the FY2008 level through March 6, 2009.", "Tax policies are also at issue. The interaction of the federal renewable energy electricity production tax credit (PTC) with state renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policies has forged a strong incentive for wind energy development. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343 [Division B], H.R. 1424) extends the PTC for wind farms for one year (three years for most other renewables) through the end of 2009, provides $800 million for a new category of clean renewable energy (tax credit) bonds, and extends for eight years the 30% level for the business solar tax credit and the 30% residential solar tax credit. Further, the law repeals nearly $17.7 billion in tax subsidies for oil and natural gas and reduces certain other financial incentives that will be used to offset the cost of the tax incentives for renewable energy ($9.1 billion) and energy efficiency ($3.6 billion).", "The ethanol fuel issue intensified for much of the 110th Congress. Corn ethanol production climbed rapidly, but appeared to be causing food price increases. Concerns about rising food prices and apparent limits to the long-term potential for corn ethanol have brought a focus on cellulosic ethanol. Cellulosic sources avoid many limits on corn and appear to have much lower net CO2 emissions, but they require an extensive and costly conversion process. P.L. 110-140 set a new renewable fuels standard (RFS), which starts at 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 and rises to 36 billion gallons in 2022. P.L. 110-343 (H.R. 1424) and the farm bill (P.L. 110-246, H.R. 6124) contain several tax incentives and other provisions for biofuels."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Renewable energy is derived from resources that are generally not depleted by human use, such as the sun, wind, and water movement. These primary sources of energy can be converted into heat, electricity, and mechanical energy in several ways. There are some mature technologies for conversion of renewable energy such as hydropower, biomass, and waste combustion. Other conversion technologies, such as wind turbines and photovoltaics, are already well developed, but they have not achieved the technological efficiency and market penetration that many expect they will ultimately reach. Although geothermal energy is produced from geological rather than solar sources, it is often included as a renewable energy resource (and is treated as such in this report). Commercial nuclear power is not generally considered to be a renewable energy resource.", "Despite fluctuating government policies since the 1970s, a combination of incentives and high energy prices has enabled wind energy to gain a toe-hold in electric power markets and allowed ethanol to secure a modest, but growing, presence in motor fuels markets. Congress is now debating whether to provide additional subsidies, incentives, and mandates to further expand renewable energy use. This report describes the background and primary policy issue areas affecting renewable energy, including budget and funding, tax incentives, electricity regulatory initiatives, renewable fuels, and climate change."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History and Background", "paragraphs": ["The energy crises of the 1970s spurred the federal government, and some state governments, to mount a variety of renewable energy policies. These policies included support for research and development (R&D), technology demonstration projects, and commercial deployment of equipment. For renewable energy, these policies included a focus on the production of both liquid fuels and electricity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fuels Production", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Tax Act of 1978 established a 4 cents per gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol blended into gasoline. This incentive expired, and was extended, several times during the 1980s and 1990s. In some cases, the incentive was modified at the same time that it was extended. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 extended the excise tax exemption and created a tax deduction for clean-fuel vehicles that included those using 85% ethanol (E85). It also established a requirement that federal, state, and other vehicle fleets include a growing percentage of alternative-fueled vehicles, including those using ethanol. In 2000, the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that the excise tax exemption and the alcohol fuel tax credits had been the most important incentives for renewable fuels. By the time that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) was enacted, a variety of tax, grant, loan, and regulatory provisions had been established for renewable fuels. This included some 17 programs spanning five agencies. At present, the major tax incentives are a 51 cents per gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol blends, a $1 dollar per gallon tax credit for agri-biodiesel (50 cents per gallon for recycled biodiesel), and the alternative motor vehicle tax credit. However, some believe that the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) set by EPACT Section 1501\u2014which requires that motor fuels contain increasing amounts of renewable fuel each year through 2012\u2014may now be the most important policy supporting renewable biofuels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electricity Production", "paragraphs": ["The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA, Section 210) created a policy framework that required electric utilities to purchase electricity produced from renewable energy sources. PURPA also empowered the states to set the price for such purchases. PURPA aimed to reduce oil use for power production, encourage the use of renewable energy for power production, and to structure a new dimension of competition to help keep electricity prices down. In the early 1980s, under the influence of PURPA regulation, a convergence of federal and state policies launched commercial deployment of wind and solar energy in California. In particular, the development of early wind farms was driven mainly by a combination of federal and state investment tax credits for wind energy.", "As the new wind industry developed, two emerging aspects stimulated further policy changes. First, some firms took advantage of the investment tax credits by capturing the tax benefits at the front end and leaving wind machines that operated poorly or not at all. Recognition of this problem eventually led to the creation of a production-oriented tax credit. Second, in order to obtain third party financing, wind farm developers needed to secure agreements for power purchases that fixed the price for a long-term (10 years or more) period. This led the California Public Utility Commission to promote the development of \"standard offer\" contracts. These contracts reduced investment risk, established stable revenue streams, and helped launch early wind farm developments.", "Oil and natural gas prices slumped during the mid-1980s, and declined more steeply in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, Congress let the residential solar investment tax credit expire in 1985. Funding for Department of Energy (DOE) renewable energy R&D programs also declined, reaching a low point in 1990.", "In late 1990 and early 1991, the Persian Gulf War re-ignited interest in renewable energy. Other nations, notably Japan and Germany, began to undertake more aggressive policies to subsidize renewables, especially wind and solar technologies. In the United States, Congress began to increase funding for the Department of Energy (DOE) renewable energy R&D program. In 1992, the United States became a signatory of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This action forged a new environmental motive for support of renewable energy. These national interests were reflected in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-486 ). For electricity, this law made permanent the 10% business investment tax credit for solar and geothermal equipment. It also created a new renewable energy electricity production tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (kwh) for wind farms and closed-loop (energy crop) biomass.", "Climate change concerns spurred other industrialized nations to strengthen renewable energy policies and programs. Through the 1990s, concern about global climate change became an increasingly important motive in the European Union (EU), Japan, and other countries for raising renewable energy production goals and providing incentives to support commercial deployment. The Kyoto Protocol set emission reduction targets for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other greenhouse gases (GHG). After signing the Protocol, these nations intensified their efforts for commercial deployment of renewable energy. In the United States, concern about climate change was largely offset by a concern about the potential effect of the Kyoto CO 2 emission reduction targets on economic growth and competitiveness. As a result of this economic concern, the United States has taken a more limited effort than many other industrialized nations to support renewable energy as a strategy for addressing climate change. The federal government has continued support for existing funding and subsidies. However, aside from the previously mentioned policies, it has not established major new policies and programs like the feed-in tariff in Germany or the European Union's target for producing 20% of its energy from renewables.", "State action on renewable energy has often supplanted federal action or created models for new federal policies. As one example, California has implemented very aggressive programs for renewable energy. In the mid-1990s, the advent of electric industry restructuring led California state policymakers to create a public goods charge on ratepayer electricity use. Part of the resulting revenue was used to fund renewable energy development and deployment programs. Also, California's electricity shortages in 2000 and 2001 prompted the state to expand its renewable energy programs. Motivated by concern over climate change, California has recently adopted more aggressive actions for renewables. This includes a $3 billion solar deployment initiative, and an increase of its renewable portfolio standard to 33% of total electricity production by 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Action in the 110th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Economic and environmental concerns\u2014namely energy security, international competitiveness, high energy prices, air pollution, and climate change\u2014are now driving policy proposals to support renewable energy R&D and market deployment.
