Nearly all of this debt is subject to the statutory limit.", "Treasury has yet to face a situation in which it was unable to pay its obligations as a result of reaching the debt limit. In the past, the debt limit has always been raised before the debt reached the limit. However, on several occasions Treasury took extraordinary actions to avoid reaching the limit which, as a result, affected the operations of certain programs. If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the issuance of obligations of the United States may not be made without exceeding the public debt limit, Treasury can make use of \"extraordinary measures.\" Some of these measures require the Treasury Secretary to authorize a debt issuance suspension period.", "Since 2011, the debt limit has been increased through provisions of four pieces of legislation. The debt limit was increased on August 2, 2011, as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25). The BCA also provided for two additional debt limit increases, which occurred in September 2011 and January 2012.

On February 15, 2014, the debt limit was suspended for a third time, through March 15, 2015, as part of the Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act (P.L. 113-83). Between the enactment of each of these legislative measures, Treasury used extraordinary measures to continue financing obligations.

The need to raise (or lower) the limit during a session of Congress is driven by previous decisions regarding revenues and spending stemming from legislation enacted earlier in the session or in prior years. Nevertheless, the consideration of debt limit legislation often is viewed as an opportunity to reexamine fiscal and budgetary policy.

Seasonal fluctuations could still require Treasury to sell debt even if the annual level of federal debt subject to limit does not increase (i.e., if the budget were balanced and trust funds were not in surplus). Even on a day-to-day basis, the level of federal debt can vary significantly. For example, Treasury issues large volumes of individual income tax refunds in February and March, because taxpayers expecting refunds tend to file early.

In other words, Treasury would have to make payments on obligations as they come due. ", "In contrast to this view, GAO wrote to then-Chairman Bob Packwood of the Senate Finance Committee in 1985 that it was aware of no requirement that Treasury must pay outstanding obligations in the order in which they are received. GAO concluded that \"Treasury is free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States.\" In any case, if Treasury were to prioritize, it is not clear what the priorities might be among the different types of spending. ", "While the positions of Treasury and GAO may appear at first glance to differ, closer analysis suggests that they merely offer two different interpretations of silence in statute with respect to a prioritization system for paying obligations. On one hand, GAO's 1985 opinion posits that silence in statute with regard to prioritization simply leaves the determination of payment prioritization to the discretion of the Treasury Department. Conversely, Treasury appears to assert that the lack of specific statutory direction operates as a legal barrier, effectively preventing it from establishing a prioritization system.", "Subsequently, Treasury noted in 2011 that an attempt to prioritize payments was \"unworkable\" because adopting a policy that would require certain types of payments taking precedence over other U.S. legal obligations would merely be \"a failure by the U.S. to stand behind its commitments.\" In an August 2012 letter, the Treasury Inspector General also addressed this topic by stating, \"Treasury officials determined that there is no fair or sensible way to pick and choose among the many bills that come due every day. Furthermore, because Congress has never provided guidance to the contrary, Treasury's systems are designed to make each payment in the order it comes due.\" At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee in October 2013, Treasury Secretary Lew stated the following:", "We write roughly 80 million checks a month. The systems are automated to pay because for 224 years, the policy of Congress and every president has been we pay our bills. You cannot go into those systems and easily make them pay some things and not other things. They weren't designed that way because it was never the policy of this government to be in the position that we would have to be in if we couldn't pay all our bills.", "Treasury offered additional information regarding its position on prioritization in May 2014 in response to questions posed by Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. At that time, Treasury Assistant Secretary Fitzpayne stated that if the debt limit was reached and not raised and sufficient cash was available, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would be technologically capable of continuing to make principal and interest payments on the debt. However, in this circumstance, Treasury would not be able to make payments on all other obligations. Assistant Secretary Fitzpayne warned that \"this approach would be entirely experimental and create unacceptable risk to both domestic and global financial markets.\"", "Another perspective on prioritization relates to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA), as amended. The term impoundment refers to actions by the President, OMB, an agency head, or any officer or employee to preclude obligation or expenditure of budget authority. One type of impoundment action, deferral , refers to a temporary withholding or delaying of the obligation or expenditure of budget authority provided for projects or activities, or any other type of executive action or inaction which effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure of budget authority. Through the establishment of several statutory processes and restrictions, the ICA generally prohibited the use of discretion to effect \"policy\" impoundments. A policy impoundment might be, for example, a decision not to spend funds appropriated by Congress because a given federal activity may not be favored by a sitting President or agency official. Funds may be deferred only for certain reasons specified in 2 U.S.C. 684(b) (e.g., contingencies). The relationship between prioritization associated with a debt limit impasse, on one hand, and the ICA, on the other, is that prioritization could be characterized as undertaking some spending but, due to lack of cash, deferring other spending.", "In the event of a debt limit impasse, however, if the prioritization appears to disfavor certain programs, issues similar to those that gave rise to the ICA might resurface. These issues could include the balance of power between Congress and the President over spending priorities and the potential for use of prioritization in ways that Congress might not intend. For example, if spending for a program that uses one-year funds were deferred until the end of a fiscal year, when the underlying budget authority expires, the deferral might constitute a functional equivalent of a rescission (cancellation of budget authority), akin to a line-item veto. It appears that OMB and the Department of Justice have grappled with some of these issues in the past without coming to firm resolution, as evidenced by a 1995 internal OMB memorandum that was publicly released with papers of former White House Associate Counsel and current Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Options for OMB: Could Apportionment Be Used?", "paragraphs": ["It also is possible that OMB may use statutory authority to apportion or reapportion budget authority (i.e., the authority to incur obligations) that Congress has granted in appropriations, contract, and borrowing authority to delay expenditures and effectively establish priorities for liquidating obligations. OMB is required by statute to \"apportion\" these funds (e.g., quarterly) to prevent agencies from spending at a rate that would exhaust their appropriations before the end of the fiscal year. If OMB were to use statutory apportionment authority to affect the rate of federal spending, its ability to do so would be constrained by the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended. As noted earlier, the Impoundment Control Act does not prohibit the President from withholding funds, but establishes procedures for the President to submit formal requests to Congress either to defer (i.e., delay) spending until later or to rescind (i.e., cancel) the budget authority that Congress previously had granted.

However, Treasury may not be able to liquidate all obligations that result in federal outlays due to a shortage of cash. In contrast to this, if Congress and the President do not enact interim or full-year appropriations for an agency, the agency does not have budget authority available for obligation.

GAO said the government had never defaulted on any of its securities, because cash has been available to pay interest and redeem them upon maturity or demand. Further, GAO said a default on the securities could have adverse effects on the economy, the public welfare, and the government's ability to market future securities.", "It is difficult to perceive all the adverse effects that a government default for even a short time would have on the economy and the public welfare. It is generally recognized that a default would preclude the government from honoring all of its obligations to pay for such things as employees' salaries and wages; social security benefits, civil service retirement, and other benefits from trust funds; contractual services and supplies, and maturing securities.... At a minimum, however, the government could be subject to additional claims for interest on unredeemed matured debt and to claims for damages resulting from failure to make payments. But even beyond that, the full faith and credit of the U.S. government would be threatened. Domestic money markets, in which government securities play a major role, could be affected substantially.", "If the debt limit were reached and interest payments on debt were paid, it is not clear what the repercussions would be on the financial markets or the economy. If Treasury had to rely on incoming cash to pay its obligations, a significant portion of government spending would go unpaid. Removing a portion of government spending from the economy would leave behind significant economic effects and would have an effect on gross domestic product (GDP) by definition, all other things being equal. Further, if the government fails to make timely payments to individuals, service providers, and other organizations, these persons and entities would also be affected. Even if the government continued paying interest, it is not clear whether creditors would retain or lose faith in the government's willingness to pay its obligations. If creditors lost this confidence, the federal government's interest costs would likely increase substantially and there would likely be broader disruptions to financial markets.", "On April 25, 2011, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee sent a letter to Secretary Geithner expressing its views on the impact on financial markets if the debt ceiling is not raised. The letter warned that any delay by Treasury in making an interest or principal payment could trigger \"another catastrophic financial crisis.\" Further, the committee described several potential consequences stemming from a Treasury default on its obligations including a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, an increase in federal and private borrowing costs, damage to the economic recovery, and broader disruptions to the financial system.

While not causing financial instability, what has been referred to as \"brinkmanship\" can lead to worse economic or financial outcomes than raising the debt limit well ahead of time. While the debt limit impasse has no direct effect on the economy because it does not interfere with government financing, it could still have had indirect effects on GDP and financial conditions if it altered the behavior of households and businesses. ", "The effects of \"brinkmanship\" can be answered by observing what happened to the economy and financial markets during the 2011 and 2013 debt limit impasse. Neither episode caused financial disruption or recession. In 2013, growth was strong in the fourth quarter when the impasse occurred, but declined in the following quarter. Nevertheless, both episodes had discernible effects. Economic growth in the third quarter of 2011 was noticeably slower (1.4%) than the preceding or following quarter, although it is difficult to isolate how much of that slowdown could be attributed to the debt limit impasse. The Treasury Department released a report detailing how the August 2011 debt limit impasse coincided with a marked decline in consumer confidence, small business optimism, and the S&P 500 stock index, and an increase in the equity market volatility index (\"VIX\"). In each case, these indicators did not return to their previous levels until several months after the debt limit was raised. The Treasury report does not attempt to isolate the effects of the debt limit impasse from other events that would also affect financial markets concurrently. Notably, the debt limit impasse also resulted in the first downgrade of federal debt by a major credit rating agency, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the debt from AAA on August 5, 2011. In its statement on the downgrade, S&P said that ", "More broadly, the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned ... ", "Thus, as their statement would suggest, another channel through which the debt limit might affect private spending is via heightened policy uncertainty. ", "By contrast, however, those same indicators showed a much smaller deterioration in October 2013. Consumer confidence also fell in October 2013, although this may have been partly caused by the concurrent government shutdown. It remained at higher levels than in August 2011 or during the financial crisis, however. The S&P 500 stock index fell by less than 3% during the shutdown, but had recovered its previous value by the time the government was reopened. This suggests that either investors felt more confident that the debt limit would ultimately be raised (perhaps because it had been raised in similar circumstances in 2011) or other factors, such as the downgrade, are responsible for the greater deterioration in credit markets in August 2011.", "The two financial instruments that experienced the most pronounced price movements in the 2011 and 2013 debt limit impasses were short-term Treasury securities and credit default swaps (CDS) on U.S. Treasuries. First, Treasury yields exhibited a highly unusual pattern. For example, from October 1 to October 16, 2013, yields on Treasury bills maturing in four weeks exceeded those maturing in three months. The consensus explanation for this phenomenon was fear that a failure to raise the debt limit in a timely fashion could cause short-term interruptions in repaying maturing debt, and the unusual pattern disappeared as soon as the debt limit was raised. (The rest of the yield curve has not exhibited any unusual movements recently.) Nevertheless, the yield on 4-week bills (0.32% on October 15) implied that this risk was still perceived to be relatively low. Since noticeably higher rates were not manifested throughout the rest of the Treasury yield curve, the broader economic consequences of this anomaly were likely limited. Their main effect was to directly raise the borrowing costs of the Treasury on securities sold during the period of elevated yields. In the 2011 debt limit impasse, GAO estimated that the debt limit impasse increased Treasury borrowing costs by $1.3 billion in 2011.", "Second, CDS prices for which Treasury securities are the reference entity rose significantly. Credit default swaps for which federal debt is the reference entity would trigger a payment from the seller of the CDS to the buyer if the security experiences a \"credit event\" related to timely and full payment. In 2011, CDS prices for five-year Treasury securities (i.e., the cost to insure against default) rose above 60 basis points, for example; this level was unusually high compared with historical standards, but lower than at the depth of the 2008 financial crisis. At its peak on October 10, 2013, CDS prices for five-year Treasury securities more than doubled compared to the previous month, rising to 40 basis points; this price was below the peak price in 2011.", "It is difficult to disentangle the effects of the debt limit impasse from the effects of the government shutdown, which happened simultaneously."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Considerations for the Current Debt Limit Debate", "paragraphs": ["There are various viewpoints about how to deal with debt limit issues.

He stated, \"Geithner is correct that the debt limit must increase. With monthly deficits running more than $100 billion, it's simply unthinkable that Congress could cut spending or increase revenue enough to avoid borrowing more.... Still, I am troubled by any suggestion that the United States might willingly default on its public debt. Doing so would have absolutely no upside.\"", "Questions have been raised regarding what constitutes a legal \"default\" by the government. Some proponents of a prioritization system suggest that the term \"default\" applies only if the government fails to pay interest on debt obligations held by third parties. Opponents of prioritization appear to argue that the term \"default\" applies not only to a failure to pay third-party debt holders, but also to the failure by the government to meet any obligation authorized by law, which would include a failure to fund an appropriated program, pay federal salaries or benefits, or pay an amount owed on a federal contract. No general statutory definition of the term \"default\" exists; however, Black's Law Dictionary 428 (7 th Ed. 1999) defines the term \"default\" as \"the failure to make a payment when due,\" which, if accepted as the governing definition, would not appear to distinguish between various types of government obligations.", "Aside from technical definitions, financial markets' perceptions of what constitutes a default, or a real threat of default, may be more relevant when assessing the potential impacts of not raising the debt limit. For example, if the federal government were to prioritize payments on debt obligations above other obligations, it is not clear whether financial markets would find this distinction to be significant when deciding whether and how to invest in federal government Treasury securities, since Treasury would be postponing payments on other legal obligations. Because perceptions such as these are difficult if not impossible to predict, it is not clear what the effects of prioritization would be, in the event of an impasse. In the event of reaching the debt limit and the enactment of prioritization legislation, certain payments would receive priority. However, issues also might arise related to how a President, OMB, or an agency prioritizes among any obligations and expenditures that are not explicitly subject to prioritization, by statute.

If the federal budget is in deficit, Treasury would have to raise the necessary cash to redeem trust fund securities by issuing debt to the public. This would not require an increase in the debt limit, as the decline in intragovernmental debt would be offset by an equal increase in debt held by the public. A decline in intragovernmental debt as a result of a redemption in trust fund securities could be financed by using surplus cash if the federal budget is in surplus at that time. In this situation, debt held by the public, debt held by government accounts, and total federal debt would decrease.

In a letter to Secretary Geithner, Senator Toomey said \"This legislation is designed to maintain orderly financial markets by reassuring investors in U.S. Treasury securities that their investments are perfectly safe even in the unlikely event that the debt limit is temporarily reached.\" Similarly, Senator David Vitter and Representative Dean Heller introduced legislation that would require priority be given to payment of all obligations on the debt held by the public and Social Security benefits in the event that the debt limit is reached ( S. 259 / H.R. 568 , 112 th Congress).

As noted earlier, Congress passed and the President signed the Budget Control Act, which addressed the debt limit and several aspects of fiscal policy.", "Social Security Trust Fund Cash and Investment Management\u00a0Practices ", "By law, the Social Security Trust Funds must be invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States (42 U.S.C. \u00a7401(d) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a71320b-15). The securities that Treasury issues to the Social Security Trust Funds count toward the federal debt limit. ", "Under normal procedures, Social Security revenues (Social Security payroll taxes and individual income taxes) are immediately credited to the Social Security Trust Funds in the form of short-term, non-marketable Treasury securities called certificates of indebtedness (CIs). Under the terms of this exchange, when Treasury credits payroll tax and other revenues to Social Security in the form of CIs, the revenues themselves become available in the General Fund for other government operations. ", "CIs generally mature on the following June 30. Each June 30, any surplus for the year is converted from short-term Treasury securities to long-term, non-marketable Treasury securities called \"special-issue obligations\" or \"specials.\" In addition, other special issues that have just matured and that are not needed to pay near-term benefits are reinvested in special-issue obligations. Interest income is credited to the trust funds semi-annually (on June 30 and December 31) in the form of additional special-issue obligations.", "Social Security benefits are paid by Treasury from the General Fund. When Treasury pays Social Security benefits, it redeems an equivalent amount of Treasury securities held by the trust funds in order to reimburse the General Fund.", "The Social Security program is projected to run a cash deficit through the 75-year forecast period. That is, Social Security's tax revenues are projected to be less than outlays for benefit payments and administration. In a year when Social Security runs a cash flow deficit, Treasury redeems some long-term government securities held by the trust funds. However, Social Security will still need to invest in non-marketable, short-term government securities to manage short-term cash flows during the periods between receiving revenues and paying benefits (42 U.S.C. \u00a7401(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7401(d), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a71320b-15). Investing the trust funds' revenues for even very short periods ensures that the trust funds maximize their interest earnings. Social Security will also need to invest in non-marketable, long-term government securities in June of each year, when short-term and certain long-term trust fund securities mature and amounts not needed to pay near-term benefits are rolled over into long-term government securities, and in June and December of each year, when semi-annual interest income is paid in the form of government securities.", "In 2011 and 2012, Social Security drew on general revenues as a result of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-312 , as amended by P.L. 112-78 and P.L. 112-96 ). P.L. 111-312 provided a temporary 2 percentage point reduction in the Social Security payroll tax for employees and the self-employed in 2011, resulting in a tax rate of 4.2% for employees and 10.4% for the self-employed. To protect the trust funds, P.L. 111-312 appropriated to the Social Security Trust Funds amounts equal to the reduction in payroll tax revenues. P.L. 111-312 specified that the appropriated amounts \"shall be transferred from the General Fund at such times and in such manner as to replicate to the extent possible the transfers which would have occurred to such Trust Fund had such amendments not been enacted.\" On December 23, 2011, Congress passed H.R. 3765 and President Obama signed the bill into law as P.L. 112-78 to extend the payroll tax reduction for workers and the general revenue transfers through February 2012. On February 17, 2012, the House and the Senate agreed to the conference report on H.R. 3630 , which further extended the payroll tax reduction for workers and the general revenue transfers through the end of calendar year 2012. H.R. 3630 was signed into law by President Obama on February 22, 2012 ( P.L. 112-96 ).", "Depending on the extent and duration of any future debt limit crisis, and also on Treasury prioritization decisions, Social Security Trust Fund investment management procedures and benefit payments potentially could be affected because of the requirement that Treasury obligations cannot be issued to the Social Security Trust Funds if doing so would exceed the debt limit. At the same time, as described above, P.L. 104-121 restricts the Treasury Secretary's ability to delay or otherwise underinvest incoming receipts to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. Delayed issuance of government obligations to the Trust Funds, or early redemption of some Trust Fund assets, could accelerate depletion of the Trust Funds and move up the expected insolvency date, absent congressional action to make the Trust Funds whole.", "Depending on the government's cash position in a given month, Treasury may need to issue new public debt to raise the cash needed to pay benefits. Treasury may be unable to issue new public debt, however, if doing so would exceed the debt limit. Social Security benefit payments may be delayed or jeopardized if Treasury does not have enough cash on hand to pay benefits."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
