Also as with H.R. 6432 , the bill would require the Secretary to seek public input before beginning negotiations with industry to reauthorize the program, hold periodic consultations with other stakeholder groups during such negotiations, and publish transcripts of all negotiation meetings between the FDA and the regulated industry, in addition to a requirement to seek public input at the conclusion of negotiations with industry. Finally, as with H.R. 6432 , the bill, as introduced, would not authorize FDA to use program fees for postmarket activities, and would not establish any new data reporting requirements for industry.", "Both H.R. 6432 and H.R. 6433 were marked up and passed by the full House Energy and Commerce Committee on July 16, 2008. The committee amended H.R. 6432 (ADUFA reauthorization) to make several technical and minor changes, and two substantive changes. First, animal drug sponsors would be required to provide annual reports to FDA regarding any of their animal drugs that contain an antimicrobial active ingredient. Such reports must include specified information about drug distribution, proposed usage, and other matters, and the Secretary would be required to publish such information in a manner that is consistent with national security and business confidentiality concerns. Second, the Secretary would be required to refuse admission to any imported animal drug that appears to be counterfeit, and to destroy any such items, under certain conditions. H.R. 6433 was amended to make several technical and minor changes, but no substantive changes.", "On July 30, 2008, the House passed an amended version of H.R. 6432 under suspension of the rules. The engrossed (House-passed) version of H.R. 6432 incorporated, as Title I, an amended version of the H.R. 6432 ADUFA reauthorization bill that was reported by the full Energy and Commerce Committee, and, as Title II, all provisions of H.R. 6433 (AGDUFA) as reported, without any substantive changes. The provisions in House-passed Title I of the bill had been amended to remove the earlier amendment made by the full committee regarding refusal of admission and destruction of animal drugs that appear to be counterfeit. The earlier amendment regarding reporting of information regarding animal antimicrobial drugs was retained. The House-passed bill also contained, as Title III, two technical corrections to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85 ) that do not apply to animal drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senate Action", "paragraphs": ["On August 1, 2008, the Senate took up the engrossed (House-passed) version of H.R. 6432 (including reauthorization of ADUFA, the user fee program for generic animal drugs, and the FDAAA technical corrections) and passed it by unanimous consent.

The industry's focus for ADUFA II was to continue the enhancement of FDA review capacity, including more support for increasingly complex reviews.

The proposal would authorize FDA to collect almost twice as much in animal drug user fees during the five-year ADUFA II program period (FY2009 through FY2013) as it could during ADUFA I (FY2004 through FY2008). Much of the growth in program costs that FDA cited is driven by factors outside of the agency's control, such as growth in the costs of employee salaries and benefits, and rents.", "Although a backlog of premarket foreign facility inspections was discussed at the March 2008 public meeting, the FDA proposal did not explicitly address the cost of these inspections. Given recent concerns about the safety of imported drugs and foods, FDA has been under pressure to expand its oversight of foreign facilities that manufacture products it regulates. FDA has not, however, signaled any particular safety concern about foreign plants that manufacture animal drugs, or any changes to the premarket inspections of these plants that are conducted for purpose of application review. At present, establishment fees may be assessed for these plants, when applicable, but the fees are not directly linked to inspection costs, and do not distinguish between domestic and foreign facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Animal Drug Safety and Postmarket Review", "paragraphs": ["The aim of drug user fees programs is to speed the evaluation of drugs for safety and effectiveness, without shortchanging the rigor of the evaluation or compromising the actual safety and effectiveness of approved drugs. Critics have charged that the user fee program for human drugs (PDUFA) places too much influence in the hands of industry, and speeds drugs to market with inadequate safety review. They note that the industry is actively involved in establishing performance benchmarks, for example. Also, some feel that consumer confidence in FDA's review process is important, and that a perception of conflicts in the user fee programs may undermine this confidence.", "It has been difficult to measure the effect of PDUFA, if any, on the safety of human drugs, and unequivocal evidence of such an effect is lacking. The law has, since its second reauthorization, allowed FDA to carry out certain postmarket safety activities with user fee funds. ADUFA I does not have a comparable authority. No postmarket activities are listed in the definition of activities for which fees may be used. For animal drugs, postmarket safety concerns arise on occasion, resulting in withdrawals or label warnings, but noteworthy recent examples preceded ADUFA. FDA's proposal for ADUFA II, as negotiated with industry, did not seek authority to use animal drug user fees for any postmarket activities. It is reported that during ADUFA reauthorization negotiations, FDA sought to have authority to spend user fees on some postmarket antimicrobial resistance activities (discussed further below), but drug companies objected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Antimicrobial Resistance", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about the effects of ADUFA on animal drug safety often play out in a different context than that for the safety of human drugs. Some critics of the law are concerned about the safety of drugs approved for animal agriculture with respect to public health and the environment, rather than safety for the treated animal. In particular, they are concerned about antimicrobials (e.g., antibiotics) used in food-producing animals, and the risk of transmitting antimicrobial resistant infections to people through food. In general, animal drug companies and livestock producers are concerned that overly stringent regulation of this class of animal drugs could compromise their availability and have harmful effects on animal health without an attendant public health benefit.", "FDA has asserted that there is a preponderance of evidence that the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals has adverse public health consequences, and that there is little evidence to the contrary. In 2003, FDA published guidance for industry, laying out the agency's information requirements and processes for evaluating animal antimicrobial drugs that may pose this risk. Review of this class of animal drugs may be more complex than is typical. FDA has not, however, published information about submissions, review times, outcomes, costs, or other metrics specific to this class.", "A coalition of consumer groups opposed reauthorization of ADUFA, but in the event of its reauthorization, called for it to authorize the use of ADUFA funds for the following postmarket activities related to antimicrobial resistance: safety reviews of currently approved antimicrobial drugs, the collection of veterinary drug use data to support antimicrobial risk assessments, and enhanced surveillance for antimicrobial resistance related to animal drug use.", "Appendix A. Summary of Provisions in ADUFA I", "Appendix B. The Animal Drug Approval Process", "Like human drugs, animal drugs must be shown to be safe and effective before they can be marketed. The FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation (ONADE), is responsible for the premarket review of new animal drugs, and it grants approvals when requirements have been met. (CVM also regulates veterinary devices but does not require their premarket approval. Veterinary biologics are regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. )", "Specific statutory requirements for the approval of \"new animal drugs\" are found in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), section 512 [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b]. Specific regulations are primarily at 21 C.F.R. 510, et seq. In each case, general provisions also apply, such as labeling requirements and enforcement provisions. According to CVM, virtually all animal drugs meet the FFDCA definition of \"new animal drug.\" The term does not, as it may sound, distinguish between pioneer (i.e., brand-name) and generic animal drugs. Several application names and acronyms used in the animal drug approval process derive from the term \"new animal drug.\" These names and acronyms are described in Table B -1 and discussed below. In this report, the terms \"animal drug\" and \"new animal drug\" are used interchangeably. Requirements for the approval of pioneer animal drugs begin at FFDCA section 512(b)(1), and those for the approval of generic animal drugs begin at FFDCA section 512(b)(2). The respective products are often referred to as \"(b)(1)\" or \"(b)(2)\" animal drugs.", "The animal drug approval process is generally similar to that for human drugs, devices, and many biologics. Animal drug sponsors conduct discovery research on drug candidates, including pilot studies of dose and potential toxicity. Sponsors seeking to develop a promising drug candidate (an Investigational New Animal Drug, or INAD) submit relevant information to CVM. Usually, the process begins with a sponsor's request for an exemption, pursuant to FFDCA section 512(j), to allow for the interstate shipment of the unapproved product in order that clinical trials of the drug's safety and effectiveness may be conducted. Sponsors wishing to begin the FDA approval process for an INAD submit a New Animal Drug Application (NADA) to CVM.", "CVM generally conducts phased review of animal drugs, encouraging sponsors to submit information about a product as it becomes available, rather than all at once, and to maintain ongoing consultations with CVM about technical and other requirements. Technical requirements include (1) the demonstration of safety in the target species, as well as in the environment and in humans (including those handling and administering the drug, and those consuming the products of food-producing animals, if applicable); (2) the demonstration of effectiveness in the target species; and (3) matters regarding manufacturing methods, controls, and product stability.", "When all required information is available, sponsors submit a final \"Administrative NADA,\" containing agency sign-off letters for all phases of review, a labeling proposal, and other information. An approved NADA means the product is safe and effective for its intended use, and that the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging of the drug are adequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity. As with approved human drugs, sponsors of approved NADAs are required to notify FDA regarding an approved drug's postmarket performance, including any adverse events.", "The animal drug approval process differs from the process for human products in two important ways. First, to support the requirement for demonstration of safety in humans, if an animal drug is intended for use in a food-producing animal, the sponsor must develop methods to test for drug residues in the human food product (e.g., meat, milk, eggs, honey). FDA determines whether the drug can be used safely in food-producing animals, with respect to public health. If approved, the drug's label must address a \"withdrawal time\" if necessary (i.e., a period of time that the drug must be withheld before an animal's products can be marketed for human consumption), allowing drug residues to fall below levels of concern.", "Second, although CVM requires clinical trials to demonstrate an animal drug's safety and effectiveness, these trials are, necessarily and as a matter of regulation, somewhat different from clinical trials required for the approval of human drugs. An approved animal drug may be labeled for use only in the species for which trials were conducted. However, veterinarians are permitted, under certain conditions, to use approved drugs for unapproved uses\u2014so-called \"extra-label\" uses\u2014such as use in species other than those on the label, or for indications other than those on the label. Also, clinical trials for animal drug approval need not be as extensive as trials for human drugs. Among other things, initial testing of the animal drug may begin in the target species, whereas candidate human drugs are studied to determine their safety in animals first, before human trials are begun.", "CVM also has authority to approve generic animal drugs. Sponsors seeking approval of a Generic Investigational New Animal Drug (JINAD) must submit an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (ANADA). The generic product and its uses must be the same as those of an approved animal drug, with certain exceptions, and it must be demonstrated that the generic product is bioequivalent to the approved product. Holders of approved or pending NADAs must submit certain patent information to CVM. CVM publishes patent information on approved NADAs, and requires ANADA applicants to certify that their product would not infringe upon a current patent, or that any such current patent is invalid. Sponsors seeking to market a generic version of an approved animal drug for a substantially different use than that currently approved (such as a label indication for a new species) often must conduct clinical trials, and typically need an investigational exemption pursuant to FFDCA section 512(j) in order to ship the drug interstate.", "Finally, CVM has authority for the conditional approval of drugs to treat minor animal species (e.g., fish) and uncommon diseases in major animal species. This allows sponsors to market a drug before collecting all necessary effectiveness data, but after proving that the drug is safe."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
