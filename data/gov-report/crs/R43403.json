", "In April 2011, President Obama directed DOD to identify $400 billion in \"additional savings\" in the defense budget, as part of a broader effort to achieve $4 trillion in deficit reduction over twelve years. The President stressed that the cuts should be strategically-driven, based on \"a fundamental review of America's missions, capabilities, and our role in a changing world.\" In May 2011, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stressed that the review would help \"ensure that future spending decisions are focused on priorities, strategy, and risks, and are not simply a math and accounting exercise\". In August 2011, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta confirmed that DOD was continuing to implement the President's April guidance by conducting a \"fundamental review\". It would address core strategic questions such as \"What are the essential missions our military must do to protect America and our way of life? What are the risks of the strategic choices we make? What are the financial costs?\" ", "In January 2012, DOD released the Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG), which was intended to provide the foundation for DOD's priorities, activities, and budget requests for the following ten years. The DSG took into account the need for cost savings, as directed by the President in April 2011. It also addressed the need to refine DOD's strategic focus in response to changes in the global security environment and the end of the decade of warfare that followed the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Broadly, the DSG called for:", "a shift in DOD's geographical priorities toward Asia and the Pacific region, while retaining emphasis on the Middle East; a shift in the balance of priority missions toward power projection and away from stabilization operations; a shift toward greater reliance on advanced capabilities including Special Operations Forces (SOF), new technologies such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and unmanned systems, and cyberspace capabilities; and corresponding changes in force structure. ", "But by the time it was issued, the DSG was already behind the fiscal curve. In 2011, Congress had enacted, and the President had signed into law, the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011, P.L. 112-25 , a dramatic effort to reduce the national deficit, which required overall reductions in defense spending for ten years and prescribed further mandatory annual cuts, through the mechanism of sequestration, should agreement not be reached regarding reducing the deficit. Most observers agree that the BCA was designed to force further tough decision-making in a more constrained fiscal climate, rather than to establish a sensible plan of action, per se . Yet early efforts to alleviate the pressure of fixed caps and sequestration restrictions, by striking some form of grand bargain, failed to yield results. While the DSG was crafted to facilitate achieving $487 billion in cost savings over ten years, it was not designed to account for the additional annual cuts that might be imposed through sequestration.", "In March 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel launched the Strategic Choices and Management Review (SCMR, commonly pronounced \"skimmer\"), an internal review process designed to explore the implications for DOD of continued budget reductions. The SCMR considered three fiscal scenarios: the President's FY2014 budget projection; the BCA's topline caps and restrictions; and an \"in-between\" scenario. The review examined three broad substantive areas\u2014management efficiencies and overhead reductions; compensation reforms; and changes to force structure and modernization plans. In briefing the major lessons from the SCMR, and in other contexts, DOD senior officials argued that the BCA topline caps and sequestration restrictions would \"break\" the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG). They also noted that even the most drastic options under consideration in the SCMR's three substantive categories would help DOD meet the BCA's annual topline caps only toward the end of the BCA's ten-year application. ", "In December 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act, P.L. 113-67 , amended the BCA to raise the topline budget caps for FY 2014 and FY 2015, offsetting the cost of that change by extending the application of the BCA for two additional years, FY 2022 and FY 2023. The new annual levels for FY 2014 and FY 2015, while above the original BCA caps, are below the President's original FY2014 request. The change offers DOD some stability and relief for the next two fiscal years\u2014together with the opportunity, or temptation, to delay some particularly tough decisions. It would also appear to address, in part, the view expressed by some DOD officials, that having greater flexibility to balance the required cost savings over ten years, instead of being required to absorb the reductions uniformly each year, would give DOD more options and allow it to make more strategically-informed decisions. But the change also preserves the uncertainty associated with the out years, which are currently still subject to the original BCA topline caps and restrictions. Not surprisingly, some DOD officials have wondered for which potential fiscal future it would be most prudent to plan; in practice, DOD has planned for several potential fiscal futures.

Moreover, some observers have suggested that BCA topline caps and sequestration restrictions should force an a priori reconsideration of the extent and nature of DOD's global presence. ", "In theory, from a strategist's perspective, a debate about presence should begin, not with an adjudication of the number of forward-stationed troops, but rather with a determination of the strategic rationale for presence\u2014that is, why should DOD engage around the world? Proponents generally propose some combination of these elements: providing closer proximity, and thus shorter timelines, to support possible future contingencies; helping guarantee access to and through other countries as needed; deterring potential aggressors and constructively shaping the choices of state and non-state actors; fostering the capabilities, capacity, and will of Allies and partners; and building relationships as means for exercising influence on the world stage. Defense strategy might balance the relative priority of these various desired effects in any number of ways.", "In turn, \"presence\" might plausibly be achieved by any of a number of different approaches: permanent versions of presence in which units are based overseas; continual versions of \"rotational presence\" in which units rotate in-and-out, back-to-back; limited versions of rotational presence in which units deploy periodically, or partially, or both; and virtual versions of presence ranging from the ability to collaborate remotely through, for example, simulations, to the ability to strike globally.

Where is it most important to maintain such presence? To what extent if any should various forms of presence be considered fungible with each other? What risks, if any, are associated with substituting less robust for more robust forms of presence and engagement? How valid is the familiar observation that \"virtual presence is actual absence\"? How unified and coherent is DOD thinking in distinguishing among the various possible forms of presence, their respective appropriateness for generating certain kinds of effects, and the risks associated with any substitutions?

In addition, partnership can be conducted bilaterally, which may have the value of simplicity; or under the rubric of formal alliances such as NATO, which may add the value of tested procedures, standing command and control mechanisms, and interoperable capabilities, as well as collective name recognition that may be helpful in shaping the choices of others.

Other proponents stressed fiscal imperatives, arguing that reductions in overall endstrength place a higher premium on cultivating the most capable U.S. forces. Skeptics have stressed, variously, the long lead times required to grow effective SOF; the stress on the SOF force that generating greater capacity might impose; and the array of critical, complementary roles, not least the command and control of complex operations and the provision of enablers, that conventional forces typically play in contingencies. The DSG largely left it to each service to determine the implications for conventional forces of greater reliance on SOF, and to craft an appropriate future SOF/conventional balance.
