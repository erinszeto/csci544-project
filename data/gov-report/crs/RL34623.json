As a result of various provisions in the act, the secondary mortgage market is likely to be broadly affected. For example, the Secretary of the Treasury is given (until December 31, 2009) the authority to lend or invest in the housing GSEs on whatever terms the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Starting in 2009, the maximum high cost conforming loan limit is increased to 150% of the conforming loan limit; this will be $625,500 in 2009. For the first time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can and have gone into conservatorship. The GSEs were placed under conservatorship on September 7, 2008, and Treasury used its new power to enter into a series of agreements to provide them with financial support.", "The act also modernizes many aspects of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). In high-cost areas, the maximum loan that the FHA can insure is identical to the maximum mortgage amount that the housing GSEs can purchase. The minimum downpayment on FHA-insured mortgages is increased from 3% to 3.5%, seller-assisted downpayment assistance is prohibited, and there is a moratorium until October 31, 2009, on the FHA's implementation of risk-based insurance premiums.", "HOPE for Homeowners authorizes the FHA to insure up to $300 billion in mortgages that refinance homeowners who are unable to pay their current high interest rate mortgages. As a condition of the borrower being eligible for the program, the current lender must agree to write-down the principal of the existing mortgage to achieve a 90% loan-to-value ratio.", "Other provisions lengthen from 90 days to 9 months the stay of foreclosure on service members' homes and provide additional support for disabled veterans with special needs. The act appropriates $4 billion for state and local governments to purchase and rehabilitate abandoned and foreclosed housing. This housing would be sold or rented to low- and moderate-income individuals and families.", "Tax provisions in the act include a refundable tax credit based on 10% of the price of a home purchased by a first time homebuyer. The maximum tax credit is $7,500 and the homebuyer pays back the credit over 15 years. This is roughly equivalent to a price reduction to one-third of the amount of the credit ($2,500). Homeowners who do not itemize on their tax returns can deduct state and local property taxes up to $500 ($1,000 on joint returns).", "This report will be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction1", "paragraphs": ["The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P.L. 110 - 289 , changes many laws that affect both the housing and mortgage markets.

The Treasury is authorized to lend or invest an unlimited amount of money in any of the regulated entities in the event of financial or mortgage market emergencies. Other provisions address mortgage licensing, revise Federal Housing Administration (FHA) operations, protect (for a limited time) service members against home foreclosures, promote redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes, and assist disabled veterans with special housing needs.

Collectively, these problems led many in Congress to conclude that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLBs need a stronger regulator. P.L. 110 - 289 creates the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to be the new regulator for the housing GSEs, replacing the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB). The task of setting mission goals is moved to FHFA from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).", "P.L. 110 - 289 gives FHFA broad authority to regulate the housing GSEs. FHFA is given the responsibility to review and to approve new types of mortgages. FHFA was granted the authority to take over and reorganize an insolvent Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and this authority was used on September 7 when the FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship. The FHFA has greater authority to set capital requirements for the housing GSEs. FHFA can now require the GSEs to dispose of assets and limit their portfolio sizes.", "FHFA also has broad regulatory powers over the FHLBs, and is required by law to recognize the differences between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the FHLBs. For example, both enterprises must continue to exist, whereas the 12 FHLBs can merge, and FHFA can require FHLBs to merge. FHFA has all the powers of the FHFB, which formerly regulated the FHLBs, including conservatorship and receivership.", "In the event of mortgage and financial market emergencies, P.L. 110 - 289 gives the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to lend or invest as much money as necessary to the regulated entities and to set the terms of the loan.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated the expected federal budgetary costs at $25 billion based on a less than 50% probability of Treasury having to use this authority before the authority expires at the end of December 2009. Since Treasury has invoked this authority, CBO estimate implies an expected cost of $50 billion or more.
