For the past several years, U.S. corn and soybean crops have experienced strong growth in both productivity and output, thus helping to build stockpiles at the end of the marketing year. This has been particularly true for soybeans, which have seen rapid growth in yield, acres planted, and stocks. This pattern reached a historic point in 2018 when, for the first time in history, U.S. soybean plantings (at 89.196 million acres) narrowly exceeded corn plantings (89.120 million acres). The record soybean plantings, coupled with the second-highest yields on record (51.6 bushels/acres), produced a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.5 billion bushels and record ending stocks (900 million bushels) in 2018. The record harvest and abundant supply, coupled with the sudden loss of China as the principal buyer of U.S. soybeans in 2018, have pressured soybean farm prices lower (-8%) to a projected $8.60/bushel for the 2018/2019 marketing year\u2014the lowest farm price since 2006 ( Figure 6 ).", "Like soybeans, USDA estimated the second-highest corn yields on record in 2018 at 176.4 bushels/acre (just behind the previous year's record yield of 176.6 bushels/acre). As a result, the United States produced the third-largest corn harvest on record at 14.4 billion bushels. Despite the near-record production, USDA predicts that record large domestic usage (including for livestock feed, ethanol production, other industrial processing, and seed) plus large exports will result in a small reduction in corn ending stocks, a decline in the ending stocks-to-use ratio to 14.0% (down from 14.5%) and a slightly higher season average farm price of $3.55/bushel.", "Both wheat and upland cotton farm prices are projected up slightly from 2017 despite relatively abundant stocks-to-use ratios, largely on the strength of international demand.", "The corn and soybean crops provide important inputs for the domestic livestock, poultry, and biofuels sectors.

During the recent five-year period from 2013/2014 to 2017/2018, the United States exported 49% of its soybean production and 15% of its corn crop. As a result, the export outlook for these two crops is critical to both farm sector profitability and regional economic activity across large swaths of the United States as well as in international markets. However, a tariff-related trade dispute between the United States and several major trading partners (in particular, China) has cast uncertainty over the corn and soybean markets. ", "The trade dispute has resulted in lower purchases of U.S. agricultural products by China in 2018, with continued diminished prospects for 2019. China was the top export market for U.S. agricultural products in 2017 with $25.9 billion in purchases. With the realization of diminished Chinese purchases, USDA has revised downward its expected export value to China for 2018 to $20.5 billion and for 2019 to $13.6 billion. Similarly, USDA has lowered its U.S. soybean export forecast from its initial estimate of 2.3 billion bushels in May 2018 to 1.875 billion bushels in its March 8, 2019, World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. The marketing year for corn and soybeans extends through August 2019. Thus, these forecasts depend on whether the trade dispute continues unabated or how the terms of any resolution (if one were to occur) would impact trade in the remaining months of the marketing year in 2019.", "The rapid expansion of U.S. soybean production has come largely at the expense of the wheat sector, which has been steadily losing acreage over the past several decades ( Figure 7 ). In 2017 U.S. wheat-planted acres were the lowest in over 100 years. Poor planting conditions in the fall of 2018 (for the 2019 winter wheat crop) across several states have resulted in the lowest estimated plantings outlook for winter wheat since 1909.

While this result varies widely across the United States, many small or marginally profitable hog and milk producers face continued financial difficulties.

Export data include processed and unprocessed agricultural products. This downturn masks larger country-level changes that have occurred as a result of ongoing trade disputes (as discussed below). In FY2019, U.S. agricultural imports are projected nearly unchanged at $127.0 billion, but the resultant agricultural trade surplus of $14.5 billion would be the lowest since 2007.", "A substantial portion of the surge in U.S. agricultural exports that occurred between 2010 and 2014 was due to higher-priced grain and feed shipments, including record oilseed exports to China and growing animal product exports to East Asia. As commodity prices have leveled off, so too have export values (see the commodity price indexes in Figure A-1 and Figure A-2 ). In FY2017, the top three markets for U.S. agricultural exports were China, Canada, and Mexico, in that order. Together, these three countries accounted for 46% of total U.S. agricultural exports during the five-year period FY2014-FY2018 ( Figure 23 ). However, in FY2019 the combined share of U.S. exports taken by China, Canada, and Mexico is projected down to 42% largely due to sharply lower exports to China. The ordering of the top three markets is reordered to Canada, Mexico, and China, as China is projected to barely stay ahead of the European Union and Japan as a destination for U.S. agricultural exports. From FY2014 through FY2017, China imported an average of $26.2 billion of U.S. agricultural products. However, USDA forecasts China's imports of U.S. agricultural products to decline to $20.5 billion in FY2018 and to $13.6 billion in FY2019 as a result of the U.S.-China trade dispute. The fourth- and fifth-largest U.S. export markets are the European Union and Japan, which have accounted for a combined 17% of U.S. agricultural exports during the FY2014-FY2018 period. This same share is projected to continue in FY2019 ( Figure 23 ). These two markets have shown relatively limited growth in recent years when compared with the rest of the world.", "The \"Rest of World\" (ROW) component of U.S. agricultural trade\u2014South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia\u2014has shown strong import growth in recent years. ROW is expected to account for 41% of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019. ROW import growth is being driven in part by both population and GDP growth but also from shifting trade patterns as some products previously targeting China have been diverted to new markets. Over the past four decades, U.S. agricultural exports have experienced fairly steady growth in shipments of high-value products\u2014including horticultural products, livestock, poultry, and dairy. High-valued exports are forecast at $94.3 billion for a 66.6% share of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 ( Figure 24 ). In contrast, bulk commodity shipments (primarily wheat, rice, feed grains, soybeans, cotton, and unmanufactured tobacco) are forecast at a 33.4% share of total U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019 at $47.2 billion.
