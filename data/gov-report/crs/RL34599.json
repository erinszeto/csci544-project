In the United States, Members organize into parties, but party cohesion in the legislature is not necessary to maintain control of the executive branch. Voters may individually choose to elect a Member of Congress from one party and a President from another.

It might also be unlikely that a committee would approve inquiries which questioned either the policy attitudes of the committee majority or of the department when the same party controlled Congress and the executive branch.", "Use of the majority and minority leaders to select questions would potentially have the advantage of focusing the question period on the policy differences between the political parties. Arguably, congressional leaders would be likely to choose questions of national political prominence which highlight policy differences between the competing parties. Under such a system, however, rank and file Members may find themselves left out of the question process. Thus, the use of chamber leaders as selectors of questions might not be desirable if legislators perceive question time as a means to allow wider participation in congressional oversight.", "Use of a random shuffle to choose among questions would potentially allow greater participation from rank and file or junior Members. On the other hand, a random shuffle might result in a greater number of questions that were not of general interest. As occasionally occurs in the British system, Members might use an oral question to seek a government answer in response to a particular constituent casework concern."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Would a Question Period be Bicameral?", "paragraphs": ["Previous proposals for question periods in Congress have not provided for joint House and Senate participation. The Mondale and Gejdenson proposals would have established question periods only in the Senate and House, respectively. The Kefauver proposals would have established separate question periods for Members of each chamber. Such separation arguably avoids procedural issues that might arise under a combined House and Senate question period, such as which chamber's rules would govern the question period and who would preside. Additionally, a well-attended joint question period might raise practical concerns about how the full membership of Congress would be accommodated in (presumably) the House in a manner that is both physically comfortable and conducive to parliamentary procedure.", "On the other hand, a question period involving the President, such as the one proposed by Senator McCain, might necessitate a bicameral arrangement. Given the schedule of the President and the logistical complexities of presidential travel, both the President and Members of Congress may prefer to conduct such a question period in a joint meeting or session. Such an arrangement would limit the number of appearances the President would need to make while also allowing for both House and Senate participation. Other contemporary joint sessions of Congress\u2014such as the annual joint session for the President's State of the Union address\u2014might serve as a logistical and procedural model for policy makers considering bicameral issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Rules Would Govern Floor Procedure?", "paragraphs": ["Parliamentary systems that employ a question period have complex rules regarding both the procedures and content of questions. For example, in the British system, the rules state that questions must be succinct, must either seek information or press for action, may not convey information or advance an argument, and must relate to a matter which is the responsibility of the Minister addressed. Similar rules are used to keep answers as short as possible.", "For any question period in Congress, rules would have to be drafted regulating general question time procedures\u2014such as the number and kind of supplementary questions which could be answered\u2014as well as specific aspects of floor procedure, such as the control of time. Legislators might consider adopting entirely new chamber rules to govern question time, or they might consider conducting question time under existing rules for floor debate. Modifying existing rules, however, might prove just as complicated, or even more complicated, as adopting entirely new rules.", "Issues of civility might also need to be addressed. Question Time in Britain and other parliamentary systems often includes sharp verbal confrontations and heated exchanges. A question period in Congress that followed the British norms would likely require at least a minimal relaxation of current congressional rules of decorum during debate. Otherwise, concern needs to be taken to require that written questions and oral supplementals are delivered in a manner consistent with chamber standards of decorum and civility.", "Question period proposals would also require a general examination of House or Senate rules of procedure to permit the accommodation of a question routine. Establishing a regular time for questions in the House, for example, would force a reexamination of the time spent on other House business. Should the length of daily House floor sessions be expanded to include 45 minutes to one hour of questions, or should other institutionalized presentations such as one-minute speeches or special order speeches be curtailed? Expanding session length would likely cause periods of substantial overwork toward the end of a session or Congress, while at other periods of relatively light floor schedules, the additional session time spent on questions may be relatively inconsequential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Would Referee?", "paragraphs": ["The enforcement of House or Senate rules might become more vital if a question period took on the partisan intensity shown in Britain and Canada. In those parliaments, the Speaker is a clearly recognized non-partisan\u2014removed effectively from electoral and legislative politics by precedents dating back (in the British Parliament) more than 200 years. The American Speaker is both a political leader and a presiding officer, and some observers have doubted whether intense political exchanges could be effectively managed by any Speaker having this dual role. The same complication arises for the Vice President in the Senate.", "Furthermore, in the British Parliament (and to a lesser degree in the Canadian Parliament), clear precedents have long been established regarding the content and form of appropriate questions, and the rulings of the Speaker are not challenged. In the U.S. Congress, rulings by the Speaker or Vice President about issues such as the proper form of questions may increase both partisan feeling and the number of appeals taken from the chair's rulings."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The question period is widely used in parliamentary systems as a means of informing MPs about the effects of government policies. Parliaments vary widely in the frequency with which question periods are held and in the number of questions submitted by Members. The data suggest that establishing a question period is no guarantee that it will develop into an effective information tool of the legislature.", "Although executive branch officials periodically appeared on the floor during the first Congresses, by the late 1790s the practice had largely ceased. Proposals for a question period for Congress have been offered with relative regularity beginning in the mid-19 th century. Initially, the proposals were endorsed by scholars who sought to increase executive branch influence in Congress at a time when the legislative branch was preeminent. In recent decades, the proposal has been offered as a means to assure greater executive branch accountability during periods of perceived executive dominance in the federal government.", "Whether the question period would be successful in a system of separated powers depends in large part on the attitude of its participants and on the format the question period ultimately assumes. The question period has the potential of involving more rank-and-file Members in the policy-making process, and improving the means of communication between executive departments and Congress. It also could harden relations between Congress and the executive, and might increase the level of partisan controversy in Congress.", "In crafting a question period proposal for use in Congress, attention would likely be given to balancing the interests of both parties and their leadership, the concerns of committees, the institutional interests of Congress, and the wishes of the general membership of the chambers."], "subsections": []}]}}
