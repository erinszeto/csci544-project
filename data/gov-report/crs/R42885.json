FSMA greatly expanded food safety oversight authority at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), but did not alter oversight authorities within other federal agencies responsible for food safety, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Given challenges facing FDA in implementing this law and also a continued prevalence of food safety incidents, Congress continues to actively address concerns of the U.S. food safety system.", "Numerous agencies share responsibility for regulating food safety; however, FSMA focused on FDA-regulated foods and amended FDA's existing structure and authorities, in particular the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301 et seq.). Among its many provisions, FSMA expanded FDA's authority to conduct a mandatory recall of contaminated food products, enhanced surveillance systems for foodborne illness outbreaks, established preventive controls at some food processing facilities and farms, enhanced FDA's traceability capacity within the nation's food distribution channels, increased the number of FDA inspections at domestic and foreign food facilities, and expanded FDA's authority and oversight of foreign companies that supply food imports to the United States. Since the law was signed in January 2011, FDA has been actively engaged in developing regulations to implement FSMA.", "Congress will likely continue to monitor FDA's implementation of the law and provide oversight over how some provisions are carried out and enforced, as well as FDA's coordination with other federal agencies, such as those in USDA and the Department of Homeland Security. Under FSMA, FDA is responsible for more than 50 regulations, guidelines, and studies; however, some FDA rules under FSMA have been substantially delayed, and it is uncertain whether full implementation of some provisions in the law will meet their expected deadlines. Regulations were to have been proposed or, in some cases, finalized within one to two years of enactment (roughly January 2012 and January 2013). Given delays in the rulemaking process, the Center for Food Safety filed suit in federal court against FDA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), citing the government's failure to implement several food safety regulations required by FSMA. By early 2014, FDA had proposed a majority of the regulations that constitute the food safety framework under FSMA, but there are continued delays in some rules, industry guidance, and reports as required under the law. FDA also re-proposed some aspects of four major proposed rules in September 2014. FDA has agreed to a new court-ordered schedule for issuing final FSMA regulations for many of the major rules between 2015 and 2016.", "Congress may also continue to consider changes to other food safety laws and policies that continue to be actively debated. Among these are food safety initiatives covering meat, poultry, and seafood products; legislation intended to curtail the non-medical use of antibiotics in animal feeds and to ban the use of certain plastic components commonly used in food containers; food labeling; stricter food safety enforcement mechanisms; and the use of plant and animal biotechnology. Several of these issues were actively debated leading up to the passage of FSMA. Several bills debated in previous Congresses were reintroduced in the 112th and 113th Congress. Some in Congress also might continue to advocate for additional policy reforms to existing FDA or USDA food safety laws to address other perceived concerns about the safety of the U.S. food supply.

However, critics view this system as lacking the organization, regulatory tools, and resources to adequately combat foodborne illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that each year about one in six Americans\u2014a total of 48 million people\u2014become sick from contaminated food. Of these, an estimated 128,000 cases require hospitalization and 3,000 cases result in death. ", "Estimates of the economic costs associated with foodborne illness vary. Researchers at FDA report that health costs associated with foodborne illness in the United States caused by known viruses, bacteria, parasites, allergens, and marine biotoxins, as well as unspecified agents total an estimated $36 billion annually. Researchers at USDA report individual cost estimates for 15 pathogens that account for most (95%) of the illnesses and deaths from foodborne illnesses in the United States for which a specific pathogen cause can be identified, which when combined total more than $15 billion annually. Most of these costs are attributable to estimated losses from five pathogens: nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica ($3.7 billion), Toxoplasma gondii ($3.3 billion), Listeria monocytogenes ($2.8 billion), Campylobacter spp. ($1.9 billion), and norovirus ($2.3 billion). The USDA estimates update previous studies that reported that foodborne illness from 14 pathogens caused an estimated $14.0 billion in cost of illness. Another study looking at the 31 pathogens for which CDC can identify a specific pathogen cause as well as unspecified agents estimates that together they cause a total economic burden of $77.7 billion from foodborne illness in the United States each year. Differences between the studies may be explained by the number of identified pathogens included; whether or not unidentified agents causing foodborne illness are included; and differences in analytical methods. ", "Major food safety-related incidents have heightened public and media scrutiny of the U.S. food safety system and magnified congressional interest in the issue. Since 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has placed food safety on its biennially published list of high-risk areas, among other areas needing the concerted attention of Congress and the Administration.", "Both the Obama and Bush Administrations addressed food safety concerns. In 2007, then President Bush released the Food Protection Plan of 2007 and Action Plan for Import Safety to address changes in food sources, production, and consumption. In 2009, President Obama established a Food Safety Working Group (FSWG) of Cabinet Secretaries and senior officials to provide advice on how to upgrade U.S. food safety laws, foster coordination throughout government, and ensure that food safety laws are effective and enforced. In 2010, as part of the FSWG's annual progress report, the Administration announced that it had taken steps to reduce the prevalence of certain food risks and implemented new food safety standards, among other actions. The HHS released a draft of its plans regarding specific food safety goals, setting percentage reduction goals for major food contaminants as well as targeted reductions in the number of cases each year by 2020.

Under FSMA, FDA is responsible for more than 50 regulations, guidelines, and studies; however, some major provisions under FSMA have been substantially delayed, and it is uncertain whether full implementation of some provisions in the law will meet their expected deadlines.

In general, foods often associated with foodborne illnesses include raw foods of animal origin\u2014meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood, and also unpasteurized (raw) milk\u2014that can cause infections if undercooked, or through cross-contamination. Other foods associated with foodborne illness include shellfish eaten raw and also fresh produce, including unpasteurized juices.", "Some foodborne outbreaks affect multiple states, depending on how widely the food associated with the outbreak is distributed. CDC reports that 103 multi-state foodborne outbreaks occurred during the five-year period from 2008 to 2012, an increase from previous years ( Figure 2 ), thus continuing to raise questions about the adequacy of the U.S. food system's safeguards for ensuring the safety of both domestically produced foods and imported foods.", "Examples of foodborne outbreaks involving FDA-regulated foods include multi-state outbreaks in 2012 of Salmonella infections, involving peanut butter and cantaloupe, and E. coli infections linked to raw clover sprouts; multi-state outbreaks in 2011 of listeriosis linked to cantaloupe; the 2010-2011 multi-state recall of Salmonella -contaminated sprouts; and a 2010 nationwide recall of more than 500 million eggs associated with increased cases of Salmonella infection, among other outbreaks.", "A multi-state outbreak of Salmonella infections that occurred in 2008-2009 was linked to an institutional brand of peanut butter and other peanut-based ingredients from a single company, resulting in a series of expanded recalls in 2009 involving thousands of peanut-containing products from more than 200 food companies. Other widespread illness outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of bagged fresh spinach grown in California contaminated with E. coli and to Mexican produce contaminated with Salmonella . There also have been large recalls of FSIS-regulated meat and poultry products due to findings of E. coli , Listeria , and other problems.", "CDC regularly tracks national foodborne outbreak data from local and state public health departments and makes these data publically available online.

GAO has identified 15 federal agencies collectively administering at least 30 laws related to food safety. State and local food safety authorities collaborate with federal agencies for inspection and other food safety functions, and they regulate retail food establishments. This organizational complexity, coupled with trends in U.S. food markets\u2014for example, increasing imports as a share of U.S. food consumption and increasing consumption of fresh, often unprocessed, foods\u2014pose ongoing challenges to ensuring food safety.", "Although numerous federal agencies have some responsibility, primary responsibility for food safety rests with the FDA and the USDA. FDA at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for ensuring that all domestic and imported food products\u2014except for most meats and poultry\u2014are safe, nutritious, wholesome, and accurately labeled. FDA also has oversight of all seafood, fish, and shellfish products. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulates most meat and poultry and some egg and fish products. The division of food safety responsibility between FDA and USDA is rooted in the early history of U.S. food regulation. For more background information, see CRS Report RS22600, The Federal Food Safety System: A Primer .", "In addition, the majority of both total federal funding and total staffing is with FSIS and FDA. FSIS's FY2015 budget is about $1.0 billion in appropriated funds plus another roughly $160 million in industry-paid user fees annually. In recent years, the balance of funding for food safety activities between FDA and USDA has started to shift. Congressional appropriations for FDA have increased, more than doubling from $435.5 million in FY2005 to $903.4 million in FY2015, with another roughly $17 million authorized user fees. Thus, FSIS receives a larger share of the two agencies' combined food safety budget, although FSIS is responsible for between 10% and 20% of the U.S. food supply, while FDA is responsible for the remainder. Staffing levels also vary among the two agencies: FSIS staff number around 9,400 full-time equivalents (FTEs), while FDA staff working on food-related activities number about 3,800 FTEs (FY2014 estimates)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (P.L. 111-353)", "paragraphs": ["FSMA focused on FDA-regulated foods and amended FDA's existing structure and authorities, in particular the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7301 et seq .).

FSMA does not directly address meat and poultry products under the jurisdiction of USDA.", "FDA has identified five key elements of FSMA: ", "Preventive C ontrols \u2014FSMA provides FDA with a legislative mandate to require comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply. As examples, the act requires mandatory preventive controls for food facilities and mandatory produce safety standards, and also gives FDA the authority to prevent intentional contamination. Inspection and Compliance \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the ability to conduct oversight and ensure compliance with new requirements and respond when problems emerge. Examples include establishing a mandated inspection frequency (based on risk); giving FDA access to industry records and food safety plans; and requiring certain testing be conducted by accredited labs. Response \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the ability to respond to problems when they emerge. Examples include giving FDA mandatory recall authority for all food products; expanding FDA's authority to administratively detain products that are in violation of the law; giving FDA the authority to suspend a facility's registration, effectively prohibiting the company from selling any products within the United States; establishing pilot projects so FDA can enhance its product tracing capabilities; and requiring additional recordkeeping by facilities that \"manufacture, process, pack or hold\" foods designated as \"high-risk.\" Imported Food Safety \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the ability to help ensure that food imports meet U.S. food safety standards. Examples include requiring importers to verify that their foreign suppliers have adequate preventive controls; establishing a third-party verification system; requiring certification by a credible third party for high-risk foods as a condition for entry into the United States; establishing a voluntary qualified importer program for expedited review and entry from participating importers; and giving FDA the right to refuse entry into the United States of food from a foreign facility if FDA is denied access to the facility or the country where the facility is located. Enhanced Partnerships \u2014FSMA provides FDA with the authority to improve training of state, local, territorial, and tribal food safety officials. Examples include requiring FDA to develop and implement strategies to enhance the food safety capacities of state and local agencies through multi-year grants, as well as strategies to enhance the capacities of foreign governments and their industries; and giving FDA the authority to rely on inspections of other federal, state, and local agencies in meeting its increased inspection mandate for domestic facilities. ", "FSMA authorized additional appropriations and staff for FDA's future food safety activities. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the newly enacted law could increase net federal spending subject to appropriations by $1.4 billion over a five-year period (FY2011-FY2015). FSMA also authorized an increase in FDA staff, reaching 5,000 in FY2014.", "For more detailed information, see CRS Report R40443, The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (P.L. 111-353) ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Issues for the 114th Congress", "paragraphs": ["The 114 th Congress will likely continue to provide oversight and scrutiny of food safety changes enacted under FSMA as they are developed, proposed, and implemented.

Among these are food safety initiatives covering meat, poultry, and seafood products; legislation intended to curtail the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in animal feeds and to ban the use of certain plastic components commonly used in food containers; issues regarding food labeling; and the use of plant and animal biotechnology, as well as other issues. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FSMA Oversight and Implementation", "paragraphs": ["FSMA is the largest expansion of FDA's food safety authorities since the 1930s, and includes provisions requiring the agency to establish and enforce new preventive controls and food safety plans at some food processing facilities and farms, among numerous other oversight capabilities of both domestic and foreign food and feed companies. ", "Along with general oversight of FSMA's key provisions, many in Congress have actively followed FDA's implementation of certain other aspects of the law. For example, FSMA's risk-based approach requires FDA to identify \"high-risk\" facilities and designate high-risk foods as part of the law's directive for targeting food safety inspection resources (FSMA, \u00a7201 and \u00a7204). How FDA identifies and designates high-risk facilities and foods, and how the agency ultimately implements these provisions, could have other far-reaching implications for some food growers and producers. In addition, FSMA excluded certain businesses from regulation as a way to mitigate the economic effects on small, organic, direct-to-market, and sustainable farming operations. These provisions will exempt from federal regulation some small-sized farms and food processors that sell directly to consumers (FSMA, \u00a7103 and \u00a7105). These exemptions require additional rulemaking by FDA to determine what constitutes a \"small\" and \"very small\" business under the new law. Some public health groups may remain vigilant of how these exemptions are implemented, particularly for growers and processors of certain perceived \"high-risk\" foods (to be determined by the HHS Secretary), although these operations would be subject to oversight by state and local authorities and their exemption can be withdrawn by the FDA in the event of a foodborne illness. Some agribusiness groups also remain opposed to these exemptions because of broader industry concerns about the need to preserve consumer confidence in the safety of all marketed produce; another industry concern is whether small foreign producers might also be exempt, if small U.S. producers are exempt (given prevailing U.S. equivalency standards).", "Under FSMA, FDA is responsible for more than 50 regulations, guidelines, and studies. However, FDA action on some major FSMA provisions\u2014including rules specifying the requirements and conditions for establishing preventive controls in food facilities, food safety standards for produce growers, and requirements for food importers, among other provisions\u2014have yet to be finalized, and most rules have been delayed well beyond the implementation dates specified in the law. Regulations were to have been proposed or, in some cases, finalized within one to two years of enactment (roughly January 2012 and January 2013); other rules were to have been submitted within 18 months of enactment (mid-2012). (FSMA was signed into law on January 4, 2011.)", "Several factors appear to have contributed to the delay in implementing FSMA. Substantial delays in publication of several FSMA proposed rules were reportedly due to rules being held up, often for months, by the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) review process. Delays in the rulemaking process also resulted from FDA granting a number of extensions in the public comment and response period for many of the major FSMA proposed rules. These extensions were requested by a wide range of stakeholders, given the complexity of the regulations as well as FDA's delayed release of other related FSMA rules that some groups argued needed to be considered together as a full regulatory package. Implementation of some provisions has also required coordination with other federal agencies, including Department of Homeland Security, USDA, and EPA. Further implementation delays have resulted from FDA's decision to re-propose some key provisions of four major FSMA regulations, which many Members of Congress and some key industry stakeholders have broadly supported. Finally, resources and the availability of discretionary appropriations might also have affected FDA's rollout and implementation of FSMA. ", "Given delays in the rulemaking process, the Center for Food Safety filed suit in federal court against FDA and OMB, citing the government's failure to implement several food safety regulations required by FSMA. FDA filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against the agency, which was denied by the court in April 2013. FDA also filed a motion to reconsider, asking the court to extend the implementation timeline for two FSMA-required rules, which was also denied. Under a February 2014 agreement between FDA and the Center for Food Safety, the agency must issue the regulations under a court-order schedule, as follows: ", "preventative controls for both human food and animal food (FSMA \u00a7103(a) and (c)): August 30, 2015; imported food and foreign suppliers, including the Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSMA \u00a7301(a)) and Accreditation of Third Party Auditors (FSMA \u00a7307): October 31, 2015; produce safety (FSMA \u00a7105(a)): October 31, 2015; sanitary transportation practices for food and feed (FSMA \u00a7111): March 31, 2016; intentional adulteration of food (FSMA \u00a7106(b)): May 31, 2016.", "This schedule further pushes back the implementation dates for final FSMA regulations beyond the dates originally mandated by Congress in the enacted law ( P.L. 111-353 ). Reportedly, an FDA official indicated in September 2014 that full implementation of FSMA would likely take another 10 years, the amount of time needed to \"reasonably expect all the rules to be working.\"", "To date, FDA has not yet issued final rules and guidance for many of the regulations required under certain key sections of FSMA.

Such constraints have raised questions for Congress about how to fully fund and implement policies that will protect public health and ensure the safety of domestic and imported foods. Among the many provisions of FSMA is the expansion of FDA's authority to increase inspection of domestic and foreign food facilities, to increase surveillance of foodborne illness and outbreak response, to conduct mandatory recall of contaminated foods, and to enforce new requirements at food facilities and produce operations. FSMA states a \"goal of not fewer than ... 5,000 staff members in fiscal year 2014\" (FSMA, \u00a7401), an increase from estimated FDA field staff of about 3,400 FTEs (full-time equivalents) in 2011. CBO estimated that implementing the law could increase net federal spending subject to appropriation by about $1.4 billion over a five-year period (FY2011-FY2015); collections from possible revenue and direct spending increases from new criminal penalties would be \"insignificant, yielding a negligible net impact in each year.\" Given the current budgetary climate, funding to undertake many federal activities in FSMA is uncertain. Although the law authorized appropriations when it enacted FSMA, it did not provide the actual funding needed for FDA to perform these activities. These funding decisions are guided by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, which annually fund FDA's activities in the Agriculture appropriations bill. FDA officials have indicated funding remains a concern, and ongoing efforts to implement FSMA will likely need to rely on state regulators to help enforce some of the major rules under the law.", "In recent years, the Administration's budget requests have projected the need for additional funds for FDA, anticipating a total need of about $1.1 billion, consisting of approximately $0.9 billion in appropriations for FDA's food program and another more than $0.2 billion in requested new user fees for the year. Appropriated funding for FDA's food program in the FY2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-235 ) totaled $903.4 million, along with another $17 million in FSMA-mandated user fees. Congressional appropriators have not approved the Administration's request to implement additional new user fees to fund FDA's food program, including a proposed new food establishment registration and inspection fee. Other proposed or expected fees in addition to appropriated funds in the Administration's budget request include food import, international courier, and food contact notification fees. FDA justified its requested increase based on the need to implement the various elements of FSMA. ", "The Administration's proposed establishment fee is opposed by most food industry groups; other groups are also concerned that the Administration's proposal relies too heavily on fees. Some public health groups, however, note the potential for raising additional resources to fund food safety efforts through user fee programs. The need for new user fees to provide additional resources to support FDA's food safety mission has been raised by the Obama Administration in consecutive statements of administration policy (SAPs) regarding annual appropriations. Although Congress has added to FDA's budget for its Foods Program in the past few years, agency officials claim it will need an additional $400 million to $450 million more per year above its FY2012 base to fully implement FSMA. The discrepancy between the Administration's request and the current congressional appropriations proposals has raised questions about how FDA will be able to implement food safety reforms authorized under FSMA, and also questions about how FDA and USDA will be able to invest in preventive efforts intended to address existing and emerging food safety threats. ", "Other budgetary concerns regarding FSMA implementation continue to be regularly noted by congressional appropriators, along with recommendations for FDA.

Most other types of food producers\u2014such as meat, poultry, and dairy farms; fisheries; and producers of raw, bulk grains\u2014would not be subject to FSMA's farm-level requirements.", "In January 2013, FDA proposed its produce rule. Under FDA's proposed rule, covered activities include the \"growing, harvesting, packing, or holding\" of produce, where produce refers to \"any fruit or vegetable (including specific mixes or categories of fruits and vegetables) grown for human consumption, and would include mushrooms, sprouts (irrespective of seed source), peanuts, tree nuts and herbs.\" Not covered by the proposed rule are foods that are rarely consumed raw, foods that go to commercial processing, and foods produced for personal consumption, as well as certain foods identified as low risk. Produce that undergoes certain commercial processing, such as bagged salads and leafy greens, would be covered by FDA's concurrently proposed rule on preventive controls for human foods covering food facilities.", "FDA's proposal covers microbial contamination of produce only and does not cover chemical, physical, or radiological contamination of produce. It proposes certain procedures, processes, and practices that FDA believes will minimize the risk of \"serious adverse health consequences or death\" and prevent the introduction of known or \"reasonably foreseeable hazards\" into produce. The rule addresses five identified routes of potential contamination: (1) agricultural water used for produce production; (2) biological soil amendments of animal origin, such as composted manure; (3) health and hygienic practices for farm personnel, including hand washing and maintaining adequate personal cleanliness; (4) domesticated and wild animal intrusions, which may introduce pathogens to produce production systems via animal feces; and (5) equipment and tools, buildings, and sanitation practices used for produce operations on farms. The rule proposes certain requirements for growing sprouts, including treating seed before sprouting and testing spent sprout irrigation water for pathogens, and monitoring the growing environment for Listeria. The proposal would require training for farm personnel who handle covered produce or food-contact surfaces and would require certain records to document that standards are being met.", "FDA estimates that the proposed rule would cover an estimated 40,496 domestic farms and also 14,927 foreign farms. FDA estimates that the costs of the proposed rule could total about $460 million annually for domestic farms and about $170 million annually for foreign farms covered by the rule. The estimated cost of the proposed produce rule is less than FDA's estimate of $1.04 billion in annual benefits under the rule. ", "The proposed rule provided flexibility in various ways. As specified in FSMA, it exempts an estimated 75,716 domestic farms from the proposed requirements, with the exception of certain labeling requirements (estimated to cost $3.82 million annually). In addition, FDA would exempt another 34,433 farms with average annual sales of $25,000 or less. The proposal's requirements would be implemented on a staggered compliance timetable, depending on farm size, giving more time to smaller farms. Under some circumstances, the proposal would allow for the establishment and use of an alternative approach to the requirements established in proposal, as well as allow for a state or foreign country to request a variance from one or more requirements.", "Since the produce rule was proposed, FDA has extended the public comment period numerous times. FDA has also conducted outreach and public meetings and released web videos and written materials. In March 2013, FDA corrected technical errors to the proposed rule.

", "Although the vast majority of food fraud incidents do not pose a public health risk, a few fraud cases have resulted in actual or potential public health risks. Perhaps the most widely cited, high-profile cases have involved the addition of melamine to high-protein feed and milk-based products to artificially inflate protein values in products that may have been diluted. For example, in 2007, evidence emerged that adulterated pet food ingredients from China had caused the deaths of a large number of dogs and cats in the United States. This was followed by reports that melamine-contaminated baby formula had sickened an estimated 300,000 Chinese children, killing a reported 6 infants. Other reports indicate that fish and seafood fraud may be widespread in some markets, consisting mostly of the mislabeling or substitution of a higher-valued species with something different from and inferior to the expected species, possibly with a fish species that could be associated with some types of food poisoning or exposure to certain allergens. Substitution of olive oil with other types of seed, legume, or nut oils could have unintended consequences if consumed by those with certain food allergies.
