If the Chief Actuary determines that the Medicare per capita growth rate exceeds the Medicare per capita target growth rate, the Chief Actuary would establish an applicable savings target\u2014the amount by which the Board must reduce future spending. This determination by the Chief Actuary also triggers a requirement that the Board prepare a proposal to reduce the growth in the Medicare per capita growth rate by the applicable savings target. The Board cannot ration care, raise premiums, increase cost sharing, or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility. In generating its proposals, the Board is directed to consider, among other things, Medicare solvency, quality and access to care, the effects of changes in payments to providers, and those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. If the Board fails to act, the Secretary is directed to prepare a proposal.", "Board proposals must be submitted to the Secretary by September 1 of each year and to the President and Congress by January 15 of the following year. Board proposals are \"fast-tracked\" in Congress, and IPAB proposals go into force automatically unless Congress affirmatively acts to amend or block them within a stated period of time and under circumstances specified in the act. Section 3403(d) of the act establishes special \"fast track\" parliamentary procedures governing House and Senate committee consideration, and Senate floor consideration, of legislation implementing the Board or Secretary's proposal. These procedures differ from the parliamentary mechanisms the chambers usually use to consider most legislation and are designed to ensure that Congress can act promptly on the implementing legislation should it choose to do so. PPACA also established a second \"fast track\" parliamentary mechanism for consideration of legislation discontinuing the automatic implementation process for the recommendations of the Board.", "The Board's charge is to develop proposals for the Secretary to implement that reduce the per capita growth in Medicare expenditures, not to reduce Medicare expenditures. Therefore, while the CBO projects that the cumulative impact of the Board's recommendations from 2015 through 2019 will reduce total spending by $15.5 billion, during the same period, Medicare expenditures will total $3.9 trillion with average spending per beneficiary forecast to increase from $13,374 to $15,749.

Specifically, over this time period, medical inflation has on average been roughly 2.2 percentage points higher each year than overall inflation. Moreover, Medicare spending during this same period has increased 8.5% per year, while total federal outlays during this same period increased by only 5.3% per year. While some of the growth in Medicare expenditures can be attributed to the increase in the number of Medicare beneficiaries, Medicare per enrollee expenditures rose 6.3% per year from 1985 through 2008\u2014faster than overall medical inflation. Had spending per Medicare beneficiary increased at just the rate of overall inflation over the 1985 through 2008 period, per enrollee expenditures in 2008 would have been slightly less than $4,600 as compared to actual 2008 Medicare Part A and Part B expenditures of $9,448 per beneficiary. ", "Again, the legislation's stated goal of the Board is to reduce the per capita growth in Medicare expenditures, not to reduce overall Medicare expenditures. The Board achieves this goal by developing proposals for the Secretary to implement that reduce the growth in Medicare expenditures. Therefore, while the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the cumulative impact of the Board's recommendations from 2015 through 2019 will reduce total spending by $15.5 billion, during the same period total Medicare expenditures are projected to be $3.9 trillion with average spending per beneficiary increasing from $13,374 in 2015 to $15,749 in 2019. These savings represent a reduction of about $60.00 per year per Medicare beneficiary over the 2015 through 2019 period.

Moreover, it has been assumed that these entities would possess the specialized expertise needed to make operational decisions regarding payments and focus initiatives on beneficiary interests and the longer term financial viability of the program. ", "For instance, in 2000 and 2001 Senators Breaux and Frist introduced reform proposals to increase CMS's budget, create separate agencies to administer parts of the program, and establish a Medicare Board to manage competition among private plans and traditional Medicare (referred to as \"Breaux-Frist I,\" S. 1895 , and \"Breaux-Frist II,\" S. 358 ). ", "Interest in an independent health care entity reemerged during early discussions of what became PPACA. Former Senator Tom Daschle proposed the Federal Health Board, modeled after the Federal Reserve Board, with broad authority over both private and public health care programs, including benefit and coverage recommendations, regulation of private insurance markets, and improvements in quality of care. ", "In June 2009, Senator Rockefeller introduced the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Reform Act of 2009 ( S. 1380 in the 111 th Congress), which would have altered MedPAC from its current 15-member advisory commission to an 11-member executive branch agency with authority to make both payment and coverage decisions (see Appendix B for a side-by-side comparison of MedPAC and IPAB). In order to achieve program savings, the Commission was directed \"to implement payment policies, methodologies, and rates and coverage policies and methodologies ... estimated to reduce expenditures under this title by not less than 1.5 percent annually.\" ", "In July 2009, the President submitted a draft proposal to Congress titled the Independent Medicare Advisory Council Act of 2009 (referred to as the IMAC proposal). This proposal would have established a five-member council to advise the President on Medicare payment rates for certain providers. While the council would have had authority to recommend broader policy reforms, its authority outside of Medicare payment policy was limited. ", "Finally, during the recent health care reform deliberations, the Senate Finance Committee included a provision (\u00a73403) to establish an independent Medicare advisory board in the now enacted PPACA. Section 10320, added by the manager's amendment, broadened the scope of the Board to make recommendations to slow the growth in nonfederal programs and changed the name of the entity to the Independent Payment Advisory Board, to reflect these additional responsibilities. ", "The perceived merits to some of an independent board are the perceived shortcomings to others. For instance, as Medicare expenditures represent a sizable proportion of federal outlays, approximately 13% in FY2010, for some critics such a large proportion of expenditures should not be beyond the scrutiny and review of elected officials or the public. Second, there is concern that boards, such as IPAB, are singularly focused on reducing spending, that tradeoffs exist between spending and quality, and that these tradeoffs are best dealt with by elected officials. Finally, similar efforts to \"automatically\" control health care spending, such as the sustainable growth rate formula, used to update Medicare physician payments, potentially demonstrate that such supposedly automatic mechanisms do not effectively remove special interests or Congress from the process. For proponents, removing short-term political and public opinion, focusing on spending, and using automatic mechanisms is required to reduce the growth in expenditures and rationalize health care decision making.

For example, for the 2013 DY, the Chief Actuary will use the growth in spending for 2011-2015.", "Using the same five-year period, the target growth rate will initially be calculated based on the midpoint between the five-year average overall inflation (using the Consumer Price Index for all items and services, the CPI u ) and five-year average medical inflation (using the Consumer Price Index for medical inflation, the CPI m ). However, beginning with the 2018 DY, the target growth rate will be tied to the growth of the economy, based on the five-year average increase in the nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus one percentage point.", "For DYs prior to 2018, the target growth rate is determined as follows:", "Calculate the percent increase in each year for both the CPI u and the CPI m . Add the CPI u and CPI m together for each year and take the simple average by dividing by 2.

The average annualized rate of growth is a single number, which is the target growth rate for the five-year period.", "For DYs beginning in 2018, the target growth rate will be the projected five-year average percentage increase in the nominal GDP per capita plus one percentage point. Using this formula will constrain future increases in Medicare expenditures more closely to the rate of growth in the economy. However because the formula adds one percentage point each year to the increase in nominal GDP, Medicare expenditures could continue to grow more quickly than the economy. ", "If the Chief Actuary finds that the growth rate does not exceed the targeted growth rate , the process for the year ends. If the Chief Actuary determines that the growth rate exceeds the target growth rate for any DY, the Chief Actuary is required to establish an applicable savings target for the IY. The applicable savings target is an amount equal to the product of the total projected Medicare expenditures in the PY times the applicable percent . The applicable percent is defined as the lesser of either the projected excess for the IY (the amount by which Medicare spending is forecast to exceed the targeted growth in spending expressed as a percent of total Medicare expenditures) or the percent as specified in the statute (0.5% in IY 2015; 1.0% in IY 2016; 1.25% in IY 2017; and 1.5% in 2018 and any subsequent IY).

In moving beyond expertise, skills, and experience and naming specific groups that should be included on the Board, the legislation designates some interests as worthy of being represented and others, by omission, as not being worthy.

The House Committee on Ways and Means also ordered the bill to be reported by voice vote on March 8, 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2011 (H.R. 5)", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 452 was combined with the Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2011 ( H.R. 5 ), a bill that would impose caps on some damages awarded in malpractice lawsuits, limit attorneys' fees in malpractice lawsuits, and establish a statute of limitations for filing health care lawsuits. On March 22, 2012, the House passed the combined version of H.R. 5 .", "Appendix A. Key Dates for IPAB Implementation", "Appendix B. A Comparison of IPAB and MedPAC", "Appendix C. Medicare Productivity Exemptions and Board Recommendations", "PPACA Section 3401 altered certain market basket updates used to adjust Medicare base payment amounts and incorporated productivity improvements into those market basket updates that previously did not include them. Since some providers and suppliers of services will receive a reduction in payments beyond their productivity adjustment in some years, Section 3403(c)(2)(iii) prohibits, as described below, the Board from recommending in some years further reduction in payment rates to those providers and suppliers. ", "All of the providers and suppliers subject to Section 3401 productivity adjustments are listed in Table C -1 . To be exempt under Section 3403(c)(2)(iii) from Board recommendations in any given year a provider would have to be slated to receive a reduction under Section 3401 in its inflationary payment update in excess of a reduction due to productivity in a year in which such recommendations would take effect. ", "Reduction in Excess of a Reduction Due to Productivity\u00a0Adjustment", "An \"update reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivity\" means that for that category of provider, after calculating any applicable percentage increase in payments due to changes in costs, reduced by the productivity adjustment, payments are further reduced by an additional applicable percentage specified in Section 3401. For example, in rate year 2012, payments to long term care hospitals will be adjusted by changes in their costs, changes in productivity in the broader economy, and then reduced by an additional 0.10 percentage point. Again, only those providers that are subject to this additional reduction in payments will receive a time-limited exemption from Board recommendations. ", "Therefore, the relevant factor in determining whether providers have an exemption is whether the provider had a reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivity in the year the recommendation would take effect. If so, that provider is exempt from Board recommendations that take effect in that year. ", "Providers Subject to Section 3401 ", " Table C -1 also indicates which providers are subject to a productivity adjustment, a reduction in excess of a reduction due to productivity, or some other adjustment; the applicable time period of the adjustment; and whether the adjustment gives rise to an exemption period under Section 3403. CRS analysis of CMS statistics indicates that in 2009 Medicare payments to exempt providers represented approximately 37% of all Medicare benefit payments.", "Proposals generated by the Board in 2018 and submitted to the President and Congress in 2019 could include provisions, relating to any provider, that the Secretary would begin implementing effective August 15, 2019, and later. By 2020, all exemptions will have lapsed and all providers of services and supplies will potentially be subject to Board recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
