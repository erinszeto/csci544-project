Emphasis is on FWS funding for programs of interest to Congress, now or in recent years. These include the endangered species program, global climate change, wildlife refuges, land acquisition, international conservation, and state and tribal wildlife grants. In addition, related policy issues are also considered in the funding context. Each of the related policy issues is explained in more detail in the report.", "For FY2010, the House passed H.R. 2996, the Interior appropriations bill, containing FWS appropriations, on June 26, 2009 (H.Rept. 111-180).

Among them are lawsuits challenging how Reclamation operations may affect several species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Over a year ago both FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) issued separate biological opinions (BiOps) for Central Valley Project (California) water operations, holding that certain actions by Reclamation would jeopardize listed species. Under the ESA, these BiOps provided alternatives to avoid jeopardy or adverse modification of habitat designated as critical to the listed species. In addition, the BiOps provided incidental take statements (ITSs) that authorized takes of listed species that might result even though the action agency followed the BiOp, the alternatives, and any mitigation recommended by FWS or NMFS. Some of the actions in the alternatives may result in restricting water supplies to certain water users in central and southern California. The agricultural users are in regions of California that are also heavily affected by the general downturn in the economy and loss of jobs in the building construction industry.", "Various California water interests support restricting or modifying the implementation of the BiOps to provide more water for agriculture. Others in the area point to the need for maintaining water in streams not only for listed species but also for commercial fisheries and water quality.

For FY2010, the House Appropriations Committee's report encouraged FWS to address a backlog of candidate species awaiting listing decisions; the Administration's request proposed a decrease in this program for FY2011. The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2010 report urged improvement in the consultation program to address past deficiencies. The FY2010 conference report set aside $2.5 million in the consultation program to improve monitoring and record-keeping.", "The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund also benefits conservation of species that are listed, or proposed for listing, under the Endangered Species Act, through grants to states and territories.

Costs of operations have increased on many refuges, partly due to special problems such as hurricane damage and more aggressive border enforcement, but also due to increased use, invasive species control, maintenance backlog and other demands. Refuge funding was not keeping pace with new demands, and these demands, combined with the rising costs of rent, salaries, fuel, and utilities, led to cuts in funding for programs to aid endangered species, reduce infestation by invasive species, protect water supplies, address habitat restoration, and ensure staffing at the less popular refuges. While some increases were provided to address these problems in recent years, the FY2009 stimulus law provided additional funding to address these concerns. Some observers contend that the system's problems are ongoing and will be significant after the stimulus funding is exhausted. Balanced against these concerns is congressional interest in general deficit reduction.", "The Administration requests $63.3 million for nationwide law enforcement, a decrease of 4% from the FY2010 level of $65.8 million.
