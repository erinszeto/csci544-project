FederalESPC projects have achieved about a 30% higher energy savings (per-square-foot basis) thanmunicipal/state governments, universities, schools, and hospitals (MUSH).

These contracts reduced energy consumption but did not reduce the totalcost of operation until contract expiration.

Since ESCOs pay interest charges on money borrowed to finance the energy conservation measures,they recover the cost over the life cycle of the ESPC. Under an appropriations-funded project, acontractor's commercial finance charges would also be passed through as part the project's cost, butthe length of financing and therefore cost of financing would be considerably less than with ESPCs.", "A key measure for comparing the ESPC funding alternative to appropriations-funded projectslies in the life-cycle cost. This accounts for the costs of the initial survey and feasibility study,installation, and owning and operating the ECM over its useful life. ORNL devised parametrictables (22) to assist federalmanagers in deciding whether to fund ECMs through ESPCs or wait for appropriated funding. Forproject duration times between 28 and 68 months, ORNL found that appropriations-funded projectshad lower life-cycle costs as long as the up-front survey/study costs stayed below 18% of thedesign/completion costs.

After an extensive review of whether ESPCs imposed a futurefinancial obligation on the federal government, CBO began scoring ESPCs as mandatory spending,coinciding with the expiration of the BEA. (24) The CBO scoring reflects how ESPCs create futurecommitments to appropriations. It is consistent with how appropriations-funded energy conservationprojects would be scored throughout the budget.

Nevertheless, CBO scores ESPCs as future commitments to appropriations, consistent with thescoring of commitments for appropriations-funded energy conservation projects throughout thebudget. O&M funds that would pay for ESPCs must be appropriated. Upwards of $2.5 billion overthe next 10 years would be scored as a future commitment if ESPCs were reauthorized. ", "In effect, the federal government borrows money when it authorizes energy-efficiencyimprovements through ESPCs. When there is a deficit, the Treasury must also borrow moneyneeded by government to pay its bills, which government borrows by selling Treasury securities suchas T-bills, notes, Treasury Inflation-Protected securities, and savings bonds to the public.", "Proponents of ESPCs may argue that ESPCs represent a financially smart choice because ofthe guarantee that all costs, including debt repayment, will be covered by the cost savings producedby new ECMs. Further, the real cost of energy conservation measures under ESPCs is zero giventhat the capital improvement costs and reduced energy costs are less than what the governmentwould continue to pay without the improvements. Further arguments may be made that ESPCsrequire shorter lead times than improvements made with appropriated funds. Hence, energyreductions can be achieved sooner with ESPCs, as supported by the ORNL study. However, thelife-cycle cost of the ECM favors appropriations-funded projects within certain parameters, andESPC funding under other parameters.

In recognizing that ESPCs do impose futurefinancial obligations, as scored by CBO, Congress may consider retaining the sunset provision.", "Despite declining appropriations for energy-efficiency improvements and the necessity tolimit future financial obligations, Congress may still choose to encourage energy-efficiencyimprovements in federal facilities. Congress may decide once again to extend the sunset provision,as had been authorized in the 1998 legislation.
