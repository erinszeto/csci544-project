{"id": "RL31636", "title": "Wireless Privacy and Spam: Issues for Congress", "released_date": "2006-12-28T00:00:00", "summary": ["Wireless communications devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs) are ubiquitous. Some consumers, already deluged with unwanted commercial messages, or \"spam,\" via computers that access the Internet by traditional wireline connections, are concerned that such unsolicited advertising is expanding to wireless communications, further eroding their privacy.", "In particular, federal requirements under the Enhanced 911 (E911) initiative to ensure that mobile telephone users can obtain emergency services as easily as users of wireline telephones, are driving wireless telecommunications carriers to implement technologies that can locate a caller with significant precision. Wireless telecommunications carriers then will have the ability to track a user's location any time a wireless telephone, for example, is activated. Therefore some worry that information on an individual's daily habits\u2014such as eating, working, and shopping\u2014will become a commodity for sale to advertising companies. As consumers walk or drive past restaurants and other businesses, they may receive calls advertising sales or otherwise soliciting their patronage. While some may find this helpful, others may find it a nuisance, particularly if they incur usage charges.", "As with the parallel debates over Internet privacy and spam, the wireless privacy discussion focuses on whether industry can be relied upon to self-regulate, or if legislation is needed. Three laws already address wireless privacy and spam concerns. The 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA, P.L. 102-243) prohibits the use of autodialers or prerecorded voice messages to call wireless devices if the recipient would be charged for the call, unless the recipient has given prior consent. The 1999 Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act (the \"911 Act,\" P.L. 106-81) expanded on privacy protections for Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) held by telecommunications carriers by adding \"location\" to the definition of CPNI, and set forth circumstances under which that information could be used with or without the customer's express prior consent. The 2003 Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (the CAN-SPAM Act, P.L. 108-187) required the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to issue rules to protect wireless subscribers from unwanted mobile service commercial messages (they were issued in August 2004). Consumers also may list their cell phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.", "Most recently, the 109th Congress passed the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, and Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2005 (U.S. SAFE WEB Act); the bill was signed into law on December 22, 2006 (P.L. 109-455). The bill would allow the FTC and parallel foreign law enforcement agencies to share information while investigating allegations of \"unfair and deceptive practices\" that involve foreign commerce. Congress continues to debate how to protect the privacy of wireless subscribers, primarily in the areas of CPNI, wireless location data, and proposed wireless directory assistance services."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Wireless communications devices\u2014including mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, and automobile-based services such as OnStar\u2014are ubiquitous. Many of the services provided by these devices require data on the user's location, whether it is to connect a phone call or dispatch emergency services when an airbag deploys.", "Consumers and privacy rights advocates are increasingly concerned about the privacy implications of these wireless location-based services. If a company providing a wireless service knows the user's location, with whom can that data be shared? How long can the data be retained? Will the data be used to create individual profiles that will be sold to marketing companies or used for other purposes unknown to the user or contrary to his or her preference? Will consumers be deluged with messages on their communications devices advertising sales at nearby stores or restaurants not unlike the \"spam\" in their e-mail inboxes?", "The precision with which wireless service providers can determine a subscriber's exact location is improving with the implementation of Enhanced 911 (E911) capabilities for mobile telephones and other wireless devices, wherein wireless carriers are required to provide Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) with the location of wireless callers who dial 911 within 50-300 meters (150-900 feet). While this serves the laudable goal of ensuring mobile telephone users immediate access to emergency services, many worry about what other uses will be made of such location information. Once the technical ability exists to provide a user's precise coordinates, some privacy advocates worry that more and more devices will incorporate it, making location information widely available without proper privacy safeguards.", "The debate over wireless privacy in many ways parallels the debate over Internet privacy and Internet spam. Indeed, since wireless Internet access devices are on the market, the issues intersect. One particular similarity is that the policy debate focuses on whether legislation is needed, or if industry can be relied upon to self-regulate.", "Four laws, each discussed later in this report, address some of the issues\u2014the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 102-243 ), the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act ( P.L. 106-81 ), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM, P.L. 108-187 ), and the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, and Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act (US SAFE WEB, P.L. 109-455 )\u2014however, other concerns remain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns of Consumers and Privacy Rights Advocates", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spam", "paragraphs": ["Some consumers and privacy rights groups, including the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), worry that the ability to identify a wireless customer's location could lead to further erosion of individual privacy. Although the E911 requirements apply only to calls made from mobile telephones seeking emergency assistance, once that capability is available, many worry that such information will be collected and sold for other purposes, such as marketing. Some observers point out that wireless carriers may be motivated to sell such customer data to recoup the costs of deploying wireless E911.", "Users of wireless devices such as pagers, personal digital assistants, or automobile-based services such as OnStar, might be affected along with mobile telephone customers. A major concern is that if location information is available to commercial entities, a wireless customer walking or driving along the street may be deluged with unsolicited advertisements from nearby restaurants or stores alerting them to merchandise available in their establishments. Supporters of unsolicited advertising insist that consumers benefit from directed advertisements because they are more likely to offer products in which the consumer is interested. They also argue that advertising is protected by the First Amendment.", "One aspect of this concern is that companies could build profiles of consumers using data collected over a period of time. In that context, one question is whether limits should be set on the length of time location information can be retained. Some argue that once a 911 call has been completed, or after a subscriber to a location-based service received the desired information (such as directions to the nearest restaurant), that the location information should be deleted.", "Wireless spam was addressed by Congress in the CAN-SPAM Act (discussed below), although it does not focus specifically on the location aspects of the issue."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Wireless 411\" Directory", "paragraphs": ["Another aspect of the wireless privacy debate concerns the rights of subscribers to have, or not have, their numbers listed in a \"wireless 411\" cell phone directory. Such a directory does not currently exist, but CTIA\u2014The Wireless Association, began developing one in 2004 for six of the seven largest mobile service providers. One estimate is that a wireless directory could generate as much as $3 billion a year for the wireless industry by 2009 in fees and additional minutes. Qsent is the \"aggregator\" for the directory service.", "In early 2005, some of the companies backing the directory project announced changes in their plans. Sprint and ALLTEL were the first to indicate that they would delay offering such a service until the regulatory climate stabilized. Some cited a new California law that requires carriers to obtain separate authorization from subscribers before including them in the directory as an example of the evolving regulatory climate. A number of other states are considering similar legislation. By the end of April 2005, T-Mobile reportedly was the only major carrier still planning to offer directory services, pledging to do so on an opt-in basis.", "A key difference between wireless and wireline phones is that subscribers must pay for incoming as well as outgoing calls. Thus, some argue that subscribers need to be assured that they will not receive unwanted calls, not only because of a nuisance factor, but for cost reasons. Consumers may list their cell phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, but concerns persist about unwanted calls from telemarketers or others. (In December 2004, an e-mail was widely circulated on the Internet warning consumers that they must list their cell phone numbers on the Do Not Call list before the end of 2004, but that is incorrect. Phone numbers may be added to the Do Not Call list at any time.)", "Questions that are arising include whether subscribers should be able to decline to have their numbers published without paying a fee (as wireline customers must do if they want an unlisted number). Proponents of the directory insist that customers will have to consent to having their numbers listed. Opponents counter that many subscribers do not realize that they already have given consent through the contract they sign with their service provider. Other critics point out that wireless subscribers pay for every call, and view their cell phones as distinctly private. From the beginning, one of the largest mobile service providers, Verizon Wireless, decided not to participate in the directory. The company's President and CEO, Denny Strigl, argues against the notion of an \"opt-in\" directory, where subscribers would have to give their express prior authorization to being listed, saying that \"Customers see opt-in as a disingenuous foot-in-the-door\u2014leading to 'opt-out' clauses and fees for not publishing a number. Nor does opt-in allow customers any degree of control over how and to whom their information is revealed\u2014they either keep full privacy or face full exposure, with nothing in-between.\" (\"Opt-in\" and \"Opt-out\" are explained below.) Consumers Union established a website to encourage individuals to contact their Members of Congress in support of wireless directory legislation.", "In September 2004, hearings were held by the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet. At the 2004 Senate hearing, CTIA testified that there is no need for legislation because the directory does not yet exist so it is premature to pass legislation now, the wireless industry has a proven track record in protecting consumer privacy, and subscribers would not be forced to participate in the directory nor charged a fee for opting-out. Mr. Strigl from Verizon Wireless repeated his strong opposition to the directory, but agreed that legislation is not necessary. Some opponents of the legislation point to Verizon Wireless's decision not to participate in the directory as indicative of a market-based solution to the problem, since subscribers wishing not to be listed could switch to Verizon Wireless.", "Advocates of the legislation at the 2004 House hearing countered that, for example, the wireless industry's track record is less than perfect. According to Communications Daily , Representative Pitts, who sponsored one of the 108 th Congress bills, stated that when he first discussed a wireless directory with industry representatives two years earlier, they insisted that opt-in was impossible, and they would need to charge for the service. Yet now, he noted, the industry is asserting that the system would be opt-in and free. Representative Markey commented that the fact that the carriers informed consumers that their numbers might become listed in a wireless directory only in the fine print of their service contracts made some observers suspicious of their intentions. Senator Boxer testified at the House hearing, noting that cell phones are quite different from home phones because people take them wherever they go, so unwanted calls are even more intrusive. She emphasized the need to allow parents to control whether their children's numbers are listed, and the need to act quickly, before the directory comes into existence. Witnesses from EPIC and the AARP testified in favor of the legislation at the Senate hearing.", "Legislation has been reintroduced in the 109 th Congress, as discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selling Cell Phone Records", "paragraphs": ["Concern is mounting about the public availability of cell phone records, which may include detailed information on calls to and from a particular number, such as the number dialed, the duration, and the location of the cell phone. Some of these records, along with records from other telephone and voice communications, may become available for sale over the Internet from \"data brokers\" who collect and sell the information. Attention is focused on how the data brokers obtain the information, and whether telecommunications companies are adequately protecting the so-called Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) as required by law. For more discussion of CPNI, see \" The Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act (the \"911\u00a0Act\") \" below.", "From a legislative standpoint, a fundamental issue is whether existing laws\u2014the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 41-51), which bans unfair and deceptive practices that might be employed by pretexters, and the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which requires telecommunications carriers to protect CPNI\u2014are adequate, or if new laws are needed to criminalize specifically the fraudulent acquisition and sale of cell phone (or all telephone) records. Generally, privacy rights groups want additional legislation. One telecommunications association, CTIA, supports new legislation to criminalize obtaining phone records by fraudulent means. Another, USTelecom, wants improved enforcement of existing laws instead of new laws. The FCC supports three potential legislative actions: making the commercial availability of consumers' phone records illegal, overturning a 1999 court ruling that limited the FCC's ability to implement more stringent protections of consumer phone record information, and strengthening the FCC's enforcement tools.

Current law requires telecommunications carriers to protect the confidentiality of CPNI. EPIC later expanded its request to the FTC, asking for an industry-wide investigation. An IEI spokesman described the company as a customer-service and billing agency for licensed private investigators and was not aware that it was breaking any laws.", "EPIC's original complaint focused on the actions of IEI in obtaining the records, asserting that it only could have done so through unfair and deceptive practices, which are under the FTC's jurisdiction.

On January 17, 2006, FCC commissioners Adelstein and Copps issued separate statements applauding the investigation. On January 30, 2006, the Enforcement Bureau issued Notices of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture (NALs) to AT&T Wireless and Alltel for failing to certify that they have protected CPNI. The Enforcement Bureau recommended $100,000 fines for each company. The FCC also issued subpoenas to several prominent data brokers seeking details on how they obtain the telephone records and asked about the sale of those records. Mr. Martin testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on February 1, 2006 that the data brokers did not reply adequately to the request, and that the FCC issued letters of citation to the companies and referred the inadequate responses to the Justice Department for enforcement of the subpoenas.

Mr. Rotenberg summarized his organization's efforts at raising awareness of this issue through the filings with the FCC and FTC (discussed above). He explained that telephone carriers opposed the use of enhanced security requirements for the data they collect, arguing that bringing lawsuits against pretexters would be sufficient. He insisted that enforcement alone would only drive the practice underground, and that \"simple security enhancements, such as sending a wireless phone user a text message in advance of releasing records, could tip off a victim ....\"", "Similar sentiments were offered by those witnesses or other representatives of their organizations at the Senate hearing on February 8. In addition, the House committee heard from the Attorney General of Illinois, who asked that state laws not be preempted if federal legislation is enacted, and from a representative of the U.S. Telecom Association, who argued in favor of enforcement of existing laws and increased penalties, and against new security mandates.

Enforcement is sometimes included as a fifth practice. \"Choice\" is often described as \"opt-in\" or \"opt-out.\" To opt-in, consumers must give their affirmative consent to a website's information practices. To opt-out, consumers are assumed to have given consent unless they indicate otherwise.", "Some argue that similar practices should be observed by wireless carriers or providers of location-based information and services.

The optimism surrounding the business potential of wireless devices is exemplified by the emergence of the terms M-Commerce (mobile commerce) and L-Commerce (location commerce) and the creation of industry associations to promote them. The Mobile Marketing Association developed a code of conduct that was adopted by MMA's Board of Directors in November 2003. It combines opt-in and opt-out approaches. In September 2004, MMA established a wireless anti-spam committee in what it called the second phase of its efforts to ensure wireless applications are spam-free (the release of the code of conduct was the first phase).", "TRUSTe, a company that offers privacy \"seals\" to websites that follow certain privacy guidelines, released what it called the \"first wireless privacy standards\" on February 18, 2004.

According to a media account, participants conceded that many companies developing wireless applications are too busy implementing their services to focus on privacy issues, and that since these companies are not certain of what future applications may emerge, \"they tend to collect far more data than they need right now ... and even more collection is likely once there's ready buyer [sic] for information.\" Some participants noted the importance of determining privacy requirements early in the development of wireless and location-based services so systems and equipment need not be retrofitted in the future.", "In November 2000, CTIA asked the FCC to initiate a rulemaking, separate from its rulemaking on Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI, see discussion of the 911 Act, below), on implementation of the wireless location information amendments made by P.L. 106-81 . CTIA argued that location privacy information is uniquely a wireless concern, and such an FCC rulemaking would attract commenters who would not be interested in the general CPNI rulemaking. CTIA asked that the FCC adopt privacy principles to assure that mobile services users would be informed of the location information collection and use practices of their service providers before the information is disclosed or used. Specifically, CTIA wanted the FCC to adopt technology neutral (i.e., for either handset- or network-based systems) rules requiring notice, choice, and \"security and integrity.\" The latter phrase was described as meaning that location information should be protected from unauthorized use and disclosure to third parties, and third parties must adhere to the provider's location information practices. The FCC issued a Public Notice on March 16, 2001 requesting comments on CTIA's request. After receiving comments and deliberating on the request, the FCC announced in July 2002 that it would not commence such a proceeding. The FCC concluded that the \"statute imposes clear legal obligations and protections for consumers\" and \"we do not wish to artificially constrain the still-developing market for location-based services...\" The FCC added that it would closely monitor the issues and initiate a rulemaking proceeding \"only when the need to do so has been clearly demonstrated.\"", "Wireless privacy issues have expanded beyond the initial concerns about privacy principles and fair information practices.

CTIA reportedly agreed with the FCC's preliminary interpretation that the CAN-SPAM Act applies only to messages sent to an e-mail address consisting of two parts, a unique user name or mailbox and a reference to an Internet domain (e.g., janedoe@wirelesscarrier.com), and therefore should not apply to SMS, short code or other text messages sent using other address formats.", "The FCC adopted the new rules on August 4, 2004; they were released on August 12.

The legislation requires commercial mobile service providers to obtain express prior authorization (\"opt-in\") from each current subscriber, separate from any authorization obtained to provide the subscriber with mobile service or any associated calling plan or other service, to include the subscriber's wireless phone number in the database. For new subscribers, mobile service providers may include a subscriber's number in a 411 directory only if they provide a separate notice at the time a new subscriber signs up for service, and at least once a year thereafter, informing the subscriber of the right not to be listed, and providing a convenient mechanism for the subscriber to decline or refuse to be listed (\"opt-out\").
