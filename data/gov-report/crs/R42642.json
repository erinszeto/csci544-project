However, the data paint a complex picture. By some measures, U.S. students appear to be doing quite well. For example, overall graduate enrollments in science and engineering (S&E) grew 35% over the last decade. Further, S&E enrollments for Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, and African American students (all of whom are generally underrepresented in S&E) grew by 65%, 55%, and 50%, respectively. On the other hand, concerns remain about persistent academic achievement gaps between various demographic groups, STEM teacher quality, the rankings of U.S. students on international STEM assessments, foreign student enrollments and increased education attainment in other countries, and the ability of the U.S. STEM education system to meet domestic demand for STEM labor.", "Various attempts to assess the federal STEM education effort have produced different estimates of its scope and scale. Analysts have identified between 105 and 252 STEM education programs and activities at 13 to 15 federal agencies. Annual federal appropriations for STEM education are typically in the range of $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion. All published inventories identify the Department of Education, National Science Foundation, and Health and Human Services as key agencies in the federal effort. Over half of federal STEM education funding is intended to serve the needs of postsecondary schools and students; the remainder goes to efforts at the kindergarten-through-Grade 12 (K-12) level.

In one in which the measures of government receive their impressions so immediately from the sense of the community as in ours it is proportionably [sic] essential.", "More recent concerns about scientific and technological literacy in the United States focus on the relationship between STEM education and national prosperity and power. Since World War II, the United States has benefitted from economic and military advances made possible, in part, by a highly skilled STEM workforce. However, today the economic and social benefits of scientific thinking and STEM education are widely believed to have broad application for workers in both STEM and non-STEM occupations. As such, many contemporary policy makers consider widespread STEM literacy, as well as specific STEM expertise, to be critical human capital competencies for a 21 st century economy. ", "One major source of the STEM workforce in the United States is the education system. Federal legislators have paid close attention to the STEM-related outputs of that system\u2014such as the number of college graduates with degrees in STEM fields or the performance of U.S. students on international mathematics tests\u2014and have sought to increase its functioning and capacity though federal policy and investments. For example, over 225 bills containing the term \"science education\" were introduced in the 20 years between the 102 nd (1991-1992) and 112 th (2011-2012) Congresses. Agency reauthorization bills often contain STEM education-related provisions, and at least 13 federal agencies conduct STEM education programs or activities.

This influential publication warned federal policy makers that perceived weaknesses in the existing U.S. STEM education system\u2014along with other important factors\u2014threatened national prosperity and power. Although some analysts disputed its assertions, the report helped focus the federal conversation about STEM education and led, in part, to passage of the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Act (or America COMPETES Act, P.L. 110-69 ). Among other things, that act authorized STEM education programs at the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Education (ED).

Congressional committees in the 113 th Congress have begun the process of reauthorizing these acts, including selected STEM education provisions.

Differences between the inventories are due, in part, to the lack of a common definition of what constitutes a STEM education program or activity. Auditors have also found STEM education activities performed by science mission agencies difficult to capture because such activities tend to be fiscally and organizationally integrated into what are otherwise primarily scientific programs. Funding calculations and program identification become even more intricate when broad-purpose education programs with a STEM goal are considered (e.g., teacher training programs that focus on mathematics in addition to other fields such as reading). Finally, some estimates of federal STEM education activities depend on agency self-reporting, which is a less-reliable auditing method.", "Despite these limitations, these four inventories reveal several general patterns in federal STEM education investments.

The GAO-2005 inventory found a much smaller share of funds at ED (8%; compared to 23%, 29%, and 22% in the latter three inventories). This discrepancy is likely attributable to a large increase in the FY2006 ED appropriation (roughly $310 million) for the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant program, which was newly authorized in 2005.

This incompatibility is likely due to overlap between the populations served or program objectives within the individual STEM education programs.

Additionally, nearly all STEM education programs have multiple objectives (e.g., supporting research and increasing degree attainment, encouraging advanced study and smoothing career transitions). Further, the inventories reported their findings on populations served and program objectives in different ways, thus making it difficult to compare their results on these important program elements.", "Each inventory reported on programs by population served (e.g., by education level), although both GAO studies did this only in terms of the number of programs and not their funding level. Figure 2 presents the percentage of programs primarily serving elementary and secondary schools and postsecondary institutions as a share of the total number of programs identified in each inventory. Of the programs identified by GAO-2005, just fewer than 40% served elementary and secondary schools and just over 60% served postsecondary institutions, compared to 25% and 75% in the ACC-2007 study, 44% and 56% in the NSTC-2011 inventory, and 31% and 69% in the GAO-2012 study.

However, only the NSTC-2011 and GAO-2005 inventories reported information that could be summarized. The NSTC-2011 study found that nearly three-quarters of programs (74%) have at least two secondary program objectives in addition to the primary objective. The GAO-2005 study found an even larger share of programs (80%) with more than one goal, with about half supporting four or more goals.
