These instructions might be consistent with new standards and guidelines that take innovative forms, such as proposals put forward by policy analysts. Some call for state-specific guidelines for existing power plants with flexibilities in state implementation plans to allow compliance in flexible ways, including use of generator and consumer efficiency, renewable mechanisms, rate averaging, and additional options. The President's announcement specifically indicated that the EPA standards should \"provide flexibility to different states with different needs, and build on the leadership that many states, and cities, and companies have already shown.\" Stakeholders are offering many comments regarding the stringency of the guidelines, the flexibilities to states and regulated entities, and the base year against which reductions will be measured, with many views on costs, benefits, and impacts on various entities and populations in the United States.", "Electricity Generation from Renewable Energy . The President set a goal to double electricity generation from wind, solar, and geothermal energy from current levels by 2020. Electricity generation produced from wind, solar, and geothermal increased 80% from 2009 to 2011, from 90 million megawatt-hours to 161 million megawatt-hours. Including biomass fuels, the increase of non-hydro renewable electricity was 52% from 2009 to 2011, from 144 million megawatt-hours to 219 million megawatt-hours.

The State Department faces a pending decision of whether to grant a Presidential Permit for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Keystone XL would transport oil sands crude from Canada to a market hub in Nebraska for further delivery to Gulf Coast refineries. Some environmental groups called this decision the \"line in the sand\" for U.S. climate change policy and urged the President to deny the permit. On June 25, 2013, the President stated in his speech that \"[our] national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the impacts of carbon pollution. The net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project can go forward . \" In April 2013 comments on the draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the permit application, EPA recommended that the State Department include in the final EIS monetized estimates of the social cost of the GHG emissions from a barrel of oil sands crude compared to average U.S. crude.

Bilateral cooperation with key major emerging economies. Existing initiatives include the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center, the U.S.-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy, and the Strategic Energy Dialogue with Brazil. The President cites as an example an agreement between the United States and China in June 2013 to phase down production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) globally under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. A call to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels globally. G-20 leaders committed to this goal in 2009. President Obama proposes in his FY2014 budget, as in previous budgets, to eliminate U.S. tax provisions that benefit fossil fuel supply. Negotiating a global free trade agreement on environmental goods and services under the World Trade Organization (WTO). The President said such a global agreement would build on the 2011 agreement under the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies to reduce tariffs to 5% or less by 2015 on a negotiated list of 54 environmental goods. The plan calls for negotiation at the WTO of a plurilateral agreement to eliminate tariffs on environmental goods with countries that account for 90% of global trade in environmental goods. It also calls for inclusion of environmental services in the ongoing plurilateral Trade in International Services agreement. These talks seek to supplant the thus far unsuccessful multilateral negotiations on environmental goods and services at the WTO Doha Round.

The cumulative impacts of existing measures and the President's announced plan have not been assessed, in terms of accomplishments in reducing GHG emissions or in terms of costs and savings that may result. In addition to net costs or benefits, distributional impacts across regions, sectors, and segments of the population may be of interest. Some in Congress and, more generally, in the American public oppose regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. Some legislators have proposed resolutions or bills to curtail executive authority in advance of EPA finalization of rules. Once a rule is finalized, Congress may use the Congressional Review Act (CRA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7801 et seq.) to overturn the rule by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The CRA allows for the use of expedited procedures when considering such a joint resolution, and, if the joint resolution were to be enacted, the rule would no longer have force or effect. However, the resolution of disapproval would require the signature of the President, who would be unlikely to sign a bill overturning his own agency's rule. A two-thirds vote in both House and Senate could overcome a presidential veto. In May 2013, the Administration released an updated range for the \"social costs of carbon\" (SCC)\u2014dollar values representing the benefits of avoiding damages of climate change, expressed as dollars per ton of CO 2 released in particular years. These SCC estimates have been, and will be used, to compare the benefits with the costs of prospective regulations, though cost-benefit analysis has not typically been a determinative factor in regulatory choices. While the interagency group that developed the SCC acknowledged the difficulties of providing such values, the 9 th Circuit Court ruled in 2007 that estimating the benefits of rules without including such values for climate damages is \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Some observers have expressed concern that the new SCC values could be used to justify tighter standards, while others have criticized the methods for understating the SCC. Congress may wish to consider the process by which the SCC have been developed, the role of public and congressional input, and how the SCC may affect future actions. 2. Some in Congress may seek to enact a more cohesive alternative to EPA regulation of GHG emissions and the assortment of Administration measures in the Obama plan. Some policy makers have proposed that fees on GHG emissions (e.g., \"carbon taxes\") would be a preferable alternative, while others oppose this option. The Keystone XL pipeline, to transport Canadian oil sands crude across the U.S. border, requires a Presidential Permit from the President. While many support approval of the pipeline, some environmental proponents have called the project the \"line in the sand\" on climate change and urge the President to deny the permit.
