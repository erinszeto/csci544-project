Native Americans in tribal areas are several times more likely to live in housing that is physically substandard or overcrowded than the U.S. population as a whole. They are also more likely to live in poverty than the general population, further contributing to housing problems. In addition, a number of issues, such as the legal status of tribal land, pose unique barriers to housing for many people living in tribal areas.", "In light of these conditions, and the federal government's trust responsibility to Native American tribes, Congress has provided funding for Native American housing programs for several decades. The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA) reorganized the previous system of housing assistance for Native Americans and replaced it with a single block grant program, the Native American Housing Block Grant (NAHBG). In addition, the law focused on self-determination for tribes, giving tribes broad authority to choose how to use the affordable housing funds they receive under NAHASDA.", "Through the NAHBG, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) distributes formula funding to Native American tribes and Alaska Native villages, or to organizations the tribes have designated to administer the funding (known as tribally designated housing entities (TDHEs)). Tribes and TDHEs, in turn, use the funding for a range of affordable housing activities to benefit low-income tribal households. These activities include developing new housing for rental or homeownership, maintaining or operating existing housing units, providing infrastructure, and offering housing-related services.", "In addition to the NAHBG, NAHASDA also authorizes a loan guarantee program to help tribes obtain private financing for housing activities (the Title VI Loan Guarantee program) and authorizes funding for training and technical assistance. An amendment to NAHASDA in 2000 established the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant (NHHBG) program to provide housing assistance for Native Hawaiians similar to the assistance provided under the NAHBG.", "HUD estimates that about 100,000 housing units have been built, acquired, or rehabilitated since the NAHBG began. The majority of these units have been substantially rehabilitated rather than built or acquired. In general, many tribes choose to use their NAHBG funds to develop more homeownership units than rental units, in part because homeownership units have fewer ongoing costs for tribes. The NHHBG has been used to build, acquire, or rehabilitate nearly 600 homes since the program began, and to provide services or training to another 1,500 households.", "The authorization for NAHASDA programs, other than the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant, expired at the end of FY2013. (The Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program has not been reauthorized since its initial authorization expired at the end of FY2005.)

One reason for this is that a disproportionate number of Native Americans are low-income, making it difficult to afford suitable housing. Additionally, Native Americans who live on reservations or in other tribal areas face housing issues that do not generally apply to the rest of the country, such as the legal status of trust land and the implications that has for mortgage lending.", "Recognizing the singular challenges in providing affordable housing for Native Americans in tribal areas, and the need for such housing, in the 1960s the federal government began to implement specific housing programs for Native Americans that were separate from other affordable housing programs. Questions about whether these programs were meeting their goals, and whether they were running efficiently, persisted for several decades. In 1996, Congress passed the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA). The law reorganized several existing federal housing assistance programs for Native Americans into a single block grant program. In addition to providing funding for affordable housing for Native Americans, the law focused on self-determination for tribes, giving tribes broad authority to choose how to use the affordable housing funds they receive under NAHASDA.", "The block grant program authorized under NAHASDA provides funding to tribes and Alaska Native villages for affordable housing activities that benefit low-income Native Americans living in tribal areas. A separate block grant program, established later by an amendment to NAHASDA, makes funding available for housing for low-income Native Hawaiians who are eligible to live on the Hawaiian Home Lands. NAHASDA also authorizes a loan guarantee program to help tribes and Alaska Native villages access financing for affordable housing activities and authorizes funding for training and technical assistance.", "This report provides some brief background on Native American housing issues and the system of federal housing assistance for Native Americans prior to NAHASDA.

These tribes and Alaska Native villages vary widely in terms of size, population, geography, history, and culture. The size and surroundings of tribes' reservations and other tribal lands are also very different. For example, some reservations are very large while others are quite small\u2014the largest is over 16 million acres, while the smallest reservations encompass fewer than 1,000 acres\u2014and some tribes do not have reservations at all. Many reservations are located in remote rural areas, while some are located closer to urban areas. ", "According to the U.S. Census, more than 5 million individuals identified as American Indian or Alaska Natives (AIAN) in 2010. Of this number, nearly 3 million individuals identified themselves solely as American Indians or Alaska Natives, while an additional 2 million identified as AIAN in combination with another race. Not everyone who identifies as AIAN is a member of a federally recognized tribe or Alaska Native village. Some individuals who identify as AIAN may not be formally enrolled members of any tribe, and some may be enrolled members of state recognized tribes or other tribes not formally recognized by the federal government. Furthermore, many people who identify as AIAN do not live on or near reservations or in other tribal areas. Of those who identified as AIAN alone, about one-third lived in tribal areas (such as on reservations or on off-reservation trust lands) in 2010, according to the Census. ", "This report describes the main federal housing program for members of federally recognized tribes and Alaska Native villages who are living on tribal lands or in nearby areas. Native Americans who do not live in tribal areas are potentially eligible for the same federal housing programs as the rest of the population. Certain issues impact housing and housing programs in tribal areas differently than the rest of the country. The special nature of the relationship between the federal government and federally recognized tribes has implications for Native American housing and housing programs. Furthermore, the restricted legal status of tribal lands has implications for financing housing in these areas. Finally, while economic conditions and the quality of the housing stock vary by tribe, housing conditions in tribal areas generally tend to be worse than in other areas. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Government's Relationship with Tribes", "paragraphs": ["The federal government's relationship with federally recognized tribes is unique in several ways. For one thing, federally recognized tribes are sovereign nations, and the relationship between the federal government and tribes is a government-to-government relationship. Tribes are entitled to govern their own affairs, including deciding tribal membership and leadership, and tribal areas are governed by tribal law. ", "Furthermore, the federal government has a long-standing trust responsibility to members of federally recognized Native American tribes, meaning that it has a responsibility to provide for certain needs of tribes and tribal members. This trust responsibility was first established through treaties between the federal government and individual tribes; under these treaties, tribes generally ceded land to the federal government in exchange for protection and certain annuities, personnel, goods, and services. Over time, the federal government's trust responsibility to tribes has been affirmed through laws, court decisions, and executive orders, and has been the basis for a number of federal programs that provide funds or services specifically to Native American tribal members. ", "At times, the federal government's responsibility to provide certain services to tribes and the tribes' right to govern their own affairs can appear to be in conflict. Tribal leaders have expressed concerns that having federal agencies administer funding that is provided to tribes, and making most of the decisions about how such funding is used, undermines tribal sovereignty and impedes the ability of tribes to develop the capacity and resources needed to administer their own affairs. In light of these concerns, federal policy towards Native Americans began to shift towards the concept of self-determination beginning in the 1970s. ", "Self-determination recognizes the sovereignty of tribes and aims to give tribes authority over their own affairs. In 1975, Congress enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act ( P.L. 93-638 ), providing tribes with the authority to contract to provide services otherwise provided by the federal government and to administer their own education programs. It represented the first major shift towards self-determination in federal programs for Native Americans. Self-determination has continued to be a cornerstone of federal Indian policy since that time, with the government providing funds for many social programs to tribes while allowing tribes greater discretion in how they implement those programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal Status of Tribal Land", "paragraphs": ["The legal status of tribal land poses some distinctive challenges for housing for Native Americans. Most tribal land is held in trust or otherwise restricted in some way. When land is held in trust, it means that the federal government holds the title to the land for the benefit of an individual (\"individual trust land\") or a tribe (\"tribal trust land\"). Both tribal and individual trust lands are subject to restrictions on alienation and encumbrance\u2014that is, trust land generally cannot be transferred, leased, or have a lien or claim placed against it without the approval of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). When land is held in restricted fee status, rather than in trust, an individual or tribe holds the title to the land, but the land still cannot be alienated or encumbered without the BIA's approval. ", "These restrictions on trust and restricted lands raise issues for mortgage lending because the land generally cannot be used as collateral for a mortgage. Banks are usually unwilling to offer mortgage loans (either for households to purchase a home or for developers to build housing) where they will not be able to take title to the land if the borrower does not repay the mortgage as promised. ", "Because of the restrictions on mortgaging trust land, many loans on trust lands involve long-term leases of the land, with the leasehold interest acting as the collateral for the loan since the ownership interest in the land cannot be transferred. For example, an individual might obtain a 50-year leasehold interest in the land, and obtain a mortgage using that leasehold interest and the home as collateral. This has provided a model for lending on lands that have legal restrictions to being mortgaged. However, leases on tribal lands also generally require the BIA's approval. The process of obtaining the BIA's approval to obtain a long-term lease of trust land can make it more complicated and time-consuming to take out a mortgage.", "Another factor that can pose obstacles to mortgage lending is that tribal lands are subject to tribal laws, rather than state or federal laws. This includes laws governing foreclosure and eviction procedures if someone who took out a loan fails to pay it back as promised. This can contribute to banks being unwilling to offer loans on tribal lands, because banks might be uncertain about tribal laws or have concerns that some tribes do not have sufficient foreclosure or eviction laws in place. Together, these factors can limit the availability of private financing in tribal areas, either for individuals to purchase homes or for developers to access capital to increase the supply of housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Conditions in Tribal Areas", "paragraphs": ["Housing conditions on tribal lands vary widely. However, in general, the housing problems of Native Americans living on tribal lands tend to be particularly severe compared to the rest of the country. Historically, Native Americans on tribal lands have been more likely than the general population to live in housing that is overcrowded and/or physically substandard, and this continues to be the case today. ", "Many issues contribute to poor housing conditions in tribal areas. Lack of economic development and economic opportunity contributes to substandard housing. Native Americans living on tribal lands are nearly twice as likely to live in poverty as the general population, making it difficult for many families to afford safe, affordable housing or leading to overcrowding. The issues raised by the legal status of trust land can make it difficult for tribes or individuals to obtain capital to finance affordable housing in tribal areas. Furthermore, the remoteness of some reservations can make it difficult or expensive to obtain building materials or find qualified labor, raising the cost of housing construction. ", "In the years prior to the enactment of NAHASDA, several studies detailed the generally poor condition of housing on tribal lands. In 1989, Congress established the National Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian housing, which released its final report in 1992. It described a persistent need for decent housing on tribal lands and identified barriers to the provision of such housing. In 1996, just before NAHASDA was enacted, the Urban Institute completed a study for HUD on Native American housing needs and the progress of existing housing programs in meeting those needs. It found that 28% of Native Americans on reservations or in other tribal areas were living in housing that lacked plumbing or kitchen facilities or was overcrowded, and that overall about 40% of Native Americans living in tribal areas were experiencing inadequate housing conditions. ", "Since NAHASDA took effect in FY1998, tribes indicate that the law has had a positive impact on their ability to address housing needs in tribal areas. However, poor housing conditions remain much more prevalent in tribal areas than in the country as a whole, and some tribes experience particularly severe conditions. According to an analysis of 2010 Census data by the Housing Assistance Council, a nonprofit organization focused on rural housing issues, 5% of housing units on tribal lands lack complete plumbing facilities, and 5% lack complete kitchen facilities, compared to less than 1% of housing units nationally that lack each of these features. Eight percent of housing units on tribal lands are overcrowded, compared to 3% nationally. Tribal officials, policy makers, and others routinely describe extremely poor housing conditions that many tribes experience. ", "In light of the special trust relationship between the federal government and tribes, the specific issues that affect housing on tribal lands, and the poor housing conditions in these areas, the federal government has established several programs that directly target housing on Native American lands over the last several decades.

The Housing Act of 1949 included a goal of \"a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family.\" However, Native Americans living on reservations or other tribal lands generally had little access to the affordable housing programs established by the federal government until the early 1960s. At that time, the government began to recognize that Native Americans largely lacked access to existing affordable housing programs and took steps to provide affordable housing funding explicitly for Native Americans. ", "In 1961, tribal governments were first recognized as eligible to receive funding under the public housing program, which had been established by the Housing Act of 1937 and was administered at the time by the Public Housing Administration. This recognition allowed tribes to establish Indian housing authorities (IHAs), similar to local public housing authorities (PHAs), to administer federal housing assistance programs authorized under the 1937 law. In 1962, the Public Housing Administration established the Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity Program to provide funds to IHAs to help Native Americans achieve home ownership through a lease-purchase program. Both the public housing program and the Mutual Help program were administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) after that department was established in 1965, and these two programs provided the bulk of housing assistance to Native Americans until NAHASDA reorganized the federal government's Native American housing programs into today's block grant system. ", "Also in 1965, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) within the Department of the Interior established the Housing Improvement Program (HIP). Through HIP, the BIA provides grants to assist the least well-off Native Americans with repairing severely inadequate housing. The BIA was authorized to establish various assistance programs for Native Americans by the Snyder Act of 1921. However, while it used this authority to establish other types of programs for Native Americans, it did not create a specific housing program for Native Americans until it created HIP.", "In the mid-1970s, the government began to recognize that simply extending existing programs to tribal areas was not always effective, given some of the unique circumstances related to housing on tribal lands. Despite the availability of a number of affordable housing programs in tribal areas, poor housing conditions in tribal areas persisted. In 1978, a report from the General Accounting Office (GAO) noted that, despite the fact that HUD, BIA, and the Farmers Home Administration administered several programs that could help provide affordable housing for Native Americans, these programs had \"not been effective in providing the number of units necessary to keep pace with the increasing need for decent, safe, and sanitary Indian housing.\" The report noted that HUD's programs were generally designed for more urban areas, and tended to be less effective on reservations located in more rural areas. ", "Federal agencies began to make efforts to make housing programs more targeted to the specific circumstances of Native Americans living in tribal areas. Around this time, HUD created a separate Office of Indian Housing to administer the agency's Native American housing programs, which were previously operated as part of the public housing program. In 1976, regulations governing Native American housing assistance were published separately from the public housing regulations.", "Federal efforts to improve housing conditions in tribal areas continued during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1983, Congress authorized a program to allow the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to insure home mortgages made on tribal lands. This program was intended to address issues related to the lack of availability of mortgage credit on tribal lands and to encourage lenders to offer mortgages in these areas. In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Housing Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-358 ), which separated Native American housing assistance from the existing public housing program in law and specified that future amendments to the public housing program would not apply to the Native American program (although existing requirements of the public housing program did continue to apply). The law also codified the Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunity Program. In 1992, Congress authorized another loan guarantee program, the Section 184 program, to encourage mortgage lending on tribal lands by allowing HUD to guarantee certain home mortgages in tribal areas. ", "By the early 1990s, tribes were eligible to receive funding through at least 14 HUD programs, each of which had its own eligibility criteria and program requirements. These included programs specifically for tribes, such as Mutual Help, the Indian public housing program, and programs to provide loan guarantees on tribal lands such as the Section 184 program. It also included other, broader HUD programs for which tribes were eligible to receive funds, often through a set-aside of funding from the larger program. However, taken together, these programs were generally seen as inadequate to address the persistent housing needs and unique circumstances of Native Americans living on tribal lands.

It also eliminated tribes' ability to directly receive funds through the HOME Investment Partnerships Program block grant, homelessness assistance programs, and the Youthbuild program (which has since been transferred from HUD to the Department of Labor).

Housing Management Services : Funds can be used for services related to the management of affordable housing, such as processing loans, performing inspections, selecting tenants, and providing maintenance or operating assistance for housing that was developed using NAHBG funds. Crime Prevention and Safety : Funds can be used for safety, security, and law enforcement activities related to protecting residents of affordable housing. Model Activities : Funds can be used for model programs that are consistent with the purposes of NAHASDA and are approved by the Secretary of HUD.", "The regulations limit the amount of funds that can be used for administrative expenses to 20% of the annual grant amount.

This means that there are fewer grants made than formula allocations, and the average grant amount is generally higher than the average formula allocation. Another reason that the number of grants might differ from the number of formula allocations is that some tribes that are eligible for formula allocations may not receive a grant in a given year. This could occur because a tribe has elected not to take its formula allocation, because it did not submit an Indian Housing Plan or that plan was not approved by HUD, or for other reasons.

The Title VI program is an example of leveraging, because it allows tribes to use their NAHBG funds to help them obtain additional financing from private sources. Leveraging of HUD funding was allowed prior to NAHASDA, but was not common, and some tribes have identified the ability to leverage funds as a major benefit of NAHASDA.

For example, a tribe that receives an allocation of $50,000 is unlikely to be able to construct or acquire new housing units with its NAHBG funding alone, and may have to focus on other, lower-cost affordable housing activities unless it is able to combine its NAHBG funding with funding from other sources. However, smaller tribes might be less likely than larger tribes to have the capacity to seek out or administer funding from additional sources.", "Other sources of funds available to tribes can include other federal programs, as well as state, local, tribal, or private funds. Some examples of other federal sources of funding for housing might include other HUD programs, the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) administered by the Department of the Treasury, or housing programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Other tribes, however, argue that Census data may not be representative of the population that NAHASDA is meant to serve.", "NAHASDA provides funds to tribes to provide affordable housing to people who are members of federally recognized (or a small number of state recognized) tribes and are living in a tribe's formula area. However, the Census counts include anyone who identifies as American Indian or Alaska Native, whether or not they are enrolled members of such a tribe. Some of the people who identify as AIAN in the Census might not be enrolled tribal members at all, or they might be members of tribes that are not eligible under NAHASDA (such as state recognized tribes, or Canadian or South American tribes). Therefore, some tribes have argued that Census data do not provide an accurate count of the tribal population, as opposed to the overall AIAN population, and have suggested that tribes should have the option of using alternative data sources that better reflect the population that NAHASDA is intended to serve.

However, many tribes disagreed with both this decision itself and with HUD's decision to use the multi-race data without consulting tribes through negotiated rulemaking or a notice and comment period. Since FY2006, annual appropriations acts have directed HUD to calculate the formula both ways for each tribe\u2014that is, using the single-race data and the multi-race data\u2014and to award each tribe the larger of the two grant amounts.
