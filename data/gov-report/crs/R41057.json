Historically, one of the justifications presented for funding the SBA's loan guarantee programs has been that small businesses can be at a disadvantage, compared with other businesses, when trying to obtain access to sufficient capital and credit. It has been argued that this disadvantage is particularly acute for startups and microbusinesses (firms with fewer than five employees):", "Traditional lending institutions, such as banks and investors, are unlikely to offer loans and investment capital to microfirms due to a variety of reasons. One barrier to microlending is a concern that startups and smaller enterprises are risky investments since growing businesses typically exhibit erratic bursts of growth and downturn. The perceived risk of these types of companies reduces the chances of a microbusiness to obtain financing. Another issue is that microbusinesses by and large require smaller amounts of capital, and thus banks or investment companies often believe that it is not efficient use of their time or resources, nor will they receive a substantive return on investment from such a small loan amount. ", "An Urban Institute survey of SBA 7(a), 504/Certified Development Company (504/CDC), Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), and Microloan borrowers conducted in 2007 found that Microloan borrowers reported having the most difficulty in finding acceptable financing elsewhere. Less than one-third (31%) of Microloan borrowers reported that they would have been able to find acceptable financing elsewhere, compared with 35% of SBIC borrowers, 40% of 7(a) borrowers, and 48% of 504/CDC borrowers.", "Since its inception in 1953, the SBA has provided loan guarantees to encourage lenders to issue small businesses loans. Interest in creating a separate loan program to address the specific needs of startups and microbusinesses increased during the 1980s, primarily due to the growth and experience of microlending institutions abroad and evidence concerning private lending practices that led Congress to conclude that a new loan program was necessary \"to reach very small businesses that were not being served by traditional lenders of SBA's credit programs.\"", "To address the perceived disadvantages faced by very small businesses in gaining access to capital, Congress authorized the SBA's Microloan lending program in 1991 ( P.L. 102-140 , the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992). The program became operational in 1992. Its stated purpose is", "to assist women, low-income, veteran ... and minority entrepreneurs and business owners and other individuals possessing the capability to operate successful business concerns; to assist small business concerns in those areas suffering from a lack of credit due to economic downturns; ... to make loans to eligible intermediaries to enable such intermediaries to provide small-scale loans, particularly loans in amounts averaging not more than $10,000, to start-up, newly established, or growing small business concerns for working capital or the acquisition of materials, supplies, or equipment; [and] to make grants to eligible intermediaries that, together with non-Federal matching funds, will enable such intermediaries to provide intensive marketing, management, and technical assistance to microloan borrowers. ", "The SBA's Microloan lending program was authorized initially as a five-year demonstration project. It was made permanent, subject to reauthorization, in 1997 ( P.L. 105-135 , the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997).", "Congressional interest in the Microloan program has increased in recent years, primarily because microloans are viewed as a means to assist very small businesses, especially women- and minority-owned startups, obtain loans that enable them to create jobs.

Bush cited the program's higher expense when he recommended in his FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007 budget requests to Congress that the program be terminated and when he recommended in his FY2008 and FY2009 budget requests to Congress that the interest rate charged to Microloan intermediaries be increased to make the program \"self-financing.\"", "Advocates argue that the program's higher cost per small business assisted is unavoidable given the relatively unique nature of the program and the special needs of its borrowers. They assert that intermediaries often have to spend a significant amount of time with Microloan borrowers because those borrowers tend to have less experience with the credit application process and a more difficult time documenting their qualifications for assistance than borrowers in the SBA's loan guaranty programs. Also, in their view, raising the interest rate charged to intermediaries to make the program self-financing would reduce the program's cost, but could also defeat the program's purpose. They assert that because microloans are small, it is difficult for intermediaries to generate enough interest income to cover their costs. As a result, if the interest rate charged to intermediaries is increased, they contend that intermediaries would have to pass the increase on to Microloan borrowers. In their view, increasing the program's cost to Microloan borrowers \"will create an economic hardship for them and make it more difficult for them to grow their businesses\" and \"lead to fewer jobs created and fewer tax dollars paid.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Administration", "paragraphs": ["On September 28, 2017, the SBA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) released an audit of the SBA's administration of the Microloan program, following up on an earlier audit released on December 28, 2009.

This review process did not allow the SBA to analyze the sources and uses of funds \"which is necessary to detect inappropriate fund transfers between the intermediaries' [Microloan Revolving Funds and Loan Loss Reserve Funds] accounts.\" onsite reviews were conducted only when an intermediary defaulted on its SBA loan. the program was inadequately staffed, operating at that time \"with 6 analysts who oversee more than 160 intermediaries, 460 intermediary loans, and approximately 2,500 microloans per year.\" the reported Microloan borrower default rate of 12% \"appeared low given the high-risk nature of the program.\" the audit identified duplicate loan reporting and 92 Microloan borrowers with outstanding microloan balances exceeding the then-$35,000 limit. the SBA's output performance metrics \"do not ensure the ultimate program beneficiaries, the microloan borrowers, are truly assisted by the program\" and \"without appropriate [outcome performance] metrics, SBA cannot ensure the Microloan program is meeting policy goals.\" The OIG recommended that the SBA \"develop additional performance metrics to measure the program's achievement in assisting microloan borrowers in establishing and maintaining successful small businesses.\"", "In its 2017 audit, the OIG found that the SBA had taken several actions (see footnote below) to improve its oversight of the Microloan program since the 2009 audit but that the agency still had \"internal control weaknesses\" that prevented it from conducting \"adequate program oversight to measure program performance and ensure program integrity.\" ", "Specifically, the OIG audited 14 intermediary lenders and 52 microloan files and found documentation deficiencies, or differences between the information contained in the lender's loan file versus that in the SBA Microloan Program Electronic Reporting System (MPERS) in 44 of the 52 files. The OIG also argued that the audit revealed that inadequate documentation exists to show that the \"no credit elsewhere\" test had been properly administered; that, in some cases, inadequate supporting documentation existed to show how the microloan funds were used by the borrower; and that, in some cases, interest rates and fees were charged that exceeded the limits allowed under the program rules and regulations.", "The identified internal control weaknesses ", "were due to the SBA not having an overall site visit plan, an adequate information system, available funding for system improvements, or clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

As a general proposition, some, including President Obama, argued that economic conditions made it imperative that the SBA be provided additional resources to assist small businesses in acquiring capital necessary to start, continue, or expand operations and create jobs. Others worried about the long-term adverse economic effects of spending programs that increase the federal deficit. They advocated business tax reduction, reform of financial credit market regulation, and federal fiscal restraint as the best means to assist small business economic growth and job creation.", "In terms of specific program changes, the provisions enacted in P.L. 111-240 (allowing the SBA to temporarily waive the Microloan program's nonfederal share matching requirements, increasing the loan limit for borrowers from $35,000 to $50,000, and increasing the loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $3.5 million to $5 million), P.L. 115-141 (relaxing restraints on the use of technical assistance grants), and P.L. 115-232 (increasing the loan limit for intermediaries after their first year of participation in the program from $5 million to $6 million) are all designed to achieve the same goal: create jobs by enhancing micro borrowers' access to capital and technical training assistance.", "Determining how specific changes in federal policy are most likely to lead to job creation is a challenging question. For example, a 2008 Urban Institute study concluded that differences in the term, interest rate, and amount of SBA financing \"was not significantly associated with increasing sales or employment among firms receiving SBA financing.\" However, they also reported that their analysis accounted for less than 10% of the variation in firm performance. The Urban Institute suggested that local economic conditions, local zoning regulations, state and local tax rates, state and local business assistance programs, and the business owner's charisma or business acumen also \"may play a role in determining how well a business performs after receipt of SBA financing.\"", "As the Urban Institute study suggests, given the many factors that influence business success, measuring the SBA's Microloan program's effect on job retention and creation is complicated. That task is made even more challenging by the absence of performance-oriented measures that could serve as a guide.", "The SBA's Office of Inspector General has recommended that the SBA adopt performance-oriented measures, specifically recommending that the SBA track the number of Microloan borrowers who remain in business after receiving a microloan to measure the extent to which the Microloan program contributed to their ability to stay in business. It has also recommended that the SBA require intermediaries to report the technical assistance provided to each Microloan borrower and \"use this data to analyze the effect technical assistance may have on the success of Microloan borrowers and their ability to repay microloans.\" Other performance-oriented measures that Congress might also consider include requiring the SBA to survey Microloan borrowers to measure the difficulty they experienced in obtaining a loan from the private sector; the ease or difficulty of finding, applying, and obtaining a microloan from an intermediary; and the extent to which the microloan or technical assistance received contributed to their ability to create jobs or expand their scope of operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
