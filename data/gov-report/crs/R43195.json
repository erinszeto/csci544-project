Ambassador Christopher Stevens was the first sitting U.S. ambassador to have been killed since 1979. Moreover, a concern exists that the attack may reflect a growing danger to U.S. diplomatic facilities\u2014the result of an increasingly diffuse threat from extremists across the Middle East and of Arab revolutions that have decreased the capacity, and perhaps the will, of local governments to protect U.S. interests. Congressional and State Department actions will be critical to responding to this evolving threat and to preventing similar tragedies in the future. ", "Congress has legislated extensive changes to the U.S. approach to securing facilities and personnel in at least two previous instances of attacks on U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad. The 1983-1984 bombings of U.S. facilities in Beirut, Lebanon, led to the adoption of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, which, among other measures, established the State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Similarly, the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania led to, among other measures, a significant construction funding program under the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 (SECCA).", "After the Benghazi attack, Congress initiated oversight through investigations by several committees and through a number of hearings featuring testimony from officials ranging from the working level to the Secretary of State. Members have also put forward a number of legislative proposals on issues ranging from the composition of Accountability Review Boards to procedures for awarding contracts for local security guards. Two of these measures have been considered and approved by committees.

The Benghazi attack prompted the State Department to take several actions. In the immediate aftermath, the department ordered all posts to review their security posture and to take all necessary steps to enhance it if necessary. Shortly thereafter, five Interagency Security Assessment Teams (ISATs) were deployed to 19 posts in 13 countries to undertake urgent reviews of high-threat posts. ", "In order to ensure consistent focus on the most endangered locations, State also reorganized its Diplomatic Security Bureau by establishing a new Deputy Assistant Secretary for High Threat Posts to oversee security arrangements for a number of so-designated countries. While press reports initially suggested the department had designated 17 High Threat Posts, State officials have suggested that this number is not static and that it would be reconsidered annually, at a minimum.

The board concluded that, while responsibility for the attack rests solely and completely with the terrorists who perpetrated it, systemic failures in Washington led to key decisions that left the Special Mission in Benghazi with significant security shortfalls. Key leadership failures in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) as well as in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs (NEA) led to confusion over decision-making in relation to security and policy in Benghazi; these were likely factors in the insufficient priority given to the Benghazi mission's security-related requests, according to the board. Still, these leadership failures did not amount to a clear breach of duty by any single U.S. government employee, the board found. ", "The board also determined that decisions by the department's senior leadership regarding the nature and extension of Special Mission Benghazi's unclear status left it outside normal procedures for funding and executing security measures, including office facility standards and accountability measures under the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 and the Overseas Security Policy Board (OSPB).

The department formed a task force to implement the board's 29 recommendations, as they were translated into 64 specific action items assigned to bureaus for implementation.", "In reviewing failures of leadership and management, the department removed four of its employees from the positions they held at the time of the attack. The officials removed from their positions include three officials from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and one from the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. The four State Department employees, who had been on administrative leave, were returned to duty on August 20 and reassigned to other positions within the department. Prior to the officials' reinstatement, a number of Members of Congress had sought clarification on their administrative status, in order to assess whether the department had held the appropriate officials to account in a full and fair manner. In addition, while the ARB fixed responsibility for these failures at the level of Assistant Secretary and below, some congressional observers have suggested that more senior department officials should have been held more fully to account. ", "By January 2013, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reported to Congress that, of the ARB's recommendations, \"more than 80 percent are on track to be completed by the end of March, with a number completed already.\" Later, Secretary of State John Kerry also stated that he is \"committed to implementing every single one of the recommendations in the report of the Accountability Review Board and doing more.\"", "The department described its progress in implementing the ARB's recommendations in a fact sheet first released on May 20, 2013. The fact sheet has been updated repeatedly; the text of the most recent publicly released update is included is available as Appendix A . The document states that the department had addressed or was addressing all 24 unclassified recommendations. It also indicates that 113 new diplomatic security personnel (including 75 DS agents) had been hired by the Department of State in FY2013, with the remaining 38 expected to be hired in FY2014. On December 10, 2014, Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security Greg Starr testified that the Department had closed 25 of the 29 ARB recommendations.", "State has also sought to improve its ability to weigh the balance between risk and reward in high-threat, high-risk areas when beginning, restarting, continuing, modifying, or discontinuing operations at individual posts. The department established a Vital Presence Validation Process, which State officials suggest will offer a \"transparent and repeatable process\" providing a \"documented, systematic, risk-based analysis\" to guide decisions on overseas presence. The Department has begun using this process, for example in its decision to return a U.S. diplomatic presence to Bangui, Central African Republic, suspended from December 2012 to September 2014. According to Assistant Secretary Starr, the department \"engaged in an analysis that determined that we should and could go back.... We worked with our colleagues at the Department of Defense to assess the security situation on the ground and develop a comprehensive plan for our return.... While we must closely monitor conditions on the ground, our return to Bangui demonstrates that our enhanced risk management procedures are working.\"", "In accordance with the Benghazi ARB's fourth recommendation, the department convened a panel of external security experts in April 2013 to identify best practices from other agencies and countries. The so-called Best Practices Panel , chaired by former Director of U.S. Secret Service Mark Sullivan, provided its report to the department on August 29, 2013. The report was released publicly by the department nearly one year later, on August 1, 2014, along with a fact sheet describing the department's implementation of the panel's recommendations. The panel observed that many security-related decisions were in the hands of the Department of State's Under Secretary for Management, a position overseeing what the panel viewed as a too-large number of support functions, creating what it deemed a \"span of control\" problem. Accordingly, the panel's chief recommendation was the elevation of the diplomatic security function through the creation of an Under Secretary for Diplomatic Security, which would focus all security issues through a single focal point at the senior executive level. ", "While State accepted 38 of the recommendations from the panel and has reportedly implemented 30 of them fully, the department determined that establishing an Under Secretary for Diplomatic Security would be counter-productive. It asserted that such a move would deepen the \"stove-piping\" that the ARB and other observers lamented in the wake of the Benghazi attacks, and reinforce the perception that Diplomatic Security has full and sole responsibility for security, rather than ensuring that all parts of the department share this priority. Instead, Secretary of State Kerry has instituted a practice whereby the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security has direct access to the Secretary of State to share security concerns \"as threats and circumstances require.\" In addition, the department did not accept the panel's proposal that waivers to established security standards only be provided subsequent to the implementation of mitigating measures, arguing that in time-sensitive situations, exceptions might be appropriate when some mitigating measures are in place and others may be planned for the future. ", "An additional panel of outside experts was charged by the department with a thorough \"review [of] DS's organization and management structure.\" This panel, chaired by former Under Secretary of State for Management Grant Green, reportedly delivered its \"Report on Diplomatic Security Organization and Management\" to the Under Secretary of State for Management in May 2013. The report has not been made public by the Department, but the department's September 2014 fact sheet in Appendix A asserts that 30 of the 35 recommendations made by the report's authors were accepted by State. According to GAO, State has made organizational changes in response to the report, including the raising of three DS Assistant Director positions to Deputy Assistant Secretary positions. However, the department declined proposals to establish a Chief of Staff position in the DS Bureau and to restructure responsibilities for the new High Threat Programs Directorate, and deferred consideration of two recommendations regarding Bureau of Intelligence and Research activities until the bureau's vacant leadership slot is filled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Requests", "paragraphs": ["The ARB report and other post-Benghazi assessments impacted the Department of State's funding requests for security for FY2013, FY2014, and FY2015. As part of what it termed an Increased Security Proposal (ISP), State in December 2012 submitted a revised FY2013 budget request to Congress outlining resource shifts totaling approximately $1.419 billion, primarily a reallocation of unobligated funds originally intended for programs in Iraq. The request sought $553 million for 35 new detachments of Marine Security Guards (roughly 225 Marines) to medium- and high-threat posts to serve as visible deterrents to hostile acts; $130 million to increase the size of the Diplomatic Security workforce by 155 DS personnel, mostly focused on medium- and high-threat posts; and $736 million to fund facility security upgrades and construction of new embassy compounds. ", "The Administration's FY2014 budget request sought to sustain the initiatives launched under the FY2013 Increased Security Proposal, including expansion of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and further growth in the number of Marine Security Guard detachments deployed to diplomatic facilities. The request for Worldwide Security Upgrades funding (for bricks and mortar security needs, including construction of secure new embassy compounds) was 108% higher than FY2012 funding. Requested Worldwide Security Protection funds (for security programs including a worldwide guard force) were 37% larger than FY21012 levels. President Obama issued a statement on May 16, 2013, calling on Congress to \"fully fund Embassy security\" and support implementation of the ARB recommendations. ", "In its FY2015 budget, the Administration sought funding to continue to implement the initiatives launched under the Increased Security Proposal and meet the post-Benghazi Accountability Review Board's recommendations. The request included approximately $3.1 billion in Worldwide Security Protection (WSP) funds, to provide security personnel with technical tools and training; and approximately $1.5 billion in Worldwide Security Upgrades (WSU) funds to upgrade and maintain safe, secure diplomatic facilities. The request also featured $44 million to fund recurring costs for the 151 additional Diplomatic Security personnel the Department of State sought to hire after the Benghazi attacks. ", "Among its funding-related prescriptions, the ARB recommended that \"the State Department must work with Congress to restore the Capital Security Cost Sharing (CSCS) Program at its full capacity, adjusted for inflation to approximately $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2015, including an up to ten-year program addressing that need, prioritized for construction of new facilities in high risk, high threat areas.\" The Capital Security Cost Sharing Program requires all U.S. agencies with presence at diplomatic facilities abroad (including the State Department) to pay a share toward the cost of those facilities. The size of each agency's required contribution is directly linked with the number of positions it authorizes overseas. Within the FY2015 request for Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) funding was $986.5 million to provide for State's share of CSCS program. The amount requested was down from the $1.4 billion appropriated for this purpose for FY2014, a result of higher assessed contributions from other agencies into the common account. Department officials underlined that the CSCS request meets the full $2.2 billion level called for by the post-Benghazi ARB.

Their report found that the Department of State did not take sufficiently into account clear evidence of a worsening security situation in Benghazi and requests for additional support from U.S. personnel posted there. This situation was compounded by the evident inability of the Libyan government to perform its duty to protect U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel. In this context, the department should have increased protective measures or withdrawn the U.S. presence there, even without specific intelligence about an imminent attack, the report concludes. The Senate report's recommendations included additional interagency joint assessments of the security requirements of high-risk U.S. diplomatic facilities; a funding process delivering sufficient, steady, and timely funding to secure diplomatic facilities and personnel worldwide; additional Department of Defense (DOD) assets and personnel devoted to the African continent; and clear and consistent communication by Administration officials about terrorist attacks.

Among the report's preliminary findings were that the senior leadership of the Department of State approved security reductions at the Benghazi diplomatic facilities prior to the 9/11/12 attack, and that the public presentation of the attack by the Administration was deliberately inaccurate in order to protect State Department interests. The report related the chairmen's view that continued examination and oversight by their respective committees of the Benghazi attack, and the Administration's response to it, remained necessary. ", "A third report, released by House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa on September 16, 2013, focused exclusively on the conclusions of the State Department Accountability Review Board (ARB).

The report concluded that the attacks were likely preventable, based on known security shortfalls at the State Department facility in Benghazi, and based on extensive intelligence reporting on terrorist activity in Libya. The report included 14 findings, ranging from the alarming pre-attack strategic intelligence picture, to the absence of U.S. military assets positioned to intervene rapidly; and 18 recommendations on issues including security standards, intelligence capabilities and processes, the use of local security guards, and the need to bring the attackers to justice, among others.

The report, Benghazi: Where is the State Department Accountability? , included a number of key findings. Among them: extensive threat reporting regarding Benghazi was well understood before the attack by senior officials in Washington, including then-Secretary Clinton; officials in Washington denied requests for additional security from personnel in Libya; the Accountability Review Board on the Benghazi attack was \"seriously deficient in several respects, most notably in its failure to review or comment on the actions of the Department's most senior officials, including Secretary Clinton herself\"; and the disciplinary actions affecting the four officials cited by the ARB did not comprise appropriate accountability. According to the report's key findings, the \"talking points\" controversy in the wake of the attack \"revealed a Department leadership more interested in protecting its reputation than establishing facts and accountability.\" Finally, the report found that the fact that there had not been a permanent State Department Inspector General for a number of years at the time of the attack contributed to the absence of a culture of accountability at the department. The report called for the Administration to \"recognize the failures of senior officials and hold them accountable.\" ", "The majority Members of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations released a sixth report, focused on the Defense Department (DOD) actions relating to the Benghazi attack, on February 10, 2014. Among the six key findings included in the report were military posture assessments prior to the 2012 anniversary of the 9/11/01 attacks did not adequately take into account the Libyan security situation; vulnerabilities in Benghazi resulted from an unchanged military force posture, no warnings of an imminent threat, and a reduction in DOD personnel in Libya favored by the Department of State; DOD officials rapidly assessed that the Benghazi events were a terrorist attack, and \"the President subsequently permitted the military to respond with minimal direction\"; the location of Benghazi, the posture of U.S. forces, and lack of clarity about events on the ground \"severely degraded\" the U.S. military's response to the attack, and military commanders \"did not take all possible steps to prepare for a more extended operation.\" The report also found that U.S. military personnel in Tripoli at the time of the attack were not told to \"stand down,\" but rather ordered into an alternative warfighting posture; still, the report suggests, the roles and responsibilities of these forces were insufficiently well understood in DOD's post-attack reviews. Finally, according to the report's findings, DOD was undertaking measures to remedy problems exposed by the Benghazi attack; however, these efforts were confronted with shrinking resources allocated to the U.S. military and a deteriorating global security environment.

The committee concluded that the CIA provided sufficient security for CIA facilities in Benghazi and provided significant assistance to the State Department on the night of the attacks. It found no evidence of a denial of military or other support to those under attack from what the committee describes as a mixed group of individuals, including those affiliated with al-Qa'ida. The committee also found that there was no intelligence failure prior to the attacks, in that there was no specific, tactical warning regarding the September 11 attacks. After the attacks, the early intelligence assessments and the Administrations' public narrative on the causes and motivations for the attack were not fully accurate, according to the committee, and the process used to generate talking points about the attack was flawed.

This process enables us to make systematic, clear-eyed assessments about whether and how the United States should operate in dangerous overseas locations where U.S. interests are at stake. We have created a \"Security Accountability Framework\" that clearly defines key actors, their roles and responsibilities, and governance mechanisms. This framework provides an essential foundation for implementing our new risk management methodologies. We created a Deputy Assistant Secretary for High Threat Programs in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), who is responsible for ensuring that high-threat posts receive the focused attention they need.
