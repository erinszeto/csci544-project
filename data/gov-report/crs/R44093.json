Depending on the data source, irrigated agriculture accounts for roughly 40% to 80% of total water supplies. Such discrepancies are largely based on different survey methods and assumptions, including the baseline amount of water estimated for use (e.g., what constitutes \"available\" supplies). Two primary data sources are the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). USGS estimates water use for agricultural irrigation in California at 25.8 million acre-feet (MAF), accounting for 61% of USGS's estimates of total withdrawals. DWR estimates water use withdrawals for agricultural irrigation at 33 MAF, or about 41% of total use. Both of these estimates are based on available data for 2010. These estimates differ from other widely cited estimates indicating that agricultural use accounts for 80% of California's available water supplies, as reported in media and news reports.", "Attention has also focused on trends in California toward growing more permanent orchard crops, such as fruit and nut trees and vineyard crops, as well as production of grain and pasture crops, much of which is used to support the state's meat and dairy industries. Orchard crops refer to tree or vineyard crops that are planted once, require continuous watering to reach maturation, and cannot be fallowed during dry years without loss of investment. In contrast, most vegetables and other row crops (including grain and pasture crops) are annual crops that are sown and harvested during the same production year, sometimes more than once, and may be fallowed in dry years. Between 2004 and 2013, overall harvested acres in California increased for almonds, walnuts, pistachios, raisins, grapes, berries, cherries, pomegranates, and olives, but also for corn. During the same period, overall harvested acreage decreased for some field crops (cotton, alfalfa, rice, wheat), but also for certain orchard crops (wine grapes and some citrus and tree fruits). This shift to growing more permanent crops, especially tree nuts, appears to be largely market-driven.", "The availability of irrigation water has been a major factor in the development of California's agricultural production. California has the largest number of irrigated farmed acres compared to other states and accounts for about one-fourth of total applied acre-feet of irrigated water in the United States. Water use per acre in California is also high compared to other states. Available data for 2013 indicate that, of total irrigated acres harvested in California, about 31% of irrigated acres were land in orchards and 18% were land in vegetables. Another 46% of irrigated acres harvested were land in alfalfa, hay, pastureland, rice, corn, and cotton.", "Congressional interest in California agriculture and water use centers largely on the Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project (CVP), which supplies water to numerous agricultural and municipal contractors. In recent years, the CVP has cut back water deliveries due to drought and environmental factors.

This attention has been twofold. First, media reports have highlighted how much water is used overall by California's agricultural sectors. Second, media reports have highlighted how much water is used to grow certain types of crops. Most media attention has focused on certain orchard crops, such as tree nuts and vineyard crops, as well as some grain and pasture crops used to support California's meat and dairy industries. These reports frequently conflict with primary data sources, resulting in confusion over the state of agricultural production and irrigated water use in the California. ", "Regarding overall water use for California's agricultural production, media reports have widely cited estimates claiming that 80% of the state's available water supplies are used annually for agricultural use. Federal and state sources indicate that the state's agricultural sector uses less available water than many media reports claim. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) indicates that roughly 60% is used for the state's agricultural sectors; the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) indicates roughly 40%. The difference between these two estimates is largely based on different survey methods and assumptions, including the baseline amount of water estimated for use, including what constitutes \"available\" supplies. Some reports, including information posted by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), have tried to clarify and highlight differences between various water use estimates. ", "Regarding water used to produce specific crops, news outlets across the country have, on numerous occasions, reported estimates of the amount of water California farmers use to produce a single serving of certain foods. For example, according to these reports, it takes nearly one gallon of water to produce one almond and 450 gallons of water to produce a quarter-pound hamburger patty. Such statistics can be misleading and further raise questions about the usefulness of quantifying the inputs and resources required to produce a single serving of a specific crop or a single serving of meat or dairy products. Most fruit and nut trees require water year-round and often take several years before the plant reaches fruiting maturity. At maturity, a fruit orchard can produce food capable of feeding many people. Other crops\u2014such as feed grains and pasture crops\u2014are grown, in some cases, mainly to feed livestock, poultry, and dairy cows. The cumulative amount of resources and inputs needed to raise a single farm animal to maturity adds up quickly. Growing consumer and market demand for these food commodities is also a major factor in their production. Moreover, some agricultural products are grown in areas where water is more accessible. Also, not all of the water used by the agriculture sector is captured by the plant; some is returned to the soil or atmosphere.

Some producers may switch to relatively less water-intensive crops, particularly when water supplies are more scarce (such as growing forage and oilseed crops, which tend to have relatively lower per-unit water costs and usage requirements). Where crop water demands are similar, and all other factors being equal, producers may invest in higher-value crops, such as fruits, nuts, and vegetables.", "Overall, while total crop acreage throughout California remained more or less constant at roughly 8 million acres in production, the volume of total crop production rose from nearly 33 million in 1960 to more than 73 million tons of product in 2009 ( Table 2 ).

However, between 1991 and 2010, adoption of drip and microsprinkler irrigation systems more than doubled and accounted for 39% of all irrigated acres in 2010. This shift to more efficient irrigation methods may in part be attributable to a reduction in irrigation water supplies in response to periodic drought conditions and other water supply constraints, as well as reduced costs and available federal assistance for adopting improved technologies.

The type of irrigation system adopted can depend on financing available to update a farm's irrigation system but may also depend on site-specific conditions at the farm, including soil type and topography, as well as the type of crop grown. Sprinkler systems may be suitable for sandy light soils where there is rapid percolation; some systems are not suitable if the slope of the land exceeds 5%-10% or in areas with high saline soils, such as in some areas on the westside of the San Joaquin Valley. Economic factors such as market demand for high-value crops or the ability to sell or lease surplus water may also influence investment in more efficient irrigation technology.", " Figure 12 shows differences among hydrologic regions in terms of irrigation methods used and trends in methods used from 1991 to 2011.", "Cost is often the main limiting factor for more widespread adoption of drip irrigation systems. Media reports cite estimates that a permanent drip irrigation system can cost $1,000 to $3,000 per acre, not including installation; maintenance and/or repair costs can add another $100 to $300 an acre per year. Actual costs will depend on the type of crop grown.

Others object to the study's assumptions that producers will shift away from growing certain crops, claiming they ignores market demand, which influences what farmers grow, among other types of methodological concerns. Others also object to claims that agricultural productivity will not be affected by irrigation reductions, pointing out numerous studies over the years estimating significant economic losses to the state's agricultural sectors as a result of ongoing drought conditions. The most recent estimates by researchers at UC-Davis project the total direct economic costs of the drought to the agricultural sectors will total $1.8 billion in 2015, or about 4% of the state's 2012 agricultural gross cash receipts, covering estimated revenue losses to crop, dairy, and livestock producers, as well as additional water pumping costs. The debate about water savings from improved irrigation efficiency further raises the question about what is the net outcome of such efficiency gains in the farming sectors: namely, will water use reductions through the adoption of more efficient irrigation systems result in overall water savings, or will these reductions be used to support additional expansion in agricultural production?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["California's agricultural industry is an important part of the state's economy and a significant contributor to the nation's food supply for certain crops such as fruits, vegetables and tree nuts.
