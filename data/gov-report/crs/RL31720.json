World and domestic demand for oil remained strong, and other factors have placed pressure on gasoline prices and deliverability in the United States.", "In the face of these developments, and because the prospect that this episode of elevated prices is likely to be a long one, interest in energy policy remains high in the 110th Congress. When the United States experiences a period marked by sharp increases in the price for energy and concern about the adequacy of essential supplies, there is widespread concern that the nation has no energy policy. The nation has, in fact, adopted several distinct policy approaches over the years, and many of the debates have been about determining the appropriate extent of the federal government's role in energy.", "There were episodes from 1973-2003 when oil prices spiked, but these were generally for comparatively brief periods; overall, the period was one of general price and supply stability. It isn't so much that energy policy failed to be adequately responsive to past crises; rather, during lengthy periods of stability and declining prices for conventional fuels, it has proven difficult to sustain certain policy courses that might help shield the nation from occasional episodes of instability. Because prices are now expected by some analysts to remain high, the prospect for certain longer-range energy policies may now be more favorable. Traditionally, the energy debate has been most vigorous over the balance to be struck between increasing supply and encouraging conservation.

Successive hurricanes, Katrina and Rita, in late August and late September 2005, brought about the shutdown of more than 5 million barrels per day of refining capacity in Texas and Louisiana and initially shut down the 25% of U.S. crude oil production and 20% of U.S. natural gas production that comes from the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. World and domestic demand for oil has remained strong, taking up most of the world's spare production capacity. The phaseout of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and a renewable fuels mandate in EPACT have placed additional pressure on gasoline price and deliverability in the United States. In the summer of 2006, gasoline prices returned to the post-Katrina peaks of more than $3.00 per gallon and stayed there throughout the peak driving season. Nevertheless, U.S. gasoline demand reached a record high, averaging over 9.5 million barrels per day in July. During early 2007, gasoline prices were in the low- to mid-$2 range.", "The passage of EPACT had its roots in an unexpected jump in oil prices that began in the late spring of 1999, following a production cut by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In early 2003, oil prices were reaching into the mid-$30s. Prices rose even higher during 2004\u2014exceeding $50 per barrel for a brief period\u2014owing to growing world demand both in the United States and the Far East, inadequate refining capacity, and Hurricane Ivan, which reduced U.S. production from the Gulf of Mexico for several months. Crude oil and petroleum product prices escalated further during 2005. These increases were initially attributable to growing international demand for oil that, domestically, put a strain on U.S. and world refining capacity. Then, in August and September, hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused further supply disruption.", "This continuing period of volatility in fuel supplies and prices has been the fourth significant episode since 1973 to jog American awareness of the extent to which the U.S. economy and lifestyle depend on inexpensive and plentiful energy. However, this surge in price represents a departure from historic trends because the rise in the price for oil fuels and energy products has occurred for more than five years and has been sustained. Some analysts have coined the term \"demand destruction\" to describe price-induced reductions in consumption, but overall demand for oil has proven resilient. World demand for oil has grown from roughly 78 million barrels daily in 2001 to roughly 84 million barrels daily during 2005.", "An additional departure from past patterns is that, historically, increases in crude oil prices owing to supply or international issues have driven product prices as the higher cost for crude feedstock is passed on. However, crude supply and stocks in 2005\u2014prior to the hurricanes\u2014were adequate. Commitments by OPEC during the course of the year to maintain or boost production appeared to have little but short-term effects on crude prices. Tightness in refined products prior to the hurricanes and the accompanying rise of product prices was a function of insufficient refining capacity in the United States to meet demand for a range of summer gasoline formulations. The pressures on product prices appeared to work backwards to support higher prices for crude. The hurricanes exacerbated these dynamics, further tightening product supply owing to problems with pipeline distribution as well as refining capacity, and introducing at the same time an uncertainty about crude supply that had not been as strong a worry prior to the storms.", "In 2006 and 2007, a number of factors\u2014new and old\u2014have contributed to an especially brittle climate for energy supply and price.

However, not only does the nation have an energy policy, it has adopted several distinct policy approaches over the years.", "This report discusses those major policy approaches, provides a conceptual framework for categorizing energy policy proposals, and briefly describes energy issues that remain current in the debate after the enactment of EPACT. Most policymakers acknowledged that EPACT would provide negligible price relief in the short term, but they contended that it would encourage domestic production of oil and gas and further conservation and alternative fuel initiatives.

However, refiner acquisition costs for domestic crude did not even double\u2014rising from $4/bbl to $7/bbl\u2014owing to a system of federal price controls that kept the price of domestic production below the market price. This discouraged domestic production and encouraged imports. However, controls may have helped insulate consumers from some of the price increase, which was the intended effect.", "Automobile fuel economy standards were enacted during the late 1970's to reduce gasoline consumption in the transportation sector. At the same time, hopes were invested in government-funded research and development of conservation technologies and alternative fuels.", "A second supply interruption was triggered in1979 by the fall of the Shah of Iran and a greatly reduced flow of Iranian oil to world markets for several months. A phased deregulation of oil prices, enacted in 1975 in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163 ), was designed to enable prices to become more responsive to market conditions.

Energy policy, in general, became more market-oriented, and the government role was lessened.", "Sustained high crude oil prices contributed to a reduction in U.S. petroleum consumption from 18.8 to 15.2 million barrels per day (mbd) from 1978 to 1982; there was more substitution of other fuels for oil, more efficient consumption of oil, and price-induced conservation. Higher prices resulted in new oil production from non-OPEC nations, allowing the United States and other consuming nations to diversify their sources of supply. Faced with a loss of market share and revenue, OPEC increased its own production in the mid-1980s, thereby lowering the price for crude oil. In the course of the year from 1985 to 1986, world oil prices plunged. In the United States, refiner acquisition cost for imported oil fell from $27/barrel to $14/barrel.", "Prices remained depressed until a fresh round of spikes in oil prices occurred in 1990-91 following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in early August 1990. That resulted in a cut-off of 4.3 million barrels per day (mbd) from world markets. The price of oil, which had averaged $16/bbl at the end of July 1990, exceeded $28 by late August and reached $36/bbl in September 1990.", "Responding to the Iraqi threat, Western and Middle Eastern nations found common ground that would have been unimaginable a decade earlier. By the late 1980s, recognition had grown of the interdependence of oil-producing and oil-consuming nations; the OPEC nations had come to recognize that long-term demand for their oil was jeopardized by any prolonged period of high oil prices. Most did not wish to repeat the cycle of the early- to mid-1980s and boosted their production to make up for some of the lost supply. Consuming nations also coordinated the release of strategic stocks of crude and products. Prices began to fall in mid-October 1990 when the United Nations approved the use of force against Iraq. Prices fell more sharply after the United States and a consortium of nations began conducting air strikes on Iraq in mid-January 1991."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Responses to the Disruptions of the 1970s and 1980s", "paragraphs": ["During all of these episodes, importance was placed on conservation, more efficient use of energy, and development of alternative energy sources. The oil shocks of the mid- and late-1970s spurred considerable spending on alternative energy\u2014including solar, geothermal, wind, clean coal, synthetic fuels, alcohol-based fuels\u2014and technologies to improve the efficiency of energy use. Regulations were developed to improve the efficiency of home appliances and to incorporate more energy-efficient designs in buildings. In the early 1980s, states and utilities promoted energy efficiency as one form of \"demand-side management\" to reduce the need for construction of new power plants. Many industries re-engineered their processes to save energy. Conservation and efficiency were championed by some as a lower-cost and more environmentally appealing way to achieve greater energy security than policies to boost supply. However, largely because of the generally lower prices over time for fossil fuels\u2014as is noted below\u2014these energy programs showed mixed results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Challenge Faced by Policymakers", "paragraphs": ["As suggested earlier, each episode of short supply and higher prices spurs concern that the nation lacks an energy policy and has ignored past lessons.

It wasn't so much that energy policy failed to be responsive to earlier crises; rather, during lengthy periods of stability and declining prices for conventional fuels, it proved difficult to sustain certain policy courses that might help shield the nation from future episodes of instability.", "An energy policy that would most effectively shield the nation and the economy from the worst effects of supply shortages would be a policy that might well deny the nation the full benefits of cheap and plentiful energy when markets are stable. The periods of relative calm and stability result in a markedly uncertain environment for investment in alternative fuels, energy efficiency technologies, and boosting the production of conventional fuels in regions where production costs are significantly higher than in the Middle East. State and local regulations and codes further cloud the climate for investment. Local opposition to new on- and off-shore production projects, power plants, electric transmission lines, refineries, and pipelines is often most effective during periods of price and supply stability, but sometimes eases only after shortages have actually occurred.", "However, a prolonged climate for higher prices\u2014stemming from tightness in the supply of products and continuing instability in Middle East regions where oil reserves are concentrated\u2014may introduce new changes in the character and particulars of U.S. energy policy.

How to boost energy supply without exacting an unacceptable toll on the environment? How, then, to reduce gasoline consumption, a commodity central to the nation's economy and lifestyle, when raising its price to achieve a meaningful reduction in demand could be economically disruptive and politically unappealing? Should federal policy encourage the use of more expensive alternative fuels and technologies that heighten efficiency, when OPEC has generally demonstrated a capability to adjust the price of oil to keep it far cheaper than its substitutes?", "Debate over energy policy has produced an enormous range of proposals, many of which have been adopted at one point or another over the years. In general, it is helpful to recognize the broad categories into which most proposals fall: Most energy policies are designed to affect either the supply of or the demand for energy products, and they are, at the same time, designed to have an effect either in the near term or the longer term.", "Traditionally, the energy debate has been the most vigorous over the balance to be struck between increasing supply and encouraging conservation. However, energy policy turns on the additional axis of short- and long-term policies. In the midst of high prices during the spring of 2001, policymakers were pressed to come up with immediate policy responses that would afford consumers price relief. However, at that time President Bush was advising Congress and Americans that the Administration's energy policy plan would focus on long-term remedies for the nation's energy problems and that there would be no immediate relief for consumers paying higher prices for gasoline, electricity, and other fuels. The President and his supporters suggested that by setting out an action-oriented and actionable comprehensive policy, markets and consumers should feel some short-term reassurance. This did not quell all the demands for more immediate action to reduce energy prices. Nor were they completely quelled during the protracted debate over omnibus energy legislation from 2003 until the enactment of EPACT in the summer of 2005.", "It is useful to clarify the differences between short-term and long-term policy initiatives. For example, a drawdown of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) affects crude oil supply in the near term. However, enactment of tax incentives for investment in new oil drilling technologies might add to domestic crude supply further in the future. Proponents of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) argue it might add anywhere from 300,000 b/d (barrels per day) to 1.4 mbd to U.S. domestic supply, but this, too, is a longer-term policy initiative.", "Turning to the consumption side of the ledger, boosting the federal gasoline tax by $1.50/gallon might be expected to reduce gasoline consumption in the near term, but increasing the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards on new motor vehicles would not take full effect until older vehicles were largely replaced, a process that could take more than a decade.", "The table below suggests a way in which many energy policies may be visualized along these lines:", "The axis of long-term/short-term, supply/demand does not capture all policy options. For example, one of the major issues in energy policy is the price for fuels. Energy policy generally is designed to affect price indirectly\u2014by having price follow, or reflect, current demand or supply for energy. There are a few exceptions. Tax policy may address energy price directly to the extent that excise taxes on fuel products can be raised or lowered (recognizing that these tax boosts or cuts may not be reflected penny-for-penny in the \"pump\" price for fuels).", "Short-term policies to affect supply, such as potential use of strategic reserves, have been sometimes very controversial because, in the absence of a very clear-cut and widely acknowledged physical shortage, such initiatives are perceived to be thinly disguised efforts to grant price relief. Some suggest at times that high prices\u2014left uninterfered with\u2014are the best policy of all, encouraging markets to provide more supply in due course, and that federal policy should address only those most adversely affected by sharply higher prices. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is one such effort to provide direct assistance to families whose quality of life is especially burdened by high energy prices. LIHEAP is a short-term policy for addressing the impact of high prices for energy.", "Supply and demand may also be affected by external events, including political and diplomatic dynamics between or among the producing nations. Weather, seasonal or otherwise, will affect supply and demand; policy cannot affect the weather, only its consequences. Lastly, Congress always has the option to require study and analysis of a problem before settling on a policy course.

However often that question recurs, the context in which it is raised changes. The current context has become distinctly different than in previous episodes.", "U.S. energy policy was primarily market-based for roughly 20 years, but policy makers have been weighing whether problems in some sectors and with some fuels are attributable to distribution or regulatory inefficiencies interfering with markets, or whether government intervention may be necessary to protect consumers and the economy from problems to which markets cannot flexibly respond. Some critics of U.S. energy policy argue that these inefficiencies and distortions are themselves the consequence of government intervention\u2014for example, Clean Air Act requirements that have required the manufacture of several different regional formulations of gasoline. Strong economic growth during the mid- and late 1990s at a time of declining real energy prices resulted in growth in consumption even though efficiency of energy use is dramatically better than during the 1970s and 1980s. Growth in petroleum consumption in the United States as domestic production declines has meant a commensurate increase in oil imports. During the second half of 2004, growth in demand as well from the Far East pressured spare oil production capacity. In the midst of market uncertainties, increased OPEC production\u2014unlike in the past\u2014appeared unable to exert its historical effect of moderating crude oil prices. There is recognition of the interdependence of producing and consuming nations; however, the political balance among the OPEC nations is delicate and can influence oil production decisions and whether OPEC is able to exert market control at all. There is growing recognition that the recent shortages and price spikes in some regions of the country have been compounded by insufficiencies in the nation's energy infrastructure\u2014refining capacity, gas and oil pipelines, transmission lines, and electric generating facilities. Some have questioned the advisability of locating so much of the nation's refining capacity in the Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas. Problems with gasoline supply and home heating oil stocks since 2000 imply some need to develop additional refining capacity and transport systems that will add both capacity and flexibility to distribution. However, national and local environmental regulation and requirements, and local community sentiment, affect the speed and ease of siting and building such facilities. Because high prices tend to eventually depress demand, the industry is sometimes wary of making investment in capacity that would achieve profit targets only during short-lived periods of unusually high prices. Uncertainty about the course of the economy may also contribute to questions about the profitability of these investments. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions add an additional measure of uncertainty.

Responding, in part, to intense lobbying by the United States, the OPEC oil ministers boosted crude production and settled upon $22-$28 per barrel as a desirable \"price band.\" But the price band grew increasingly out-of-touch and irrelevant as prices renewed their increase, and surged during 2004.

In addition, five fuel specification changes during 2005 put additional pressure on the gasoline supply system. An ultra-low sulfur diesel program that began in June 2006 required that 80% of on-highway diesel have no more than 15 ppm (parts per million) sulfur content. The elimination of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) placed pressure on ethanol supply and prices and incurred some loss to product yield in the manufacture of RFG (reformulated gasoline).", "The ability of the OPEC cartel to exert influence upon oil prices at critical times underscores that\u2014with respect to petroleum\u2014the problem is less that the world supply of oil is tight than that so much of it is concentrated in other parts of the globe, principally the Middle East. U.S. dependence upon imported oil is now about 60% of total consumption.

Opponents also suggest that the risks are not worth bearing, especially if the resources in ANWR turn out to be at the lower range of estimates, providing only an additional 300,000 b/d of supply.

Were increases in new car fuel economy achieved by reducing vehicle weight or disproportionately encouraging the sale of small vehicles, the study allowed that additional fatalities could result. However, some members of the NAS panel dissented, suggesting that the analysis of the relationship between fuel economy and vehicle safety is extremely complex.", "There is little question that the price hikes during past episodes of tight energy supply spurred many improvements in energy efficiency. Some argue, however, that the easiest and lowest-cost efficiency gains have been achieved, and that expectations should be lowered about the additional efficiency gains that can be captured in the present price framework for energy. When the Reagan Administration redirected energy policy to a more market-oriented framework, it was argued that R&D needed to be carefully focused on areas that were promising, but unlikely to be explored by the private sector.", "In its energy policy plan, the Bush Administration recommended a review of the funding and performance of energy efficiency research and development for the purpose of determining appropriate funding for performance-based research in public-private partnerships."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Uncertain Future", "paragraphs": ["As apparent as it seems to many that the nation should do \"something\" about energy, the preceding pages have outlined the layers of complexity that augur against easy agreement to many of the policy options that have been proposed and debated since the mid-1970s. A review of the history shows that every episode of instability has had its own set of unique contributing factors\u2014and that these may be geopolitical, based in energy infrastructure or unanticipated natural disasters, or triggered by extremes of heat or cold beyond anyone's control. Making policy decisions that will anticipate unpredictable future developments, or settling on policies to mitigate the consequences when these events are before us, will remain a challenge for policymakers as the energy debate continues."], "subsections": []}]}}
