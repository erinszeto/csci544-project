EPA had initiated the investigation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) in response to citizen complaints in 2008 about domestic well water quality. On June 20, 2013, EPA announced that it would not finalize the report but would defer to the state of Wyoming to assume the lead in investigating drinking water quality in Pavillion. The EPA draft report indicated that certain constituents in groundwater are consistent with some of the constituents used in natural gas well operations, including the process of hydraulic fracturing. EPA claimed that its approach to the investigation best supports the explanation that different compounds associated with hydraulic fracturing have contaminated the aquifer used for domestic water supply in the Pavillion area. EPA also stated that its approach indicates that gas production activities have likely enhanced the migration of natural gas in the aquifer. EPA did not appear to conclude that there was a definitive link to a release from the production wells, nor to the constituents found in domestic wells in shallower parts of the aquifer.", "Because the draft report linked groundwater contamination in Wyoming to activities related to hydraulic fracturing, it had raised concerns about hydraulic fracturing practices in general. Some stakeholders took issue with some of the findings in the draft report. They questioned the scientific validity of EPA's contention that \"the explanation best fitting the data for the deep monitoring wells is that constituents associated with hydraulic fracturing have been released into the Wind River drinking water aquifer at depths above the current production zone.\" In contrast, some environmental organizations cited EPA's findings in calling for more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Stakeholder groups commissioned independent assessments of EPA's draft report and released their respective assessments in May 2012. An assessment commissioned by an industry organization disagreed with EPA's findings, whereas an assessment commissioned by four environmental organizations supported the agency's findings.", "EPA's draft report also has received attention within Congress. On January 20, 2012, 11 members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee sent a letter to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson asking that the EPA investigation be considered a \"highly influential scientific assessment and that any related, generated report is subject to the most rigorous, independent, and thorough external peer review process.\" In the House, the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing on February 1, 2012, to examine EPA's findings. Concerns about the status of EPA's report and the scientific validity of its findings have continued into the 113th Congress.", "In response to concerns about the adequacy of the original data, EPA worked with the U.S. Geological Survey and the state of Wyoming to collect additional samples from two deep monitoring wells installed by EPA. On September 26, 2012, the USGS released two reports regarding their sampling program for the two wells. The USGS provided raw data from only one well because the second well did not yield enough water to collect representative samples. A news report cited an EPA spokesperson stating that the USGS sampling results were generally consistent with findings from the earlier EPA draft report. An industry spokesperson stated that there was nothing surprising in the USGS results, based on a preliminary examination of the data. Now that EPA has decided not to finalize its report, whatever additional actions may be taken at the Pavillion site would appear to depend on the outcome of the investigation of the state of Wyoming and what continuing role EPA may play in a supporting capacity."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["On December 8, 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a draft report on its investigation of groundwater contamination near the town of Pavillion, Wyoming.

In response to these citizen complaints, the EPA Region 8 Office initiated an investigation of possible contamination of the drinking water aquifer underlying the town, using the authorities of CERCLA delegated to EPA by Executive Order 12580. Section 104(a) of the statute authorizes EPA to respond to a release or substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance, or a pollutant or contaminant that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare. This authority is available in such situations if EPA deems that response actions would be necessary to protect public health or welfare, or the environment, subject to the availability of appropriations under the Superfund program to carry out such actions. The federal regulations of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (often referred to as the National Contingency Plan or NCP for short) establish the procedures under which EPA may evaluate a site to determine where federal response actions may be warranted under Section 104(a) of CERCLA. State or local officials often are responsible for elevating sites to EPA for evaluation under CERCLA, in their capacity as first responders under the NCP.", "Section 105(d) also establishes a mechanism under which citizens may request that EPA perform a preliminary assessment to determine whether response actions may be warranted at a site, if EPA has not previously assessed the site. This provision provides the authority for any person who is, or may be, affected by a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant to petition EPA to assess the potential hazards to public health and the environment that may arise from such a release or threatened release. EPA is required either to complete a preliminary assessment of a site within 12 months of the submission of a citizen petition, or to provide an explanation of why an assessment may not be appropriate.", "As specified in the NCP, a citizen petition under CERCLA should be addressed to the EPA Regional Administrator in the region in which the site is located and should identify the location of the release, how the petitioner is or may be affected by the release, and to the extent available, what types of substances were or may be released and the nature of the activities that have occurred where the release is located. Petitions also should indicate whether state and local officials have been contacted about the release. EPA would use such information to determine whether a site assessment may be warranted at the federal level under CERCLA. The EPA Draft Report for the Pavillion site indicated that the EPA Region 8 Office determined an assessment of the groundwater underlying the site was appropriate based on the observations about domestic well water quality cited in the citizen complaints that the agency received in 2008.", "See the Appendix at the end of this report for further discussion of EPA's response authorities under CERCLA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related Federal Public Health Study", "paragraphs": ["To help inform its investigation of the groundwater underlying the Pavillion site, EPA requested that the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, examine the potential health hazards that may be associated with contaminants found\u00a0specifically in private residential well water, but not other portions of the aquifer. Section 104(i)(4) of CERCLA authorizes EPA (or state or local officials) to request that the ATSDR provide consultations on potential health issues that may be associated with the release of a hazardous\u00a0substance at a specific site. In response to EPA's request under this authority, the ATSDR issued a Health Consultation for Pavillion in August 2010.", "The ATSDR concluded that exposure to some of the contaminants found in the private residential well water were at levels that could lead to certain health effects, based on the potential for exposure relative to the health screening criteria that the ATSDR applied, and that some of the contaminants (such as methane) could present potential explosive hazards in residences under certain conditions. The ATSDR recommended that residents use alternate or treated water supplies, and recommended certain other measures to address potential explosive hazards, such as ventilating bathrooms while showering.", "It should be emphasized that the ATSDR's study focused specifically on potential hazards associated with the private residential well water, whereas the scope of EPA's site investigation was broader in terms of identifying and characterizing contaminants across the aquifer more widely and at greater depths. The ATSDR's finding of the presence of potential hazards was limited to the private residential well water itself, at shallower depths common to most domestic wells, and not the greater depths of natural gas production wells.

(See Figure 1 .) The Wind River Formation, an accumulation of sandstone, conglomerate, shale, and mudstone, is the major source of drinking water for domestic and public-supply uses in the Wind River Basin. The Wind River Formation varies in thickness, and extends from the ground surface to as deep as 3,400 feet in the Pavillion gas field area. Natural gas is produced from wells drilled into the Wind River Formation, and from deeper wells drilled into the Fort Union Formation, which lies directly underneath the Wind River Formation. The most productive zone of natural gas extraction is from the bottom of the Wind River Formation, although hydraulic fracturing to enhance gas production has occurred at locations as shallow as 1,220 feet below ground surface, according to the EPA Draft Report. ", "The EPA sampled residential wells, stock wells, shallow monitoring wells, and two municipal wells. The domestic wells range in depth from approximately 20 feet to nearly 800 feet, and the two municipal wells are 505 and 515 feet deep. The shallow monitoring wells were approximately 15 feet deep. According to the EPA Draft Report, the early phases of the investigation detected the presence of methane and diesel-range organic chemicals in some of the deeper domestic wells, which prompted EPA to install two deep monitoring wells in June 2010. EPA stated that the purpose of installing two deep monitoring wells\u2014one at 785 feet and the second at 980 feet\u2014was to differentiate potentially deep sources from potentially shallow sources of contamination. Shallow sources of contamination were thought to be related to leakage from surface pits used for storage and disposal of drilling wastes and produced and flowback water. Potential deeper sources were thought to be related to gas production, which would include drilling and hydraulic fracturing, as well as actual gas production. ", "Detecting and distinguishing between potentially shallow and potentially deep sources of groundwater contamination lies at the heart of the primary findings in the EPA Draft Report. Whether the report clearly links groundwater contamination to drilling or hydraulic fracturing activities at depth has been the source of relatively heated commentary by proponents and opponents of the use of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas development.

The contaminants identified in the shallow portions of the aquifer included benzene, xylenes, gasoline-range organics (GROs), and diesel-range organics (DROs). According to the report, at least 33 surface pits were likely sources for the contaminants detected in shallow groundwater: \"detection [of these contaminants] in ground water samples from shallow monitoring wells near pits indicates that pits are a source of shallow ground water contamination in the area of investigation.\" The pits were used for disposal of drilling cuttings, hydraulic fracturing flowback, and water produced from the formation.

However, the geology and hydrology of each region differs. The differences in geology and hydrology could make a significant difference in the likelihood of contaminating drinking water aquifers from hydraulic fracturing and from other natural gas development activities.

Natural gas is extracted from sandstone lenses in the Wind River Formation and in the underlying Fort Union Formation. The sandstone lenses are interbedded with less permeable rocks, such as shales and mudstones. The natural gas did not originate in the sandstone lenses, but was likely formed in deeper and older rocks and then migrated into the sandstone lenses. The sandstone lenses, therefore, constitute the reservoir for natural gas, but not the source . The gas remains trapped in the sandstone reservoirs because the surrounding rocks are relatively impermeable to flow and keep the gas within the sandstone lenses. ", "Tight gas sandstones generally are defined as unconventional gas deposits because they generally have lower permeability than other types of sandstones in conventional deposits. Unconventional gas deposits require enhanced recovery techniques to produce the gas, such as hydraulic fracturing. Conventional gas deposits, by contrast, can produce gas to the surface via a well under the natural pressure and permeability of the reservoir (at least, until the natural pressure is depleted). Figure 3 is a schematic showing conventional and unconventional types of natural gas deposits, including shale gas and tight sand gas.", "The crucial geologic difference between tight sand gas formations and shale gas formations is that shale gas formations are both the source rock and the reservoir rock. The natural gas is formed within the shale layers, but because shale is virtually impermeable to flow, the gas remains trapped and bound to the matrix of organic matter in the shale. Shale gas formations are also deemed unconventional gas deposits.", "The distinction between tight sand gas and shale gas is important in the Pavillion area because in the upper 1,000 feet of the Wind River Formation, the sandstone lenses are also part of the aquifer used for water supply. The sandstone, in contrast to shale, has enough permeability to transmit groundwater to water wells in the region. In a sense, the sandstone lenses can act as a reservoir for both natural gas and for groundwater. Shale formations, such as the Marcellus Shale, are not permeable enough to transmit water and are generally not considered aquifers. In fact, thick layers of shale are considered to be barriers to groundwater flow"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hydraulic Fracturing in Deep Versus Shallow Reservoirs", "paragraphs": ["The issue at Pavillion, where hydraulic fracturing and gas production are occurring only slightly deeper than the deepest water wells, would likely not be an issue for most shale gas plays. The uppermost region of hydraulic fracturing in the Pavillion field is within a few hundred feet of the deepest water wells. The close vertical proximity of natural gas development activities and the bottom of the drinking water aquifer means that injected fluids would not have to travel far to reach the aquifer, provided the fluids had a suitable pathway. Put another way, at Pavillion there is less rock between the gas development activities and the aquifer. In contrast, deeper shale gas reservoirs, such as the Marcellus Shale in the northeast United States, are separated from overlying drinking water aquifers by thousands of feet of rock in areas under active development. ", "In addition, if the intervening interval contains layers of rock relatively impermeable to flow, such as other shale formations, then the chances of upward migration of injected fluids are reduced. In such cases, the only pathways for fluid migration from a deep shale gas reservoir would be along leaky old wells or poorly constructed production wells. Those types of wells would provide possible routes for fluids to migrate upward because the wells pierce the intervening rock layers and could connect the drinking water aquifer to the deeper, hydraulically fractured gas shale reservoir.

In tight sand reservoirs, such as the Pavillion field, often more wells are required to efficiently produce the gas from a given section of the reservoir than from conventional sand reservoirs. In other words, one well in a tight gas reservoir will produce less gas over time than what would be expected from a well in a conventional sand reservoir. That means that the well spacing for tight gas sands could be much denser than for conventional sand gas fields. According to one source, well spacing in a conventional sand reservoir is generally 160 to 320 acres per well, but in a tight sand reservoir the well spacing can be as little as 10 acres per well. The greater number of wells required to produce gas in tight sands also increases the number of potential vertical pathways from the fracture or production zone to the surface, or to a drinking water aquifer if some wells are improperly constructed or leak over time. ", "Well spacing for vertical wells in other unconventional gas reservoirs, such as the Marcellus Shale, would also be more dense as compared to conventional gas reservoirs. However, horizontal drilling is increasingly used to both hydraulically fracture and produce gas from shale gas reservoirs. According to one source, shale gas development could require only one horizontal well instead of four vertical wells to produce the same amount of gas. Also, one drill pad is required for each vertical well drilled, while multiple horizontal wells could be drilled from the same drill pad. If four horizontal wells were drilled from a single drill pad, that would be the equivalent of drilling 16 vertical wells. For shale gas fields where horizontal wells are chiefly used, the number of potential vertical pathways per land area that could transport leaked contaminants to overlying drinking water aquifers likely would be far fewer than for tight gas sand fields such as at Pavillion.

Horizontal wells used for hydraulically fracturing shale gas fields, such as the Marcellus Shale, probably require a greater overall volume of fluid per well than is required for vertical wells drilled into tight gas sands, such as Pavillion. The requirement for greater volumes of water in shale gas fields would present different challenges regarding water supply and water disposal than for tight gas sand fields, such as Pavillion. In addition to greater volumes injected into the subsurface, greater volumes of fracture fluid would need to be stored at the surface during a hydraulic fracturing operation, which could also increase the likelihood of surface spills.

If EPA were to determine that cleanup of contamination is warranted to protect human health and the environment, certain exclusions, limitations, or exemptions could constrain the actions that EPA could pursue under CERCLA. In the case of a site like Pavillion, these constraints may include the exclusion of releases of natural gas from the reach of the statute, the general limitation on the use of the authorities of the statute to respond to releases of hazardous substances that may be naturally occurring, and the exemption from liability under the statute for response costs or damages resulting from federally permitted releases of hazardous substances (including permits issued by states with delegated federal authorities, and certain permits issued by states under their own authorities that govern underground injection involved in oil or natural gas production).", "Although the initial site-specific evaluation process under CERCLA may be funded and performed under EPA's Superfund program, it does not constitute the placement of a site on the National Priorities List (NPL). Rather, such an evaluation is the initial\u2014and in most cases the only\u2014stage of the site-specific process under CERCLA. Most potentially contaminated sites initially brought to EPA's attention are deferred to the states for further action. EPA's investigation of the Pavillion site formally constituted the Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection step of the site-specific evaluation process under CERCLA. EPA broadened the Site Inspection phase at the Pavillion site to an \"Expanded Site Inspection\" to collect additional samples and more fully characterize the contaminants that may be present in the groundwater and the potential sources.", "The primary purpose of this step of the process is to identify whether a release of hazardous substances may warrant emergency response actions to address immediate risks, and whether the site may warrant listing on the NPL to take more extensive response actions. Relatively few potentially contaminated sites reported to EPA result in an NPL designation. Approximately 50,000 potentially contaminated sites have been reported to EPA over time since the enactment of CERCLA in 1980. Of this total site universe, more than 21,000 sites have been the subject of Site Inspections similar to that conducted at Pavillion, of which 1,685 have been listed on the NPL to date, including sites that have since been deleted once the cleanup objectives were met. ", "Whether EPA may pursue further action at a site under investigation depends on the findings. In its Draft Report for the Pavillion site, EPA did not reach a conclusion definitively linking contaminants found in the groundwater to a specific release that may present a risk to human health or the environment. Accordingly, the agency did not determine that cleanup actions were warranted, nor did the agency identify any potentially responsible parties as being liable for any response actions under Section 107 of CERCLA. At any site, a source of contamination first would have to be confirmed and the potential risks further examined, before any determinations could be made as to whether cleanup may be warranted and whether any potentially responsible parties are identified who may be liable for the cleanup.", "If EPA were to find that a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance may present a threat to human health or the environment, EPA would evaluate the potential hazards according to the criteria established under Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA to determine whether the site may be eligible for listing on the NPL. These criteria and how to apply them are outlined in federal regulation under the Hazard Ranking System (HRS). This system is based on a scale of 1 to 100 to rank the degree or severity of the potential hazards. Sites scoring 28.5 and higher generally are eligible for listing on the NPL. Whether EPA may list an eligible site on the NPL to elevate its priority for cleanup at the federal level would depend on numerous other criteria, including the criteria under Section 105(h) of CERCLA for\u00a0deferring a site to the state in which the site is located instead of listing it on the NPL, if the state requests such deferment.", "If a site is not listed on the NPL but still is not deferred to the state, EPA may take certain actions at the federal level to address potential health and environmental risks, including the performance of emergency \"removal\" actions if warranted. Under CERCLA, removal actions generally are measures intended to address more immediate risks of exposure, whereas \"remedial\" actions generally are measures intended to provide a more permanent solution to address long-term risks. Although a site must be listed on the NPL to be eligible for Superfund appropriations to perform remedial actions, removal actions are eligible for such federal funds regardless of a site's listing status. The initial stage of evaluating a site also may be funded with Superfund appropriations prior to any listing decision, to determine whether further response actions may be warranted. The use of Superfund appropriations at the Pavillion site was limited to the performance of the Preliminary Assessment/Site Inspection of potential groundwater contamination, upon which the EPA Draft Report was based.", "EPA also may pursue mechanisms to enforce cleanup liability under CERCLA if the source of contamination is confirmed, the release that caused the contamination falls under the authorities of the statute, and the potentially responsible parties who can be held liable under the statute can be identified and are financially viable. These mechanisms include cleanup orders under Section 106 and cleanup agreements under Section 122, neither of which hinges upon whether a site is listed on the NPL. However, Section 128(b) of the statute generally limits EPA's enforcement authority under CERCLA to issue a cleanup order under Section 106, if a state is already pursuing the cleanup of a site under its own authorities.", "EPA did not use any of these enforcement authorities of CERCLA at the Pavillion site. Rather, the EPA Draft Report identified constituents in certain portions of the aquifer that the agency characterized as being consistent with, or similar to, some substances used in the natural gas production operations.
