The accumulation of confidential business information from owners and operators of the nation's critical infrastructures, 85% of which is reportedly owned by the private sector, continues to be an important component of homeland security efforts. Critical infrastructure sectors have been defined to include information technology; telecommunications; chemicals; transportation systems; including mass transit, aviation, maritime, ground/surface, and rail and pipeline systems; emergency services; postal and shipping; agriculture and food; public health and healthcare; drinking water and water treatment systems; energy, including oil and gas and electric power; banking and finance; the defense industrial base; and national monuments and icons. The Freedom of Information Act of 1974 (FOIA) along with other statutes and regulations provide legal authorities for the protection of various types of security-related information. Nevertheless, some owners and operators are hesitant to voluntarily share security-related information with the government because of the possible disclosure of this information to the public. To prohibit public disclosure of security-related information under the Freedom of Information Act and other laws, Congress has drafted and passed legislation designed to remove legal obstacles to information sharing. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA); the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 in section 214 of the Homeland Security Act; the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA); and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), as amended by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, each exempt certain types of security-related information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

With the exception of three special categories of law enforcement-related records that are entirely excluded from the coverage of the FOIA and records already made available for publication or inspection, all other federal agency records may be requested under the FOIA. That records are potentially subject to FOIA requests does not mean they necessarily will be disclosed. Nine categories of information may be exempted from mandatory disclosure. The exemptions permit, rather than require, the withholding of the requested information. Records that are not exempt under one or more of the Act's nine exemptions must be disclosed. If a record contains some exempt material, any reasonably segregable portion of the record must be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.

Exemption 4 of FOIA exempts from disclosure \"trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\" Most exemption 4 cases have involved a dispute over whether the requested information was \"confidential.\"", "In 1974, the D.C. Circuit in National Parks and Conservation Association v. Morton , enunciated a two-part confidentiality test for commercial information: \"if disclosure of the information is likely to either impair the government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future; or to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained,\" the commercial information will be treated as confidential. In 1992, in Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC , the D.C. Circuit limited the scope and application of National Parks to cases in which a FOIA request is made for commercial or financial information which is required to be furnished to the Government. The court established a new test of confidentiality for information submitted voluntarily, under which information is exempt from disclosure if the submitter can show that it does not customarily release the information to the public. The burden of establishing the submitter's custom remains with the agency seeking to withhold the record.", "A number of lower federal courts have applied the Critical Mass distinction between voluntary and required submissions. Nonetheless, Critical Mass has not been widely adopted by the other circuits.", "Whether submission of a vulnerability assessment or a site security plan is voluntary or required will determine the level of protection afforded the information under exemption 4. Because an absolute prohibition on the disclosure of commercial or financial information does not exist under exemption 4, separate confidentiality protections have been created for certain types of security-related information under other federal statutes. Often the security-related statutes discussed herein differentiate between \"required\" and \"voluntary\" submission. For example, the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) require covered entities to submit information to the federal government. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act (CIIA) provides confidentiality protections for critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to DHS. The regulations for sensitive security information issued pursuant to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) designate 16 categories of sensitive security information, and include information submitted pursuant to a requirement and information voluntarily submitted.

Congress recognized that some situations simply do not fit the general mold of FOIA releases of agency records to any requester. This third exemption establishes an open-ended set of documents which have previously been mandated to be confidential or for which Congress has made specific provision for confidentiality. It is Congress, not the agency, which makes the secrecy decision under this exemption.", "For a nondisclosure provision in a separate federal statute to qualify for exemption 3 status, the nondisclosure provision must meet one or two of the criteria: either the statute must require that matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or establish particular criteria for withholding or refer to particular types of matters to be withheld. If the statute meets the criteria of exemption 3 of FOIA and the information to be withheld falls within the scope and coverage of that statute, the information is properly exempt from disclosure under exemption 3 of FOIA.", "To withhold a document under exemption 3, the agency bears the burden of demonstrating that the statute either requires that the document or documents be withheld without agency discretion or specifically authorizes the agency to use discretion to withhold that type of document. The scope of the statute must be examined by a reviewing court to determine whether it qualifies as a withholding statute. Basic principles of statutory construction are to be used to determine exemption 3 status. When resolving an ambiguity about the proper interpretation of a specific statute under exemption 3, the Chevron rule of judicial deference applies to the agency's interpretation of the statute it administers. Substantial weight is to be given to an agency's claim of exemption 3 status.", "The first subpart of exemption 3\u00e2\u0080\u0094subpart (A)\u00e2\u0080\u0094is often referred to as the \"no discretionary release\" category.

For example, the Supreme Court found no discretion within the Census Act's prohibition against disclosure of census records.", "Subpart (B) of exemption (b)(3), commonly referred to as the \"particular criteria\" category, permits agency discretion on whether to withhold or disclose agency records. Under subpart (B), an agency has the discretion to disclose if it so chooses but also has authority (explicit or implicit) to withhold. The statute must establish particular criteria for withholding or refer to particular types of matters to be withheld. To qualify under subpart (B), the statute must provide articulable criteria for the agency to use to determine whether to permit disclosure. The Supreme Court looks for \"sufficiently definite standards\" in a statute rather than \"broad discretion.\" The degree to which Congress has specified the agency's discretion in the statute is important. A court must examine the underlying congressional intent to exempt material from FOIA and analyze the amount of discretion left to the agency. The statute must be \"the product of congressional appreciation of the dangers inherent in airing particular data and must incorporate a formula whereby the administrator may determine precisely whether the disclosure in any instance would pose the hazard that Congress foresaw.\"", "Numerous statutes have been held by courts to qualify as exemption 3 statutes and agencies. In addition, agencies often rely on statutes as a basis for exemption 3 withholding in the absence of a judicial determination that the statute qualifies as an exemption 3 withholding statute. Congress has increasingly enacted exemption 3 statutes containing disclosure prohibitions that are specifically directed toward the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The following are summaries of selected exemption 3 statutes applied by various agencies that may be relevant to the protection of security-related information and that contain legal authorities or requirements regarding non-disclosure of information developed or obtained in accordance with those Acts.", "The Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996 require agencies to list the exemption 3 statutes upon which they rely in their annual FOIA reports, and include a description of whether a court has upheld the agency's decision to withhold information under such statute. An examination of exemption 3 statutes applied by DHS components throughout FY2004 reveals that several non-disclosure provisions are relied on to withhold security-related information. These exemption (b)(3) statutes include non-disclosure provisions for critical infrastructure information, the prohibition on release of all information contained in maritime industry vulnerability assessments, the prohibition on release of all information contained in maritime security plans, and a provision governing the non-disclosure of transportation security activities.

The transfer of authority, however, required that TSA \"shall be maintained as a distinct entity within the Department under the Under Secretary for Border Transportation.\" This distinct entity requirement was effective for the first two years of DHS's existence and expired on November 25, 2004. It should be noted that TSA was not the only agency that was transferred to DHS as a distinct entity. Other such agencies include the Coast Guard and the United States Secret Service, whose status as distinct entities, however, unlike TSA's, do not contain sunset provisions.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 also re-codified and further amended TSA's authority to:", "prescribe regulations prohibiting the disclosure of information obtained or developed in carrying out security under authority of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Public Law 107-71) or under chapter 449 of this title if the Under Secretary decides that disclosing the information would\u00e2\u0080\u0094(A) be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; (B) reveal a trade secret or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information; or (C) be detrimental to the security of transportation.", "In addition to the amendment to the definition of SSI, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 specifically prohibits the Under Secretary from transferring its SSI classification authority to \"another department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States,\" unless otherwise authorized by law. Moreover, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 amended the existing DOT authority with respect to SSI such that it would be virtually identical to the TSA authority. The only difference between the two statutes is contained in subpart (C), which provides DOT with authority to prohibit disclosure of information that would be \"detrimental to transportation safety.\" By removing any reference to persons or passengers, Congress again significantly broadened the scope of the SSI authority. As a result, it appears that the authority to designate information as SSI now encompasses all transportation related activities including air and maritime cargo, trucking and freight transport, as well as pipelines.", "On May 18, 2004, TSA, functioning as distinct entity within DHS, and DOT jointly promulgated revised SSI regulations in response to their newly expanded statutory authority. These revised regulations adopt the Homeland Security Act language as the definition of SSI. In addition, the new regulations incorporate former SSI provisions, including the sixteen categories of information and records that constitute SSI. Included among these categories are: security programs and contingency plans; security directives; security measures; security screening information; and a general category consisting of \"other information.\" With respect to the regulation's application to information governed by the language in the MTSA, TSA indicated that \"[w]hile the MTSA provides broad limitations on public disclosure of the information related to maritime security requirements ( see 46 U.S.C. 70103), it does not establish binding requirements for owners and operators of maritime transportation facilities and vessels to safeguard the information from disclosure.\" TSA concluded that, because the lack of a legal and regulatory framework was prohibiting dissemination to those that needed it, there was an \"immediate need to expand the existing regulatory framework governing information related to aviation security to cover information related to security of maritime transportation.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Judicial Review of SSI Classification", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the implementation and use of the SSI regulations by TSA have created a number of legal controversies that have resulted in both criminal and civil litigation in federal court. Among these are the reported withdrawal of two federal criminal prosecutions involving TSA baggage screeners for fear that proceeding would require the public disclosure of SSI. Based on an electronic search of both published and unpublished federal court opinions, it appears that there have been more than a dozen reported decisions or orders involving the procedural requirements for the use and/or disclosure of SSI. Two of these reported cases have been criminal prosecutions. In one case, the reviewing court determined that despite the liberal discovery permitted to criminal defendants under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the government was entitled to withhold information from defendants pursuant to the SSI statute. In the other, the government argued that the information being sought by the defendant was designated SSI and, therefore, protected from the defendant's discovery request. The court, however, decided the case on alternative grounds without addressing the SSI statute or the government claims to protection.", "With respect to civil actions involving SSI, the courts appear to be using a variety of procedures to address issues raised by or related to information classified by the government as SSI. The most common procedure appears to be the use of ex parte , in camera reviews of submitted material. For example, in Gordon v. F.B.I , a Freedom of Information Act suit regarding the administration of TSA's \"no fly\" and other aviation watch lists, the government claimed numerous SSI exemptions and resisted disclosing information to the plaintiffs. The District Court for the Northern District of California ordered that the government \"produce copies of all withheld evidence for the Court's review\" as well as ordered that the government review all withheld information to ensure that it was exempted in good faith and provide a detailed affidavit explaining why the material was exempt from disclosure. In response to the information and affidavits received, the plaintiffs argued that TSA had not provided enough detail about the withheld information and that they had not sufficiently segregated non-SSI material from that which received the designation. The court disagreed, noting that it \"has reviewed in camera all of the redacted SSI and has determined that all of it is properly withheld.\" In addition, the court also stated, with respect to the segregation issue, \"the Court has reviewed each of the SSI redactions in camera and had determined that each is properly asserted.\" Similarly, in Jifry v. FAA , which involved a challenge to an FAA order revoking the airmen certificates of several alien pilots on the grounds that they posed security risks, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that, although SSI had been relied upon by the government in deciding to revoke the certificates, there was no due process violation because, among other procedural protections, the pilots were afforded an \" ex parte , in camera judicial review\" of the entire administrative record.", "In addition to the use of ex parte , in camera review, several courts have examined claimed SSI exemptions using a more traditional analysis under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The statutes authorizing the classification of information as SSI have been held to be an \"exemption 3 statute\" thereby, authorizing the withholding of information sought under the FOIA. Generally speaking, in responding to FOIA requests, the government is required to submit a \" Vaughn Index,\" which is a document that describes withheld or redacted documents and explains why each withheld record is exempt from disclosure.", "Courts that have been faced with Vaughn Indexes claiming protections under the SSI statute have reviewed the sufficiency of the government's explanations and descriptions with mixed results. In Electronic Privacy Information Center v. D.H.S. , the District Court for the District of Columbia held that with respect to one document the court \"does not have enough information to gauge wither TSA document E falls under exemption 3.\" The court noted that the government merely asserted that the documents contained SSI without any additional details. According to the court, while the government is not required to describe the SSI in such detail as to reveal the information, \"they must provide a more adequate description in order to justify the application of the exemption to the withheld material.\" As a result, the court ordered the government to submit a supplemental Vaughn Index with a more detailed description. Conversely, in Judicial Watch, Inc. v. D.O.T. the plaintiffs argued that the government's Vaughn Index was too vague to establish that the withheld documents were covered by exemption 3. The court, noting that the government had submitted a revised Vaughn Index along with supporting documents, cited a government provided affidavit indicating that TSA determined the information to be SSI because its release \"may reveal a systematic vulnerability of the aviation system or a vulnerability of aviation facilities vulnerable to attack.\" Based on the information contained in the revised Vaughn Index and supporting documents, the court concluded that \"DOT has satisfied its burden of establishing that the challenged documents were properly withheld under [FOIA] exemption 3.\" Based on these two reported cases, it appears that the government's ability to withhold information pursuant to SSI depends largely on the adequacy of the explanations that it provides to the court through its Vaughn Index and supporting documentation.", "Finally, there have been several reported cases that have utilized alternative procedures for dealing with information deemed by the government to be SSI. These procedures have included ordering the parties to provide the court with recommended security procedures before proceeding; ordering TSA to file a redacted motion for summary judgment with the court under seal; declining to review a TSA final order classifying information as SSI and advising plaintiffs of their ability to appeal to the Court of Appeals; and finally, ordering that TSA attorneys be present at depositions in order to protect SSI from being disclosed during the questioning of witnesses."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
