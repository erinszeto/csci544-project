Bush that U.S. courts have jurisdiction to hear challenges on behalf of persons detained at the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in connection with the war against terrorism. The Court overturned a ruling that no U.S. court has jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus on behalf of the detainees because they are aliens detained abroad, but left questions involving prisoners' rights and status unanswered. The 9/11 Commission recommended a common coalition approach to such detention. Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), P.L. 109-148, to establish standards for interrogation and to deny detainees access to federal courts to file habeas petitions but allow limited appeals of status determinations and final decisions of military commissions. Congress approved the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA), P.L. 109-366, to authorize military commissions for the prosecution of detainees for war crimes.", "The Bush Administration earlier deemed all of the detainees to be \"unlawful combatants,\" who may, according to Administration officials, be held indefinitely without trial or even if they are acquitted by a military tribunal. Fifteen of the detainees were designated as subject to the President's Military Order of November 13, 2001, making them eligible for trial by military commission. In answer to the Rasul decision, the Pentagon instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals to provide a forum for detainees to challenge their status as \"enemy combatants.\" The Pentagon had earlier announced a plan for annual reviews to determine whether detainees may be released without endangering national security.", "The President's decision to deny the detainees prisoner-of-war (POW) status remains a point of contention, in particular with respect to members of the Taliban, with some arguing that it is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the Geneva Convention for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW), which they assert requires that all combatants captured on the battlefield are entitled to be treated as POWs until an independent tribunal has determined otherwise. The publication of executive branch memoranda documenting the internal debate about the status of prisoners evoked additional criticism of the Bush Administration's legal position. Finally, the Supreme Court's decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld determined that persons captured in Afghanistan in connection with the \"Global War on Terrorism\" are entitled at least to the minimum set of protections accorded by Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.", "This report provides an overview of the law of war and the historical treatment of wartime detainees, in particular the U.S. practice; describes how the detainees' status might affect their rights and treatment; and summarizes activity of the 108th and 109th Congresses related to detention in connection with the war against terrorism.

The decision overturned the holding of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which had accepted the Administration's argument that no U.S. court has jurisdiction to hear petitions for habeas corpus by or on behalf of the detainees because they are aliens and are detained outside the sovereign territory of the United States. In response to the Court's ruling, the Department of Defense (DOD) instituted a new form of tribunal at Guantanamo Bay to allow detainees an opportunity to contest their designation as \"enemy combatants,\" similar to the planned administrative review procedure DOD had announced that would review the necessity of individuals' continued detention.", "Congress approved the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA, or Graham-Levin Amendment) to establish standards for interrogation and to deny detainees access to federal courts to file habeas petitions but allow limited appeals of status determinations and final decisions of military commissions in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. More than a hundred petitions for habeas corpus were already pending in the D.C. Circuit. In the case of accused driver and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a federal judge held the petitioner's ongoing trial by military commission to be illegal, leading the government to suspend temporarily the operation of military tribunals. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision, allowing DOD to restart the military commissions, but the Supreme Court granted certiorari and reversed.", "Two other district judges issued contradictory opinions as to whether the detainees have any rights enforceable in federal court; these decisions also have been appealed. The Administration has filed motions either to dismiss all of these petitions on the basis that the DTA has curtailed the courts' jurisdiction or to convert the cases to appeals subject to the strictures of that Act. The Supreme Court rejected the government's argument that the Hamdan case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the DTA. Congress responded by passing the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which, in addition to providing explicit authority for military commissions, cuts off jurisdiction to hear all habeas cases and other legal actions brought by aliens in relation to their detention as \"unlawful enemy combatants,\" including such cases that are currently pending.", "The detention and treatment of the suspected enemy combatants at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has been a consistent source of friction for the Bush Administration since it began transporting prisoners there in January, 2002. After criticism from human rights organizations and many foreign governments regarding the determination that the Geneva Conventions of 1949 do not apply to the detainees there, President Bush shifted position with an announcement that Taliban fighters are covered by the 1949 Geneva Conventions, while Al Qaeda fighters are not. Taliban fighters are not, however, treated as prisoners of war (POW) because they reportedly fail to meet international standards as lawful combatants. The President had determined that Al Qaeda remains outside the Geneva Conventions because it is not a state and not a party to the treaty. The President proclaimed, in a previously secret memorandum that was issued February 7, 2002, that \"[a]s a matter of policy, the United States Armed Forces shall continue to treat detainees humanely and, to the extent appropriate and consistent with military necessity, in a manner consistent with the principles of Geneva.\"", "The Bush Administration deems all of the detainees to be \"unlawful combatants,\" who may, according to Administration officials, be held indefinitely without trial or even despite their possible acquittal by a military tribunal. The 9/11 Commission, apparently finding the international discord over the treatment and status of the detainees to be harmful to the U.S. effort to thwart terrorism, recommended the development of a common coalition approach toward the detention and humane treatment of captured terrorists. After the Hamdan decision was announced, the Department of Defense issued a memorandum announcing that Al Qaeda detainees were to be considered to be covered by the protections of Common Article 3, and that DoD regulations pertinent to detainee operations, other than those pertaining to military commissions, were understood to comply with Common Article 3. Subordinate departments were requested to review directives and regulations to ensure such compliance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Current Status", "paragraphs": ["Some 380 detainees (including three children under the age of 16 ) have been released from the detention facilities at the U.S. Naval Station in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba , and approximately 85 detainees have been deemed eligible for transfer. The Supreme Court's Hamdan decision and Congress' approval of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (\"MCA\") may have largely resolved the issue of detainees' legal status; however, the treatment of detainees who remain in custody continues to be a source of contention with human rights groups. Some critics contend that the amendments to the War Crimes Act effectively permit harsh treatment that falls below the international standard.", "The administrative proceedings implemented to review the status of detainees, called the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT), appear designed to satisfy the Supreme Court's Hamdi ruling, although the government has argued in court that the Guant\u00e1namo detainees, as aliens detained outside the territory of the United States, are not entitled to any process beyond the initial screening process used to determine whether detainees should be sent to Guant\u00e1namo. Although Congress has not authorized or required CSRT proceedings, it has likely ratified their use by providing in the MCA a definition of \"unlawful enemy combatant\" that includes persons who have been determined to be such by these tribunals and by providing for the limited review of CSRT determinations in federal court. Critics view the CSRT proceedings as insufficient to satisfy Hamdi , which many believe applies to all detainees regardless of citizenship and place of detention. CSRTs were completed for all detainees and confirmed the status of 520 enemy combatants. Thirty-eight detainees were determined by CSRTs not to be enemy combatants. The first round of Administrative Review Boards (ARBs) resulted in decisions to release 14 detainees, to transfer 120 detainees, and to continue detaining 329 detainees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critics' Views", "paragraphs": ["Some allied countries and human rights organizations criticized the President's decision as contrary to international law, arguing it relied on an inaccurate interpretation of the Geneva Convention for the Treatment of Prisoners of War (GPW). The U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights (UNHCR) and some human rights organizations argue that all combatants captured on the battlefield are entitled to be treated as POWs until an independent tribunal has determined otherwise. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights Working Group on Arbitrary Detention deemed that the U.S. detention of \"enemy combatants,\" without determining their status in accordance with international law, may be arbitrary. The UNHCR released a report criticizing the U.S. detention policy as inconsistent with U.S. obligations under international law, including humanitarian law and human rights treaties.", "The European Parliament expressed concern about the U.S. detention of persons in Guant\u00e1namo, in 2002, asking the United Nations to pass a resolution requesting the establishment of a tribunal to clarify the detainees' legal status. No action was taken on that request, and European Union countries voted as a bloc against a Cuban resolution calling on the UNHCR to investigate U.S. detention operations at Guantanamo Bay. The European Parliament adopted another resolution in 2004 calling for detainees to be charged, tried, and treated in accordance with international law. In June of 2006, the European Parliament adopted a motion urging the United States to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.", "The Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council adopted a resolution in June, 2003 calling the detention of persons detained in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Afghanistan, and elsewhere \"unlawful,\" noting in particular its concern that children are among the detainees, which it reiterated in April 2005. The Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission adopted precautionary measures with respect to the United States, urging it to take \"urgent measures\" to establish hearings to determine the legal status of the detainees. The United States declined to comply, answering that the Commission has no jurisdiction to enforce the Geneva Conventions, and reiterating the Administration's position that, there being no doubt as to the status of the detainees, individual legal procedures to determine the status of the detainees are unnecessary. On July 28, 2006, the Inter-American Commission adopted a resolution urging the United States to close the detention facility and take other measures. The decision to transfer the prisoners to Guant\u00e1namo Bay has also been criticized as an effort to keep them \"beyond the rule of law.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applicable Law", "paragraphs": ["The Geneva Conventions of 1949 create a comprehensive legal regime for the treatment of detainees in an armed conflict. Members of a regular armed force and certain others, including militias and volunteer corps serving as part of the armed forces, are entitled to specific privileges as POWs. Members of volunteer corps, militias, and organized resistence forces that are not part of the armed services of a party to the conflict are entitled to POW status if the organization (a) is commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates, (b) uses a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, (c) carries arms openly, and (d) conducts its operations in accordance with the laws of war. Groups that do not meet the standards are not entitled to POW status, and their members who commit belligerent acts may be treated as civilians under the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (GC). These \"unprivileged\" or \"unlawful combatants\" may be punished for acts of violence for which legitimate combatants could not be punished. Some have argued that there is implied in the Geneva Conventions a third category comprised of combatants from militias that do not qualify for POW status but also fall outside of the protection for civilians, who may be lawful in the sense that they would not necessarily incur criminal liability for engaging in otherwise lawful combat. The Bush Administration took the position that the Geneva Conventions do not provide any protection to \"unlawful combatants\" and that such persons may be tried by military commission for any act in furtherance of an unlawful belligerency, but stated that the United States treats all such detainees in a manner consistent with the Geneva Conventions protections for prisoners of war.", "The White House's legal position was somewhat clarified by a series of internal documents released by the White House and DOD in response to allegations of detainee abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The memoranda document the internal debate about the applicability of the GPW to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. They do not expressly explain the application of the GPW to the Taliban, whose members would arguably seem to be eligible for POW status as members of the armed forces of Afghanistan under a plain reading of GPW art. 4A(1), but suggest the view that the four criteria in GPW art. 4A(2) apply to regular armed forces as a matter of customary international law. The documents also suggest that Afghanistan, as a \"failed state,\" did not have a functional government with sufficient control over the territory and citizenry to enable it to field a regular army. It is unclear why, under this view, the conflict with the Taliban would continue to qualify as an international war under GPW art. 2 such that art. 4 would remain relevant.", "State practice does not appear to support the conclusion that the armed forces of states or organized rebel forces have been categorically denied eligibility for POW status on the basis that the army did not comply completely with the law of war. Indeed, U.S. practice has been to accord POW status generously to irregulars, to support such status for irregular forces at times, and to raise objections whenever an adversary has sought to deny U.S. personnel POW status based on a general accusation that the U.S. forces were not in compliance with some aspect of the law of war. The Administration also asserted that the Geneva Conventions are obsolete when it comes to dealing with terrorists, but that it would continue to follow the treaties' principles.", "With respect to Al Qaeda fighters, the Administration stated it would not apply the Geneva Conventions because Al Qaeda is a criminal organization and not a state party to the Geneva Conventions. However, the Hamdan decision effectively overruled that decision, finding that at least Common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which provides minimum protection during non-international conflicts for all captives, applies to Al Qaeda."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Law of War", "paragraphs": ["The law of war, also known as the law of armed conflict or humanitarian law, is a subset of international law that has evolved through centuries of efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of war. Recognizing the impossibility of eliminating warfare all together, nations in essence have agreed to abide by rules limiting their conduct in war, in return for the enemy's agreement to abide by the same rules. There are two branches of the law of war: The older of the two branches, known as \"Hague law\" after the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, prescribes the rules of engagement during combat and is based on the key principles of military necessity and proportionality. The humanitarian side of the law, known as \"Geneva law,\" emphasizes human rights and responsibilities, including the humane and just treatment of prisoners.", "The legality and proper justification for resorting to war in the first place are a separate legal regime. A principal distinction exists between the law of conduct during war\u2014 jus in bello \u2014and international law regulating when going to war is justified\u2014 jus ad bellum . Parties to an armed conflict retain the same rights and obligations without regard to which party initiated hostilities and whether that conduct is justifiable under international law. Otherwise, each party would routinely regard its enemy as unlawfully engaging in war and would thus feel justified in taking whatever measures might be seen as necessary to accomplish its defeat.", "If the law of war is to have any effect in restraining the conduct of belligerents, there must be both inducements for adherence to it and punishment for failure to adhere. One incentive for parties to adhere to the rules is the promise that their members will receive humane treatment and some legal privileges at the hands of the enemy if they are captured. Reciprocity serves as a primary motivator, but is not an absolute requirement for adherence; a derogation from the rules by one party does not excuse breaches by another, although reprisal in proportion may be permissible. Were this not the case, any deviation from the letter of the law could be invoked to justify wholesale abandonment of the law of war, causing the conflict to degenerate into the kind of barbarity the law of war aims to mitigate. Reprisals may not be taken against POWs or other protected persons.", "Some experts argue that in keeping with the purpose of humanitarian law, that is, to protect civilians and reduce the needless suffering of combatants, humanitarian law should be interpreted as broadly as possible in favor of individual rights and protections, to include rights of irregular combatants who comply to the extent possible with the law of war. Under this view, no one falls completely outside the protection of the Geneva Conventions during an armed conflict. Others would adhere rigidly to their interpretation of the letter of the law, denying rights to irregular combatants in order to deter the formation of resistance movements and to avoid legitimizing their belligerent acts. Proponents of this view argue the treatment of detainees not clearly covered by the Conventions is entirely at the discretion of the detaining power. However, states dealing with insurgents and armed resistance groups have typically denied that a state of war exists, treating rebels as common criminals and trying them in civil court for any belligerent acts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Characterizing the Conflict", "paragraphs": ["In order to determine the legal status of the detainees, it is first necessary to determine whether an armed conflict exists, and if so, whether that conflict is \"international\" or \"non-international.\" The type of armed conflict depends upon the status of the parties to the conflict and the nature of the hostilities. The status and rights of individuals depend, in turn, on the relationship of those individuals to the parties to the conflict. It may also become important to determine the temporal and geographical boundaries of the armed conflict\u2014for the most part, the Geneva Conventions would not apply to conduct that occurred prior to the onset or after the end of the armed conflict, nor would it apply to conduct occurring on the territory of a non-party to the conflict. Whether the territory on which the punishable conduct occurred is considered \"occupied\" or \"partially occupied\" may also be relevant to determining the status of detainees and the law applicable to them.", "The Geneva Conventions apply in full to \"all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them,\" or in \"any cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party.\" Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applies to internal hostilities serious enough to amount to an armed conflict, although the parties are encouraged to adopt voluntarily the remaining provisions with respect to each other. In the case of sporadic violence involving unorganized groups and uprisings, the law of war is not implicated, although the law of basic human rights continues to apply.", "The classification of an armed conflict presents few difficulties in the case of a declared war between two states. Such a conflict would clearly qualify as an international armed conflict to which the Geneva Conventions would apply in their entirety. Such conflicts have also become rare. The term \"internal armed conflict\" generally describes a civil war taking place within the borders of a state, featuring an organized rebel force capable of controlling at least some territory. Internal conflicts may be more difficult to classify as such because states frequently deny that a series of violent acts amounts to an armed conflict. Classifying a conflict in which a foreign state intervenes in an internal armed conflict creates an even more complex puzzle. Some theorists consider an armed conflict to remain internal where a foreign state intervenes on behalf of a legitimate government to put down an insurgency, whereas foreign intervention on behalf of a rebel movement would \"internationalize\" the armed conflict. Under this view, the war in Afghanistan was an internal conflict between the Taliban and Northern Alliance troops until U.S. forces intervened, at which point the conflict became international. When the Taliban ceded control of the government, the conflict may have reverted to an internal conflict, because U.S. forces then became aligned with the government of the state. Others view virtually any hostilities causing international repercussions to be international for the purposes of the Geneva Conventions.", "According to the official commentary of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the conditions for an international war are satisfied whenever any difference arises leading to the use of armed force between the militaries of two states. Both the United States and Afghanistan are signatories to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949. If the Taliban was, at the onset of the conflict, the government of Afghanistan and its soldiers were the regular armed forces, it would appear that the conflict met the Geneva Conventions' definition of an international armed conflict. However, only three states ever recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. While it is not necessary for the governments of states engaging in hostilities to recognize each other, the rules are less clear where virtually no country recognizes a government.", "Because the use of force by private persons rather than organs of a state has not traditionally constituted an \"act of war,\" it is arguable that refusing to recognize the Taliban as a de facto government of a state would preclude the United States from prosecuting the September 11 terrorist attacks as \"war crimes.\" After all, it has been suggested that international terrorism might be considered to amount to armed conflict for the purposes of the law of war only if a foreign government is involved. The level of state support of terrorism required to incur state responsibility under international law is a matter of debate. Denying that any state is involved in the terrorist acts that precipitated the armed conflict could call into question the United States' treatment of those attacks as violations of the law of war and for treating the global war on terrorism as an international armed conflict.", "Some observers cite additional policy grounds for treating the armed conflict as international. To treat it as an internal conflict could have implications for U.S. and allied troops. No one would be entitled to POW status or \"protected person\" status under the third and fourth Geneva Conventions, although Common Article 3 would remain in force for all parties. U.S. and coalition soldiers may be placed at risk of capture in Afghanistan or elsewhere depending on how the conflict proceeds. The President's decision to apply the Geneva Conventions to the Taliban but deny their application to Al Qaeda as a non-party may be an implicit recognition that the armed conflict is an international one, at least with respect to the Taliban.", "It is also possible to view the conflict with the Taliban as separate from the conflict with Al Qaeda. Al Qaeda would have to qualify as a belligerent in its own right, however, which most observers argue it does not. Because an armed conflict can only exist where (at least) two belligerents are in opposition, the present hostilities between the United States and Al Qaeda would not seem to qualify as an armed conflict under international law. The difficulty under this view is that it may either lend an air of legitimacy to Al Qaeda or cast doubt on the legality of the United States' military actions against Al Qaeda.", "Another possibility is that the war on terrorism is forging new international law by recognizing or creating a new form of armed conflict, in which a state is authorized to use armed force against members of a para-military group in self-defense outside its own territory, not only to deflect immediate attacks but also to initiate attacks against members of the group and their leaders in order to weaken or eradicate it, at least so long as force is used on the territory of a consenting government or territory not under the firm control of any national government. Under this view, the traditional nexus between the rights and the obligations of belligerents appear to be severed, so that a state may wage a full-fledged war against persons not entitled to participate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Authority to Detain during an International Armed Conflict", "paragraphs": ["The treatment of all persons who fall into the hands of the enemy during an armed conflict depends upon the status of the person as determined under the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.

The right to detain enemy combatants is not based on the supposition that the prisoner is \"guilty\" as an enemy for any crimes against the Detaining Power, either as an individual or as an agent of the opposing state. POWs are detained for security purposes only, to remove those soldiers from further participation in combat. The detention is not a form of punishment. The Detaining Power may punish enemy soldiers and civilians for crimes committed prior to their capture as well as during captivity, but only after a fair trial in accordance with the relevant convention and other applicable international law. Failure to accord prisoners a fair trial is a grave breach under article 130 of GPW and article 146 of GC.", "Neutral and non-belligerent signatory countries also have an obligation to intern members of belligerent armed forces under the Geneva Conventions of 1949.

Declarations of \"no quarter\" were forbidden because an enemy soldier who had become hors de combat \u2014incapacitated due to injury, illness, surrender or capture\u2014no longer posed a danger to combatants. Killing such persons or causing their needless suffering was considered to serve no valid military purpose, the objective being the incapacitation rather than the annihilation of enemy. The privilege of being held as a prisoner of war was not extended to brigands, pirates, looters and pillagers not associated with the uniformed army of any state. Such persons were considered common criminals acting for personal gain rather than agents of a state, and they could be summarily shot.

Saboteurs retain the protection of the GC, and are entitled to a fair and regular trial before punishment may be administered.

Mercenaries are persons who are not members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict but participate in combat for personal gain. They may be authorized, or at least encouraged to fight by a party to the conflict, but their allegiance to the authorizing party is conditioned on payment rather than obedience and loyalty. It is seen as questionable whether mercenaries can serve as valid agents of a party to the conflict, or are, rather, mere \"contract killers,\" especially considering they could just as easily switch sides to accept a better offer; may be operating in pursuit of different objectives from those of the party to the conflict; and may have an incentive for keeping the conflict live.

It appears to be generally recognized that the fighters do not believe themselves to be serving Afghanistan as a country but are serving either the Taliban or Al Qaeda, perhaps both, for ideological reasons. The United States has made it clear that it is not fighting against the Afghan people, but instead considers the Taliban and Al Qaeda to be the enemies.

In some conflicts, irregulars who could not prove their affiliation to an official military were summarily shot as franc-tireurs . The lack of international consensus with regard to the treatment of insurgents and partisans contributed to the international impetus to codify the law of war, but has not been resolved and remains a source of contention among states parties to the resulting treaties. Guerrilla tactics do not appear to be in and of themselves violative of international law. It could be argued that conventional style warfare conducted by irregular soldiers is no worse. Under this view, members of irregular armies who carry out ordinarily lawful belligerent acts, or who have not personally carried out any hostile acts, while not necessarily entitled to POW privileges, would not be punishable as unlawful combatants.

Members of other volunteer corps, militias, and organized resistence forces belonging to a party to the conflict were entitled to POW status only if the organization met the four criteria in GPW article 4A(2). The regular armed forces of a state, even if it is a government or \"authority\" not recognized by the opposing party, need not necessarily satisfy the four criteria in order for their members to be entitled to POW status under the GPW art. 4A(2).

If the Taliban were not the armed forces of Afghanistan, it would seem that such a determination would have rendered the conflict non-international from the outset, in which case GPW art. 4 was entirely irrelevant.

The language may have been included in order to ensure that members of the United States National Guard, for example, are protected.

The phrase was apparently included to address resistance movements of the type that sprang up in many occupied territories during World War II.

The court upheld the civil convictions, holding that since no government with which Israel was then at war claimed responsibility for the actions of the PLFP, its members were not entitled to be treated as POWs.

United States officials have argued that the Taliban and Al Qaeda are intimately connected. That connection is arguably what makes the Taliban responsible for the terrorist acts of Al Qaeda, and thus subject to military action.

Unfortunately, there is not much legal precedent that can aid in interpreting and applying the criteria.", "The four criteria have their roots in the earliest expressions of the laws of war, beginning with the Brussels Declaration and continuing nearly unchanged in the Hague Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 1907, and are repeated in the GPW. However, this may be more a reflection of nations' inability to agree on a better formula than an indication of the solidity of their foundation. The criteria may reflect the customs of war as they existed among the European countries who signed the original treaties, but were not viewed at the time as universal. The criteria originated as a compromise between states with strong standing armies and weaker states whose defense might depend on armed citizens. The only real effect of the enumeration of the criteria at the Hague Convention was to prohibit ill treatment of those who do not meet them.", "Historically, the most important consideration given to POW status has been whether there is evidence that they serve a government or political entity that exercises authority over them. For example, the United States practice as early as 1900, during the Philippine Insurrection following the Spanish-American War, was to accord prisoner of war status to members of the insurgent army recognized by the Philippine government who complied \"in general\" with the four conditions. Members of guerrilla bands not part of the regular forces were punished severely for acts of violence. A similar policy was adopted by the British during the South African War, although the first inclination was to declare that, inasmuch as the newly annexed Orange River Colony was British territory, inhabitants who took up arms were to be treated as rebels. Foreign jurists and some prominent British statesman objected to the policy as a \"monstrous proclamation ... absolutely opposed to the first principles of international law and history.\" A new proclamation was issued to declare that only those inhabitants who had not been a continuous part of the fighting would be treated as rebels. British forces punished as \"marauders\" those who carried out acts of hostility who did not belong to \"an organized body authorized by a recognized Government.\"", "On the other hand, toward the end of the Mexican War, in 1847, United States forces changed from a more tolerant policy toward irregulars to one of utmost severity. By that time, warfare by bands of guerrillas sanctioned by the late Mexican government had become the primary means of resistance. Once the war degenerated to the point where the guerrillas more resembled murderers and highway robbers than soldiers, the U.S. Secretary of War directed General Winfield Scott to adopt a policy of less forbearance than had hitherto been observed. In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the German commanders refused to treat any irregular fighters as lawful combatants, even those who possessed papers proving their affiliation with the government. In 1914, when the German army invaded Belgium, it refused to recognize the citizen defense of yet unoccupied territories as a valid \"people's war\" qualifying for belligerent status because the Belgian government did not adequately organize the forces and failed to supply the civilian fighters with proper distinguishing emblems.", "It was a fundamental part of the law of war that only combatants authorized to fight on behalf of a state party to a conflict were allowed to participate in the hostilities. It has never been permitted to wage war against civilians. Civilians could become lawful military objectives only if and for so long as they took up arms against a belligerent. The four criteria are meant to ensure that only persons authorized to fight on behalf of a higher authority who is responsible for their conduct will participate, excluding civilians as both combatants and targets.", "Supporters of granting POW status to Taliban soldiers have argued that the text of the Conventions should be read literally. That the four criteria are listed only under the sub-paragraph for volunteer groups and militias not forming part of the regular army of a state indicates that there is no similar test for those whose status as members of a state military force is not in doubt. Others, however, have argued that regular soldiers must already meet those criteria under customary international law, and the drafters of the GPW felt it would be superfluous to list the criteria with regard to regular armies. Article 1 of the 1907 Hague Convention could be read to apply the four criteria to all military forces. However, inasmuch as that article states that not only the rights, but the laws and duties of war as well, apply only to the parties it lists, such an interpretation could lead to the conclusion that regular armies could evade their obligations under the law of war simply by not fulfilling the four conditions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "(a) Commanded by a Person Responsible for his Subordinates", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. military doctrine, the responsible command element is fulfilled if:", "the commander of the corps is a commissioned officer of the armed forces or is a person of position and authority or if the members of the militia or volunteer corps are provided with documents, badges, or other means of identification to show that they are officers, noncommissioned officers, or soldiers so that there may be no doubt that they are not persons acting on their own responsibility. State recognition, however, is not essential, and an organization may be formed spontaneously and elect its own officers.", "The key to the first element is that the subject is acting on behalf of and on the command of a higher authority.

It is not necessary to inform the enemy of the distinctive sign, although it may be desirable to do so in order to avoid misunderstanding.", "The GPW does not clarify what is meant by \"fixed\" or by \"distinctive,\" despite the fact that the same language gave rise to disputes as it was interpreted in earlier treaties. Presumably, the requirement for a sign to be \"fixed\" was meant to prevent fighters from removing them easily, but it is unlikely the requirement was meant to remain in force even when no military operations were ongoing. Similarly, there is nothing to explain how great a distance must be before the distinction need no longer be discernible. Methods of locating and of camouflaging military targets, including soldiers, make it questionable whether the standards are the same today as they were when the original Conventions were drafted, if such standards ever existed.", "The purpose for requiring combatants to distinguish themselves from civilians is to protect civilians from being targeted. Combatants who are unable to distinguish enemy combatants from civilians might resort to firing upon all human beings in the area of operations. There may be other reasons for enforcing the obligation to identify oneself as a combatant that serve tactical purposes rather than purely humanitarian ends. Requiring irregulars to display a mark aids the opposing army in targeting them and also impedes the irregulars' ability to effect a surprise attack. The use of different uniforms to distinguish the forces also helps leaders identify their own troops during combat, and to distinguish friendly from enemy soldiers. It has also been suggested that the requirement to wear a uniform is a remnant of long outdated forms of warfare, in which closely ranked armies opposed each other across open fields. Modern army uniforms are designed to make the wearer difficult to distinguish from the surrounding foliage from any distance. It has been pointed out that the requirement for irregulars is not more stringent than the standard set by regular armies.", "Although the lack of uniform can be detrimental to a soldier who falls into the hands of the enemy, it has not been the case historically that all fighters lacking a uniform or some other identifying mark have been denied prisoner status. According to FM 27-10, the lack of uniform brings the following result:", "Members of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces lose their right to be treated as prisoners of war whenever they deliberately conceal their status in order to pass behind the military lines of the enemy for the purpose of gathering military information or for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property. Putting on civilian clothes or the uniform of the enemy are examples of concealment of the status of a member of the armed forces.", "For a combatant to engage in hostilities while disguising his identity in order to deceive the enemy thus could amount to perfidious conduct in violation of the law of war. Guerrillas and terrorists therefore lose any claim they might have to protected status if they place the civilian populace at risk. However, a soldier not engaging in hostilities probably has not committed a violation by using civilian disguise merely to evade detection by the enemy. Soldiers who belong to armies that do not wear full uniforms are not necessarily engaging in perfidious conduct as long as they bear arms openly and do not hide their belligerent status.", "Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld has suggested that the Taliban never fulfilled the requirement because they \"did not wear distinctive signs, insignias, symbols or uniforms. To the contrary, far from seeking to distinguish themselves from the civilian population of Afghanistan, they sought to blend in with civilian non-combatants, hiding in mosques and populated areas.\" Critics of the Defense Department's position point out that neither the Taliban nor the Northern Alliance had ever worn uniforms or any distinctive sign, other than the black turban reportedly worn by members of the Taliban and distinctive headscarves worn by members of the Northern Alliance. The failure to wear what Western commanders might regard as proper military dress may be more a matter of custom than perfidy. Since most of the hand-to-hand combat was conducted by the Northern Alliance, with U.S. forces supplying intelligence and fire support from the air or at a great distance, the critics argue, the Pentagon's position that the lack of uniforms makes \"unlawful combatants\" of the Taliban force is less persuasive. The very success of the armed forces in quickly routing the enemy with virtually no U.S. casualties may also make the argument somewhat more difficult to sustain.

However, the somewhat lenient stance just quoted reflects the fact that the \"concept of the laws and customs of war is rather vague and subject to variation as the forms of war evolve.\" The imprecision of the condition could lead to its abuse; a relatively minor violation of the law of war could be used as a pretext to deny POW status to an entire army, which would arguably give the members of an irregular army little incentive to follow any of the rules if adherence to a particular rule is outside their capability.", "One of the unresolved issues, then, is whether the criteria apply to each soldier as an individual or to the army as a whole. In other words, does the violation of a rule by one soldier result in the failure to qualify for POW status for the rest of the group, even though some members might scrupulously follow all of the rules? Can individual soldiers still qualify for POW status even though their leaders do not strictly enforce the rules over all subordinates? A member of a regular force does not lose his right to be treated as a POW by violating the law of war, so it might seem inconsistent to give members of irregular groups who might otherwise qualify harsher treatment.

The provision is new to the 1949 GPW and was inserted at the request of the ICRC. Prior to the inclusion of this language, summary decisions were often made by soldiers of relatively low rank on the battlefield, leading to instances where a captive could be presumed unlawful and executed on the spot, with any investigation to follow. Under the 1949 GPW, combatants are presumed to be entitled to POW status unless formally declared otherwise. The United States has in the past interpreted this language as requiring an individual assessment of status before privileges can be denied.

Under the MACV directive, the captured North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong fighters were accorded POW status upon capture. For prisoners who were not obviously entitled to POW status, a tribunal of three or more officers was convened to determine their status. \"Irregulars\" were divided into three groups: guerrillas, self-defense force, and secret self-defense force. Members of these groups could qualify for POW status if captured in regular combat, but were denied such status if caught in an act of \"terrorism, sabotage or spying.\" Those not treated as POWs were treated as civil defendants, and were accorded the substantive and procedural protections of the GC.

Detained persons were later classified as POWs, retained persons, or civilian internees, and were allowed to communicate with their next of kin within seven days of capture. Seventeen former members of the government who were accused of taking part in the coup attempt, however, were initially detained incommunicado and interrogated on board U.S. vessels.

Ordinarily, a preliminary determination of each captive's status would be made by military police with the assistance of military intelligence personnel and interpreters during the processing procedure at the battlefield division collection point.

Despite the reports of widespread abuse of prisoners of war at the hands of enemy interrogators, there is very little case precedent defining the boundaries of acceptable conduct. A British military court convicted several German Luftwaffe officers of improperly interrogating British POWs at a special interrogation camp, where it was charged the officers used excessive heating of cells in order to induce prisoners to give war information of a kind they were not bound by the Convention to disclose. The charges also alleged the officers had threatened prisoners that their failure to provide sufficient answers could be seen by the Gestapo as evidence that the prisoners were saboteurs. The military court expressed its agreement with the defense's position that interrogation was not unlawful under the Geneva Convention then in force, that obtaining information by trick was likewise not unlawful, and that interrogation of a wounded prisoner was not itself unlawful without evidence that methods used amounted to physical or mental ill-treatment.", "It appears to be a common practice for militaries to interrogate prisoners as soon as possible after capture to exploit their knowledge concerning tactical positions and plans. There is no express right to counsel during such interrogation; however, the case may be different where the information sought is of the type that could incriminate the prisoner personally for any crime. The GPW forbids the use of coercion to induce a POW to admit guilt, and POWs who are accused of crimes have the right to counsel. It may thus be argued that POWs are entitled to some form of exclusionary rule to keep a forced confession from introduction into evidence at trial.", "Common Article 3 does not supply separate rules or standards for interrogation, but the prohibition on ill-treatment continues to apply during interrogations.
