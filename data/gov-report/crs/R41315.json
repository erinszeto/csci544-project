Some individual sections of PPACA are expected to create more than one new entity, the number of entities created pursuant to some sections of the legislation is contingent upon other factors, the requirements in more than one section may be satisfied by a single new entity, and some new entities may be created to implement the legislation even though they are not specifically mentioned in PPACA.", "The Appendix to this report identifies dozens of sections of PPACA that create or require the establishment of new entities, but some of those sections are expected to create more than one new office or advisory body to implement the legislation. For example, Section 10334(b) of PPACA (\"Minority Health\") requires the heads of six separate agencies within HHS to each establish their own offices of minority health. Other provisions in the legislation may result in an indeterminate number of new organizations. For example: ", "Section 1002 of PPACA (\"Health Insurance Consumer Information\") refers to an \"independent office of health insurance consumer assistance, or an ombudsman\" that state governments must designate to be eligible to receive a grant. Because it is not clear how many states will seek such grants, it is unclear how many of these offices will be established. Section 1323(d) of the legislation requires state governments to establish or designate public or non-profit \"state advisory councils,\" but exempts states that opt out of the program. Because the number of states that will opt out is currently unknown, it is unclear how many state advisory councils will be established. Section 5208(b) states that nurse-managed health clinics that apply for a grant must ensure that a \"community advisory committee\" will be established. Because it is unknown how many such clinics will apply for a grant, the number of these committees is also unknown. Section 6301(a) of PPACA says that the Patient-Centered Research Institute \"may appoint permanent or ad hoc expert advisory panels as determined appropriate.\" How many such panels will be \"determined appropriate\" by the institute is currently unclear.", "It is also possible that one new entity could satisfy multiple PPACA requirements. For example, Section 2951 of PPACA (\"Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs\") contains two separate requirements for the Secretary of HHS to establish advisory bodies in relation to early childhood home visitation programs conducted with grants\u2014(1) one body that obtains recommendations regarding the technical assistance provided to entities that are required to develop and implement an improvement plan (i.e., those that do not demonstrate improvement in at least four of six specified areas); and (2) another body that makes recommendations on the design and plan for the evaluation of statewide needs assessments and grants. Given that both advisory bodies are required in relation to different elements of the same program (technical assistance and evaluation), it is possible that one body could perform both tasks.", "Some PPACA requirements may be satisfied by existing entities. For example, Section 1104(b) states that a required review committee on operating rules for health information transactions can be the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics or \"any appropriate committee as determined by the Secretary.\" The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics has been in operation for more than 55 years. Other new entities were created by eliminating existing entities and transferring functions. For example, Section 3509(a) of the legislation establishes an Office on Women's Health within the Office of the Secretary of HHS, transferring all functions and authorities of an existing Office on Women's Health from the Public Health Service. Also, Section 5103 of PPACA requires the Secretary of HHS to create a National Center for Health Workforce Analysis, transferring the responsibilities and resources of the existing National Center for Health Workforce Analysis in the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within HHS to the new center within 180 days after enactment (i.e., by September 19, 2010). ", "In addition to the entities that PPACA specifically creates, requires others to create, or authorizes, other entities have been established administratively to implement the legislation, and others may be established in the future. For example, on April 19, 2010, HHS established an Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight to implement many of the provisions in the legislation that address private health insurance. PPACA does not mention such an office. According to the office's website,", "Our office is responsible for ensuring compliance with the new insurance market rules, such as the prohibitions on rescissions and on pre-existing condition exclusions for children that take effect this year. It will oversee the new medical loss ratio rules and will assist states in reviewing insurance rates. It will provide guidance and oversight for the state-based insurance exchanges. It will also administer the temporary high-risk pool program and the early retiree reinsurance program, and compile and maintain data for an internet portal providing information on insurance options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointments and Appropriations Will Allow PPACA Entities to Function", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, the language in PPACA appears to have created certain entities and advisory bodies as of the date that the legislation was enacted. For example, Section 3201(a) of PPACA states that \"There is created within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation ... to carry out the duties described in this section.\" Section 3403(a) states that \"There is established an independent board to be known as the 'Independent Medicare Advisory Board.'\"", "In other cases, PPACA appears to require someone else to create these new entities. For example, Section 4001(a) states that \"The President shall establish, within the Department of Health and Human Services, a council to be known as the 'National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council.'\" Section 4001(f) requires the President to establish an advisory group to the council within HHS composed of not more than 25 non-federal members to be appointed by the President. Section 3509(a) states that \"The Secretary (of HHS) shall establish within the Office of the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, an office to be known as the Office of Women's Health.\"", "The wording of these provisions notwithstanding, in practical terms, many of these entities will not be able to function until their members are appointed and funds are appropriated or made available for the entities to operate (to the extent that operating funds are required). For example, neither the National Prevention, Health Promotion and Public Health Council nor the advisory group to the council will be able to function until the President acts to convene the council and appoint members to the advisory group. ", "The experience of the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) is instructive in this regard. Congress created ACUS in 1964, but did not provide an appropriation for the agency until 1968, when it was able to begin operations. In 1995, Congress eliminated ACUS, and it went out of existence the next year. In 2004, Congress reauthorized appropriations for ACUS during FY2005 through FY2007, but no appropriations were subsequently provided for those years. As a result, ACUS still did not exist during this period. In July 2008, ACUS was again reauthorized for appropriations for FY2009 through FY2011, and in March 2009, Congress appropriated $1.5 million for ACUS to use during the remainder of FY2009 (i.e., until about six months later at the end of September 2009). However, Professor Paul Verkuil's nomination as chairman of ACUS was not received in the Senate until November 2009, and he was not confirmed until March 2010.

Section 6703(a) establishes the Elder Justice Coordinating Council within the Office of the Secretary of HHS. In other cases, PPACA provides a general description of the new organization, but permits substantial discretion regarding where the new entities are to be positioned. For example, Section 4003(a) of the legislation requires the director of AHRQ to convene a Preventative Services Task Force, but does not specify where that task force is to be located. It does, however, state that the task force is to be \"independent,\" that the task force is not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, and that its members are to be \"not subject to political pressure.\" It goes on to say that AHRQ is to provide ongoing administrative, research, and technical support to the task force. Much more commonly, however, PPACA does not indicate in either specific or general terms where the newly created entities are to be established. As a result, the appointing authorities will be able to make those determinations. For example: Section 5605(b) of the legislation creates a Commission on Key National Indicators, with the commission composed of eight members appointed equally by the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, and the Speaker and the minority leader of the House of Representatives. The commission is to oversee a new national indicators system \"enabled\" by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), make recommendations on how to improve the system, and enter into contracts with NAS. It is also to develop annual reports to Congress and to NAS.

For example: ", "Section 1322 of the legislation requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a \"Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP)\" program to \"foster the creation of qualified nonprofit health insurance issuers to offer qualified health plans in the individual and small group markets in the States in which the issuers are licensed to offer such plans.\" The section also created a 15-member advisory board for the program, and goes on to say that \"There are hereby appropriated, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $6,000,000,000 to carry out this section.\" Section 2951 on \"Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Programs\" requires the Secretary of HHS to establish two advisory panels, and states that \"Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there are appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section\" $100 million for FY2010, $250 million for FY2011, $350 million for FY2012, $400 million for FY2013, and $400 million for FY2014. It goes on to say that \"Funds made available to an eligible entity under this section for a fiscal year shall remain available for expenditure by the eligible entity through the end of the second succeeding fiscal year after award. Any funds that are not expended by the eligible entity during the period in which the funds are available under the preceding sentence may be used for grants to nonprofit organizations under subsection (h)(2)(B).\" Section 3021 requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS, and states that \"There are appropriated, from amounts in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated\" $5 million for FY2010, $10 billion for FY2011 through FY2019, and $10 billion for each subsequent 10-fiscal year period. It also specifies that the $5 million appropriated in FY2010, and not less than $25 million of the funds appropriated in each fiscal year thereafter, shall be available to design, implement, and evaluate payment and service delivery models. Section 3403 of the legislation appropriates $15 million for the Independent Medicare Advisory Board to carry out its duties and functions, and states that this amount should be increased in subsequent fiscal years by the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The section specifies that 60% of the appropriations are to be transferred from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, and the remaining 40% transferred from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. Also, it says that the chairman may not submit a request for appropriations without the prior approval of a majority vote of the board.", "Other PPACA provisions authorize appropriations for the newly created entities, but do not provide those appropriations directly. In these cases, funding must be provided through subsequent action in the annual appropriations process, when the specific budgetary resources being provided are determined. Most of these provisions are general, authorizing \"such sums as may be necessary\" within particular years, or without specifying the time periods covered by the authorization. For example, Section 3509(f) of the legislation requires the Secretary of HHS to establish an Office of Women's Health with the office of the administrator of HRSA, and states that \"there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2014.\"", "More commonly, however, PPACA neither directly provides funding for the newly created entities, nor provides an authorization for appropriation. Whether authorized or not, Congress may elect not to appropriate funds for the operation of certain entities, and may subsequently prohibit general funds for being used for those entities. As noted earlier in this report, if funds are not provided or permitted, it is questionable whether these entities will be able to function. Also, Congress may subsequently place additional conditions on such appropriations, requiring that certain conditions be met to use appropriated funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applicability of General Management Laws", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, Congress has enacted a series of general management laws that are designed to regulate the activities, procedures, and administration of all or most executive branch agencies in such areas as regulatory and information management, personnel management, financial management, procurement, and strategic planning. These management laws include the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA, 5 U.S.C. Appendix); the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA, \u00a7\u00a7 3501-3520); and numerous civil service requirements governing personnel and ethics issues. ", "In some cases, PPACA specifically indicates whether certain of these general management laws apply to new entities and advisory bodies. In particular, several of the advisory bodies created through the legislation are exempted from Section 5 or Section 14 of FACA, or are exempted from the act entirely. For example:", "Section 1322 of PPACA states that the board providing advice to the Secretary of HHS in awarding loans and grants under the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program is exempt from Section 14 of FACA. Section 5101 states that the National Health Care Workforce Commission is to be composed of 15 members appointed by the Comptroller General \"without regard to section 5 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).\" Section 8002(a) states that Section 14 of FACA does not apply to the CLASS Independence Advisory Council. Sections 4003(a) and 4003(b) state that the Preventative Services Task Force and the Community Preventive Services Task Force, respectively, are not subject to FACA.", "Several other sections of the legislation provide exemptions from the PRA, and at least one of those exemptions applies to a new entity created by PPACA. Section 3021(a) (which established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS) states that the PRA \"shall not apply to the testing and evaluation of models or expansion of such models under this section.\" Other sections of PPACA exempt certain organizations from particular requirements in federal civil service laws. For example:", "Section 3403(a) of the legislation states that the chairperson of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board \"may, without regard to the civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate an executive director and such other additional personnel as may be necessary to enable the Board to perform its duties.\" Section 5101(f) states that the National Health Care Workforce Commission may employ and fix the compensation of an executive director (not exceed the rate of basic pay payable for EX-V, which is $145,700 per year in 2010) and such other personnel \"without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service.\" Section 8002(a) states that the members of the CLASS Independence Advisory Council \"shall be appointed by the President without regard to the civil service laws and regulations.\"", "Whether other organizations and advisory bodies created by PPACA would be covered by these or other general management laws may depend on where these entities are located. For example, entities located in the Executive Office of the President are generally less likely to be covered than entities created as or as part of cabinet departments and independent agencies. Also, entities located in the legislative branch are unlikely to be covered by these laws directed at executive branch organizations. However, because the location of many of these entities is not specified in PPACA, it may be impossible to say whether these laws apply to them until they are created."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duration", "paragraphs": ["A few of the new organizations created through PPACA are expected to have limited life spans, and are expected to terminate after fulfilling their missions.

For example:", "Section 5602 of PPACA states that the Secretary of HHS can terminate a negotiated rulemaking committee if the committee is unlikely to reach consensus on a methodology and criteria for designating medically underserved populations and health professions shortage areas. Section 3403(a) states that if a specified joint resolution is enacted by August 17, 2017, then the Independent Medicare Advisory Board and the consumer advisory council created by that section will terminate on August 16, 2018. Section 4305(b) states that the Secretary of HHS is to review the continued need for the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee at least every two years.", "However, most of the new organizations delineated in PPACA appear to be of a more indeterminate life span. The legislation either suggests an ongoing role of the entity, or does not indicate a termination date.

For example:", "Section 1322(b)(3)(C) states that any vacancy on the Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program advisory board \"shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.\" Section 3403(a) states that members of the Independent Medicare Advisory Board must include national experts in such fields as health finance and economics, actuarial science, and health facility management.

The institute is directed to carry out its research agenda through contracts and data collection efforts. The National Health Care Workforce Commission is directed to communicate and coordinate with the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, and Education on related activities administered by one or more of the departments. PPACA also says that the commission is to develop and initiate evaluations of education and training activities to determine whether the demand for health care workers is being met; identify barriers to improved coordination at the federal, state, and local levels and recommend ways to address such barriers; and encourage innovations to address population needs, constant changes in technology, and other environmental factors. ", "Also, it is unclear how GAO will be able to independently audit these entities when the CG has appointed their members.

The roles that these entities are expected to play in the implementation of PPACA vary significantly. Many of the organizations were designed to represent certain constituencies, gather and report information, or coordinate different agencies or groups. Other organizations appear to have more decision making authority, and perhaps as a consequence, are more controversial. For example, the Independent Medicare Advisory Board's recommendations to reduce the rate of growth in Medicare spending are required to be implemented by the Secretary of HHS unless Congress approves an alternative proposal. Some observers have already expressed concerns about the amount of power given to this board. ", "Congress has a range of options as it attempts to oversee the creation and operation of the entities established as a result of PPACA, and the nature of that oversight will likely vary somewhat depending on how the relevant statutory provisions are written. If the legislation delineates when and where the new entities are to be created, how they are to be staffed and operate, and what they are to accomplish, congressional oversight can focus on whether those statutory requirements have been met. On the other hand, if PPACA is silent with regard to these types of issues, then the nature of congressional oversight will likely be different, and may focus on whether these new offices and advisory bodies are being established at all, whether they are duplicative of each other, and whether they are contributing to the overall purposes of the legislation. Whether specific or general, oversight of the implementation of PPACA can provide Congress with the information needed to decide whether the legislation needs to be changed in the future.
