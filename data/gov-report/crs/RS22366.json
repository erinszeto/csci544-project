{"id": "RS22366", "title": "Military Support to the Severely Disabled: Overview of Service Programs", "released_date": "2007-03-29T00:00:00", "summary": ["Ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have caused serious injuries to some military personnel. Many have been returned to medical facilities in the U.S., especially Walter Reed Army Medical Center, the National Naval Medical Center, and Brooke Army Medical Center. These severe and traumatic injuries\u2014including amputations, burns, blindness, brain injury, and paralysis\u2014often create significant hardships for the affected individuals that make independent living difficult or impossible. For example, an injured service member may need extensive physical therapy, transportation assistance, and job retraining in order to make the transition back to civilian life. In 2003 and 2004, some pointed out inadequacies in the military's ability to provide these services to its seriously injured personnel. Members of Congress have frequently expressed concern about the level of care for these wounded warriors and their family members. The Department of Defense (DOD) and each of the military services have established new programs to care for the severely disabled, ensuring rehabilitative assistance and easing the transition back to civilian life. Congress has followed these initiatives with interest and recently directed DOD to develop policies and procedures to standardize these programs. This report examines the background for the new initiatives and provides a status of each program, including contact information. This report will be updated as these programs continue to evolve and mature."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As of March 26, 2007, a total of 25,320 military personnel had been classified as Wounded in Action (WIA) in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).

The remaining 11,450 (45.2%) required longer treatment in the area of conflict or were evacuated to regional military hospital facilities in Kuwait, Spain, or Germany.

These FSTs, each with four surgeons, have been deployed further forward than in past conflicts in order to directly support combat forces and to provide emergency surgical intervention and evacuation to a Combat Support Hospital (CSH). Two CSHs with four sites now exist in Iraq. These are 248-bed hospitals with six operating tables, some specialty surgery services, and radiology and laboratory facilities. After three days at a CSH, patients may be evacuated to one of three regional military hospitals in Kuwait, Spain, or Germany. Those requiring more than 30 days of treatment will be initially evacuated to major medical centers in the United States.", "Typically, seriously injured military personnel are evacuated to the Army's Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, DC, the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, or to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX, which specializes in burn treatment.

The MSI Center is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for service members and their families. It provides a \"safety net\" for information referral and tracking, advocacy for financial problems, education and training, job placement, accommodations, and personal/family counseling. The Center is currently staffed with approximately 10 \"care managers\" who are registered nurses, licensed clinical social workers, or other master's level health care specialists, all with experience in issues relating to disabled personnel. This core staff is augmented with representatives from the military services, Veterans Administration, Department of Labor and the Transportation Security Administration. An additional 19 \"counselor-advocates\" are available regionally at or near military medical treatment facilities and military installations to provide local support by helping connect families to resources in the hospital or the surrounding community.
