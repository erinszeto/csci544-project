NIAA mandates that agencies must share those records with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for inclusion in a computer index accessible to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

As a result, such persons are prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition. In the past, Congress has considered legislation that would redefine \"mental incompetency\" for the purposes of gun control, such that firearms ineligibility based on a person's mental incompetency would only be based on an involuntary commitment to a mental institution or finding by a magistrate or judicial authority ruling that the beneficiary is a danger to themselves or others.", "Since the release of this report, the House has passed a bill ( H.R. 1181 ) that would clarify the conditions under which veterans and survivors who are beneficiaries of programs administered by the VA may be treated as \"adjudicated as a mental defective.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brady Act, NICS, and Firearms Ineligibility", "paragraphs": ["As amended by the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, 1993 (Brady Act), the Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) requires background checks to be completed for all unlicensed persons seeking to obtain firearms from federally licensed gun dealers (otherwise referred to as federal firearms licensees, or FFLs).

These discussions were largely led by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the agency principally responsible for administering and enforcing federal gun control laws. On June 27, 1997, the ATF promulgated a final rule defining the following terms:", "\"Adjudicated as a mental defective\" includes a determination by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority that a person, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence or a mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease, (1) is a danger to himself or others, or (2) lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs. The term also includes (1) a finding of insanity by a court in a criminal case and (2) those persons found incompetent to stand trial or found not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility pursuant to articles 50a and 72b of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C.

Under current VA procedures, an individual is considered \"mentally incompetent\" if he or she lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her own affairs for reasons related to injury or disease (under 38 C.F.R. \u00a73.353). In a proposed rulemaking, the ATF opined that the inclusion of \"mentally incompetent\" in the definition of \"mental defective\" was wholly consistent with the legislative history of the 1968 Gun Control Act. ", "In the wake of the December 2012, Newtown, CT, mass shooting, the ATF issued proposed regulations to clarify further individuals who might fall under this definition. This proposed regulation has not been made final. It is significant to note that the NICS index is not intended to be a registry of all individuals diagnosed with a mental illness. The vacated SSA rule calls into question, who ought to be prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms and ammunition, among those persons deemed mentally incompetent for the purposes of federal benefit claims processing?

Due to his disturbing on-campus behavior, the assailant had previously been evaluated by health care professionals and ordered by a judge to undergo \"outpatient\" mental health treatment, because he was deemed to be a threat to himself or others. At that time, however, Virginia state law only referred the subjects of \"inpatient\" court orders for such treatment to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index. Following this massacre, the Virginia governor, now-Senator Timothy Kaine, reviewed the state statute and determined that henceforward subjects of either court-ordered inpatient or outpatient mental health care under such circumstances would be referred to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index.", "In response to the Virginia Tech mass shooting, Congress passed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA). This act includes provisions designed to encourage states to make available to the Attorney General certain records related to persons who are disqualified from acquiring firearms, particularly disqualifying records related to mental health adjudications, as well as domestic violence misdemeanor convictions and restraining orders. To accomplish this, the act establishes a framework of incentives and disincentives whereby the Attorney General is authorized to either waive a grant match requirement or reduce a law enforcement assistance grant depending upon a state's compliance with the act's goals of bringing such firearms-related disqualifying records online. ", "During congressional debate, however, some Members expressed opposition to the NIAA based on the assertion that, under these amendments, any veteran who was or had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and was found to be a \"danger to himself or others would have his gun rights taken away ... forever.\" Members of Congress included a provision in NIAA that required agencies to inform a claimant beforehand that they could lose their gun rights and privileges if they are found to be mentally incompetent as a condition of a benefit program's administration and eligibility. In addition, as under the state grant provisions, NIAA required those referring agencies to establish a firearms disabilities relief program, whereby any individual referred to the NICS index for reasons related to mental incompetency would be able to petition to have his or her gun rights and privileges restored, if and when he or she had overcome the incapacities that led to the initial finding.", "Thirty-two states and the VA have established disability relief programs under NIAA.

As mentioned above, a VA beneficiary would have had the option to request such a review from this board or from a court of competent jurisdiction. Under the Manchin-Toomey provision, the board would have been able to consider the individual's honorable discharge or decoration in determining whether he or she \"cannot safely use, carry, possess, or store firearms due to mental incompetency.\" A beneficiary who received a determination from the board also would have been permitted to seek judicial review in federal court of the board's decision.

In addition, SSA planned to inform the affected individual of his or her ability to request relief from the federal firearms prohibitions at any time after SSA's adjudication became final."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Affected Individuals Would Have Had Their Records Removed from the NICS?", "paragraphs": ["SSA planned to notify the Attorney General that an affected individual's record should be removed if (1) the individual were later capable of managing his or her benefit payments, (2) the individual died, (3) SSA received information that it reported the record to the NICS in error, or (4) the agency granted the individual's request for relief under the new rule. In requesting relief, an affected individual would have been required prove that he or she was not likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and such relief would not have been contrary to the public interest. Affected individuals denied relief by SSA would have been able to file a petition seeking judicial review in U.S. district court."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, Congress has passed legislation to encourage state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to submit prohibiting records to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index for individuals who have been \"adjudicated as a mental defective,\" including some federal benefit claimants deemed to be too mentally incompetent to contract or handle their own affairs. Under the GCA, such persons are prohibited from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition. The legislative record suggests that some Members of Congress have taken issue with the current regulatory definition of \"adjudicated as a mental defective,\" while other Members would prefer to have it codified. ", "The VA has implemented the Brady Act and NIAA and submitted prohibiting records on beneficiaries \"who because of injury or disease lack the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs.\" After the December 2012 Newtown, CT, tragedy, the Obama Administration directed the SSA to administer the Brady Act and NIAA in a similar manner. ", "The SSA adopted a final rule that was not completely parallel to the VA's administration of these laws, in that it would have resulted in a narrower set of prohibiting records of beneficiaries being submitted to the FBI for inclusion in the NICS index. As described above, the SSA tied such \"adjudications\" to \"mental impairments,\" in addition to a beneficiary's ability to handle his or her day-to-day affairs, whereas the VA only ties it to the beneficiary's ability to manage his or her day-to-day affairs. ", "As the legislative record shows, some Members of Congress oppose NICS referrals based solely on the grounds that an individual \"lacks the mental capacity to manage his [or her] own affairs.\" Opponents of the SSA final rule contend that a mental impairment, even when tied to an incapacity to manage one's own affairs, is not sufficient grounds to make such NICS referrals to the FBI, without an \"order or finding of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial authority of competent jurisdiction that such person is a danger to himself or herself or others.\" They also pointed to the position taken by mental health advocates that reporting the incapacitated or mentally disabled under current VA procedures and the SSA final rule, without any regard to their propensity to be violent, reinforces ingrained stereotypes about the disabled.", "Proponents maintain that the VA has been, and SSA would have been, faithfully addressing public safety by implementing provisions of the Brady Act and NIAA. They argued that measures to prevent mentally incompetent persons from acquiring firearms are justified because firearms in their view are dangerous instruments that amplify violence in the United States to unacceptable levels. They underscore that issues related to notification of loss and restoration of gun rights and privileges were addressed in NIAA, incorporated into the current VA procedures and the vacated SSA final rule, and codified in P.L. 114-255 .", "Opponents of the SSA final rule maintain that it was not substantive enough on its own to justify the taking of a constitutionally enumerated right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. Opponents of the SSA final rule contend that it was unbalanced, because the SSA would have had to show that the beneficiary was \"mentally incompetent\" due to a diagnosed \"mental impairment,\" whereas the beneficiary would have had to demonstrate to the SSA that he or she was not a threat to himself or herself, or others to regain his or her Second Amendment rights. In other words, the bar for the beneficiary to regain his or her gun rights would have been higher than for the initial SSA mental incompetency determination."], "subsections": []}]}}
