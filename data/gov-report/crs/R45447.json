{"id": "R45447", "title": "Permanent Employment-Based Immigration and the Per-country Ceiling", "released_date": "2018-12-21T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) specifies a complex set of categories and numerical limits for admitting lawful permanent residents (LPRs) to the United States that includes economic priorities among the admission criteria. These priorities are addressed primarily through the employment-based immigration system, which consists of five preference categories. Each preference category has specific eligibility criteria; numerical limits; and, in some cases, distinct application processes. The INA allocates 140,000 visas annually for all five employment-based LPR categories, roughly 12% of the 1.1 million LPRs admitted in FY2017. The INA further limits each immigrant-sending country to an annual maximum of 7% of all employment-based LPR admissions, known as the per-country ceiling, or \"cap.\"", "Prospective employment-based immigrants follow two administrative processing trajectories depending on whether they apply from overseas as \"new arrivals\" seeking LPR status or from within the United States seeking to adjust to LPR status from a temporary status that they currently possess. While some prospective employment-based immigrants can self-petition, most require U.S. employers to petition on their behalf. In both cases, the Department of State (DOS) is responsible for allocating the correct number of employment-based immigrant \"visa numbers\" or slots, according to numerical limits and the per-country ceiling specified in the INA.", "This report reviews the employment-based immigration process by examining six pools of pending petitions and applications, representing prospective employment-based immigrants and any accompanying family members at different stages of the LPR process. While four of these pools represent administrative processing queues, two result from the INA's numerical limitations on employment-based immigration and the per-country ceiling.", "These latter two pools of foreign nationals, who have been approved as employment-based immigrants but must wait for statutorily limited visa numbers, totaled in excess of 900,000 as of mid-2018. Most originate from India, followed by China and the Philippines.", "Some employers maintain that they continue to need skilled foreign workers to remain internationally competitive and to keep their firms in the United States. Proponents of increasing employment-based immigration levels argue that it is vital for economic growth. Opponents cite the lack of compelling evidence of labor shortages and argue that the presence of foreign workers can negatively impact wages and working conditions in the United States.", "With this statutory and economic backdrop, the policy option of revising or eliminating the per-country ceiling on employment-based LPRs has been proposed repeatedly in Congress. Some argue that eliminating the per-country ceiling would increase the flow of high-skilled immigrants from countries such as India and China, who are often employed in the U.S. technology sector, without increasing the total annual admission of employment-based LPRs. Currently, nationals from India in particular, and to a lesser extent China and the Philippines, face lengthy queues and inordinately long waits to receive LPR status. Many of those waiting for employment-based LPR status are already employed in the United States on temporary visas, a potentially exploitative situation that some argue incentivizes immigrant-sponsoring employers to continue to recruit foreign nationals primarily from these countries for temporary employment. Others counter that the statutory per-country ceiling restrains the dominance of a handful of employment-based immigrant-sending countries and preserves the diversity of immigrant flows."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Four major principles currently underlie U.S. policy for admitting lawful permanent residents (LPRs): reunifying families, admitting individuals with needed skills, providing humanitarian assistance, and diversifying immigrant flows by country of origin.

Family reunification occurs primarily through family-sponsored immigration. Admitting individuals with needed skills occurs through employment-based immigration. Humanitarian assistance occurs primarily through the U.S. refugee and asylum programs. Origin-country diversity occurs primarily through the Diversity Immigrant Visa.", "This report focuses on the second LPR pathway noted above, employment-based immigration. Employment-based immigrants enter the United States through one of five preference categories, each with its own eligibility requirements and numerical limitations and, in some cases, different application processes. ", "In addition to the numerical limits imposed upon each preference category, employment-based immigrants face a per-country ceiling, or \"cap,\" that limits the number of immigrants from any single country of origin to 7% of the annual limit for each of the five preference categories. This limitation was imposed to prevent any one country or handful of countries from dominating the flow of employment-based immigration to the United States. ", "The numerical limits imposed upon each preference category, combined with the per-country ceiling, mean that employment-based immigrants from certain countries can face considerable waits before they can acquire LPR status. In recent years, some Members of Congress have shown interest in reassessing the 7% per-country ceiling for employment-based immigration.", "Some assert that the current numerical limits on employment-based LPRs are not working in the national economic interest and potentially lead to exploitation of foreign workers who are waiting to acquire LPR status.

In either case, petitioning and application involve multiple steps and federal agencies. While some prospective employment-based immigrants can self-petition, most require U.S. employers to petition on their behalf.", "DOS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) each play key roles in administering the law and policies on immigrant admission. In addition, petitioners for 2 nd and 3 rd preference category immigrants must apply for labor certification (described below) from the Department of Labor (DOL). Once any required labor certification is approved, DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) must adjudicate an immigrant petition. If the prospective immigrant resides in the United States, USCIS also processes the application to adjust to LPR status (discussed below). In contrast, if the prospective immigrant resides abroad, they must subsequently apply to DOS's Bureau of Consular Affairs for a visa to travel to the United States. DOS is also responsible for the allocation, enumeration, and assignment of all numerically limited \"visa numbers\" or slots, regardless of where prospective immigrants reside.

Such prospective employment-based immigrants are eligible to submit their visa application to DOS or their adjustment of status application to USCIS. The term \"current\" indicates that DOS can issue visa numbers to all qualified applicants in that category regardless of priority date or country of origin.", "Usually cut-off dates in the Visa Bulletin advance with time. However, visa number demand by applicants with a variety of priority dates can fluctuate from month to month, invariably affecting cut-off dates. Such fluctuations can cause cut-off date movement to slow or stop. In some cases where visa number demand unexpectedly exceeds supply, DOS may have to regress cut-off dates to earlier dates to maintain an orderly queue, a situation referred to as \"visa retrogression.\" In sum, visa retrogression occurs when more people apply for a visa number in a particular category or country than there are visa numbers available for that month.", "Priority dates shown in the Visa Bulletin are not necessarily an accurate guide for visa applicants to gauge their expected wait times until they can apply for a visa or adjust status. Changes in the rate at which foreign nationals apply for LPR status can alter waiting times substantially. For example, the Visa Bulletin for December 2018 indicates that Indian nationals, whose 2 nd preference employment-based petitions (professionals with advanced degrees) were submitted on or before April 1, 2009, could apply for a visa. Indian nationals who were considering applying as employment-based immigrants might interpret this to mean that filing a 2 nd preference employment-based immigrant petition in December 2018 would result in an expected wait time of about 9.5 years until they could receive LPR status. However, if more or fewer Indian nationals applied for employment-based LPR status between 2009 and 2018 than those who applied for LPR status during the 9.5 years prior to April 1, 2009, expected wait times for LPR status could be longer or shorter, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Petition and Application Processing", "paragraphs": ["Before petitioning for 2 nd and 3 rd preference category workers, employers must first apply for a foreign labor certification from DOL.

Such proponents argue that the current system effectively ties immigrant workers to the employers that sponsor them for extended periods and invites potential exploitation. According to this perspective, employers who petition on behalf of prospective employment-based immigrants have disproportionate power over them. Because such employers can withdraw their petitions at will, they discourage foreign workers from negotiating for higher wages and/or improved working conditions. All else being equal, rational employers therefore benefit financially by sponsoring such workers who remain relatively immobile during their extensive waits to receive LPR status.

Those who favor eliminating the per-country cap contend that such circumstances effectively encourage employers to sponsor prospective employment-based immigrants primarily from India. According to this perspective, de facto discrimination results on the basis of origin country, fostered partly by U.S. laws which otherwise prohibit most forms of labor market discrimination. The more that employers follow this hiring approach, the greater the queue of Indian prospective immigrants and the longer the waiting times for acquiring LPR status, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that may limit hiring of prospective employment-based immigrants from other countries.", "Proponents argue, therefore, that removing the per-country ceiling from employment-based immigrants would \"level the playing field\" by making immigrants from all countries more equally attractive to employers. If the per-country ceiling is eliminated and the current queue of pending petitions and visas is processed, proponents argue, employers would have no incentive to sponsor employment-based immigrants from any one country over others except based on conventional labor market criteria. As a result, waiting times for prospective employment-based immigrants to receive LPR status would ultimately equalize across countries of origin.", "From a national interest perspective, many have argued that current circumstances discourage skilled foreign workers from countries such as India from seeking employment and immigration sponsorship in the United States. Prospective immigrants, aware that they could wait for substantial periods of time before actually receiving LPR status, may decide to start their careers and conduct entrepreneurial activities in other countries where the equivalent of LPR status is more quickly obtained. Consequently, firms who wish to attract highly skilled foreign workers may face competitive disadvantages compared to firms based in countries that provide permanent legal status more easily.

They contend that removing the per-country ceiling would advantage Indian and Chinese prospective immigrants who would move more quickly to the head of the queue at the expense of those from all other countries.", "Arguments against lifting the per-country ceiling often point to the H-1B visa for temporary \"professional specialty workers,\" an employment category generally associated with STEM fields. The H-1B visa represents a frequently used pathway for skilled nonimmigrant (temporary) workers to become employment-based immigrants. Some observers criticize the H-1B visa as exploitative of foreign workers, mostly from India, because once sponsored for employment-based LPR status, workers are unable to change employers, leaving them vulnerable to exploitative practices. They note that Indian nationals dominate H-1B visa recipients with almost three fourths of the total. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Anticipated Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Many observers are interested in how revising the per-country ceiling would affect future flows of employment-based immigrants. Estimating such impacts are challenging for a number of reasons, including the complex accounting among the six pools of petitions and applications. If Congress eliminated the per-country ceiling for employment-based immigrants, many expect that Indian and Chinese nationals would dominate the flow of new employment-based LPRs for as many years as needed to clear out the accumulated queue of prospective immigrants from those countries. This queue would include those with approved employment-based immigrant petitions who are waiting to file either a visa application with DOS or an adjustment of status application with USCIS (i.e., the third and fourth pools discussed above in \" Pools of Prospective Employment-Based LPRs .\")", "As noted above, the \"Yoder Amendment,\" which was introduced during the 115 th Congress and would eliminate the per-country ceiling for all employment-based preference categories, illustrates what kind of impacts might be expected. The amendment would phase out the ceiling over four years. In the first year, a single country could use 85% of all visa numbers in a preference category with the remaining 15% still subject to the 7% per-country ceiling. Thus for the 1 st , 2 nd , and 3 rd preference categories, each of which account for 40,040 visa numbers under the current system, this would amount to 34,034 visa numbers (40,040 x 0.85) for each of the first three preference categories in the first year after enactment. That percentage would increase to 90% for the second and third years (36,036 visa numbers), and reach 100% in the fourth and subsequent years.", "To illustrate this further, consider the 3 rd employment-based preference category. Data presented above for the third and fourth pools in \" Pools of Prospective Employment-Based LPRs \" yield an estimated 170,000 principal and derivative immigrants from India, China, and the Philippines who were waiting for LPR status in 2018. Given the parameters of the Yoder Amendment, one could estimate that roughly four to five years would be required to eliminate this queue of prospective 3 rd preference employment-based immigrants. ", "Other outcomes may also result from eliminating the per-country ceiling, apart from reducing certain queues of prospective immigrants more quickly, and removing the perceived employer incentive to choose nationals from these countries over other countries. For example, shorter wait times for LPR status might actually incentivize greater numbers of nationals from India, China, and the Philippines to seek employment-based LPR status. If that were to occur, the reduction in the number of approved petitions pending might be short-lived. In addition, absent a per-country ceiling, a handful of countries could conceivably dominate employment-based immigration, possibly benefitting certain industries that employ foreign workers from those countries, at the expense of foreign workers from other countries and other industries that might employ them. ", "In addition, because the INA grants LPRs the ability to sponsor family members through its family-sponsorship provisions, removing the per-country ceiling would alter, to an unknown extent, the country-of-origin composition of subsequent family-based immigrants acquiring LPR status each year."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
