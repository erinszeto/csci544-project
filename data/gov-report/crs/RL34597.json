In recent years, new Congresses have convened during the first week of January in each odd-numbered year but not necessarily on January 3. As pointed out in a CRS report", "A \"lame duck\" session of Congress is one that takes place after the election for the next Congress has been held, but before the current Congress has reached the end of its constitutional term. Under contemporary conditions, any meeting of Congress that occurs between a congressional election in November and the following January 3 is a lame duck session. The significant characteristic of a lame duck session is that its participants are the sitting Members of the existing Congress, not those who will be entitled to sit in the new Congress.", "Several factors may contribute to the occurrence of lame duck sessions, including the need to deal with unfinished business or urgent matters that have arisen suddenly. The consideration and enactment of legislative proposals, particularly those with significant budgetary implications, is sometimes postponed until a lame duck session. For example, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 ( P.L. 112-240 ), which addressed a number of fiscal policies, was enacted at the end of the 2012 lame duck session on January 2, 2013. ", "Lame duck sessions have been used in recent years for various purposes, including efforts to bring action on regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year to a close. In addition to action on appropriations measures, lame duck sessions have been used for such matters as the consideration of authorization measures for the Department of Defense and intelligence activities, the finalization of a measure establishing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the House impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton.", "Twenty-one lame duck sessions occurred between 1935 and 2016. Ten of the 21 lame duck sessions occurred between 1935 and 1990, an average of 1 every 5 years.

As Table 1 shows, lame duck sessions occurred during this period whether party control of the federal government was unified (i.e., the same party controlled the presidency and both chambers of Congress, as in 1994, 2004, 2006, and 2010) or divided.

The count of regular appropriations acts in Table 2 includes those that were enacted in standalone vehicles, omnibus vehicles, or covered by full-year CRs. During the 109 th Congress, covering 2005 and 2006, the number of regular appropriations acts was reduced from 13 to 11 due to reorganization of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. At the beginning of the 110 th Congress, a further reorganization of the appropriations subcommittees took effect, which resulted in an increase in the number of annual appropriations acts to 12.

In 1994, all of the 13 regular appropriations acts for FY1995 were enacted before the beginning of the fiscal year. In 1998, 1 of the FY1999 regular appropriations bills was enacted before the start of the fiscal year, and the remaining 12 bills were enacted by October 21, nearly 2 months before the lame duck session began on December 17. In 2008, work on 3 out of the 12 regular appropriations acts for FY2009 was completed before the end of September; at that time, a CR was enacted that provided funding for the 9 remaining acts through early March of the following year. Those nine acts were not considered until the beginning of the 111 th Congress, when they were combined into an omnibus appropriations measure and enacted on March 11, 2009. Similarly, in 2012, a CR was enacted prior to the beginning of the fiscal year that provided funding through March 27, 2013. Annual appropriations for FY2013 were later enacted after the beginning of the 113 th Congress on March 26, 2013, in a consolidated measure that contained five regular appropriations acts and full-year CR that covered the seven remaining regular appropriations acts.", "The enactment of regular appropriations bills was an important element in three lame duck sessions: 2000, 2004, and 2014. In 2000, eight regular appropriations bills were enacted before the lame duck session, but the remaining five were enacted during (or immediately after) the session. In 2004, four regular appropriations bills were enacted before the lame duck session, but the remaining nine were enacted during the session. Most recently, in 2014, a consolidated measure containing 11 of the regular appropriations acts for that fiscal year was enacted during the lame duck session, with the remaining regular bill\u2014for DHS\u2014being enacted afterward on March 4, 2015. ", "Different patterns prevailed in the other four lame duck sessions held in 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2016, but action on all regular appropriations acts was not completed until after the session in any of these instances. In 2002 and 2006, two of the regular appropriations bills (for FY2003 and FY2007, respectively) had been enacted before the lame duck session began, but final action on the remaining acts was not completed until February during the following session. The remaining 11 regular appropriations acts for FY2003 were incorporated into an omnibus appropriations measure, which was enacted on February 20, 2003. Full-year funding for the nine remaining FY2007 regular appropriations acts was provided through a full-year CR, which was enacted on February 15, 2007. For 2010, no regular appropriations bills had been enacted before the start of the lame duck session, and annual appropriations were ultimately provided in a consolidated measure that was enacted on April 15, 2011. This measure contained the Department of Defense Appropriations Act and funded the programs and activities in the 11 remaining appropriations bills through a full-year CR. For FY2017, one regular appropriations bill (Military Construction and Veterans Affairs) was enacted before the lame duck session began. Funding for the other 11 appropriations bills was provided in a CR that expired during the lame duck session. Upon the CR's expiration, Congress passed a second CR to provide funding through April and then a third CR to provide funding for another week, at which time the remaining 11 appropriations bills were consolidated into an omnibus appropriations measure that was enacted in May 2017.

Whenever action on one or more of the regular appropriations bills for a fiscal year is not completed until after the fiscal year has begun, CRs are used to provide stop-gap funding, thereby avoiding disruption in agency operations. Two issues that arise under these circumstances are how CRs will be used to resolve any funding impasses and the appropriate duration of any period for their use.", "CRs may have a relatively short duration in the expectation that action on the regular appropriations acts will be concluded within several days or weeks. In this case, multiple short-term CRs are often used to \"buy time\" for ongoing negotiations on regular appropriations acts while maintaining incentives to complete the negotiations. Alternatively, CRs may have a longer duration to postpone final action on appropriations decisions until after elections or into the beginning of the next congressional session. Finally, a CR may provide funding for the remainder of the fiscal year, as was the case in FY2007, FY2011, and FY2013.", "There has been considerable variation in the degree to which CRs have been used to provide stop-gap funding during the 11 most recent lame duck sessions held since 1994 (see Table 3 ).

In 1998, all of the regular appropriations bills (for FY1999) were enacted before the lame duck session began (but not before the beginning of the fiscal year). Six CRs were enacted to provide funding through the first three weeks of the fiscal year, but none were needed afterward. In 2008, the CR that was enacted before the fiscal year began also contained three regular appropriations acts. That CR extended funding for the remaining appropriations acts through March 6, 2009, at which point action on annual appropriations was completed. Similarly, a long-term CR, which provided funding for the first six months of FY2013, eliminated the necessity for stop-gap appropriations during the 2012 lame duck session. Action on annual appropriations for FY2013 was completed during the following session of Congress on March 28, 2013.", "Circumstances were different with respect to the other six lame duck sessions, which all involved the enactment of one or more CRs. In 2000, six CRs for FY2001 were enacted during the lame duck session. (Fifteen had been enacted before the session began.) In 2004, two CRs for FY2005 were enacted during the lame duck session. (One had been enacted before the session began.) In each year, one or more CRs was enacted before the lame duck session ended that extended stop-gap funding for a period of less than one week, allowing sufficient time for the remaining regular appropriations acts to be enacted.

", "In the case of the five remaining lame duck sessions\u2014held in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, and 2016\u2014CRs were needed to provide stop-gap funding both during and after the sessions. In 2002, one CR for FY2003 was enacted during the lame duck session. (Four had been enacted before the session began.) Three additional CRs were enacted early in the 2003 session before action on appropriations was ultimately concluded with the enactment of an omnibus measure on February 20. In 2006, two CRs for FY2007 were enacted during the lame duck session. (One had been enacted before the session began.) Action was concluded early in the 2007 session with the enactment of a full-year CR on February 15. In 2010, three CRs were enacted during the lame duck session.

Two CRs were also enacted during the lame duck session to provide stop-gap funding while that consolidated measure was being completed. In addition, the consolidated act contained a CR that provided stop-gap appropriations for DHS until February 27, 2015. Those stop-gap appropriations were later extended through March 6 by a further CR that was enacted during the new session of Congress. The purpose of this CR was to allow time to complete the remaining DHS regular appropriations act.
