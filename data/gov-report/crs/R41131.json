Development of the alternative, the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine, was funded in Administration budgets from FY1996 to FY2006. From FY2007 to FY2010, Congress rejected Administration proposals to terminate the program. In FY2011, Congress agreed not to fund the alternate engine, and the alternate engine program was terminated in April 2011. The Administration's FY2012 budget submission again requested no funds for the program.", "Through FY2009, Congress provided approximately $2.5 billion for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine program. The program is projected to need an additional $1.9 billion-2.9 billion through 2016 to complete the development of the F136 engine.", "Critics of the proposal to terminate the F136 alternate engine argue that termination was driven more by immediate budget pressures on the department than the long-term pros and cons of the F136 program. They argue that engine competition for the F-15 and F-16 saved money and resulted in greater reliability. Some who applaud the proposed termination say that single-source engine production has been the norm, not the exception. Long-term engine affordability, they claim, is best achieved by procuring engines through multiyear contracts from a single source.", "Canceling the F136 engine poses questions on the operational risk\u2014particularly of fleet grounding\u2014posed by having a single engine design and supplier. Additional issues include the potential impact this termination might have on the U.S. defense industrial base and on U.S. relations with key allied countries involved in the alternate engine program. Finally, eliminating competitive market forces for DOD business worth billions of dollars may concern those seeking efficiency from DOD's acquisition system and raises the challenge of cost control in a single-supplier environment.", "Continuing F136 development raises issues of impact on the overall F-35 acquisition program.

Such a cost increase would reduce the number of F-35s that could be procured within a given total amount of F-35 acquisition funding, forcing cuts in future capabilities and force structure. An official from the F-35 program office stated that the reduction in F-35 procurement over the next five years might total 50 to 80 aircraft. Procuring a second engine would increase F-35 life-cycle operation and support (O&S) costs by requiring DOD to maintain two engine maintenance and repair pipelines. Supporting two engines on aircraft carriers would be particularly challenging due to limited space and facilities. Having a second engine is not needed to sustain international interest in the F-35, because the most significant potential foreign buyers are already committed to the F-35 program, and because committed and potential buyers already have several significant reasons to be interested in the F-35, starting with the aircraft's capabilities, procurement cost, and operating and support cost. Congress already accepts the risk of using single designs across fleets, both in powerplants and airframes. Many other aircraft types in the U.S. inventory use one engine design across the fleet. Procurement of a single airframe design also carries the risk of fleet grounding if there is a flaw in the design (as has occurred in the past), yet those risks are acceptable to Congress and DOD. The same risk logic should apply to F-35 engines. Development, testing, and production of the F135 have reached the point where it is no longer necessary to hedge against the possibility of technical problems in the F135 engine by pursuing an alternate engine program as a backup. The causes of F135 test failures in 2007 and 2008 have been identified and fixes are being implemented.", "Opponents of the Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program argue the following:", "The Administration's proposal to terminate the alternate engine program does not comply with Section 213 of the FY2008 defense authorization act ( H.R. 4986 / P.L. 110-181 of January 28, 2008), which states: \"Of the funds appropriated pursuant to an authorization of appropriations or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2008 or any year thereafter, for research, development, test, and evaluation and procurement for the Joint Strike Fighter Program, the Secretary of Defense shall ensure the obligation and expenditure in each such fiscal year of sufficient annual amounts for the continued development and procurement of 2 options for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter in order to ensure the development and competitive production for the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter.\" Given that F-35s are to constitute the vast majority of the country's strike fighters, it would be imprudent to have all those strike fighters powered by a single type of engine, since a problem with that engine could force the grounding of the entire F-35 fleet. Having a second engine in production (or ready for production) would permit DOD to use competition (or the threat of competition) in procuring and supporting F-35 engines, which could reduce F-35 engine procurement and O&S costs compared to what would be achievable in a sole-source procurement, offsetting the additional costs associated with developing, procuring, and supporting a second engine. Competition (or the threat of competition) would also promote better engine performance, increased engine reliability, and improved contractor responsiveness. Having two F-35 engine production lines in operation would also permit F-35 engine production to be more quickly surged to higher levels if needed to respond to a change in the strategic environment, and preserve a potential for maintaining effective competition in the development and procurement of future tactical aircraft engines, particularly if F-22 and F/A-18E/F production ends. Having a second engine in production would help sustain international interest in the F-35 program, maximizing F-35 exports. Potential foreign buyers would be more inclined to purchase the F-35 if they had a choice regarding the aircraft's engine, and if they believed that competition (or the threat of competition) in engine production was holding down the engine portion of the F-35's total cost."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "paragraphs": ["These are the most common questions received by CRS concerning the F-35 alternate engine program:"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternate Engine Program Status", "paragraphs": ["The alternate engine program was terminated by DOD on April 25, 2011.

The certification of a funded program for an alternate engine is a positive commitment to cost-effective program management. However, the actual demonstration of the alternate engine in a JSF airframe has been continuously shifted to the ''out years,'' an action that threatens to invalidate the whole initiative. If the alternate engine is not completed for use for the most stressing of the JSF requirements (the short takeoff/vertical landing variant), then it may be too late to provide a major benefit to the program.

Accordingly, the committee authorized provisions adding $400.8 million for the continued development of the interchangeable engine during fiscal year 2007; and directing the Secretary of Defense to continue the development and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter program with two competitive propulsion systems throughout the life of the aircraft or enter into a one-time, firm-fixed-price contract for a single propulsion system throughout the life of the aircraft.", "The report discussed two proposed legislative provisions on pages 129-131, stating:", "Development of the propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter (sec. 254)", "The committee recommends a provision that would direct the Secretary of Defense to continue the development and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program with two competitive propulsion systems throughout the life cycle of the aircraft, or enter into a one-time firm-fixed-price contract for a selected propulsion system for the life cycle of the aircraft following the initial service release of the JSF F135 propulsion system in fiscal year 2008.", "During the 1970's and early 1980's, Pratt & Whitney was the sole source provider of engines for the F\u201314, F\u201315, and F\u201316 aircraft. Because of persistent engine problems that resulted in the loss of aircraft and degraded readiness, Congress directed the Department of Defense to develop and produce an engine to compete with Pratt & Whitney engines on these aircraft. The benefits that resulted from this competition included improved performance, reduced risk, increased readiness, lower cost of ownership, improved contractor responsiveness to customer needs, and over $4.0 billion of cost savings. Congress once again directed the Department to provide for an engine competition for the JSF in 1996 out of concerns for a lack of competition expressed in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (P.L. 104\u2013106).

If the Department had conducted a full life cycle analysis, the committee believes that the results of the analysis would show significant cost savings that could be achieved through a competitive engine strategy. The committee believes that through the enduring value of competition, sufficient savings will be generated from a series of competitive engine procurements over the life cycle of the aircraft that will more than offset the cost of completing the F136 engine development. In order to ensure that the Congress has the complete picture of the full life cycle costs, the committee has recommended another provision described elsewhere in this report that would require the Secretary of Defense and the Comptroller General to conduct independent life cycle cost analyses addressing this issue.", "Independent cost analyses for Joint Strike Fighter engine program (sec. 255)", "The committee recommends a provision that would direct the Secretary of Defense, a federally-funded research and development center (FFRDC) chosen by the Secretary, and the Comptroller General to conduct independent life cycle cost analyses of the development and sustainment of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program with two competitive propulsion systems throughout the life cycle of the aircraft, versus terminating the alternate engine development and proceeding with only one engine.", "The provision would also require that the Comptroller and the FFRDC certify that they had access to sufficient information upon which to make informed judgments on the life cycle costs of the two alternatives.", "As noted elsewhere in this report, the committee is concerned that the Department of Defense analysis provided as justification for the termination of the F136 interchangeable engine did not account for all of the costs over the life cycle of the aircraft.", "The report discussed the JSF program on pages 95-96 and 179.

Despite section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110\u2013181), which requires the Secretary of Defense to obligate and expend sufficient annual amounts for the continued development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F\u201335, the committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense (DOD) has, for the third consecutive year, chosen not to comply with both the spirit and intent of this provision by opting not to include funds for this purpose in the budget request.", "The committee notes that the F135 engine development program has experienced cost growth since the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) program began in fiscal year 2002. At the beginning of EMD in fiscal year 2002, the F135 engine development program was expected to cost $4.828 billion in then-year dollars. The F\u201335 program manager reports that as of the end of 2008, development costs have grown to $6.7 billion in then-year dollars, an increase of $1.872 billion, or 38 percent. Additionally, the committee notes that the F\u201335 program manager has reported an increase of approximately 38 to 43 percent in F135 engine procurement cost estimates between December 2005 and December 2008, in the annual selected acquisition reports for the F\u201335C and F\u201335A variants. Between December 2005 and December 2008, engine procurement cost estimates for the F\u201335B have grown approximately 47 percent, but the F\u201335B engine procurement cost growth is attributable to both the F135 engine and the F\u201335B's lift fan. Conversely, the F136 engine program has not experienced any cost growth since its inception. The F136 pre-EMD contract, which began in 2002 and was completed in 2004, was for $411.0 million and did not experience cost growth. The F136 EMD contract was awarded in 2005, and the cost estimate, at $2.486 billion, has been stable since contract award. Given the F135 development and procurement cost increases, the committee is perplexed by the Department's decisions over the past three years to not include an F\u201335 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests. Based on the F135 cost growth, F135 test failures noted in the committee report ( H.Rept. 110-652 ) accompanying the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, and resultant schedule delays due to F135 engine test failures, the committee remains steadfast in its belief that the non-financial factors of a two-engine competitive program such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability and improved operational readiness, strongly favor continuing the F\u201335 competitive propulsion system program\u2026", "For continued development of the competitive F\u201335 propulsion system program, the committee recommends a total increase of $463.0 million in PEs 64800F and 64800N as noted in the tables elsewhere in this report. The committee also recommends an aggregate increase of $140.0 million as noted in the tables elsewhere in this report in Aircraft Procurement, Navy and Aircraft Procurement, Air Force for the procurement of four F136 engines, F136 spare parts, and advance procurement of F136 long-lead components to continue F136 procurement in fiscal year 2011.

These changes will delay the fielding of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) capability and capacity, adversely impacting the Department's overall strike fighter inventory. In addition, the Administration objects to provisions of the bill that mandate an alternative engine program for the JSF. The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test hours. Expenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress of the overall JSF program. Alleged risks of a fleet-wide grounding due to a single engine are exaggerated. The Air Force currently has several fleets that operate on a single-engine source. The Administration also objects to the limit on the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75% of the amount authorized until Department of Defense (DOD) has obligated all funds provided in FY 2010 for the alternative engine program.

The committee understands that current plans for the F136 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion system would complete the development in sufficient time to conduct a first competitive contract award in fiscal year 2012, concurrent with the award for the sixth lot of low-rate initial production aircraft.", "The budget request included $1,741.3 million in PE 64800N, and $1,858.1 million in PE 64800F for continued development of the JSF program, but included no funds for continuing the SDD phase of the F136 program.", "The committee continues to believe that, in light of studies performed by the Department of Defense, the Institute for Defense Analyses, and the Government Accountability Office, it is in the best interests of the Nation to continue the development of the F136. Though the results of these studies were, in the aggregate, inconclusive on whether there would be a financial benefit to the Department in continuing to develop a competitive propulsion system for the JSF program, the committee notes that all studies identified significant non-financial factors of a two-engine competitive program. These included better engine performance; improved contractor responsiveness; a more robust industrial base; increased engine reliability; and improved operational readiness. The committee believes that the benefits, which could be derived from the non-financial factors, favor continuing the JSF competitive propulsion system program.", "Therefore, the committee recommends an increase of $438.9 million for continuing F136 SDD, with half that amount added to PE 64800N and the other half added to PE 64800F.

The JET reported that the program would cost significantly more and take longer to fully develop and test than the Department was then projecting. Although the JET has yet to officially report out for 2009, the initial indications are that cost growth and schedule issues remain. Nevertheless, the Department insists that the program is on track to achieve both the cost and schedule currently reflected in the program of record.", "Therefore, the JSF procurement program is provided $6,840,478,000, and the JSF program is designated as a congressional special interest item. The Secretary of Defense is directed to ensure that all 30 aircraft be procured as requested in the budget.

The Committee strongly supports realistic budgeting that matches available funding to overall programs. Indeed, many of the program terminations proposed in the fiscal year 2010 budget request are supported in this bill. Nevertheless, the Committee is concerned that the proposal to terminate some programs is premature, and believes that continuing certain efforts may yield significant payback. The Committee believes that this is clearly the case for the presidential helicopter, wherein five aircraft have been purchased that could be pressed into service. Similarly, in the Committee's view, there is potential for significant payback associated with the Joint Strike Fighter alternative engine and certain missile defense activities provided in this recommendation. (Page 4)", "The report also states:", "JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER ALTERNATE ENGINE", "The F\u201335 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program truly represents the Nation's future with respect to tactical aviation. The Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force plan to procure over 2,500 of these fifth generation stealthy aircraft and will fly them well into the future. The Department's original plan for the F\u201335 propulsion engine was to have two engine variants. Cost growth in other areas of the development program resulted in the Department abandoning the alternate engine program. Currently, all three variants of the F\u201335 aircraft will be powered by the same propulsion engine. Although this will make the logistics for the aircraft less complex, this practice presents problems. The Committee is extremely concerned that in the near future when the F\u201335 will comprise the majority of the Nation's tactical aircraft inventory any technical problems with the engine could theoretically ground the entire fleet of aircraft. If this situation were to arise in a time of crisis, the Commander-in-Chief's flexibility would be severely limited.", "Another area of concern for the Committee is the lack of competition for the Joint Strike Fighter engine program. With over 2,500 aircraft envisioned for this program, the potential for cost savings through an engine competition is enormous. The Committee is aware that the Department conducted a business case analysis that compared the cost of the program of record (sole source engine provider) to a program using a dual source strategy for the engine program. The business case concluded that the costs of the two programs were essentially the same. Since the Congress has put several hundred million dollars into the development of an alternate engine program since this business case was published, the Committee is puzzled by the Department's decision to not fund the alternate engine. With the majority of the upfront development cost having been sunk into the program, it seems clear that from this point forward the dual source strategy is the most cost effective method to acquire the propulsion engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. Therefore, the recommendation provides an additional $430,000,000 for the continued development of the alternate engine and $130,000,000 for alternate engine production costs for a total of $560,000,000 above the request for the alternate engine program. Further, since a dual source engine strategy is the most cost effective method for acquiring engines from this point forward, the Secretary of Defense is directed to include funding for the alternate engine program in future budget requests.

Under Air Force Research & Development/Items of Special Interest, the report states:", "F-35 aircraft", "The budget request contained $2.4 billion in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M for development of the F-35 aircraft, but contained no funds for development of a competitive F-35 propulsion system. The budget request also contained $7.7 billion in Aircraft Procurement, Air Force and Aircraft Procurement, Navy for procurement of 22 F-35As, 13 F-35Bs, and 7 F-35Cs.", "The competitive F-35 propulsion system program is developing the F136 engine, which would provide a competitive alternative to the currently-planned F135 engine. For the past four years, the committee recommended increases for the F-35 competitive propulsion system, and notes that in all cases, funds have been appropriated by Congress for this purpose. Despite section 213 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 ( P.L. 110-181 ), which requires the Secretary of Defense to obligate and expend sufficient annual amounts for the continued development and procurement of a competitive propulsion system for the F-35, the committee is disappointed that the Department of Defense (DOD) has, for the fifth consecutive year, chosen not to comply with both the spirit and intent of this law by opting not to include funds for this purpose in the budget request.", "In the committee report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 ( H.Rept. 111-166 ), the committee noted cost increases in the F135 development program, as well as cost increases for the procurement of F135 engines between December 2005 and December 2008. A March 2010 report on the Joint Strike Fighter by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) notes that F135 engine development cost is now estimated to cost $7.3 billion, a 50 percent increase over the original contract award. In its report, GAO also notes that for the fiscal year 2009 F135 engine contract, the negotiated price for the F-35B engine and lift fan was 21 percent higher than the budget estimate, and the negotiated unit cost for the F-35A engine was 42 percent higher than budgeted. Over the past year, as a result of these cost increases in fiscal year 2009, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics directed that a Joint Assessment Team (JAT) review the F135 cost structure, and the JAT concluded that engine contractor improvement plans were credible but challenging, and would require additional investment by the contractor for cost reduction initiatives.", "On February 23, 2010, the Deputy Secretary of Defense submitted to the committee an update of the 2007 DOD `Joint Strike Fighter Alternate Engine Acquisition and Independent Coast Analysis' for the competitive engine program which noted that an investment of $2.9 billion over six years in additional cost would be required to finish F136 engine development and to conduct directed buys to prepare the F136 for competitive procurement of F-35 engines in 2017. This report also noted that long-term costs for either a one-engine or two-engine competitive acquisition strategy are the same, on a net present value basis.", "Given the F135 development and procurement cost increases and that long-term F-35 engine costs would be the same for a competitive F-35 engine acquisition strategy, the committee is puzzled by the Department's decisions over the past five years to not include an F-35 competitive propulsion system program in its budget requests. The committee remains unwavering in its belief that the non-financial factors of a two-engine competitive program, such as better engine performance, improved contractor responsiveness, a more robust industrial base, increased engine reliability and improved operational readiness, strongly favor continuing the F-35 competitive propulsion system program. Therefore, the committee recommends a total increase of $485.0 million for the competitive engine program in PEs 64800F, 64800N, and 64800M as noted in the funding tables elsewhere in this report.", "Over the past year, the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) and F-35 contractor failed to meet promised expectations with regard to cost and schedule performance. As a result, in addition to the JAT, the Department of Defense conducted two other reviews of the F-35 program which included a 2009 update to the 2008 Joint Estimating Team (JET), known as JET 2, and chartered an independent manufacturing review team (IMRT). The JET 2 was tasked to conduct an independent cost and schedule estimate of the development and production program, while the IMRT reviewed production capacity and risk. The JET 2 concluded that the F-35 development program would take 30 months longer and cost some $3.0 billion more, and the IMRT concluded that the contractor's planned production ramp rates were high risk and not achievable within the contractor's planned timeframe. To reduce development and production risk, the Department of Defense proposes to procure one additional F-35C developmental test aircraft; stand-up an additional software simulation facility; utilize three operational F-35s for developmental test purposes; adjust the production profile in line with the IMRT recommendations and reduce planned production in the Future Years Defense Program by 122 aircraft; and increase amounts budgeted for F-35 development and production. Together, these actions are projected to delay the completion of F-35 development by 13 months compared to last year's plan, and cost $2.8 billion more. In accordance with section 2433 of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary of the Air Force informed the committee on March 25, 2010, that the F-35 program will exceed unit cost thresholds by more than 50 percent compared to the original baseline estimate.", "On March 11, 2010, in testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics described the F-35 program as having `unprecedented concurrency' of development, test, and production activities. On March 24, 2010, at a hearing held jointly by the Subcommittee on Air and Land Forces and the Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces, the Office of the Secretary of Defense's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation testified that `the primary issues with the Joint Strike Fighter program have been late delivery of test aircraft and the failure to adjust to the reality by building and resourcing realistic system development and test plans, as well as plans for producing and delivering aircraft.' Additionally, on March 24, 2010, GAO's Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management testified to the Subcommittee on Air and Land Forces and the Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces that the `DOD intends to procure up to 307 aircraft at a cost of $58.2 billion before completing developmental flight testing by mid-fiscal year 2015.' The committee notes that, under current plans in the spring of 2015, the Department will have requested a total of 550 aircraft, over 22 percent of the planned procurement of 2,443 F-35s, before developmental testing is complete. The committee also notes that, notwithstanding the JAT, JET 2, and IMRT findings and continued unprecedented research and development and procurement concurrency, the request for 43 total F-35 aircraft for fiscal year 2011 is the same as projected in fiscal year 2009 for fiscal year 2011. In its testimony on March 24, 2010, GAO also noted that `with most of development testing still ahead, the risk and impact from required design changes are significant,' and may require `alterations to the production process, changes to the supply base and costly retrofitting of aircraft already produced and fielded.' Consequently, the committee remains concerned that despite the Department's recent reduction of 122 aircraft in the Future Years Defense Program, the F-35 production ramp rate may still too high and the Department should consider further reductions until developmental testing is complete.", "For fiscal year 2011, the committee recommends authorization of the budget request for 42 aircraft, subject to the Department's completion of certain milestones planned by the Department for calendar year 2010. Accordingly, the committee recommends a provision (sec. 141) which would require the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation to certify, not later than January 15, 2011, that certain milestones have been completed before an amount necessary for the procurement of more than 30 F-35 aircraft would be obligated or expended.", "A May 27, 2010, statement of Administration policy on H.R. 5136 states:", "F-35 Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Extra Engine: The Administration strongly objects to the addition of $485 million for the extra engine program and to associated legislative provisions that limit the obligation of overall JSF development funding to 75 percent of the amount authorized until the funds for FY 2011 have been obligated for the extra engine program, require the Secretary to ensure that each budget in the Future Years Defense Plan include, and expend, sufficient funding to continue the program, and designate the F135 and F136 engine development and procurement programs as major subprograms. As Secretary Gates has noted, even after factoring in Congress' additional funding, the extra engine would still require a further investment of $2.4 billion before it could be considered as a viable extra engine for the JSF program. The Department does not believe that this cost will ever be recovered in a hypothesized competition or that the funds should be diverted from important defense needs. The current engine is performing well with more than 13,000 ground test and 200 flight test hours. If the final bill presented to the President includes funding or a legislative direction to continue an extra engine program, the President's senior advisors would recommend a veto.", "The report accompanying S. 3454 ( S.Rept. 111-201 of June 4, 2010) included a certification requirement prior to expenditure of further funding for the alternate engine:", "Limitation on use of funds for alternative propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program (sec. 211) ", "The committee recommends a provision that would require that, before spending any additional funds on the F136 engine that is being developed as an alternative propulsion system of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Secretary of Defense would have to certify that development of the alternate propulsion system: ", "(1) will:", "(a) reduce the total life cycle-cycle costs of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program;", "(b) improve the operational readiness of the fleet of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft; and", "(2) will not:", "(a) disrupt the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program during the research, development, and procurement phases of the program; or", "(b) result in the procurement of fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft during the life cycle of the program.", "As passed, H.R. 6523 , the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2011, did not include program-level detail, so there is no amount specified for the F-35 alternate engine (nor, for that matter, the F-35 itself.)", "In lieu of a conference report, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees issued a joint explanatory statement regarding H.R. 6523 .", "The joint explanatory statement included an amended version of the House language designating an F-35 engine development and production subprogram, as follows:", "SEC. 802.

The Act included no funds for the F-35 alternate engine program.", "Appendix B. The \"Great Engine War\" of 1984-1994", "Congress's interest in establishing and funding an F-35 alternate engine program may have been informed by \"the Great Engine War\"\u2014an annual competition from 1984 to 1994 between Pratt & Whitney and General Electric to produce and maintain engines for Air Force F-16 fighters. Pratt & Whitney's engine for the F-16 was the F100, which was originally developed for the Air Force F-15 fighter. General Electric's alternate engine for the F-16 was the F110.", "Historians trace the Air Force's interest in pursuing an alternate engine for the F-16 to Air Force frustrations in the 1970s with Pratt & Whitney's management of the effort to develop the F100 and to Air Force concerns about using a single type of sole-sourced engine to power their entire fighter fleet of F-15s and F-16s. After a number of contentious hearings in 1979, Congress provided funding through the Engine Model Derivative Program (EMDP), a congressionally directed program, for General Electric to develop its F101 engine (which later became the F110) as an alternate engine for the F-16. DOD spent more than $376 million to develop the F110 to compete with the F100 and $600 million to improve the F100's durability and reliability to make it a stronger competitor.", "The use of annual competitions for procuring engines for an aircraft procurement program was unprecedented and controversial. Proponents believe it produced better engines, on better terms, for less money than would purchasing from a single company facing no competition. Other observers believed it \"unjustifiably jeopardized combat effectiveness and pilot survivability.\" Most studies have concluded that contractor responsiveness\u2014not dollar savings\u2014was the primary benefit of the competition. Testimony presented at a 1984 hearing suggested that requiring General Electric and Pratt & Whitney to compete for annual production and O&S work generated benefits for DOD in areas such as better contract terms and conditions, better warranties to assure engine quality, consistency, and long term stability of support. A 1987 assessment stated that after competition was introduced, the incumbent (Pratt & Whitney) offered \"engine improvements to the Air Force earlier than the Air Force had been led to expect without the competition.\"", "The benefits of the Great Engine War have been attributed in part to the particulars of how the engine competition was managed. Prior to the first contract award, for example, the Air Force demanded that General Electric and Pratt & Whitney provide six years of cost projections to include the production of engines, support equipment, spare engines, technical data and dual sourcing data and second sourcing data for operations and support (O&S). The contractors were held to these cost projections for six years: the Air Force let six years of firm-fixed price, or \"not-to-exceed\" contracts from the first production lot. Prior to the Great Engine War, government had succeeded in negotiating firm-fixed price contracts only after the engine had been operating in the field for several years. Never before had contractors agreed to provide cost projections into the future, and contracts were typically for production only, not O&S work. To avoid potential disruptions in production, and to protect itself against price gouging, DOD \"required (each contractor) to provide his plan for providing dual sources of critical parts. These separately priced options in the proposals would allow the Government to reprocure spare parts from sources other than the prime contractors.\"", "Appendix C.
