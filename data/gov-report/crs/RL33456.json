The authoritarian government of Get\u00falio Vargas (1930-1945) began the incorporation of the working classes but exerted strict control over labor as part of its broader push to centralize power. Vargas also increased the state's role in the economy and pursued import-substitution industrialization.

Although repressive, the Brazilian military was not as brutal as those in some other South American countries. It nominally allowed the judiciary and Congress to function during its tenure, but stifled representative democracy and civic action, carefully preserving its influence during one of the most protracted transitions to democracy to occur in Latin America. According to Brazil's National Truth Commission, at least 434 people were killed or \"disappeared\" by the dictatorship.

The plan consisted of a new currency (the real ) pegged to the U.S. dollar, a more restrictive monetary policy, and a severe fiscal adjustment that included a 9% reduction in federal spending and an across-the-board tax increase of 5%.

During his first term, Lula maintained the market-oriented economic policies associated with his predecessor. He tightly controlled expenditures, raised the primary budget surplus, and granted additional autonomy to the Central Bank. At the same time, he placed greater emphasis on reducing poverty, reorganizing and expanding some of the social programs that had been initiated under Cardoso. The most high-profile program, Bolsa Familia (\"Family Grant\"), provides monthly cash transfers to poor families that ensure their children attend school and receive proper medical care. Lula's agenda stalled toward the end of his first term as several top PT officials were implicated in a vote-buying scheme.

He expanded Bolsa Familia and launched new social welfare programs. He also continued to raise the minimum wage, which, adjusted for inflation, increased nearly 64% during his eight years in office. In response to the global financial crisis, the Lula Administration implemented a series of stimulus measures designed to offset declines in global demand with increased domestic consumption. Analysts have credited the administration's timely policy response for mitigating the effects of the crisis and facilitating recovery; the Brazilian economy contracted by 0.2% in 2009 before rebounding with 7.6% growth in 2010.

Income inequality was also reduced, with the Gini coefficient falling from 0.64 to 0.56 during the same time period. While these advances were partially the result of stronger economic growth driven by a boom in international demand for Brazilian commodities, government policy also played a role. According to a 2012 study, about 28% of the decline in income inequality in Brazil between 2001 and 2009 was attributable to increases in the minimum wage, and another 13% of the decline was attributable to the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Rousseff Administration (2011-Present)", "paragraphs": ["President Dilma Rousseff of the center-left PT was inaugurated to a second four-year term on January 1, 2015.

Annual economic growth averaged over 4% during that eight-year span, boosting employment and wages. As China's economy decelerated and commodity prices began to fall, however, Brazil's economic growth slowed.", "During her first term, Rousseff sought to offset the weaker international economic situation by stimulating domestic consumption and protecting domestic industries. Her administration implemented a series of short-term tax cuts and provided subsidized credit through state banks. Although those measures initially helped keep unemployment near historic lows, they also eroded the country's primary budget surplus and helped push inflation to the upper edge of the government's targeted boundary (4.5% with a 2-point tolerance band). To mitigate the increase in inflation, the Rousseff Administration held down fuel and electricity prices, which, along with other interventions in the economy, deterred investment.

She appointed a new economic team to implement a series of austerity measures designed to stabilize the country's debt levels, encourage investment, and ultimately boost growth. The fiscal adjustment has included partial budget freezes, reductions in the number and size of government ministries, restrictions on certain pension and unemployment benefits, and reversals of several of the tax cuts granted during her first term. The Rousseff Administration has also allowed fuel and electricity prices to rise. At the same time, the Brazilian Central Bank has steadily raised the benchmark interest rate with the aim of bringing inflation back down to the 4.5% target.", "Nevertheless, economic conditions in Brazil have continued to deteriorate.

Inflation remains high, amounting to 10.7% in 2015, eroding wages and the value of social welfare programs. As a result of delays in the implementation of its fiscal adjustments and weaker-than-forecasted revenue collection, the Rousseff Administration was forced to abandon its 1.1% primary budget surplus target and finished 2015 with a budget deficit before interest payments of 1.9%. Two of the three major credit ratings agencies have downgraded Brazil's sovereign credit rating to \"junk\" status, obliging many institutional investors to divest funds from the country.", "Many economists and international investors maintain that Brazil must implement more far-reaching economic adjustments. The IMF, for example, maintains that Brazil needs to quickly restore a fiscal surplus and put public debt on a downward path; bring inflation back down to the target range; and address structural impediments to growth, such as infrastructure bottlenecks, a relatively closed economy, and a complex and burdensome tax system. Some economists assert that Brazil has lost market credibility and that the only way to regain it quickly would be to negotiate an adjustment program with the IMF. President Rousseff did little to prepare her political base for an economic adjustment, however, having campaigned against austerity measures during the 2014 election.

At least $3 billion from the inflated contracts was allegedly funneled to corrupt executives at the construction firms and Petrobras, as well as dozens of politicians from multiple political parties.

Brazilian presidents have traditionally constructed governing majorities by distributing control of government resources to allied political parties through legislative earmarks and positions in ministries and state enterprises. Rousseff has fewer resources to distribute, however, as a result of her administration's austerity policies.

Rousseff is charged with \"fiscal pedaling\" for allegedly violating the country's fiscal responsibility law by postponing required payments to state banks to compensate for budget shortfalls and thereby presenting a stronger (and artificial) fiscal position. Cunha's decision appears to have been driven largely by political factors. After he was indicted on corruption and money laundering charges, Cunha sought to use the threat of impeachment as leverage to ensure PT legislators would help derail efforts to expel him from Congress. When the PT legislators voted to move forward with an ethics investigation, Cunha retaliated with the impeachment proceedings.", "Rousseff maintains that there is no legal justification for her impeachment, and has repeatedly asserted that any attempt to remove her would amount to a \"coup.\" Rousseff's opponents need to secure two-thirds majorities in both houses of the Brazilian Congress in order to impeach her and remove her from office. Most analysts think Rousseff currently has enough congressional support to hold onto the presidency. That could change, however, if prosecutors find evidence directly linking her to the Petrobras scandal or if the continued deterioration in economic conditions leads to a new round of large-scale anti-government protests.
