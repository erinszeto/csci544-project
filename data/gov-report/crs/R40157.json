Families that were economically disadvantaged before the recession are highly likely to face risks to their well-being\u2014unemployment rates for women maintaining families, minorities, and those with less than a high school education are above the average for all workers.", "The emphasis of public policy for low-income families with children with able-bodied parents is supporting and requiring work. The system of needs-based cash benefits underwent major changes over several decades, culminating in policy changes in the mid-1990s that included the major welfare reform law of 1996. The current recession is the first real test of how policies put in place in the mid-1990s affect the well-being of families with children during a steep economic downturn and high unemployment. Unemployment insurance (UI) is the major program to replace lost wages for unemployed workers. However, low-wage workers and those with intermittent employment are less likely to receive UI than higher-wage workers with stronger labor force attachment. In the past, the \"safety net\" for families with children included cash welfare. The 1996 welfare reform law created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant with fixed funding and altered rules that apply to the cash welfare caseload and gave states enhanced flexibility in designing benefits and services for needy families with children. The cash welfare caseload declined by two-thirds from 1994 to 2008 and stood at 1.8 million families in December 2008, just above the post-welfare reform low of 1.7 million families in July 2008. The share of poor children receiving TANF plummeted from over 60% before welfare reform to 22% by 2008.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) provides states with incentives and funds to rethink the safety net for disadvantaged families with children. First, it provides states with funding incentives to expand UI for low-income workers. This permits states to expand social insurance to respond to the recession. ARRA also provides additional funding to the states through TANF to finance recession-related expenditures. It establishes a temporary, $5 billion \"emergency\" contingency fund that will reimburse states for 80% of increased expenditures for basic assistance, non-recurrent short-term benefits, and subsidized employment expenditures for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Emergency funds for basic assistance are contingent on increases in the basic assistance caseload. Through September 11, 2009, 15 states have been granted emergency funds totaling $563 million with $180 million in outlays.", "ARRA's new funds to pay for increased basic assistance (i.e. cash welfare) have raised the question of whether the newly available funds will serve to promote welfare dependency. Historically, cash welfare caseloads often increase when unemployment increases, so it could be argued that the additional funds will pay for caseload rises caused by systemic economic forces (e.g. a world-wide recession). However, concerns about increasing welfare dependency, as well as concerns that traditional cash welfare might not meet the needs of those thrown into poverty by the recession, could lead to debates at the state level about how best to use these new TANF funds. Since TANF provides states with broad flexibility, ARRA's additional TANF funding could be used for new programs, such as short-term benefits, subsidized employment programs, and community service programs, in addition to or instead of increased traditional cash welfare.

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), an earnings supplement usually received as a tax refund, was expanded and its amount increased by legislation in 1993. Health care from Medicaid was gradually expanded to cover all poor children, followed by legislation in 1997 that established the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). ", "The TANF cash welfare system of today reflects a historical legacy of controversy. Federal involvement in funding cash welfare for needy families dates back to the Great Depression, and concern about risks to the economic security of families. At the time, the major risk addressed by policy was the loss of the earnings of one parent (the father) because of death. However, \"welfare\" issues were entwined with many of the social changes in the second half of the 20 th Century. The increase in women's labor force participation raised the expectation that mothers heading families work. Welfare raised racial issues, as an increasing share of the welfare caseload became nonwhite. Payments that went primarily to fatherless families also raised issues of personal responsibility and morality. Welfare increasingly became a program associated not with economic risks, but with the personal characteristics and behavior of its recipients.", "The 1996 welfare reform law ( P.L. 104-193 ) substantially altered the policy landscape for low-income families. It ended the New Deal program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and with it the entitlement to needy families for cash assistance. AFDC was replaced by the TANF block grant, with work participation requirements and time limits for cash welfare recipients. The 1996 welfare reform also significantly increased federal funding to the states to subsidize child care, further supporting work among low-income families.", "Partially as a result of the policies put into place in the mid-1990s, and partially as a result of the economic boom that followed, the welfare caseload plummeted and work among single mothers increased. In December 2008, the cash welfare caseload had fallen to 65% below the December 1994 caseload figure. Child poverty declined from 1994 through 2000, but the welfare rolls declined faster. As a result, fewer poor children were in families receiving cash welfare, though a greater proportion of poor children were in families with earnings. The period after 2000 saw slower economic growth than in the late 1990s, and child poverty rose, but the welfare rolls still declined.

Historically, child poverty rates have increased during recessions and fallen during periods of economic growth. The child poverty rate tends to peak after the low-point of the economic cycle. During the decade of the 1980s, the child poverty rate peaked in 1983, a year after the end of the back-to-back recessions of 1980 and 1981-82, and in the 1990s it peaked in 1993, two years after the 1990-91 recession.

While there is a clear association between the two indicators, the child poverty rate is affected by more than just the national economy. The child poverty rate remained high in the 1980s, as the percent of children living in female-headed families increased. The child poverty rate also increased after the 2001 recession.

Unemployment insurance (UI) is the primary government program to help the involuntarily unemployed replace a portion of their lost earnings. However, UI was not designed to provide benefits to all unemployed persons. New entrants and those re-entering the workforce after prolonged absences are not eligible for UI. Even among job losers, UI receipt is not universal. UI requires sufficient recent employment (and a minimum amount of earnings in a recent period) to be eligible for benefits upon becoming unemployed. Additionally, some unemployed persons already have exhausted their weeks of unemployment benefits. ", "Research shows that low-wage workers, part-time workers, and women, have lower rates of UI receipt when they become unemployed. Additionally, policies to increase the financial rewards from work and the welfare reforms of the 1990s helped spur more single mothers into the workforce. Those who leave welfare for work often fail to stay employed. Studies of those who left welfare indicate that, among those who left welfare for work, only between 30% and 50% stayed employed all four quarters after leaving the rolls. A study of welfare leavers in four large states (Florida, Ohio, Michigan, and Texas) showed that of all welfare leavers who became unemployed, only 13% drew UI. Less than 25% of unemployed leavers applied for UI. Most of those who applied for UI were monetarily eligible (earned sufficient wages), but many failed to receive unemployment benefits for other reasons. Voluntarily quitting a job often disqualifies a person from receiving UI, and in many states a person who quits for \"family\" reasons (e.g. caring for a sick child, need to align hours to accommodate family responsibilities, etc.) cannot receive UI. During a recession, those who leave jobs for such reasons have to compete in a more difficult labor market along with others. Many states also bar unemployed persons available only for part-term work from receiving UI.", "The second tier of the safety net for families with children are programs that provide benefits based on financial need. Before the economy entered recession, poor children were far more likely to be in families receiving benefits from the food stamp program (now renamed Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and health care than cash welfare. Figure 2 shows the number of children in families receiving cash welfare, compared with children in SNAP/Food Stamp households and children enrolled in Medicaid in both FY1995, before the enactment of welfare reform, and FY2007. The other two programs had more child recipients than cash welfare in both years. However, by FY2007 the number of children benefitting from SNAP/food stamps and Medicaid dwarfed the number of children in families receiving cash welfare.

TANF also includes some additional funding sources, including a limited contingency fund (discussed in detail below) and supplemental grants that have totaled $319 million and have been targeted to 17 states.", "The fixed nature of TANF funding imposes financial risk on states. Absent additional funding, states bear the risk of an increase in recession-related costs, including increases in the cash welfare caseload. To pay for increased costs in a recession, states either have to cut other human services funded through TANF or increase spending from their own funds. TANF funds have been used for a wide range of human services that either seek to address the root cause or ameliorate the effects of economic disadvantage among families with children. These initiatives\u2014launched in better economic times\u2014are at risk in states that need to reallocate TANF funds toward economic assistance during a recession.", " Figure 3 shows the use of TANF grants and MOE spending for FY2007.

Even when also counting expenditures on administration and work activities (the other categories associated with traditional welfare programs), a little less than half of all TANF and MOE funds are accounted for. A second major category of TANF funding is work supports\u2014particularly child care. Child care\u2014either through expenditures or transfers to the Child Care and Development Fund\u2014accounts for almost one-fifth (19%) of total TANF and MOE spending.

It was estimated that little more than 1/3 of those who entered the rolls could be expected to be on the rolls for five years or more.
