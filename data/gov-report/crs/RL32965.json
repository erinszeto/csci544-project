Quantity goals are based on the projected need for new personnel each service must bring in over the course of the year to meet its congressionally authorized end-strength. There are two principal quality goals: at least 90% of new recruits should be high school diploma graduates and at least 60% should score above average on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). Quality goals are only for recruits without any previous military service (\"non-prior service\"). Retention performance for enlisted personnel is principally measured by meeting one or more quantity goals. For the Active Components, quantity goals are based on career phase (for example, initial term, mid-career, and career) and are stated in numerical terms. For the Reserve Components, retention is tracked via overall attrition rates, which measure the ratio of people who leave in a given year. Reserve Component retention goals establish a maximum attrition rate or \"ceiling\" which should not be exceeded. They are stated in percentage terms and are not broken out by career phase.", "Overview of FY2013 and FY2014 Results", "In FY2013 and FY2014, all of the Active Components achieved their recruit quantity goals and recruit quality was high. Nearly all new recruits had high school diplomas, and about three-quarters scored above average on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Recruit quality in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force in these years has been near the highest levels experienced since the beginning of the All-Volunteer Force in 1973; Army recruit quality, as measured by high school diploma graduates, has been quite high as well, although above-average scores on the AFQT are just slightly above the DOD benchmark. Retention has remained strong for most of the services, although the Navy experienced modest shortfalls in both years. Most of the Reserve Components met or exceeded their quantity goals while quality remained high. The Army National Guard was slightly below its quantity goals in both of these years, while the Army Reserve experienced more substantial shortfalls, contributing to a decline in its personnel strength. Recruit quality for the Reserve Components has been fairly strong, although above-average AFQT scores for the Army National Guard and Army Reserve have hovered just slightly above the DOD benchmark of 60%. Several of the Reserve Components exceeded their attrition ceilings, although the margins were modest. The Army Reserve finished FY2014 about 3.3% below its authorized end-strength, indicating a need for stronger recruiting and retention in the future.

Congress exercises a powerful influence on recruiting and retention goals through its establishment of personnel strength levels for each of the Active and Reserve Components. It influences the achievement of these goals primarily through setting military compensation levels (which may include recruiting and retention bonuses, educational benefits, and separation incentives), establishing criteria that affect eligibility for enlistment and retention (for example, age, cognitive, behavioral, and citizenship standards), and by authorizing and funding recruiting and retention programs (for example, providing for dedicated recruiters and career counselors, military entrance processing stations, market research, and advertising). Through its oversight powers, Congress also closely monitors the performance of the executive branch in managing the size and quality of the military workforce.", "Since 2001, the United States has conducted major military operations that dramatically increased the operations tempo of the military services, required the large-scale mobilization of reservists, and resulted in significant battle casualties. These factors were particularly applicable to the Army, Army Reserve, Army National Guard, Marine Corps, and Marine Corps Reserve, which shouldered the bulk of the manpower burden associated with operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Many observers expressed concern that these factors would lead to lower recruiting and retention rates and jeopardize the vitality of today's all-volunteer military, particularly in the FY2005-FY2007 timeframe, when the Army had difficulty meeting its recruit quantity goals and began accepting lower-quality recruits. However, starting in 2008 these concerns were alleviated by the more favorable recruiting and retention environment brought about by comparatively high unemployment rates in the civilian economy, the improved security situation in Iraq, and reduced recruiting goals for the Army and Marine Corps as both of those services completed major expansions. ", "In recent year, cuts in active and reserve force structure have generated less demand for military manpower, thus allowing the services to set lower quantity goals for recruiting and retention. Lower quantity goals also allow the services to be more selective in whom they accept and retain, thereby enhancing quality levels. However, the future recruiting and retention environment is less clear. Reductions in strength may be coming to an end, which would likely require the services to increase their recruiting and retention quantity goals in order to stabilize their forces at planned levels. This could result in the services reducing quality somewhat to meet their quantity goals, or perhaps require the application of greater recruiting resources (e.g., advertising, recruiters, and enlistment bonuses) to maintain quality. A strengthening of economic growth could make civilian work comparatively more attractive than military work, thereby making recruiting and retention more challenging. Additionally, the historical experience of the post-Cold War drawdown also raises some cautionary flags for the current post-drawdown situation: if a perception of limited career prospects or lower job satisfaction were to develop, it could have a negative effect on recruiting and retention.

Taken as a whole, FY2009-FY2014 have been strong recruiting years, most clearly with regards to recruit quality. ", "There are a number of likely causes for this recruiting success. One factor that has a powerful impact on military recruiting is the state of the economy. Military recruiting is generally easier in times of high unemployment and more difficult in times of low unemployment. Historical data indicate that the unemployment rate dropped from 2003 through 2007 (falling from 6.0% in 2003 to 4.6% for 2006 and 2007) and then climbed to 5.8% in 2008, 9.3% in 2009, and 9.6% in 2010. While the unemployment rate subsequently dropped to 8.9% for 2011, 8.1% for 2012, and 7.4% in 2013, it was likely still high enough to benefit military recruiting efforts. ", "Another factor contributing to strong recruiting was likely the cumulative effect of the substantial increases in military compensation that have occurred over the past decade or so. In most years between FY2001 and FY2010, Congress increased basic pay by an amount that was at least 0.5% higher than the annual increase in the employment cost index (a common measure of increases in wages for private-sector employees). Congress initiated a multi-year reform of housing allowances between FY1998 and FY2005 to raise housing allowance rates in order to bring them line with actual housing costs. Congress also increased the amount of hostile fire pay and family separation allowance in 2002, authorized premium-based TRICARE coverage for non-activated reservists in 2006, and enacted a generous new educational benefit in 2008. Cumulatively, these changes have made the military compensation package much more attractive. ", "A third important factor was likely the improved security situation in Iraq, which resulted in a rapid decline in casualties. From 2004 to 2007, roughly 700 servicemembers were killed in action each year while serving in Iraq, with about 70% of them serving in the Army and its Reserve Components. However, as security improved in Iraq, the number of those killed in action in Iraq dropped to 218 in 2008, and to 34 in 2011 when the U.S. combat mission in Iraq formally ended. While casualties in Afghanistan rose significantly between 2008 and 2010, the increase was substantially less than the decline in casualties in Iraq. Combat deaths in Afghanistan declined after 2010, with 38 in 2014.", "One more factor that positively affected recruiting in FY2009 and subsequent years was the completion of the major multi-year efforts by the Army and the Marine Corps to increase their personnel strength, followed by very substantial strength reduction for those two services. The growth initiatives carried out between FY2005-FY2008 required those services to set higher goals for the number of new accessions. With the successful completion of its \"Grow the Army\" initiative, the Army was able to lower its accession goal from 80,000 per year in FY2005-FY2008 to an average of about 68,000 per year in FY2009-FY2011. Likewise, the Marine Corps was able to reduce its accession goal from 37,967 in FY2008 to an average of about 30,000 per year in FY2009-FY2011. Then, in FY2013-FY2015, Congress approved substantial reductions in end-strength for the Army and the Marine Corps, which continued to limit the need for new enlisted accessions. ", "However, some of the factors that helped to generate a strong recruiting environment in FY2009 and subsequent years have been fading in significance. Most notably, the civilian unemployment rate is much improved from the 9.3% rate in FY2009. At present, the unemployment rate (5.5% in May 2015) is at a level where it could have a detrimental effect on recruiting; that is, competition with civilian employers might undercut military recruiting efforts. Additionally, in contrast to the increases of the previous decade, Congress and the Administration have sought to rein in military compensation raises in recent years, most notably by holding the 2014 and 2015 increases in basic pay below the rate of increases in civilian compensation and by slightly reducing housing allowance rates in 2015. Further changes in the military compensation package are being contemplated as well, most notably the restructuring of the military retirement system proposed in the House and Senate versions of the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act.

This was a particular concern during the middle part of the last decade, as the stress of combat deployments raised concerns about the willingness of military personnel to continue serving. The opposite concern\u2014more salient today in light of reductions in force structure\u2014is that too many people will stay in, thereby decreasing promotion opportunities and possibly requiring involuntarily separations in order to prevent the organization from becoming \"top heavy\" with middle and upper level leaders or to comply with end-strength limitations.

The Marine Corps exceeded its retention goals in FY2013, although it fell short in both categories in FY2014.

Reserve Component retention goals establish a maximum attrition rate or \"ceiling\" which should not be exceeded. They are stated in percentage terms and are not broken out by career phase. The data show all of the Reserve Components achieved enlisted attrition rates below their ceilings for FY2012 (see Table 6 ). This is consistent with Reserve Component retention results over the past decade: the Reserve Components have typically stayed under their attrition ceilings, often by substantial margins. For FY2013, the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, and Navy Reserve were above their attrition ceilings, though this was partly due to a lower ceiling rather than just an increase in attrition. In comparison to FY2012, attrition increased slightly for all the Reserve Components except the Army National Guard. Attrition in FY2014 was slightly higher than FY2013 for the Army National Guard, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, and Air Force Reserve. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Retention has been positively affected by some of the same factors that have led to strong recruiting (see \" Recruiting \"). Put simply, for a number of years, a relatively weak civilian job market coupled with an attractive military compensation package has provided fewer incentives for members to leave the military. Additionally, the ongoing drawdown of the Army has had a positive effect on its achieving retention goals. Planned reductions in its Active Component force structure have allowed the Army to maintain fairly modest retention goals, thereby making it easier to achieve them. If Congress continues to approve Administration proposals to reduce Army personnel strength through over the next several years, it will continue to require relatively modest retention rates. The Marine Corps also reduced its retention goals modestly between FY2009 and FY2010, and they have stayed approximately at the lower level since then. However, it may need to raise its retention goals in the near future as it appears to be approaching the end of its drawdown. ", "On the other hand, there are some factors which may pose challenges to robust retention in the future. For example, improvements in the unemployment picture and recent efforts to reduce spending on military compensation may be increasing the attractiveness of civilian employment. Additionally, recent force structure reductions in the Army and Marine Corps may lead servicemembers to conclude that they have limited career prospects in the military and encourage them to look for more promising opportunities in the civilian economy. Finally, with the U.S. combat mission in Iraq completed in 2011, and a drawdown of forces in Afghanistan nearly complete, some servicemembers may become dissatisfied with military life in a garrison environment and therefore be less inclined to continue their military service. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Historical Perspective: The Post-Cold War Drawdown and Its Impact on Recruiting and Retention", "paragraphs": ["The nation's most recent experience with force structure cuts illustrates some of the potential impacts that such cuts can have on recruiting and retention. In the aftermath of the Cold War, all of the services embarked on major force reduction efforts. Needing fewer people, the services significantly reduced their recruiting and retention goals, which in turn made it easier for them to meet these goals. As a result, the services all reported excellent recruiting and retention results in the early 1990s. However, by the late 1990s, the Army, Navy, and Air Force began to experience some difficulties. In FY1998, the Army and the Navy failed to meet their quantity goals for enlisted recruits, as did the Army and the Air Force in FY1999. Retention shortfalls also surfaced in the Army, Navy, and Air Force. There was a wide array of perceived causes for these recruiting and retention shortfalls, including competition with a robust civilian economy and a perceived \"pay gap\" between civilian and military compensation, competition with institutions of higher education, and demographic and attitudinal changes among younger Americans. Other cited causes included limited recruiting resources and dissatisfaction with military life, due to the nature of military service and pace of operations (e.g., Bosnia and Kosovo) and a lack of critical supplies and equipment. ", "In comparison to the Cold War drawdown mentioned above, this current drawdown is smaller in scope for the Army, about the same magnitude of reduction for the Marine Corps, and is focused mainly on these two services rather than all four services; but a similar dynamic could occur. In such a scenario, recruiting and retention would likely remain strong in the near term due to force reductions and sluggish competition from the civilian economy, but challenges would arise once these factors faded. Specifically, recruiting and retention requirements could increase as the drawdown neared completion in order to stabilize the force at its designated personnel strength level. Meeting these requirements might also be made more difficult due to increased competition from a more robust economy, fewer resources allocated to recruiting and retention, or the development of negative attitudes about military career prospects and job satisfaction. If such a scenario were to occur, its impact on recruiting and retention would likely not be manifest until the latter half of this decade. Another cautionary flag raised by the post-Cold War drawdown relates to managing force structure to hedge against future contingencies. To paraphrase the comments of a former Chief of Staff of the Army, you can reduce force structure quickly, but it takes time to re-grow quality soldiers and leaders. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Congress exercises a powerful influence on recruiting and retention goals through its establishment of personnel strength levels for each of the Active and Reserve Components. As such, Congress's response to the Administration's force structure plans can have a major impact on each of the services' recruiting and retention goals. If Congress enacts into law manning levels significantly higher than what the Administration proposes, then the services typically increase their recruiting and retention goals to meet the higher objective; conversely, if Congress enacts lower manning levels into law, the services can decrease their goals.", "Congress also influences the achievement of these goals through setting military compensation levels (which may include recruiting and retention bonuses, educational benefits, and separation incentives), establishing criteria that affect eligibility for enlistment and retention (for example, age, cognitive, behavioral, and citizenship standards), and by authorizing and funding recruiting and retention programs (for example, providing for dedicated recruiters and career counselors, military entrance processing stations, market research, and advertising). Through its oversight powers, Congress also closely monitors the performance of the executive branch in managing the size and quality of the military workforce.", "The policy levers most commonly used by Congress and DOD to manage recruiting and retention in the near term include varying the number of recruiters, funding for advertising, and funding for enlistment and reenlistment bonuses. When recruiting or retention shortfalls occur, or are anticipated, Congress may elect to apply additional resources to these mechanisms, as it did during the last decade. Conversely, when recruiting or retention is expected to be strong, Congress may elect to shift resources away from these areas, as it has done in recent years.", "Robust military compensation, force structure cuts, and weakness in the labor market have contributed to a favorable environment for recruiting and retention in recent years. However, these favorable influences appear to be waning to a certain degree. Additionally, the experience of the post-Cold War drawdown raises some cautionary flags. If the drawdown undermines job satisfaction or creates a perception of limited career prospects, or if an improving economy makes civilian employment comparatively more attractive than military service, the services may face a more challenging recruiting and retention environment within a few years.
