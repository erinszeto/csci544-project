The act requires that these regulations, among other things, prohibit statements on labels and in advertisements \"that are disparaging of a competitor's products or are false, misleading, obscene, or indecent.\" A 1988 amendment to the act requires that alcoholic beverages sold or distributed in the United States, or to members of the Armed Forces outside the United States, contain a specified health warning label.", "In 1995, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional a provision of the act that prohibited beer labels from displaying alcohol content unless state law requires such disclosure. The Court found the provision to violate the First Amendment, concluding that, although the government had a legitimate interest in curbing \"strength wars\" by beer brewers who might seek to compete for customers on the basis of alcohol content, the ban \"cannot directly and materially advance\" this \"interest because of the overall irrationality of the Government's regulatory scheme.\" This irrationality was evidenced by the fact that the ban did not apply to beer advertisements, and that the statute required the disclosure of alcohol content on the labels of wines and spirits.", "Federal law does not prohibit the advertising of alcoholic beverages on radio or television, but, since 1936 for radio and 1948 for television, the industry voluntarily refrained from advertising hard liquor on radio or television.

Then, in March 2002, NBC announced that it would no longer accept liquor ads.

This apparently would include radio, and broadcast, cable, and satellite television.", "In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adopted a final rule restricting the advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. The purpose of the final rule \"is to establish restrictions on the sale, distribution, and use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in order to reduce the number of children and adolescents who use these products . . . .\" The rule did not go into effect, however, because a federal court ruled that the FDA lacked the statutory authority to restrict tobacco advertising. The Supreme Court later held that the FDA lacked the statutory authority to regulate tobacco products at all.", "The FDA final rule would have restricted tobacco advertising in several ways, such as by banning \"outdoor advertising for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, including billboards, posters, or placards . . . within 1,000 feet of the perimeter of any public playground or playground area in a public park, . . . elementary school or secondary school,\" and permitting other outdoor advertising, and advertising in newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, only in \"black text on a white background.\" It would also have prohibited any manufacturer, distributor, or retailer from sponsoring \"any athletic, musical, artistic or other social or cultural event, or any entry or team in any event, in the brand name .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, logo, motto, selling message, recognizable color or pattern of colors, or any other indicia of product identification identical or similar to, or identifiable with, those used for any brand of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco.\"", "On November 23, 1998, attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories signed an agreement with the major tobacco companies to settle all the lawsuits the states have brought to recover the public health costs of treating smokers.

The 1980 statute allows such a rule only if it is \"based upon acts or practices that are 'deceptive'\" ; unfairness alone is not adequate.", "A 1994 amendment to the FTC Act provides that an act or practice is illegal only if it \"causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumer or to competition.\" Section 12 of the act makes it unlawful to disseminate any false advertisement for \"foods, drugs, devices, services, or cosmetics.\" The Federal Trade Commission Act does not provide for lawsuits by individual consumers.

This statute applies to any unwanted advertisement, regardless of content.", "Another section of the statute provides that any person may file with the Postal Service a statement \"that he desires to receive no sexually oriented advertisements through the mails.\" The Postal Service shall make the list available, and \"[n]o person shall mail or cause to be mailed any sexually oriented advertisement to any individual whose name and address has been on the list for more than 30 days.\" If the Postal Service believes that any person is violating this provision, it may request the Attorney General to commence a civil action against such person in a federal district court.", "Another section of the statute provides that unordered merchandise sent through the mails \"may be treated as a gift by the recipient,\" and the sender may not bill for it. Various other federal statutes prohibit mail fraud and other deceptive mailing practices. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has adopted a trade regulation rule entitled \"Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise,\" which requires, among other things, that sellers who solicit buyers to order merchandise through the mails or by telephone ship such merchandise within the time the seller states or, if no time is stated, within 30 days after receipt of the order. Where a seller is unable to ship the merchandise within such time, it must offer the buyer the option to cancel the order and receive a prompt refund.", "In 1999, Congress enacted the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, P.L. 106-168 , which contains restrictions and requires disclosures with respect to mailed sweepstakes promotions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Advertising by Telephone", "paragraphs": ["The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 makes it illegal to, among other things, \"initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message,\" or \"use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.\" Victims of these practices may file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission and may sue and recover actual monetary damages or $500, whichever is greater, and the court may increase the award up to three times if it finds that the defendant acted willfully or knowingly. The Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, P.L. 109-21 , amended the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 to add the exception, previously promulgated by the FCC, that allows senders who have an established business relationship with a recipient to send unsolicited fax advertisements to that recipient. The 2005 statute also requires senders of fax advertisements to place a clear and conspicuous notice on the first page of every fax informing the recipient of how to opt out of future faxes.", "The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, enacted in 1994, required the Federal Trade Commission to \"prescribe rules prohibiting deceptive telemarketing acts or practices and other abusive telemarketing acts or practices.\" Such rules must include:", "(A) a requirement that telemarketers may not undertake a pattern of unsolicited telephone calls which the reasonable consumer would consider coercive or abusive of such consumer's right of privacy,", "(B) restrictions on the hours of the day and night when unsolicited telephone calls can be made to consumers, and", "(C) a requirement that a person engaged in telemarketing for the sale of goods or services shall promptly and clearly disclose to the person receiving the call that the purpose of the call is to sell goods or services and make such other disclosures as the Commission deems appropriate, including the nature and price of the goods and services.", "The FTC's Telemarketing Sales Rule, adopted pursuant to the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, prohibits telemarketers from, among other things, calling a person's residence, without the person's prior consent, before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. It also prohibits initiating a call to a person who has previously stated that he or she does not wish to receive a call from the seller or charitable organization, or who has placed his or her telephone number on the \"do-not-call\" registry maintained by the FTC.", "On September 23, 2003, a federal district court in Oklahoma held that the FTC does not have the authority to promulgate a national do-not-call registry, but, in response, Congress enacted a law ( P.L. 108-82 (2003)) to ratify that it does. On September 25, 2003, a federal district court in Colorado enjoined implementation of the do-not-call registry on the ground that it violated the First Amendment because it applied only to commercial solicitors and not to other types of speech, such as charitable or political solicitations. The FTC appealed, however, and, on October 7, 2003, the court of appeals granted a stay of the lower court's order, allowing the do-not-call registry to remain in effect pending final resolution of the appeal on the merits. On February 17, 2004, the court of appeals reversed the district court's decision, finding that the do-not-call registry does not violate the First Amendment. The discrimination against commercial solicitors, the court of appeals found, was justified \"based on findings that commercial telephone solicitation was significantly more problematic than charitable or political fundraising calls.\"", "The Federal Communications Commission also addresses the do-not-call issue; it requires persons who initiate a telephone solicitation to a residential phone number to institute procedures for \"maintaining a list of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations made by or on behalf of that person or entity.\" The Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, P.L. 108-10 (2003), requires the FCC, by September 7, 2003, to \"issue a final rule it began on September 18, 2002, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 U.S.C. 227 et seq.)
