Currently, federal highway and public transportation programs are funded mainly by motor fuel tax receipts that flow into the Highway Trust Fund (HTF). The tax rates, set on a per-gallon basis, have not been raised since 1993, and receipts have been insufficient to support the transportation programs authorized by Congress since FY2008. The long-term viability of motor fuels taxes is also questionable because of increasing vehicle fuel efficiency and the wider use of electric vehicles. Economists have favored the use of mileage-based user charges as an alternative to motor fuels taxes to support highway funding. Congress, in Section 6020 of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act; P.L. 114-94), provided $95 million to fund large-scale pilot studies by states or groups of states to demonstrate \"user-based revenue systems\" to maintain the solvency of the HTF.", "Under this user charge concept, motorists would pay based on distance driven and, perhaps, other costs of road use, such as wear and tear on roads, traffic congestion, and air pollution. Mileage-based road user charges could range from a flat cent per mile charge based on a simple odometer reading to a variable charge based on a global positioning system (GPS). Other proposals envision mileage-based road user charges that would mimic the way Americans now pay their fuel taxes by collecting the charge at the pump. Most road user charge systems would require electric vehicle users to pay for their use of the roads. Charging by the mile could in itself provide an incentive to drive less. Such a reaction would reduce revenue, however.", "Implementation of a mileage-based road user charge would have to overcome a number of potential disadvantages relative to the motor fuels tax, including public concern about personal privacy; the higher costs to establish, collect, and enforce (estimates range from 5% to 13% of collections); the administrative challenge of the billing process given the size of the private vehicle fleet (estimated at roughly 256 million vehicles or points of collection); and the setting and adjusting of the road user charge rates, which would likely face as much opposition as increasing the motor fuels taxes.", "Experiments with road user charges have been conducted in the United States. Although useful, most of these have been small-scale experiments done at the state or local level. Other countries have implemented full-scale road user charge systems that offer more information on the potential costs and benefits.

The funds collected would be spent for surface transportation purposes.", "The concept is not new: Federal motor fuel taxes are a form of indirect road user charge insofar as road use is loosely related to fuel consumption. Some states have charged trucks by the mile for many years, and toll roads charge drivers based on miles traveled and the number of axles on a vehicle, which is used as a proxy for weight. Recent technological developments, as well as the evident shortcomings of motor fuel taxes, have led to renewed interest in the user charge concept, including establishment of a pilot program in legislation enacted in 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Road User Charges Might Work", "paragraphs": ["A road user charge system would involve assessing owners of individual vehicles on a per-mile basis for the distance the vehicle is driven. Depending upon the details of such a program, a basic per-mile charge could be adjusted based on any number of factors, such as the time of day a trip is taken, the place of travel, the weight of the vehicle, and the emissions of the vehicle's engine. Most studies of road use charging envision a single national system that would distribute revenue to the HTF and directly to the states, which currently impose their own taxes on motor fuels for transportation purposes. Existing motor fuel taxes might be discontinued, phased out, or diverted to other uses as a user charge system takes effect. ", "Proposed systems generally involve three functional components:", "1. Metering: determining the number of miles traveled on roads subject to the user charge and any other information needed to determine fees owed. 2. Billing: communication of mileage and fees owed, issuance of bills, and collection of the revenue. Most charging proposals envision that fees would be charged to the vehicle owner's credit or bank card, as occurs on many toll roads today. 3. Enforcement: assuring that motorists have been charged correctly and have paid their fees. Enforcement actions could include checks for tampering with on-board units (OBUs) that might be used to collect data, checks of OBUs against odometer readings, and legal measures to collect unpaid charges. If some motorists were allowed to continue to pay motor fuel taxes rather than distance-based user charges, authorities would need to verify that such taxes were being paid. If a road user charge were to have multiple objectives, enforcement could become more complex. For example, if the system were to have lower charges for trucks with low-emissions engines than for trucks with high-emissions engines, it would be necessary to verify that each truck is using an OBU that identifies its emissions level correctly. ", "There are numerous ways in which a nationwide road user charge could be structured and collected.

The location data could be used to inform the driver of the fee in real time or could be transmitted via mobile phone to a central processing office for calculation. In either case, the central office data center would use the information to prepare the user's invoice. The on-board unit (OBU) offers the ability to vary the charges on a particular vehicle based on multiple objectives. However, it also raises the greatest concern about privacy, as the operators of the system would be able to track each vehicle's movements. This may have legal implications as well. Although the technology would be quite different from existing electronic tolling systems, such as E-ZPass, the experience would be quite similar for drivers, who would not need to take any special action to figure out their liability and pay their bills.

Two states have tested user charges of this sort. A test in Nevada simply estimated each vehicle's mileage based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency and the amount of gasoline purchased. When the vehicle pulled up to the gas pump, a transponder installed in the vehicle transmitted this information to a transponder in the pump. The pump transponder retransmitted the mileage information to a central office, which calculated the road user fee and sent the information back to the pump for inclusion in the price of fuel. The participant received a receipt, printed at the pump, specifying the cost of fuel and the user charge. Oregon ran similar tests with and without installation of a GPS-based recording device in the vehicles. Participants expressed privacy concerns about the GPS devices. The systems without GPS devices, however, cannot charge variable rates depending upon time of day or road congestion, as they reveal only how many miles the vehicle was driven, not where or when it was driven. ", "Pay-at-the-pump systems might allow a mileage-based user charge to coexist with a motor fuels tax, with vehicle owners having the option of paying one or the other. However, it could be administratively complex. The current federal fuels taxes are collected from fuel dealers prior to the wholesale level, not from retail gas stations, so charging in this way would require the federal government to establish thousands of new collection points.

Fraud could be a major problem, as drivers might have incentives to install defeat devices and software. A straightforward odometer reading would not support higher user charges at peak times or on congested roads, and it would not be able to avoid double-charging vehicles that use toll roads.", "Oregon has implemented an odometer-based system, known as OReGO, on a voluntary basis. The system uses a plug-in device to collect revenue at a rate of 1.5 cents per mile. Taxpayers have a choice of a device with no GPS that tallies charges for all miles driven or a device with GPS that tallies only miles within the state.

The federal government has no need to assess taxes at 111,000 gasoline stations or charge millions of vehicle owners individually. Tax administration costs are generally estimated to be less than one cent per dollar of revenue.

", "U.S. toll road agencies that make extensive use of electronic toll collection experience costs of roughly 7% to 12% of revenues. For example, the New Hampshire Turnpike system reported that its E-ZPass processing fees were 7.3% of total E-ZPass revenues in FY2015. Fees charged by banks for processing transactions and enforcement costs are not included in that percentage.

More recently, the New Hampshire Turnpike System reported that for the 2015 fiscal year, bank and credit card fees were 2.7% of its electronic E-ZPass revenues. This indicates that the cost of any electronic user charge scheme relying on users paying via credit and bank cards would likely be more than double the cost of collecting the federal motor fuels tax, even before administrative or enforcement costs are considered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charging Unbanked and Underbanked Users", "paragraphs": ["About 7.7% of U.S. households are \"unbanked,\" lacking any bank account at an insured institution.

Over 30% of consumers do not have a credit card, and 20% do not have a debit card. Unbanked and underbanked road users would not be easily brought into a charging system based on electronic payments.

The cost of enforcing road user charges could be quite different, especially if the charges for a particular trip are based on congestion, number of passengers in the vehicle, or other factors in addition to mileage traveled. ", "The administrative and enforcement costs matter. If a road user charge were designed to raise the same amount of revenue as the current motor fuels tax but were far more costly to administer, it would generate less money for transportation purposes.

For example, given its past support for low-emission vehicles, Congress might wish to exempt electric vehicles from the mileage-based charge. Similarly, vehicles owned by nonprofit organizations could be exempt from the charge, or vehicles owned by disabled individuals could face a lower charge per mile. Such provisions would either reduce revenues or require other vehicle owners to pay higher rates to produce the same amount of gross revenue. Creating numerous categories with distinct charges would increase the complexity of administration and enforcement, likely raising the cost of operating the system.

Fitting trucks with OBUs based on GPS technology would raise fewer privacy concerns than a system encompassing all vehicles, and implementation costs would be lower.

Currently, states impose motor fuel taxes at varying levels, and in some cases regions within states impose additional taxes on fuel. An eventual national user charge scheme would need to be able to determine the distance a vehicle has driven in each jurisdiction and assess the appropriate per-mile charge levied by that jurisdiction, if any, in addition to the federal charge.

Drivers of trucks without OBUs must pay the toll by credit card or direct debit either on the Internet or at kiosks installed at gas stations and highway rest stops.

There is no adjustment for an increased number of axles beyond four. The road user charge in Germany is assessed on the basis of kilometers rather than ton-kilometers, as in Switzerland. This fee structure gives operators an incentive to load their vehicles to the maximum permissible weight.

Direct taxes on German-registered trucks were reduced by as much as \u20ac929 per year when the charge was introduced. Approximately \u20ac150 million per year raised from the charge is distributed to German states in compensation for revenue forgone when previous truck taxes were reduced. ", "Toll Collect does not disclose operating costs. However, the U.S. GAO determined that the German government paid the system operator roughly $664 million per year\u2014or about 13% of average annual revenue\u2014to manage the system from 2007 through 2011. In addition, about $740 million is spent annually to assist German trucking firms in complying with the system. The German government does not consider this to be part of the cost of operating the system, but it does reduce by roughly 15% the revenues available to be used for other purposes. ", "The 2011 law now governing the German truck road user charge system includes significant provisions intended to protect privacy. The system operator is prohibited from disclosing data on any vehicle's toll payments, route, time of travel, registration number, number of axles, and engine characteristics, and such data may not be transferred to any other party. Except when a vehicle is under investigation for toll evasion, the system operator must destroy data communicated by the OBUs immediately upon payment. Data and photographs from surveillance devices must be destroyed as soon as the operator confirms that the road user charge has been paid or that the vehicle is not subject to charge.

Unlike the Swiss and German systems, the Austrian system provides for three different size classifications for vehicles with two axles, three axles, and four or more axles. Rates for vehicles with four or more axles are more than twice those for two-axle vehicles with engines of similar vintage. A three-axle truck with a recent engine pays \u20ac0.2198 per kilometer ($0.40 per mile), and a four-axle truck with an older engine may pay as much as \u20ac0.4473 per kilometer ($0.82 per mile).", "The Austrian system does not rely on GPS but uses a microwave transponder mounted behind the truck windshield to communicate with toll-collection devices on road-spanning gantries. It is technically compatible with the Swiss system, so trucks with Swiss OBUs are able to travel on Austrian roads. Trucks equipped with German OBUs may also use them in Austria. However, Austrian transponders will not work in Switzerland or Germany.", "The transport ministers of Austria's federal states have proposed extending mileage-based road user charges to all federal and state highways\u2014in part to address complaints that heavy trucks are using these roads to avoid paying the user charges and in part to produce additional revenue for state governments. Such a change would require Austria to shift from its microwave-based system to a GPS-based system such as Germany's, at considerable cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other EU Countries", "paragraphs": ["Several other EU member states also impose mileage-based road user charges on trucks.

Rates per kilometer on national highways are 20% less than those on expressways. ", "The Czech Republic uses a microwave system similar to Austria's. Road user charges are based on the number of axles rather than vehicle rate, but engines are divided into three emissions classes rather than four, as in Poland.

The charges were based on distance driven and a nominal vehicle weight, as opposed to the actual weight of a vehicle on each trip. The charges were applied to diesel passenger cars as well as heavy goods vehicles. The policy decision to include diesel cars was taken because New Zealand does not assess a road tax on diesel fuel, as more than one-third of all diesel fuel sold in the country is used for off-road purposes. Drivers of vehicles powered by gasoline, compressed natural gas, and liquid petroleum gas pay a road tax collected at the wholesale level and are not subject to road user charge. Revenue from both the road user charge and the road tax, as well as from an annual registration fee on all vehicles, is expended on surface transportation.", "The actual charges assessed on individual vehicles are based on a cost-allocation model that aims at forcing individual users to pay the long-run marginal social cost of their use of New Zealand's road network. The most significant of these costs is road wear. The charge for a heavy truck with five axles, for example, is lower than for a heavy truck with three or four axles, because distributing the vehicle weight across more axles reduces the amount of road wear caused. In practice, however, it has been difficult for New Zealand authorities to adjust charges for road wear without compromising simplicity and ease of enforcement. For example, wide tires are known to reduce the pavement wear caused by a heavy vehicle, but adjusting individual vehicles' charges based on the width of their tires would make the charging system more complex and compliance more difficult to monitor.", "Road users subject to the road user charge must purchase distance licenses in units of 1,000 kilometers. The license, a placard that must be displayed on the passenger side of the windshield, specifies the vehicle odometer readings at the start and end of its validity. Each vehicle subject to the charge is required to have a hub odometer installed on the left-hand side of one axle, and police and New Zealand Transport Agency inspectors can readily check the hub odometer to determine whether the license is valid.", "The cost for a standard passenger car is 62 New Zealand dollars per 1,000 kilometers (US$0.07 per mile). This is approximately the same cost per mile paid in the form of petrol excise duty by a gasoline vehicle with fuel efficiency of 25 miles per gallon. A four-axle tractor-trailer combination must pay 361 New Zealand dollars per 1,000 kilometers (US$0.41 per mile). The New Zealand Transport Agency estimates that the road user charge represents about 10% of truckers' total costs. The agency also assesses a transaction fee of 4.80 New Zealand dollars (US$3.35) each time a license is purchased online, with higher charges for licenses purchased from machines at service stations and over-the-counter at retailers. Continuous licensing is required, so a driver must be in possession of a new license at the time the previous 1,000-kilometer allotment has been used."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
