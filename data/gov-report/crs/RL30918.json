Most analystsacknowledge that in some major areas Fujimori brought greater stability to Peru. He did much to bring undercontroldestabilizing factors such as terrorism, drug trafficking, hyperinflation, and border disputes. But Fujimori also ledthecountry into several constitutional crises. He was elected in 1990 under a constitution which limited presidents toservingone 5-year term. In 1992, in what became known as a \"self-coup,\" Fujimori dissolved Congress and took controlof thejudiciary. Under intense domestic and international pressure, Fujimori then oversaw the drafting of a newconstitution thatwent into effect in 1993, and scheduled elections. The new constitution allowed a president to serve two consecutivetermsand established a unicameral legislation. ", "Fujimori ran again in 1995, and won a second 5-year term. He quickly began paving the way for yet another term, furthereroding the independence of Peru's already weak democratic institutions as he did so. In 1996, the unicamerallegislature,dominated by a pro-Fujimori majority, passed a \"Law of Authentic Interpretation\" which stated that Fujimori'selectionunder the previous constitution did not count against the two-term limit of the current constitution. In 1997, theConstitutional Tribunal, a high court charged with deciding the constitutionality of laws, issued an opinion that theLaw ofAuthentic Interpretation was not applicable. The Peruvian Congress dismissed the three members of the court whosignedthe opinion (the other four members abstained), rendering the court unable to act.

Numerous Peruvian and international election monitoringorganizations and press reports indicated several areas of concern: the executive branch's manipulation of thejudicialsystem to achieve its desired outcome; questions regarding the independence and impartiality of the electoral bodiesresponsible for organizing Peru's elections, and use of public resources for campaign purposes. Concerns regardingfreedom of the press and access to information involved unequal media access, media bias, and harassment ofcandidatesand domestic election observers.

Since the fall of theFujimori government, many observers have expressed concern regarding the former head of the Peruvianintelligenceservice, Vladimiro Montesinos, and his relationship to U.S. agencies, especially to the Central Intelligence Agency. AsFujimori's top adviser, Montesinos was also involved in Peru's collaboration with the United States incounter-narcoticsefforts. Like Fujimori, Montesinos fled the country. He was captured in Venezuela, however, and returned to Peru,wherehe faces some 168 criminal investigations into crimes including money laundering, illicit enrichment and corruption,organizing death squads, protecting drug lords, and illegal arms trafficking.", "In their oversight of counter-narcotics programs in Peru, Members of the 107th Congress continue to monitor theseinvestigations, especially as they relate to relations between Montesinos and U.S. agencies. Peru's intelligenceservicereceived $1 million annually from 1990 to 2000 for counter-narcotics assistance from the CIA. A declassified DrugEnforcement Administration document shows U.S. officials were aware by 1996 of allegations that Montesinos wastakingprotection money from drug traffickers. (15) Therewere also reports that the service, known by its Spanish acronym of SIN,was responsible for an array of human rights violations. The United States has provided the Peruvian congressionalcommittee investigating Montesinos's activities with declassified State Department documents, which show U.S.officialsas wary of dealing with Montesinos in light of unconfirmed allegations of his involvement in corruption and humanrightsviolations. ", "President Toledo thanked President Bush for U.S. help in Montesinos' arrest and asked the U.S. to help build Peru's caseagainst former President Fujimori by releasing related classified U.S. documents. President Bush has promised thecontinued declassification and delivery of State Department documents requested by the Peruvian legislature.", "Trade Issues. Peru has an essentially free market economy. The UnitedStates is Peru's largest trading partner, with each country exporting approximately $2 billion to the other in 2000. Over thepast decade, Peru has eliminated almost all non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports. Tariffs averaging 13% apply tovirtually allU.S. exports to Peru. Tariffs on a very few agricultural goods are as high as 25%. Due to bilateral and multilateraltariffreduction agreements with Peru, exporters from some countries other than the United States have preferential accesstoPeru's market.", "For 10 years, Peru has benefitted from the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), which expired in December 2001, andadvocates its renewal. Part of the U.S. effort to promote economic alternatives to illicit narcotics production, ATPAgavepreferential, mostly duty-free treatment to certain Peruvian exports. The Andean Trade Promotion andDrugEradication Act ( H.R. 3009 ), would reauthorize and expand the program. The Houseversion passed Nov. 16, 2001; theSenate version ( S. 525, The Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act ) has been reported out ofcommittee and awaitsfinal floor action. Both versions would extend trade preference benefits into 2006, and expand duty-free treatmenttoinclude products that had previously been excluded, under certain conditions. Peru sought an extension to includeunlimited access for apparel made from regional fabrics and traditional fibers such as alpaca and llama. Bothversions ofthe bill would give preferential treatment to such exports. (For further information, see CRS Report RL30790 , The AndeanTrade Preference Act: Background and Issues for Reauthoriztion, by J.F. Hornbeck.)", "One of the greatest barriers to trade and investment in Peru, according to a U.S. Trade Representative report, is theweakness of Peruvian government institutions. Neither executive nor judicial branch offices, nor regulatoryagencies, hasthe expertise or resources to effectively conduct their duties. The judicial branch is especially susceptible to outsideinfluence. In seeking foreign investment and support, President Toledo has acknowledged these weaknesses andpromisesto promote reform to strengthen Peruvian institutions.", "Investment. The government launched a privatization program in 1992,and has greatly reduced its role in the economy since then. Most major state-owned businesses have been sold. Thegovernment has retained parts of the national petroleum company, some electrical utilities, and the Lima watercompany. U.S. companies have actively participated in Peru's privatization process, especially in the mining, energy, andpetroleumsectors.", "Over the past decade, Peru has eliminated most barriers to direct investment. National treatment for investors is guaranteedin Peru's 1993 constitution. Problems for U.S. investors have included efforts by the Privatization Agency toexcludeforeign investors from recent privatizations of electrical utilities by defining investors so as to exclude foreign ones;a lawwhich restricts majority ownership of broadcast media to citizens of Peru; in at least one case reported by the U.S.TradeRepresentative, a Peruvian government entity was reluctant to agree to arbitration with a U.S. firm in lieu of ajudicialproceeding, even though the constitution guarantees arbitration as an alternative to the courts.", "Intellectual Property Rights Protection. Peru has been on the U.S. TradeRepresentative's \"Special 301\" Priority Watch List since April 1999 due to concerns that Peru inadequately enforcesintellectual property rights. Although the government of Peru generally acts to promote and protect both domesticandforeign intellectual property rights, and Peruvian law provides for effective trademark protection, counterfeiting oftrademarks and piracy of copyrighted goods continue to be widespread.", "Lori Berenson. Berenson is an American who has been serving a lifesentence in Peru on charges of treason. She was convicted in 1996 by a secret Peruvian military tribunal of helpingtheTupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) plan a thwarted takeover of Peru's legislature. Berenson hasmaintainedher innocence. Since her imprisonment, some Members of the U.S. Congress have appealed for her release or fora new,fair trial. In July 2000, bipartisan groups of 221 Representatives and 40 Senators urged the Clinton Administrationto seekBerenson's release. Both letters cited Peru's failure to provide a fair public trial, as outlined in the InternationalCovenanton Civil and Political Rights, to which Peru is a signatory. In August 2000 Peru's highest military court overturnedherconviction, sending her to civilian court for a new trial on lesser charges of \"terrorist collaboration.\" In June 2001,she wasconvicted and given a 20-year sentence, the minimum for collaboration. Berenson's appeal of that judgment wasdenied byPeru's Supreme Court in February 2002.", "Some analysts, including former U.S. Ambassador to Peru Dennis Jett, who was serving in Peru when the MRTA tookhundreds of people hostage at the Japanese ambassador's residence in 1996, say it would be \"a major mistake\" tomakeBerenson's pardon a high priority in U.S.-Peru relations and would risk making President Toledo appear to be softonterrorism or as interfering with the courts. (16)", "When he met with President-elect Toledo in June, President Bush asked Toledo, \"in addition to the rule of law,\" that\"humanitarian factors be taken into consideration in a final resolution\" of Berenson's case. Toledo said he told Bushhebelieved that the judiciary system should be allowed to \"do its job\" and said elsewhere that he would not intervenein thecase. (17) The White House denied reports thatPresident Bush had asked Toledo to grant Berenson clemency on Bush'srecent trip to Lima. A spokesman said the President told Toledo Berenson was given due process in her second trial,andthat he was awaiting the recommendation of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The Commissioncouldrecommend her case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which could order Peru to overturn herconviction - heronly other option for release. (18)"], "subsections": []}]}}
