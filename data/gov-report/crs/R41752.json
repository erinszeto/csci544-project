Congressional authorization of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), expires on September 30, 2011. The pending reauthorization has increased congressional awareness of the link between the condition of locally operated levees, FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and levee accreditation (which determine which NFIP requirements and premiums apply in an area), and programs providing federal disaster assistance for these levees. Congress is considering whether and how to change current programs, federal funding, and the existing division of levee responsibilities. Options are complicated by the desire to promote state, local, and individual decisions and investments that reduce flood risk; concerns about the local costs associated with NFIP purchase and levee accreditation requirements; and consideration of whether to expand federal responsibilities and potential liability. Even though similar issues also exist for some of the federally operated levees, this report focuses on locally operated levees since these dominate the national levee portfolio.", "Approximately 22% of U.S. counties across the country, representing almost half of the U.S. population, contain levees. Economic damage from floods in leveed areas ranges between $5 billion and $10 billion annually. Levees play an important role in protecting property against flood damage. More than 100,000 miles of levees may exist, with the federal government operating roughly 2,100 miles. One estimate puts the five-year level of investment needed for new construction or maintenance of the nation's levees at $50 billion.", "FEMA is updating FIRMs and deciding whether to accredit levees which will determine whether they appear on those maps. There is some debate regarding the extent to which FEMA should assist with levees investment through its hazard mitigation programs. FEMA often cites overlap with activities of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture as justification for not funding levee activities.", "The Corps is the main federal partner for construction of locally operated levees. Pursuant to congressional authorizations, the Corps participates in cost-shared planning and construction of levees. No general federal authorities exist for the Corps to assist with the regular operation and maintenance of locally operated levees; that is, local levee owners are responsible for operation, maintenance, and improvement. However, there are multiple authorities enacted by Congress for flood fighting, flood mitigation, and levee repair of damages caused by natural events. Since 2005, the Corps has had limited involvement in the data collected and certified to inform FEMA accreditation of locally operated levees. The Corps has limited authority to assist local levee owners in obtaining NFIP levee accreditation. Policymakers in recent years have considered whether to expand the Corps' role in NFIP data certification and post-construction improvements for locally operated levees. NRCS has limited authority to assist in the construction of smaller levees and to repair small, mostly rural levees damaged by a natural event.", "Congressional options for assisting with levees include, but are not limited to, maintaining the status quo, adopting the recommendations of the National Committee on Levee Safety (such as federal support to develop new state levee safety programs), modifying federal programs, or creating new federal programs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congressional awareness of issues associated with locally owned and operated levees is increasing, largely because of the nationwide remapping of floodplains by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and efforts to reauthorize the FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) which expires on September 30, 2011. Floodplain remapping can result in owners of mortgaged structures located in areas protected by levees being required to purchase flood insurance if the levees cannot satisfy FEMA's levee accreditation requirements. Many communities and levee owners struggle with the expense and effort of data collection, repairs, and improvements needed to obtain levee accreditation and have approached Congress for assistance. Multiple federal agencies have roles in levee accreditation and federal levee assistance. Most notably, FEMA coordinates updates to Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and issues levee accreditations that waive the mandatory purchase requirement for homeowners who reside in areas protected by levees. In certain limited situations discussed later in this report, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) may certify the data submitted to FEMA for accreditation purposes. However, existing federal actions to assist locally operated levees are limited, particularly in the scope of eligible activities. Limitations stem from constraints on federal funding and from levee operation, maintenance, and improvements generally being the responsibility of the levee owner. ", "Levees are structures, either earthen embankments or concrete and steel floodwalls, built along rivers, or other bodies of water, to prevent water from flooding bordering land. Levees are located throughout the country and are found in approximately 22% of U.S. counties, where almost half of the U.S. population resides. Nationally, average economic damage from floods in leveed areas ranges between $5 billion and $10 billion annually. The full extent and specific conditions of the nation's levees are unknown, but the National Committee on Levee Safety, which was created by Congress, estimates that more than 100,000 miles of levees may exist. The federal government through the Corps built less than 15,000 miles of these levees. The Corps operates roughly 2,100 miles of the 15,000 it constructed. That is, local levee owners operate and maintain the estimated 85,000 miles of locally constructed levees and almost 13,000 miles of Corps constructed levees. One estimate puts the five-year level of investment for new construction or maintenance needed for the nation's existing levees at $50 billion.", "Congress has considered in recent years whether and how to change the current division of levee responsibilities and their costs, and whether to modify existing levee-related federal programs. Some stakeholders seek to expand flood hazard mitigation activities eligible for federal funds to include levees, while others are concerned that the federal government might assume more of the costs and liability for levee investments that they consider a local responsibility. Another aspect of the debate is whether to change FEMA's risk assessment, remapping, and timelines for obtaining levee accreditation. These changes are raised in the context of climate change and a broader rethinking of flood risk management and control structures (like levees) following Hurricane Katrina and recent floods.", "This report covers the federal role in locally operated levees. It does not address federally owned and operated levees, which are less common and are concentrated in a few areas of the United States (e.g., along the Mississippi River).", "The report first discusses the role of levees in flood risk reduction, the shared responsibilities for levees in the United States, and the role of three agencies: FEMA, the Corps, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Local governments generally are responsible for land use and zoning decisions that shape floodplain and coastal development, but the federal and state governments also influence decisions on managing flood risk. State and local governments make decisions that allow or prohibit development in flood-prone areas. Local, private, and sometimes state entities construct, operate, and maintain most levees and have initial flood-fighting responsibilities. Agencies of the federal government operate flood control dams, offer crop insurance, support hazard mitigation, and provide emergency response and disaster aid for recovery from floods. The federal government constructs some of the nation's levees, but most often does in partnership with local project sponsors who are responsible for operation and maintenance.", "No federal program specifically regulates the design, placement, construction, or maintenance of nonfederal levees. While federal and state agencies often have their own policies and criteria for levee design, construction, and maintenance, there are no national engineering standards or policies for levee design or level-of-protection standards for different floodplain uses. ", "Many levees protecting today's communities and agricultural investments originally were constructed more than 50 years ago by local interests reclaiming land for agriculture and other uses. Rather than each landowner building separate levees, landowners often consolidated their resources by forming a levee district. As a consequence of this history, many of today's physical constructions and configurations, as well as institutional arrangements for flood protection, have roots distinct from their current use as flood protection for development. For the most part, municipalities serving concentrated urban populations have assumed flood control responsibilities, while special levee districts remain active in rural and agricultural areas. ", "Prior to the Lower Mississippi River Flood of 1927, the federal role in flood control was limited. In addition to authorizing the Corps to design and construct significant flood control projects along the Mississippi River (and on the Sacramento River (CA)), the Flood Control Act of 1928 reiterated the sense of Congress, at the insistence of President Coolidge, that there should be local contribution toward flood control works. The act also provided that the federal government generally could not be held liable for flood damage. From 1928 to 1936, there was considerable debate about the need for national planning for flood control and a national water resources program, and the proper roles of Congress and the Executive Branch in this planning and selection of construction projects. The Flood Control Act of 1936 (49 Stat. 1570) declared some flood control a \"proper\" federal activity:", "It is hereby recognized that destructive floods upon the rivers of the United States, upsetting orderly processes and causing loss of life and property, including the erosion of lands and impairing and obstructing navigation, highways, railroads, and other channels of commerce between the States, constitute a menace to national welfare; that it is the sense of Congress that flood control on navigational waters or their tributaries is a proper activity of the Federal Government in cooperation with States, their political sub-divisions and localities thereof; that investigations and improvements of rivers and other waterways, including watersheds thereof, for flood-control purposes are in the interest of the general welfare; that the Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries including watersheds thereof, for flood-control purposes if the benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs, and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected.", "Since 1936, Congress has authorized the Corps to construct hundreds of miles of levees. ", "Today the federal role in flood risk management goes beyond assisting with the construction of dams and levees. For instance, some federal actions attempt to modify individual and community behavior to reduce flood vulnerability; the NFIP and FEMA's hazard mitigation programs are examples. Congress established the NFIP with the 1968 passage of the National Flood Insurance Act. Prior to the program's establishment the federal government relied on a \"levee-only\" policy that permitted unrestricted development of the floodplains along with an emphasis on structural flood control systems. Making federally subsidized flood insurance available to property owners signaled a shift in federal policy towards a flood control strategy that was less dependent on structural measures. The new policy had the intended consequence of regulating the development of flood-prone areas. The NFIP's multi-pronged regulatory system consists of flood risk assessment and mapping, flood insurance, and land use and building construction measures that restricted development in vulnerable areas. The NFIP allows for residential construction in known floodplains, with the proviso that construction must follow building code regulations that include flood-proofing requirements. FEMA's hazard mitigation programs fund mitigation activities such as elevating properties, acquiring properties and converting them to open space, retrofitting buildings, and implementing limited flood control systems.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Emergency Management Agency", "paragraphs": ["FEMA is responsible for flood risk assessment and mapping, flood insurance, and federal hazard mitigation. Much of the congressional attention concerning locally operated levees derives from concerns about insurance expenses under the NFIP. FEMA uses FIRMs to delineate flood risk zones and the applicable insurance premiums to be charged for properties covered by federally backed mortgages. FEMA is updating the nation's inventory of FIRMs and requiring verification, through accreditation, that all levees currently depicted on FIRMs meet design, operation, and maintenance standards for protection against the 1%-annual-chance flood. FEMA activities have generated a number of questions. Some communities and stakeholders have raised questions about the development and accuracy of the updated FIRMs. Some levee owners have questioned the costs and documentation requirements associated with levee accreditation. Questions concerning liability in the event of a levee failure have been raised, most notably by representatives of engineering firms. ", "FEMA also operates various flood hazard mitigation grant programs that assist in removing repetitively flooded structures from floodplains, and conducts other activities to reduce flood impacts. Policy discussions surrounding these programs have questioned to what extent levee work should be eligible for FEMA mitigation funds. While some communities and levee owners want levee work to be funded by these programs, FEMA argues that funding levee projects would duplicate other federal programs and that appropriate provisions have not been made to address levee liability. ", "Under FEMA regulations, hazard mitigation funds cannot replace project or program funding available under other federal authorities, unless there exists an extraordinary threat to lives, public health or safety, or improved property. This provides FEMA officials with discretion to determine whether other federal programs are more appropriate to fund levee projects. Because certain levee activities receive funding from the Corps or NRCS, FEMA has determined that these agencies have the primary authority for the repair of flood control works such as levees. As a result, FEMA hazard mitigation assistance grants have not been used for levee projects for at least the last decade. While FEMA officials cite program duplication as justification for denying levee projects mitigation funding, it can be argued that FEMA has not consistently applied the same standard regarding duplication of authorities. That is, FEMA officials have allowed Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funds to be used for disaster housing projects that were eligible for funding under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In fact, in some instances CDBG funds were used to augment HMGP-funded projects.

The Corps can repair damage caused by a natural event at a levee that participates in the Corps' Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP, also known as the P.L. 84-99 program). The Corps currently has no general authority, responsibility, or funding to assist local levee owners in assembling their NFIP levee accreditation packages, unless the levee is part of an ongoing Corps study or project.

For public entities, this concern stems in part from the uncertainty related to the implications of Paterno v. State of California, which held the State of California liable for a levee it did not build, but operated as part of a state-sponsored levee system . Anecdotal evidence suggests that some engineering firms have declined to perform levee work because of liability concerns; however, other anecdotal information suggests that levee owners generally have found a firm or some other means to perform the needed work (e.g., city engineers signing NFIP levee data certifications). The additional cost to levee owners from efforts of private engineering firms to cover their potential liability for the levee services is unknown. ", "To some extent, federal agency liability for federally funded levee projects has been addressed through congressional action. One source of the federal government's immunity is the exception under the Federal Tort Claims Act for actions that constitute a discretionary function. A second source of immunity for the federal government is the Flood Control Act of 1928, which prevents the government from being sued for damages resulting from federally supported damage reduction projects or from floodwaters.

FEMA officials point out that the NFIP has realized significant savings both to itself and to property owners by reducing the cost of disaster relief. The basic requirement of the flood management program (and access to federal flood insurance) is that communities adopt and enforce minimum land use and building code regulations to prevent new development from increasing the flood risk and to protect new and existing buildings. Property owners obtaining loans from federally regulated lending institutions, or receiving federal assistance for acquisition or construction in special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in communities that participate in the NFIP, are required to purchase flood insurance for their outstanding mortgage balance, up to a maximum of $250,000 in coverage for single-family homes.

Flood maps have many uses, including local land-use planning, emergency preparedness and response, and natural resource management.

The levee data certification package is used by FEMA as the basis of its determination for whether or not to accredit a levee. ", "In 2005, FEMA increased the information requirements needed to accredit a levee. FEMA now requires more data on the structural integrity of the levee and the hydrology and hydraulics to which the levee is exposed than in the past. As a result, local owners of some levees that previously were accredited by FEMA are having trouble obtaining and paying for reaccreditation. In many cases, they face a lack of readily available data on their levees' construction, materials, and structural integrity and confront assessments that indicate a lower level of protection than previously thought. ", "To complete the levee data certification, a professional engineer must sign a statement that the levee is designed in accordance with sound engineering practices to provide protection from the 1%-annual-chance event. Defining what constitutes sound engineering practices is complicated by the absence of a national levee model design for engineers to turn to as the professional standard for levee design parameters. Some engineering firms and their insurers have been concerned about liability if a firm certifies levee data and the levee later fails. Proposals for addressing this concern include providing immunity for the firms and clarifying that the professional engineer is certifying that the data comply with FEMA's requirements, rather than attesting to the levee's safety. Whether a federal agency certifying levee data would be immune from similar liability concerns is unclear and may be an issue if Congress considers increased Corps participation in data certification.", "Prior to the 2005 increased information requirements, FEMA accepted the Corps' inspection of levees that participated in the Corps' Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) as sufficient for the data certification for levee accreditation. Since 2005, Corps RIP inspections are insufficient to meet the current FEMA data certification requirements. The purpose of RIP inspections is to assess compliance with the requirements of RIP \u2500 that the levee owner is performing the maintenance required for RIP participation. The RIP inspections do not evaluate a levee's level of protection and structural integrity as required by FEMA for levee accreditation. In August 2010, the Corps released new guidance on how the agency will conduct the NFIP levee data certifications (which it calls levee system evaluations) that it has the authority to perform (see box \"Limited Corps Role in Levee Data Certification\"). The Corps process complies with the FEMA NFIP requirements under 44 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a065.10(b), but uses a different approach. The Corps approach is more focused on an evaluation of flood risk with the levee in place, while the 44 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a065.10(b) requirements are more focused on the level of protection provided by the levee.

Regulations establish eligible levee projects under the PA program. Eligible PA projects may include:", "emergency and permanent repairs to restore the levee to its pre-disaster condition; removal of debris in a flood control work; placement and removal of flood-fighting measures if such activity is necessary to eliminate a public health and safety threat; and dewatering of areas behind the levee if there is a threat to public safety or structures.", "Ineligible levee activities under the PA program include:", "repair of levees that are in the Corps' Rehabilitation and Inspection Program or have a pending RIP application deemed eligible; repair of eligible levees under NRCS programs; dewatering of areas behind levees for the purpose of drying land; repair of secondary levees riverward of a primary levee, unless protecting human life; and increasing the height of a levee.", "Generally, PA program funds are limited to restoring a structure to its pre-disaster condition; projects to construct new levees or enhance existing levees are not eligible. In some instances, locally operated levee projects are deemed ineligible because of potential funding from other federal sources. In order to prevent duplication of programs, FEMA utilizes a decision tree for PA levee project requests, as shown in Figure 1 .", "Discretion to determine levee project eligibility for PA lies\u00a0with\u00a0the FEMA Administrator. Disagreement occasionally arises between FEMA officials and state officials, especially regarding the need to restore a levee to its pre-disaster condition. The Stafford Act states that federal disaster assistance, administered by FEMA, is available to restore a structure to its pre-disaster condition. It can be argued that, in some cases, the most cost-effective use of federal funds would be to enhance the level of flood protection of a levee that is already undergoing repair after a disaster, rather than just restoring it to the pre-disaster level of protection.

For damage to be repaired, the repair must have a favorable benefit-cost ratio. Rehabilitation assistance is limited to repair or restoration of the project to its pre-disaster level of protection; no betterments or levee setbacks are allowed. Local sponsors are required to assume any rehabilitation cost of damage to an active project that is attributable to deficient maintenance. For larger floods or natural disasters resulting in the need for significant RIP-funded repairs, Congress has often used supplemental appropriations to fund eligible repairs. For smaller RIP repairs, the Corps often attempts to fund repairs within its existing funding; at times, some eligible repairs have been delayed due to limitations on the availability of funds. ", "A common issue that arises under RIP (as well as for FEMA mitigation programs discussed later) is interest in not only repairing levees but also improving them. Congress expressly restricted RIP funds to repair. The program is not designed to evaluate the federal interest in investments to further reduce the flood risk at a location.

Emergency repairs to projects designed and constructed by either the Corps or NRCS may only be made by the respective agency (i.e., NRCS cannot repair a structure built by the Corps or vice versa). For nonfederal structures, however, the division of responsibility is based on a 1986 memorandum of agreement between the Corps and NRCS. Under the agreement, the Corps is responsible for repair of flood damage to projects installed for the purpose of controlling floodwaters in watersheds larger than 400 square miles. NRCS, on the other hand, is responsible for flood damage to projects built for the purpose of flood prevention in small watersheds (400 or fewer square miles).

Levee repair, maintenance, and enhancement projects could possibly be considered mitigation activities and might potentially be considered eligible under the HMGP. While statutory language does not expressly prohibit funding for certain types of levees, such projects have historically not been funded under hazard mitigation assistance except when there is an immediate risk to public safety. It may be argued that failure to fund levees to enable them to maintain FEMA accreditation does create an \"immediate risk to public safety.\" Under this view, FEMA acknowledges the public safety risk when it designates a levee for de-accreditation due to a lack of compliance with levee standards. ", "One possible explanation for denial of levee projects relates to the risk of duplication of programs discussed earlier in this report. Another reason may be the low prioritization of levee projects under HMGP as effective flood mitigation measures. According to the Association of State Floodplain Managers, levees should be used as a mitigation activity of last resort, because they provide limited flood protection. Since communities can undertake several other flood mitigation measures, competition for flood mitigation funding may preclude funding of levee projects. Other mitigation projects that would likely receive higher prioritization than levee projects include elevation of properties, retrofitting existing structures, and stormwater management. One of the most effective flood mitigation activities is to buy out homes and businesses in a floodplain and convert the land to open space.
