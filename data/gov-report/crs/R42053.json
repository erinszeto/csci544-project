{"id": "R42053", "title": "Fiscal Impacts of the Foreign-Born Population", "released_date": "2011-10-19T00:00:00", "summary": ["This report reviews estimates of fiscal impacts to the federal, state, and local governments of the foreign born who reside in the United States. It examines the academic and policy literature on fiscal impacts of two populations: all U.S. foreign born and unauthorized aliens. Computing such fiscal impacts involves numerous methodological and conceptual challenges, and resulting estimates vary considerably according to the assumptions used, including those about the time frame considered, the treatment of U.S.-born children, the unit of analysis used, and which costs and revenues are included.", "For the total foreign-born population, the findings of a 1996 analysis commissioned by the National Research Council entitled The New Americans remain authoritative and relevant. The report estimated that each new immigrant at that time, with his or her descendents, would generate an average net fiscal surplus. The authors illustrated how their estimate varied according to foreign-born residents' age composition and educational attainment. Varied assumptions about education generated substantially different impacts. For instance, immigrants with above-average education generated a considerably larger than average net fiscal surplus; those with below-average education levels generated a net fiscal deficit. Reducing the time frame of the analysis to fewer generations changes the average net fiscal surplus into an average net fiscal deficit.", "This study and others confirm that the foreign born, like the native born, impose their largest costs on U.S. taxpayers as children, through their consumption of public education, and as the elderly, through their consumption of government-funded public health programs. Yet, the majority of the foreign born come to the United States as young adults, where they pay taxes and contribute to programs like Social Security for most of their working lives. Relatively young ages at arrival for most foreign born help explain why many fiscal impact studies found that foreign-born residents generated net fiscal surpluses over the long term.", "Findings from all of the studies reviewed in this report indicate different impacts at the state and federal levels. Many federal programs, such as Social Security and Medicaid, are oriented toward assisting the elderly, while many state and local level jurisdictions are responsible for services consumed by younger persons, such as public education and criminal justice administration. Foreign-born residents' relatively young age distribution thus accentuates the degree to which states and localities incur greater fiscal costs from the foreign born than the federal government.", "Fiscal impact studies of unauthorized aliens reach less consensus than those of the total foreign-born population. Three national estimates evaluated in a 1995 General Accounting Office (GAO) report varied considerably and left the agency unable to definitively quantify such fiscal impacts. Subsequent state-level studies emphasized fiscal impacts of costly public services: public education, health care, and law enforcement. Many estimated tax and other fiscal contributions.", "Studies estimating fiscal impacts for unauthorized aliens are more likely to yield estimated net fiscal deficits than those estimating fiscal impacts for all foreign born, because unauthorized aliens, on average, tend to be younger and less educated. Consequently, they are more likely to use public education for their children and contribute relatively less in tax revenues compared to all foreign born. Given their unauthorized status, they are also less likely themselves to receive public benefits, although their U.S.-born children may be more likely to qualify for such benefits. However, deriving more specific conclusions or estimates from studies of unauthorized aliens reviewed in this report remains elusive due to variation in study design and methodology."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["This report reviews estimates of fiscal impacts to the federal, state, and local governments of the foreign born who reside in the United States.

The analysis of tax-funded expenditures and tax revenues together is referred to as the net fiscal impact.", "Congress has had a long-standing interest in the fiscal impacts of the foreign born. Congressional interest has emphasized two public policy issues: immigration policy, particularly what categories of foreign nationals and what number should be granted admission into the country; and to a lesser extent, budget concerns over the cost of public services used by the foreign born. For instance, concerns about consumption of public services by unauthorized aliens and other foreign-born persons caused Congress to pass the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA, P.L. 104-193 ), which statutorily barred many legal permanent residents and other noncitizens from many federal assistance programs.

However, it does not address the following topics: economic impacts of the foreign born, such as their effect on industrial competitiveness, economic development, or the employment prospects, wages, and working conditions of U.S. workers; demographic impacts of the foreign born, such as their effect on the size and composition of the U.S. population; socio-cultural impacts of the foreign born, such as their effects on language use and civic participation; and environmental impacts of the foreign born, such as their effects on pollution generation, public goods consumption, and traffic congestion. Nor does it address, for the unauthorized alien population, costs to the federal government of enforcing immigration laws, such as investigating, arresting, detaining, and removing unauthorized aliens from the United States. ", "The report examines the academic and policy literature on fiscal impacts of two populations: the entire foreign-born population and the unauthorized alien population. While many studies have been conducted to estimate fiscal impacts of just the unauthorized alien population, few have estimated fiscal impacts of just the legally residing foreign-born population. For example, The New Americans , an authoritative report discussed extensively below, considers all foreign born without analyzing populations separately according to legal status. Consequently, the first portion of this report evaluates studies of all foreign born, irrespective of legal status. The second portion evaluates studies of only the unauthorized alien population.", "This report is not an exhaustive review of the literature. Reviewed studies were generally selected if they included attempts to quantify the cost of public services and benefits received by the foreign born and/or tax revenues contributed, and they explained their methodologies for computing estimates. Hence, studies that applied excessively simple, incomplete, or undisclosed methodologies were generally not included. This report also excluded studies that intended to show only a favorable or unfavorable portrait of the foreign born, unless their methodological sophistication warranted their inclusion. The span of methodologies used in the analyses presented in this report ranges from basic arithmetic computations to sophisticated microeconomic and macroeconomic models. Moreover, the report distinguishes between cross-sectional studies that consider the fiscal impacts of the foreign born at a particular year, versus longitudinal studies that attempt to capture fiscal impacts of the foreign born across longer periods or several generations.", "With the exception of studies discussed in a 1995 General Accounting Office (GAO) report that assess fiscal impacts of the unauthorized alien population, studies reviewed herein were completed after 1996. Studies within each section are generally reviewed in chronological order, with the earliest studies evaluated first. The Appendix summarizes findings for all studies reviewed. Because of differences in research scope, methods, specific populations analyzed, and other factors, the report refrains from synthesizing these results beyond what is presented in its conclusion section.", "The report begins by discussing challenges of enumerating the foreign born, including the unauthorized alien population, and estimating fiscal impacts of the foreign born. Next, it reviews four sets of studies. The first, included in a National Research Council (NRC) report entitled The New Americans , represents an evaluation of short- and long-term fiscal impacts of the entire foreign-born population that served as a touchstone for subsequent research assessing the impact of U.S. immigration. The second part of this report reviews scholastic research on fiscal impacts of the total foreign-born population published after the NRC report. These scholastic analyses, published mostly in peer-reviewed academic journals, generally encompass greater analytic rigor than policy studies. The third part of this report reviews policy studies of fiscal impacts of the total foreign-born population conducted at the national and state levels that were undertaken by policy organizations. The fourth part considers the unauthorized alien population by first discussing a seminal policy debate between 1993 and 1995 assessing fiscal impacts of unauthorized aliens, and continuing with a review of policy studies conducted mostly at the state level on fiscal impacts of unauthorized aliens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges for Estimating Fiscal Impacts", "paragraphs": ["Analysts have long attempted to estimate the fiscal impacts of immigrants to the United States.

Studies can be evaluated on the extent to which they incorporate or address such elements.

The foreign born can be distinguished in large-scale data sets such as the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Decennial Census of the Population (Census), or the American Community Survey (ACS). However, while these data sets distinguish between foreign born who are naturalized citizens and those who are noncitizens, they do not distinguish between noncitizens with legal status and noncitizens who are unauthorized aliens. They also do not distinguish between refugee or asylee status, or between legal temporary noncitizens, such as temporary workers, and legal permanent residents.", "The studies reviewed in the first half of this report estimate fiscal impacts of all foreign-born persons. To evaluate fiscal impacts for only the legally residing foreign born, analysts must isolate that population from the unauthorized alien population. This can be done in several ways, including making assumptions about the legal proportion of the total foreign-born population, subtracting estimates of the unauthorized population from the total foreign-born population, or applying methodologies that assign legal or unauthorized status to a dataset's cases based on individual case characteristics and then analyzing only cases with legal status in that dataset. These methodological challenges may have contributed to the paucity of fiscal impact studies of legal immigration. Consequently, analyses of the foreign-born population's fiscal impacts sometimes yield ambiguous policy implications because they combine effects of legally residing foreign born and unauthorized aliens, two groups with distinct educational profiles and employment trajectories. ", "Legal status also affects fiscal impacts according to federal law. For instance, whether foreign-born persons must pay taxes depends both on their legal status and if tax treaties or agreements exist between their countries and the United States. However, a foreign-born person's legal status may limit his or her eligibility to receive public services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accurately Enumerating the Unauthorized Alien Population", "paragraphs": ["Studies that estimate fiscal impacts of the unauthorized alien population are hampered by difficulties associated with accurately enumerating that population.

Much literature cites estimates of the unauthorized population produced annually by Jeffrey Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center. Most recently, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that approximately 11.2 million unauthorized (illegal) aliens resided in the United States in March 2010. Published estimates by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) yielded results consistent with but not equivalent to Passel's. OIS estimated that 10.8 million unauthorized aliens resided in the United States as of January 2010. Part of the difference stems from the use of different datasets: OIS uses ACS data to produce its estimates while the Pew Hispanic Center relies on CPS data. Such discrepancies suggest that attempts to quantify the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens are hindered by disagreement over how many reside in the United States, among other factors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Which Costs and Revenues Should be Estimated?", "paragraphs": ["Producing comprehensive and realistic estimates of fiscal impacts of the foreign born requires the analyst to select which costs and revenues should be included. Most state-level analyses reviewed in this report highlighted the largest budget expenditures that varied with the size of the foreign-born population, such as public education costs, criminal justice administration costs, and the cost of public health care programs. Some studies attempted to estimate less expensive services such as sanitation and police and fire protection. Some included the cost of federal income transfers, such as the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps), Medicaid, and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. Others included public infrastructure and service costs, such as those for highways, parks, and libraries, which pose particular challenges to quantifying costs from additional use by the foreign born. Finally, some studies estimated costs for pure public goods that require little or no additional spending for new foreign-born persons residing in the United States, such as national defense, medical and technical research, or interest on the national debt. ", "For revenues, most state-level studies estimated state and local income taxes based on recorded survey data or from estimates based on recorded or estimated annual incomes. Other frequently estimated tax revenues included property, sales, and excise taxes. While some studies limited their analyses of fiscal impacts entirely to state and local costs and revenues, others expanded their scope to include federal revenues such as federal taxes, FICA, and Medicare withholdings. Including estimated federal tax contributions in an analysis but not estimated federal public services costs (or vice versa) distorts estimates of the net fiscal impacts of the foreign born.

Fiscal impacts are often measured as the difference between estimates of annual tax and other revenues from noncitizens (or noncitizen headed-households) and estimated costs of government services and benefits to these persons or households. However, because fiscal impacts of foreign-born persons accumulate over their lifetimes, this methodology represents a static, cross-sectional perspective that obscures their more substantial costs as young consumers of public education or elderly consumers of public health care services, as well as their contributions as working-age taxpayers. Estimates from such annual studies thereby implicitly assume a demographic \"steady state\" condition whereby the age and skill composition of the foreign born remains unchanged over time. Such circumstances hardly ever occur: over even short periods of time, foreign-born populations change in size, age composition, and educational composition, all of which affect public service consumption and tax revenue contributions.", "Many policy studies reviewed in this report applied a cross-sectional approach. However, several academic studies employed longitudinal approaches that attempted to overcome this shortcoming.

Nonetheless, households can pose methodological complications if they contain citizens and noncitizens. Such \"mixed status\" families and households not only constitute a sizeable portion of all foreign-born households, but they also complicate fiscal impact analyses because of variation in federal program eligibility. As an example of how this issue was treated, The New Americans , reviewed below, included revenues and expenditures for all children of noncitizens, including U.S. citizen children, but only for those who lived in the household. As such, this analysis overstated estimated costs to U.S. taxpayers of noncitizen households because most U.S. citizen children were in the household during the relatively costly school-age period but not when they were of tax-contributing working ages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Should U.S.-Born Children be Treated?", "paragraphs": ["Another analytic issue centers on children of the foreign born.

As such, they do not reflect changes imposed by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 that statutorily barred LPRs and other noncitizens from many federal assistance programs. It is expected that, all else being equal, a similar analysis using data after 1996 would yield larger estimated surpluses and smaller deficits to some unknown degree because of greater restrictions placed on the foreign born to accessing public services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Short-Term Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The New Americans distinguished between short-term (annual) and long-term impacts of the foreign born. The conclusions of the report's annual impact analysis relied on studies of California and New Jersey, states with sizable foreign-born populations. The annual impact analysis estimated revenues and costs associated with foreign-born households and co-resident U.S.-born children, in contrast to the long-term impact analysis, which considered all children of foreign-born parents regardless of where they resided. The authors cautioned that excluding U.S.-born children not residing in such households in the short-term analysis most likely overstated the fiscal burden of the foreign born because while it included children's considerable costs at younger ages when they were most likely to live with their parents, it excluded their tax contributions as adults when children were most likely to live separately.", "Results for the New Jersey and California studies were expressed as estimated benefits or costs to native-headed households. At the state level , the estimated impact of a foreign-born-headed household amounted to a net cost to each native-headed household of $232 and $1,178 in 1996 dollars for New Jersey and California, respectively, or $322 and $1,637 in 2010 dollars, respectively. At the federal level , the estimated impact amounted to a much smaller net benefit of about $3 in 1996 dollars for each of the two states. Yet, because of these two states' sizable foreign-born populations, California and New Jersey more accurately represent such fiscal impacts primarily for residents living in similarly populated states than they do for other states in the country. When the authors broadened their analysis and estimated the impact of all U.S. foreign-born-headed households on all U.S. native-headed households, the resulting net impact at the state level was a lower cost, ranging from $166 to $226 to each native-headed household in 1996 dollars for each foreign-born-headed household, or $231 to $314 in 2010 dollars. At the federal level, when the study was expanded to the entire nation, foreign-born-headed households were expected to produce a larger net fiscal benefit than the $3 figure estimated for just New Jersey and California, although the authors did not estimate this amount.", "According to the authors, three factors explain why foreign-born households consume more in public services than they contribute in tax revenues. First, foreign-born households have greater numbers of children and consume more public education services. Second, on average, foreign-born households are poorer and consequently receive more income transfers and benefits. Third, because the foreign-born earn lower average incomes and own less property, they contribute less income and property taxes. ", "Annual estimates, however, should not be extrapolated to determine long-term fiscal impacts for several reasons. First, timing distorts the ultimate fiscal impact of foreign-born households. For example, young foreign-born persons consume costly public education services but subsequently contribute considerable tax revenues over the course of their working lives. Older foreign-born persons arriving to the United States later in their working lives may contribute withholdings immediately to support Social Security and Medicare but not for a sufficient period to balance the cost of their subsequent use of those services upon retirement. Short-term analyses cannot factor in other predictable changes that affect public service consumption or tax contributions, including changes in tax rates as incomes increase, changing public service eligibility with age, and the degree to which current demographic and fiscal conditions in the United States may alter the provision of future public services or receipt of tax revenues. Finally, the foreign born arriving in the United States during different decades have encountered different economic, demographic, labor market, and regulatory circumstances that have significantly affected their fiscal impacts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Impacts", "paragraphs": ["To estimate long-term fiscal impacts of the foreign born, the authors of The New Americans extended their methodology for computing annual estimates by making assumptions regarding several factors, including future taxes and public service expenditures; characteristics of the new foreign born; foreign born and native differences in characteristics ranging from fertility to lifetime earnings trajectories; and discount rates used to translate future revenues and costs into current dollars. Altering these assumptions generated different estimates, which were discussed at\u00a0length. ", "The analysis yielded several overall conclusions regarding the fiscal impact of the foreign born. On the cost side, the authors found little difference between the estimated cost of public services used by foreign-born and native residents over the long term. Although some foreign born and native differences in estimated per-capita costs varied substantially across the separate government programs examined, combined per-capita costs for major government programs yielded little difference. Similarly, while the study found that the foreign born incurred higher estimated social program costs than native residents at younger ages, it also found that they incurred lower costs in old age, a difference which tended to balance out over lifetimes. On the revenue side, the study found considerable differences between foreign-born and native residents' tax contributions, stemming largely from differences in future earnings. ", "The analysis estimated the net fiscal impact of the presence of a new foreign-born individual in the United States by subtracting the cost of his or her estimated social benefit consumption from estimated tax contributions, at every age, over three centuries to account for all descendents. The resulting estimated net fiscal impact for someone arriving in 1994 is an $80,000 net surplus. This baseline figure varies substantially by personal characteristics and model assumptions. ", " Figure 1 graphs the net present value of this total fiscal impact, which is represented by the total area between the graph lines and the horizontal axis. For instance, the estimated federal impact from 1994 though 2050 is a surplus because the thin solid line falls above the axis, while the state impact for that period is a deficit because the broken line falls below the axis. The $80,000 estimate ($111,000 in 2010 dollars) represents the sum of the total federal and state estimates for each year, summed across all 300 years. It illustrates how one foreign-born individual, arriving in 1994, produces varied state and federal impacts over time. Like native residents, the foreign born are costly to society at young and old ages, but are net revenue generators during working ages. As a result, according to the study, a foreign-born individual's long-term fiscal impact depended largely on age at arrival in the United States. Most foreign born between ages 10 and 25 produced a net fiscal surplus, while those arriving at retirement age produced a net fiscal deficit. Because most foreign born arrive as young adults, estimates produced by this type of analysis typically yield net fiscal surpluses. Finally, Figure 1 shows that the estimated fiscal impact differs markedly at the federal and state levels, with the federal government reaping surpluses over the life of the individual and his/her descendents, and state and local governments incurring deficits.", "Impact estimates were especially sensitive to assumptions about educational attainment ( Table 1 ). Foreign-born persons with less than a high school diploma generated an estimated net deficit of $18,000 (in 2010 dollars) over their lifetimes, while those with more than a high school education produced an estimated net surplus of $275,000. Education differences altered the range of estimates for foreign-born persons by themselves, from -$124,000 for less than a high school education to +$146,000 for more than a high school education, a difference of $270,000. By contrast, the range of estimates for descendents of the foreign born, from $106,000 to $129,000, produced a difference of only $23,000. Education also altered fiscal impact differences within the same education categories. Foreign-born persons with less than a high school education generated an estimated fiscal deficit of $124,000, while their descendents generated a surplus of $106,000, a gap of $230,000. For foreign born with more than a high school education, that same gap amounted to -$17,000.", "The estimated fiscal impact of $111,000 (in 2010 dollars) that the authors produced was based upon assumptions using average characteristics of the foreign born at the time of the analysis. The authors extended their analysis to suggest what altering those assumptions implied for U.S. immigration policy ( Table 2 ). For instance, if the United States were to admit foreign-born persons whose educational profile matched that of U.S. native residents, the average estimated fiscal impact would increase from +$111,000 to +$168,000. On the other hand, if the foreign born admitted possessed the same older age profile as U.S. native residents\u2014thereby reducing the span over which they paid taxes\u2014their estimated average fiscal impact would decrease from $111,000 to $44,000. Age-adjusted \"sensitivity analyses\" conducted by the authors indicated that on average, the foreign born paid less taxes and received fewer benefits than native residents.", "Geographically, the authors found that the foreign born generated net federal fiscal surpluses throughout the country, in contrast to net state and local fiscal deficits concentrated among states with large foreign-born populations. As a result, this study suggested that native residents in those states incurred net fiscal costs while residents in all other states reaped net fiscal benefits. Since The New Americans was published in 1997, considerable foreign-born population growth has occurred in new urban and rural destinations outside of traditional immigrant-receiving states. Yet, even in 2008, roughly two-thirds of the foreign born remained concentrated in just six U.S. states.

Borjas acknowledged the superior conceptual approach and more complete accounting from analyzing fiscal costs and contributions of the foreign born over their lifetimes. However, he questioned, for several reasons, the finding that admitting a foreign-born person to the United States in 1994 yielded an estimated $111,000 (in 2010 dollars) net fiscal national surplus over the long run of 300 years (see Figure 1 and discussion above). ", "Borjas first questioned the assumption that the federal government, facing fiscal imbalances, would pass substantial tax increases to reduce national debt growth in 2016. This assumption, the author contended, automatically incorporated into the analysis a favorable result for the foreign born who, by shouldering their portion of an assumed tax increase, would make themselves more fiscally valuable. According to his own calculations, removing this assumption changed the estimated $111,000 net fiscal surplus to a $21,000 net fiscal deficit (in 2010 dollars).

According to the author's computations, adopting a 50-year time frame from the time a new foreign-born person arrived in the United States reduced the estimated net surplus from $111,000 to just over $15,000. A 25-year time frame yielded an estimated $26,000 deficit.", "Borjas concluded that variations in estimated fiscal impacts found in the research literature stemmed mostly from assumptions about the appropriate time frame, with short-run and long-run estimates each containing inherent flaws. Short-run estimates from The New Americans (noted above) suggested that foreign-born households cost each native household between $166 and $226 in additional taxes each year ($231 and $314 in 2010 dollars). Moreover, according to the author's computations, the long-term estimated fiscal impact in that same study, when computed for a 50-year work-span and annualized, generated an annual fiscal surplus of just $450 ($625 in 2010 dollars)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Academic Studies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Current Fiscal Impact of Immigrants and Their Descendents: Beyond the Immigrant Household (1998)", "paragraphs": ["The authors of this analysis estimated the fiscal impacts of the foreign born at the national level using a cross-sectional approach not found in many contemporary analyses.

The data, taken from the 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys, represented 40.4 million persons, including 22.8 million foreign-born individuals alive in 1994, their 13.8 million surviving U.S.-born children, and their 3.9 million grandchildren (born to U.S.-born children).

Translating that into per-capita numbers yielded a net fiscal deficit of $680 per foreign-born individual and concurrent descendent versus a $200 surplus per native-born individual and concurrent descendent. According to the study, the difference stemmed from two sources: the foreign-born population's greater costs for public education, bilingual education, noninstitutional Medicaid, and other public health services; and their lower per capita tax payments. At the federal level, however, the foreign born and their concurrent descendents paid an estimated $153.4 billion in taxes and consumed $102.5 billion in public services, for an estimated net fiscal surplus of $50.9 billion.

In the first formulation of this conceptual experiment, the foreign born by themselves represent a mostly working-age population with no children and yielded estimated fiscal surpluses at all levels. In the second formulation, foreign-born households include co-residing U.S.-born (citizen) children, who, being mostly school-aged, caused the estimated net fiscal impact to change from a $32.4 billion surplus to a $13.3 billion deficit. According to the authors, state and local costs for public education accounted for most of the difference in estimates between the first and second formulations. The study's third formulation, of the foreign born and all of their children, regardless of where the latter resided, yielded a net fiscal surplus of $29.5 billion, reflecting the tax contributions of the adult children of the foreign born. Finally, the study's fourth formulation, which included the foreign born, their children, and their grandchildren, reduced the estimated net fiscal surplus from $29.5 billion to $23.5 billion while increasing the estimated deficit on states and localities from $19.3 billion to $27.4 billion.", "According to the study, impacts differed for the six high immigration states, which possessed roughly three-fourths of all foreign-born persons and their concurrent descendents, and all other U.S. states.

This finding suggested that immigration has two opposing impacts; it can assist in reducing current fiscal imbalances as well as generate costs for future taxpayers.

Methodological hurdles limit the degree to which analysts can produce viable results comparable across time periods, geographies, and populations. Obstacles include datasets that have limited information on legal status, differences in the costs and revenues analysts chose to analyze, and the treatment of U.S.-born children. While a number of state-level policy studies reviewed in this report began with Pew Hispanic Center estimates of the unauthorized alien population, they diverged in what public service costs and revenue streams were analyzed. In some cases, the lack of data influenced what was quantified. Nevertheless, several recurring themes appeared throughout many of the studies considered in this report.", "Studies of both the total foreign-born population and the unauthorized alien population suggest that foreign-born residents' age composition substantially affects their net fiscal impact. The foreign born, like the native born, impose their largest costs on U.S. taxpayers as children through their consumption of public education, and as the elderly through their consumption of public health services from programs like Medicare and their receipt of Social Security retirement benefits. Yet, the majority of the foreign born who come to the United States as young adults and reside permanently pay taxes and contribute to programs like Social Security for most of their working lives. The relatively young ages at arrival for most foreign born help explain why many fiscal impact studies reviewed by the authors of The New Americans, for example, found that foreign-born residents over the long term generated net fiscal surpluses.", "Educational attainment of the foreign-born population also remains a critical determinant of net fiscal impacts. Findings from the seminal study, The New Americans , which received empirical support from several subsequent academic studies reviewed in this report, bear reiteration. The study estimated that foreign-born residents with less than a high school education created a long-term deficit of $18,000, while those with more than a high school education generated a long-term surplus of $275,000. These figures illustrate the degree to which one sophisticated estimation procedure yields substantially different fiscal impacts by varying one key characteristic: education.", "Fiscal impacts differ at the state and federal levels. Differences varied according to which contributions and public services were considered, what time frame was used, and the taxing scheme of the state in which the study was undertaken. Hypothetically, a legal permanent resident could contribute more federal taxes than the cost of Social Security, Medicare, and other federal public services he and his family consume in a given year, yielding a net fiscal surplus at the federal level. However, if his children attended public schools, whose costs are borne by local residents through state and local income and property taxes, he and his family could generate a net fiscal deficit at the state level during the same year. ", "Foreign-born residents' relatively young age distribution accentuates the degree to which states and localities incur greater fiscal costs from the foreign born than the federal government. Federal programs such as Social Security and Medicare are oriented toward assisting the elderly, while state and local level jurisdictions are often responsible for services consumed by younger persons, such as public education and criminal justice administration.", "Studies of the fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens reach less consensus than those of the total foreign-born population. Three national estimates of the net fiscal impact of unauthorized aliens evaluated in a 1995 GAO report varied considerably and left the agency unable to definitively quantify such impacts. Subsequent state-level studies emphasized fiscal impacts from the most costly public services: public education, health care, and law enforcement. Many also estimated tax and other fiscal contributions. Studies estimating fiscal impacts for unauthorized aliens were more likely to yield estimated net fiscal deficits than those that estimated fiscal impacts for all foreign born. On average, unauthorized aliens tend to be younger and less educated, thereby earning lower wages and salaries than all foreign-born workers. As a consequence, they are more likely to use public education for their children and contribute relatively less in tax revenues compared to all foreign born. However, deriving more specific conclusions or estimates from studies of unauthorized aliens reviewed in this report remains elusive due to differences in study methodology and variation in costs across states where these analyses were conducted.", "Policy analyses reviewed in this report illustrate two key findings. First, both the noncitizen foreign born and many unauthorized aliens can generate significant fiscal expenditures. Moreover, the relative pervasiveness of document fraud among unauthorized aliens working in the formal economy suggests that some portion of those nominally ineligible for public services can still obtain them.
