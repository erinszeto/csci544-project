The Member salaries were in parity with those of district judges from 1955 to 1969 and have been again since 1987. During the period 1969 to 1987, Member pay was often in parity with the pay of federal appellate judges. There is no constitutional or statutory requirement (other than the provision of law establishing the commission procedure discussed below) that the salaries of federal executive branch officials and federal Justices and judges be limited by the salaries of Members of Congress, or that Member pay be limited by the salaries of these federal executive and judicial officials."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ethics Reform Act", "paragraphs": ["The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 includes two provisions under which pay rates for Members, the Vice President, federal officials paid under the EX, and certain federal Justices and judges can be set. The first of these provisions provides for a quadrennial review of the salaries of federal officials by a Citizens' Commission on Public Service and Compensation. The commission is to make recommendations to the President. The law requires the commission and the President to submit recommendations to Congress providing that the salaries of the", "Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Vice President of the United States, and the Chief Justice of the United States shall be equal; Majority and Minority Leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate, the President pro tempore of the Senate, and Level I of the Executive Schedule (Cabinet officers) shall be equal; and Senators, Members of the House of Representatives, the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, Delegates to the House, Judges of the U.S. District Courts, Judges of the United States Court of International Trade, and Level II (Deputy secretaries of departments, secretaries of military departments, and heads of major agencies) of the Executive Schedule shall be equal.", "Although the law establishes the salary parity stated above upon quadrennial review, it is unclear what effect, if any, the provision has, since the commission has never been activated. The commission was initially funded in the 1993 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, but that appropriation was rescinded in the 1994 act.", "A second provision in the Ethics Reform Act establishes an annual salary adjustment procedure for the Members, the Vice President, federal officials paid under the EX, and federal Justices and judges. The adjustment is based on the percentage change in the wages and salaries (not seasonally adjusted) for the private industry workers element of the Employment Cost Index (ECI), minus 0.5% (December indicator). It becomes effective at the same time as, and at a rate no greater than, the annual base pay rate adjustment for federal white-collar civilian employees under the General Schedule (GS). The adjustment cannot, however, be less than zero or greater than 5%.", "While this provision of the Ethics Reform Act sets the rate of the judicial pay adjustment, a 1981 law provides that any salary increase for Justices and judges must be \"specifically authorized by Act of Congress hereafter enacted.\" The Member pay raise becomes effective automatically unless Congress statutorily denies an increase or revises the adjustment, or the annual base pay adjustment for GS employees is established at a rate less than the scheduled increase for Members, in which case Members would be paid the lower rate. The pay adjustment for federal officials paid under the EX also takes effect automatically unless Congress takes similar action. Such congressional action has generally occurred during consideration of the appropriations bill that funds the Department of the Treasury and General Government. Most recently, this occurred in the 105 th Congress (1999) when Members voted to deny themselves and federal executive and judicial officials a pay adjustment. Similar action occurred in 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997.", "There have been instances in which pay parity could have been, but was not, broken. In the 103 rd Congress, for example, the Representatives and Senators passed legislation to forgo their pay adjustment for 1994. Because base pay for the GS was not increased in 1994, the Members and federal executive and judicial officials did not receive a pay raise in January 1994. If GS base pay had been adjusted and these officials had received a pay adjustment in that year, pay parity would have been severed because of the action of the Members to deny themselves a pay increase. A provision to cut FY2000 spending across the board by 0.97% and to include Member pay in that reduction, if enacted in the 106 th Congress, would have resulted in lower salaries for Members, but not for federal executive and judicial officials. During the first session of the 109 th Congress, the Senate agreed to a provision that would have denied Members of Congress a pay adjustment in January 2006. On October 18, 2005, during consideration of H.R. 3058 , Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development, the Judiciary, the District of Columbia, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for FY2006, the Senate agreed, on a 92 to 6 vote (No. 256), to an amendment ( S.Amdt. 2062 ) offered by Senator Jon Kyl to forgo the Member pay adjustment. The House version of the bill did not include this provision and it was not included in the enacted legislation.

For example, the 2000 annual report on the federal judiciary recommended a 9.6% adjustment in judicial salaries, disengagement from the Member salary adjustment, and automatic pay adjustments under the Ethics Reform Act. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist stated that \"because Judges are appointed for life and expected to remain on the bench, increases in judicial compensation should not be tied to increases for non-career public servants.\" In a 2003 report, the National Commission on the Public Service, citing \"the compelling need to recruit and retain the best people possible\" to serve as executive branch officials and on the federal judiciary, also recommended separate salary adjustments. As an interim step toward implementation of its recommendations, the commission stated that \"Congress should grant an immediate and significant increase in judicial, executive, and legislative salaries to ensure a reasonable relationship with other professional opportunities,\" and \"Its first priority in doing so should be an immediate and substantial increase in judicial salaries.\"", "Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., reiterated the commission's recommendations in the 2005 annual report on the federal judiciary. His 2006 annual report focused solely on the issue of judicial pay. Discussing the effects of inadequate salaries (increased by \"only occasional and modest cost-of-living adjustments\") on the federal judiciary, the Chief Justice stated these concerns:", "An important change is taking place in where judges come from\u2014particularly trial judges. In the Eisenhower Administration, roughly 65% came from the practicing bar, with 35% from the private sector. Today the numbers are about reversed\u2014roughly 60% from the private sector, less than 40% from private practice. It changes the nature of the federal judiciary when judges are no longer drawn primarily from among the best lawyers in the practicing bar.", "Inadequate compensation directly threatens the viability of life tenure, and if tenure in office is made uncertain, the strength and independence judges need to uphold the rule of law\u2014even when it is unpopular to do so\u2014will be seriously eroded.", "The dramatic erosion of judicial compensation will inevitably result in a decline in the quality of persons willing to accept a lifetime appointment as a federal judge. Our judiciary will not properly serve its constitutional role if it is restricted to (1) persons so wealthy that they can afford to be indifferent to the level of judicial compensation, or (2) people for whom the judicial salary represents a pay increase.... a judiciary drawn more and more from only those categories would not be the sort of judiciary on which we have historically depended to protect the rule of law in this country.
