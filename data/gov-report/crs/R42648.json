In cases in which the Clause applies, the immunity is absolute and cannot be defeated by an allegation of an improper purpose or motivation. When applicable, the Clause provides both immunity from liability (in civil and criminal proceedings) and a complimentary evidentiary privilege.", "Recently, two separate and previously unresolved issues arose with respect to the scope and application of the Speech or Debate Clause. The first case concerned claims of employment discrimination brought against Members' offices pursuant to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Both the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and the D.C. Circuit ruled that the Speech or Debate Clause does not automatically prevent such suits from proceeding. Additionally, an appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected because the Court ruled that it lacked a jurisdictional basis to decide the case. These decisions, however, appear to leave unanswered significant questions about the use and introduction of evidence related to \"legislative acts,\" which are protected by the Speech or Debate Clause. Such questions could ultimately frustrate the ability of potential plaintiffs to pursue their claims successfully.", "In August 2007, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) issued its opinion in a case arising from the execution of a search warrant on the Rayburn House Office of Representative William J. Jefferson. The search was conducted as part of the FBI's investigation of Representative Jefferson to determine whether he was involved in criminal activity, including bribery and other felonies. Such an action by the executive branch appears to be unprecedented. It raised significant constitutional questions about potential intimidation of the legislative branch and threats to its independence, which the Clause is designed to protect. Although Representative Jefferson lost his initial legal challenge, the appeals court subsequently held that the search violated the Speech or Debate Clause. The court ordered the district court to provide Representative Jefferson with copies of the seized materials and a chance to assert his privilege claims ex parte and in camera. Moreover, the appeals court ordered that the Department of Justice (DOJ) continue to refrain from reviewing any of the seized materials until the privilege claims were evaluated by the lower court.", "In 2011, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals also weighed in on how to apply the Clause to executive branch criminal investigations of Members. In that case, Representative Richard Renzi was accused of agreeing to support legislation in exchange for a private land purchase agreement benefitting one of his creditors. He was indicted on numerous criminal counts, including extortion and fraud, which he challenged on Speech or Debate Clause grounds. The appeals court determined that his challenged actions were not covered by the Clause. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit appeared to split with the D.C. Circuit analysis in Representative Jefferson's case on whether the Clause prevents the executive branch from ever viewing protected evidence.", "This report examines the constitutional background of the Speech or Debate Clause and these recent developments in jurisprudence.

In explaining the purposes of the Speech or Debate Clause, the Supreme Court traced the ancestry of the Clause to the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which was \"the culmination of a long struggle for parliamentary supremacy\":", "Behind these simple phrases lies a history of conflict between the Commons and the Tudor and Stuart monarchs during which successive monarchs utilized the criminal and civil law to suppress and intimidate critical legislators.

United States and United States v. Brewster , two decisions issued on the same day in 1972, the Court adopted a more limited view of the Clause's protection. Not all actions taken by a Member in the course of his congressional duties are covered by the Speech or Debate Clause. As the Court explained,", "The heart of the Clause is speech or debate in either House. Insofar as the Clause is construed to reach other matters, they must be an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which members participate in committee and House proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either House."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Acts", "paragraphs": ["Since the Gravel and Brewster rulings, the Clause has only protected a \"legislative act,\" which is \"an act generally done in Congress in relation to the business before it.\" The Clause does not protect \"political\" activities, which include such activities as constituent services and issuing press releases, even if done as part of the Member's congressional duties. The Brewster Court explained that \"[a]lthough these are entirely legitimate activities, they are political in nature rather than legislative\" and, therefore, are not afforded Speech or Debate Clause protection. ", "This distinction between legislative acts and other legitimate, but non-legislative, acts can be seen in Hutchinson v. Proxmire . In Proxmire, a Senator argued that the Speech or Debate Clause immunized him from liability for allegedly defamatory statements he made about a federal employee in his efforts to publicize wasteful government spending. The newsletters, press releases, and television interviews he gave to draw attention to the issue of government spending were not essential to the deliberation of the Senate and, therefore, received no Speech or Debate Clause protection.

A Member can still be prosecuted for criminal offenses such as bribery, since for example, accepting a bribe in exchange for voting a certain way is not \"an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes\" by which Members participate in legislative activities. However, the Clause's testimonial privilege will still prevent the introduction of evidence of true legislative acts or the motivation for such acts during such a prosecution. As the Gravel court summarized, \"While the ... clause recognizes speech, voting, and other legislative acts as exempt from liability that might otherwise attach, it does not privilege either Senator or aide to violate an otherwise valid criminal law in preparing for or implementing legislative acts.\"", "The distinction between covered legislative acts and unprotected criminal acts is demonstrated in Gravel and Brewster . In Gravel , the Court held that the Speech of Debate Clause prevented a grand jury from inquiring into the conduct or motives of a Senator or his aides at a subcommittee meeting in which the Senator placed classified government documents, the Pentagon Papers, in the public record. However, the Court also held that the Clause did not prohibit the grand jury from probing how the Senator had obtained the Pentagon Papers or considering allegations that the Senator arranged for private publications of the classified materials. The Court explained the distinction by stating, \"While the ... clause recognizes speech, voting and other legislative acts as exempt from liability that might otherwise attach, it does not privilege either Senator or aide to violate an otherwise valid criminal law in preparing for or implementing legislative acts.\" ", "Similarly, in Brewster , the Court determined that the Speech or Debate Clause did not provide immunity from prosecution for bribery, where a Member allegedly accepted payment in exchange for a promise to vote a specific way. The Court explained that the Clause has never been viewed \"as protecting all conduct relating to the legislative process.\" Because bribery was \"not, by any conceivable interpretation, an act performed as part of or even incidental to the role of a legislator,\" it received no Speech or Debate Clause protection.

", "Furthermore, the Clause affords both an institutional and an individual privilege. It is uncertain whether, at least in limited circumstances, the institution might be able to waive the privilege of individual Members.

In 1995, with little debate focused on the immunity issue, the House and Senate passed the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA), which applies several civil rights, labor, and workplace safety and health laws to Congress. Section 413 of the CAA, however, declares that the authorization to bring judicial proceedings under various provisions of the law does not constitute a waiver of the Speech or Debate privilege of any Member. ", "Prior to the passage of the CAA, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit) had held that the Speech or Debate Clause provided Members with immunity from personnel actions brought by at least some congressional employees. In Browning v. Clerk , U.S. House of Representatives , it was alleged that the termination of the first African American Official Reporter employed by the House was the result of racial animus. The court, in dismissing the claims, held that the Speech or Debate Clause protected Members from liability based on personnel actions they took if the impacted \"employee's duties were directly related to the due functioning of the legislative process.\" ", "However, two years later, the Supreme Court raised doubts as to whether Speech or Debate Clause immunity extended to employment actions. In Forrester v. White , a case alleging sex discrimination, the Court held that a state court judge did not have judicial immunity for the firing of a probation officer. It concluded that the immunity did not extend to \"administrative, legislative, or executive functions,\" regardless of how important the functions may be to the \"very functioning of the court.\" In other words, according to the Court, the employment decision in Forrester was administrative, not judicial; therefore, there was no entitlement to judicial immunity. Subsequently, in Gross v. Winter , the D.C. Circuit, applying Forrester , held that common-law legislative immunity did not immunize a D.C. Council Member from suit based on employment-related decisions. However, the court in Gross declined to overturn the reasoning in Browning , preferring instead to distinguish the case on the grounds that it dealt with a common law privilege and not the Speech or Debate Clause.", "In light of the passage of the CAA and these previous cases, both the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals and the D.C.

The Senator's office moved to dismiss the claims, arguing that the Speech or Debate Clause immunized the office from the claims because the \"[p]laintiff's duties of meeting with constituents, gathering information for the Senator, discussing constituent suggestions and then conveying them to the Senator, constitute actions that directly relate to the due functioning of the legislative process.\" The district court found that the plaintiff's duties included \"gathering and conveying to Senator Campbell himself, and to the Defendant, information critical to the Senator's legislative agenda.\" As a result, the court dismissed the suit, holding that because the plaintiff's duties were directly related to the due functioning of the legislative process, the Speech or Debate Clause immunity applied.", "The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, however, reversed the lower court's decision, distinguishing between \"legislative\" acts that are entitled to Speech or Debate immunity and non-legislative acts, which are not. Senator Campbell argued that the plaintiff's job function constituted a legislative act because the information received from constituents could affect his drafting and support of legislation and his votes. The court disagreed, classifying such functions as \"informal information gathering\" that is distinct from the type of information gathering performed by legislative committees, which is covered by the Speech or Debate Clause. Extending the Clause's protection to other forms of information gathering by individual Members would exceed the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Clause's scope. Therefore, the Clause's protection did not apply because the allegedly discriminatory actions by the Senator were not legislative acts. Additionally, the Clause's testimonial privilege would not hamper this civil action because the \"[p]laintiff's discrimination claim does not require proof of any legislative act by Senator Campbell or his staff.\" ", "The court did note that even if the Senator's actions were protected, the Senator's office could still be liable for personnel decisions because an office's actions fall outside the scope of the Clause's immunity. Moreover, the court specifically refused to adopt the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in Browning v. Clerk , noting that, in its opinion, Browning extended further than the Supreme Court's cases involving the Speech or Debate Clause.

Clerk of U.S House of Representatives should remain the law of the circuit. With 8 of the 10 members of the D.C.

The court also unanimously held that the Browning framework was no longer consistent with Supreme Court precedent and should be abandoned.

On the one hand, Judge Randolph's plurality opinion focused on the interaction between the judicially created, burden-shifting framework used in employment discrimination cases and the Clause's potential protections. Under the framework, a plaintiff proves a prima facie case of discrimination, then the employer rebuts by producing evidence that the conduct was nondiscriminatory, and, finally, the plaintiff tries to demonstrate that the employer's explanation is pretextual. If the employer's nondiscriminatory reason for taking the adverse employment action is motivated by a legislative act, the Speech or Debate Clause protection may prevent a plaintiff from being able to challenge the Member's assertion, since Members remain protected from \"inquiry into legislative acts or the motivation for actual performance of legislative acts.\" ", "Judge Randolph attempts to provide some guidelines for invoking the Clause's protection and emphasizes that the Clause's application must be determined on a case-by-case basis.", "On the other hand, Judge Janice Rodgers Brown, writing for three members of the court, noted that the CAA creates a \"legal fiction\" by holding the Member's \"employing office\" liable for employment discrimination claims, not the Member or his aides individually. She concluded that the \"employing office,\" as an \"organizational division within Congress,\" is not entitled to Speech or Debate Clause protection. Judge Brown did recognize that the Clause's evidentiary privilege would protect the Member from disclosure or discussion of his legislative acts if he was personally implicated. ", "Judge Brown appears to suggest a narrower reading of the Speech or Debate Clause than offered by Judge Randolph's plurality opinion. According to Judge Brown's opinion, as long as a Member or potentially protected aide is not directly providing evidence or giving testimony, the Speech or Debate Clause is not implicated; therefore, plaintiffs can potentially pursue more claims under this interpretation. However, if the suit requires such evidence or testimony, even Judge Brown's interpretation would require a district court to address assertions of Speech or Debate immunity on a case-by-case basis.", "Senator Dayton's office filed a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, along with a statement of jurisdiction asserting that the CAA afforded his office an appeal by right to the Court. The Court set oral arguments for April 24, 2007, to address whether the office was entitled to a direct appeal to the Supreme Court and whether the case was now moot because Senator Dayton's term of office had expired. The Court issued its decision on May 21, 2007, unanimously holding that it lacked jurisdiction to reach the merits of the case. Senator Dayton based his request for review on Section 412 of the CAA, which states that \"[a]n appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court of the United States from any interlocutory or final judgment, decree, or order of a court upon the constitutionality of any provision of this chapter. \" According to the Court, this section cannot serve as the basis for jurisdiction because the D.C. Circuit's \"determination that jurisdiction attaches despite a claim of Speech or Debate Clause immunity is best read as a ruling on the scope of the Act, not its constitutionality.\" The Court also concluded that there was no basis for exercising its discretionary certiorari jurisdiction as the D.C. Circuit's decision did not conflict with any other circuit with respect to the application of the Speech or Debate Clause in suits challenging personnel actions taken by Members of Congress. Senator Dayton's office went back to the district court after its Speech or Debate Clause argument was rejected and the court denied its motion to dismiss arguing that the claim was moot.

The knowledge by a Member that the F.B.I. can make an unannounced raid on his legislative office to read and rummage through every document or email is bound to discourage Congress from the muscular check against the Executive that the Speech or Debate Clause was calculated to foster.", "Representative Jefferson raised these Speech or Debate Clause arguments when he sought to have the search declared unconstitutional and the seized materials returned to his possession. In addition to raising many of the arguments discussed above, Representative Jefferson argued, inter alia, that execution of the search warrant \"guaranteed that the executive would be in possession of material that relates to the Member's legislative duties.\" The motion asserted that those actions, coupled with the exclusion of Representative Jefferson's counsel and the House General Counsel from even viewing the search process, violated his Speech or Debate Clause privilege.", "The DOJ argued in its reply brief that because it was only interested in obtaining non-legislative materials, the use of a filter team provided sufficient protection of the privilege under the Speech or Debate Clause.

", "The appeals court affirmed the district court's orders, holding that Representative Renzi's interactions and negotiations with RCC and Aries were not legislative acts, and therefore, were not protected by the Clause. In coming to this conclusion, the appeals court emphasized that no court has ever \"indicated that 'everything that related to the office of a Member was shielded by the Clause.'\" Additionally, the court noted that the Supreme Court has distinguished between completed legislative acts, which are covered by the clause, and promises to perform future legislative acts, which are not covered. As the Brewster Court previously held, pre-legislative negotiations with private parties or constituents are not considered to be legislative acts because the Clause's text and history do not support such a broad reading of the privilege. Furthermore, Representative Renzi's specific acts, his negotiations with RCC and Aries, cannot fall under the Clause's protection because extortion, like the bribery claims at issue in Brewster , has no part in the legislative process and is not performed as a part of a Member's role as legislator.", "Next, the Court addressed Representative Renzi's argument that his indictment should be dismissed because the grand jury was presented evidence of protected legislative acts. While generally a court will not inquire into the evidence used to support a grand jury indictment if the indictment is valid on its face, the grand jury is not permitted to violate a valid privilege, like the Speech or Debate Clause privilege. Therefore, other circuits have gone \"behind the face of the indictment\" when a violation of the Clause is alleged at the grand jury stage. In this case, the appeals court adopted the Eleventh Circuit test, concluding that it should look behind the face of the indictment and only dismiss it if protected \"'evidence [presented to the grand jury] cause[d] the jury to indict.'\" The court noted that using this test protects the privilege without allowing Members to avoid prosecution for acts that are not protected by the Clause. The appeals court found that several documents discussed actual legislative acts and should not have been presented to the grand jury. However, the court refused to dismiss the indictment because the protected evidence did not cause the jury to indict. Rather, the indictment relied on evidence of Representative Renzi's interactions with RCC and Aries, negotiations that the court previously concluded were not legislative acts and therefore were not protected. ", "The appeals court then addressed Representative Renzi's request for a hearing to determine if the government's non-protected evidence was derived from protected evidence, which he argued could not be used in the proceeding. In addressing this request, the court had to evaluate whether the Speech or Debate Clause privilege is a privilege of non-disclosure, as Representative Renzi maintained, or non-use, meaning the Clause only prevents protected evidence from being introduced in a court proceeding. The court rejected Representative Renzi's argument that the Clause confers a non-disclosure privilege, emphasizing that the Supreme Court has never held that the Clause prevents the use of derivative evidence or \"precludes the Government from reviewing documentary evidence referencing 'legislative acts' even as part of an investigation into unprotected activity.\"", "This part of the decision puts the Ninth Circuit at odds with the D.C. Circuit decision in United States v. Rayburn House Office Building , discussed above, which concluded that the Clause prohibits any executive branch exposure to evidence of legislative acts. The appeals court described the holding in Rayburn as founded on reasoning unique to the D.C. Circuit that has not been adopted by the Supreme Court. The court rejected the D.C. Circuit's interpretation that the \"'distraction' of Members and their staffs from legislative tasks is a principal concern of the Clause\" and, thus, distraction alone can trigger the Clause's protection. Rather, the court stated that the risk of legislative distraction can only prompt the Clause's protection when the underlying investigation being conducted concerns a privileged legislative act. As the court explained, \"[w]hen the Clause bars the underlying action, any investigation and litigation serve only as wasted exercises that unnecessarily distract Members from their legislative tasks.\" In its view, this is the type of distraction that the Clause is intended to prevent. ", "However, when the underlying action is not covered by the Clause, such as the investigations of alleged extortion and fraud in this case and Rayburn , other legitimate interests, like the ability of the executive branch to prosecute non-protected activities, outweigh concerns about legislative distraction. The court relied upon the Supreme Court's holding in United States v. Helstoski , a 1979 case prosecuting a Member for bribery, as support for its disagreement with the decision in Rayburn . In Helstoski , the Court held that the government could introduce into evidence documents discussing legislative acts, which it had obtained through compelled disclosure from the defendant Member, as long as the documents were redacted to exclude any references to legislative acts. The appeals court stated that this outcome was irreconcilable with Representative Renzi's argument and the Rayburn holding. The Clause must be interpreted as providing a non-use privilege, not a non-disclosure privilege, \"because the Executive would be hard pressed to redact a document it was constitutionally precluded from obtaining or reviewing....\" ", "The court also criticized the Rayburn decision for ignoring the fact that \"the Speech or Debate Clause is a creature born of separation of powers concerns,\" and thus should apply equally to both the executive and the judiciary. It reasoned that if the Clause provided a non-disclosure privilege, then disclosures of privileged documents to the executive branch and the judiciary would constitute independent violations. Even though the Rayburn court adopted a non-disclosure interpretation and ruled that disclosures to the executive branch constituted violations of the Clause, it did not recognize that disclosures to the judiciary could also be violations. Instead, it put the judiciary in charge of viewing and evaluating all of the allegedly privileged evidence. The appeals court in Renzi used this internal inconsistency to reinforce its view that a non-disclosure interpretation of the clause was implausible and incorrect. ", "Representative Renzi filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court following the appeals court decision. His petition was denied in January 2012. The criminal prosecution is still pending in the district court. "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
