{"id": "RL31572", "title": "Appropriations Subcommittee Structure: History of Changes from 1920 to 2019", "released_date": "2019-02-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["This report details the evolution of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees' subcommittee structure from the 1920s to the present. In 1920, the House adopted a change in its rules to consolidate jurisdiction over all appropriations in the Appropriations Committee. After the enactment of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, the House reorganized its Appropriations Committee by establishing for the first time a set of subcommittees to consider appropriations bills based on the administrative organization of the executive branch. The Senate followed suit in 1922, and the two chambers have continued under that basic organizational approach since that time.", "It is possible to divide the evolution of the modern Appropriations subcommittee structure into four eras. The first era, stretching roughly from the initial reorganization in the 1920s until the end of the Second World War, was marked by stability. Most of the changes in Appropriations structure resulted from combining bills (e.g., the Treasury Department bill with the Post Office Department bill beginning in 1924), although one new bill (and subcommittee) was created when the appropriations bill for the Department of Labor was split off from the Departments of State, Justice, Commerce, and Labor bill in 1939.", "The second era, from the end of the Second World War through 1970, saw a number of significant changes. During this period, Congress attempted to keep pace with executive branch reorganizations (e.g., creation of subcommittees to consider appropriations for the new Departments of Defense in 1947 and Transportation in 1967) and changing national priorities (e.g., creation of a separate appropriations bill, and later subcommittee, for foreign operations).", "The third era, from 1971 through 2003, was marked by a renewed stability. While some appropriations subcommittees were renamed to reflect changes in agency and departmental status, these changes did not represent major shifts in jurisdiction.", "Following major changes in organization involving nearly every subcommittee in the 108th, 109th, and 110th Congresses, the two chambers have once again settled into an era of stable organization. In 2003, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees merged their subcommittees on Transportation and Treasury and created new subcommittees to consider appropriations for the newly created Department of Homeland Security. In 2005, both chambers undertook major reorganizations, eliminating three subcommittees in the House and one in the Senate. This reorganization, however, left the two chambers with differing subcommittee jurisdictions. In 2007 the two Appropriations Committees reorganized again to reestablish parallel subcommittees that have remained in place since.", "During the first session of the 110th Congress (2007), the House created the Select Intelligence Oversight Panel of the appropriations committee to oversee spending on federal intelligence activities. This panel was eliminated in 2011 at the beginning of the 112th Congress.", "This report will be updated to reflect any changes in Appropriations subcommittee structure."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Article I, Section 9, of the U.S. Constitution provides, \"No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\" The Constitution does not, however, prescribe any specific structure or process for making appropriations. The committee structure established by Congress during the 20 th century assigns a prominent role to the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate for both the development of appropriations legislation and oversight over budget execution. The Appropriations Committees, in turn, have created a system of subcommittees designed to facilitate their ability to carry out these tasks. ", "The number and jurisdictions of appropriations subcommittees have evolved to meet changing needs and circumstances. For example, reorganization was undertaken at the beginning of the 108 th Congress in response to the creation of a new Department of Homeland Security. After the legislation establishing the new department was enacted, the House Appropriations Committee established a new subcommittee. This modification of subcommittee structure affected eight of the existing subcommittees and was one of the most extensive reorganizations of the Appropriations Committees since the 1920s. Shortly thereafter, a similar change was made in the Senate Appropriations Committee.", "Reorganization can also be undertaken to adapt to changes in congressional priorities. For example, in the reorganization that occurred at the start of the 109 th Congress, both the House and the Senate undertook a major change in subcommittee structure. This resulted in the elimination of three appropriations subcommittees in the House and one in the Senate and ultimately affected the jurisdictions of 10 appropriations subcommittees in the House and 8 in the Senate. Another major reorganization at the beginning of the 110 th Congress again shifted subcommittee jurisdiction to reestablish parallel House and Senate subcommittees.", "This report details the evolution of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees' subcommittee structure from the 1920s to the present."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consolidation and Initial Stability: 1920-1946", "paragraphs": ["By the end of the First World War, the idea that the President should play a prominent role in a more centralized budgetary process gained prominence, ultimately resulting in passage of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. In anticipation of the more centralized executive budget system provided under the act, the House also changed its rules to require that all appropriations be considered by the Appropriations Committee. During the late 19 th century, congressional rules had assigned jurisdiction over certain general appropriations bills to committees other than the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. Notably, the appropriations bills for the District of Columbia, Indian affairs, Agriculture Department, Army, Navy, Post Office Department, and rivers and harbors (i.e., public works) were all considered by their respective legislative committees.", "A subsequent, additional change involved the organization of appropriations bills. Prior to the Budget and Accounting Act, appropriations bills (and subcommittees) tended to be organized along topical lines. For example, the military activities of the War Department were considered in appropriations bills reported by the Military Affairs Committee, and the activities of the Corps of Engineers were considered in River and Harbor appropriations bills reported by the Commerce Committee. The salaries and contingent expenses for the civilian administration of the department, however, were carried in the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial bill, which was within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. A similar division existed for most departments and was true even for agencies whose appropriations were wholly within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee. Funding for the activities of agencies as disparate as the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Mines was carried in the Sundry Civil bill, which was frequently the largest of the general appropriations bills. Nevertheless, their salaries and expenses were generally funded in the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial bill.", "Concurrent with the congressional consolidation of jurisdiction over appropriations, the newly established Bureau of the Budget recommended that appropriations bills be reorganized along administrative lines, where appropriations for salaries and expenses would be carried in the same bill as funding for programs and activities administered by a department. This arrangement had previously existed only for the Department of Agriculture appropriations bill. The House Appropriations Committee adopted the bureau's concept and reorganized the structure of general appropriations bills and its subcommittees so extensively that only the structure of the Agriculture bill remained essentially unchanged.", "After its reorganization, the House Appropriations Committee comprised the following subcommittees:", "1. Agriculture Department; 2. Commerce and Labor Departments; 3. Deficiencies; 4. District of Columbia; 5. Independent Offices (including the Executive Office of the President); 6. Interior Department; 7. Legislative Establishment; 8. Navy Department and the Navy; 9. Post Office Department; 10. State and Justice Departments (including the judiciary); 11. Treasury Department; and 12. War Department and the Army (both military and civil functions).", "By long-standing custom, the House originates all general appropriations bills. As a consequence, historically, the House has generally determined the initial content of the bills. By originating appropriations bills corresponding to its new administratively based organizational structure, the House created a jurisdictional problem for the Senate, which retained a system based on topical organization of appropriations bills, as well as multiple committees sharing jurisdiction over general appropriations bills. Confronted with the difficulty of considering the reorganized appropriations bills with its now outmoded system, the Senate reorganized its appropriations jurisdiction and subcommittees in 1922.", "Information available on congressional subcommittees, including those of the Appropriations Committees, is generally sparse and unsystematic prior to enactment of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. From available hearings and other committee documents, however, it appears that during this era the Appropriations Committees continued the practice of each subcommittee (other than the Deficiencies Subcommittee) being responsible for drafting one of the regular appropriations bills. Using data on appropriations bills to identify subcommittee structure during this period, one may conclude that the subcommittee structure of the Appropriations Committees was relatively stable. Other than name changes, the salient changes in appropriations bill structure (and, presumably, subcommittee structure) between 1922 and 1946 seem to have been limited to the following:", "The combination of the bills for the Treasury and Post Office Departments beginning in the second session of the 68 th Congress (1924); The combination of the Commerce and Labor Departments bill with the State and Justice Departments bill beginning in the second session of the 68 th Congress (1924); The separation of the War Department and Army bill into two bills, one for the Military Establishment and the other for War Department Civil Functions, beginning in the first session of the 75 th Congress (1937); The separation of the Labor Department (and the Federal Security Agency) from the Departments of State, Justice, Commerce, and Labor bill beginning in the first session of the 76 th Congress (1939); and The inclusion of the Judiciary in the Legislative Branch bill during the 78 th Congress (1943-1944)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reorganization and Multiple Changes: 1947-1970", "paragraphs": ["One of the chief aims of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 was to bring about a modernization of Congress's committee system, including its subcommittees. As a result, unlike the earlier period, information on subcommittee structure since 1946 is more readily available. In the 80 th Congress (1947-1948), the Appropriations Committees in both chambers had these 12 subcommittees:", "1. Agriculture; 2. Deficiencies; 3. District of Columbia; 4. Government Corporations; 5. Independent Offices; 6. Interior Department; 7. Legislative; 8. State, Justice, and Commerce Departments and the Judiciary; 9. Treasury Department and Post Office; 10. Labor Department and Federal Security Agency; 11. War Department; and 12. Navy Department.", "The idea of modernizing congressional committee structure and operations embodied in the Legislative Reorganization Act was paralleled by an interest in developing a more modern federal administrative apparatus to supplant the one that had grown in episodic bursts to meet the challenges of the Depression and World War II. Because appropriations bills continued to be organized along administrative lines, these changes in the executive branch had an impact on appropriations subcommittee structure. The four changes in party control of the House between 1947 and 1955 also contributed to an environment conducive to revision of appropriations subcommittee jurisdiction. This evolution saw the number of subcommittees fluctuate between a low of 10 and a high of 15.
