Alternatively, Congress could direct DHS to oversee security enhancement at potentially dangerous facilities. Or, Congress might enact legislation to reduce risks, either by \"hardening\" defenses against terrorists (for example by increasing security patrols) or by requiring industries to consider use of safer chemicals, procedures, or processes. Restricting terrorists' access to information might be a least-cost approach to reducing risks, but it would also limit public access to information about potential risks and reduce accountability of facility owners. For more on this topic, see CRS Report RL33043, Legislative Approaches to Chemical Facility Security , by [author name scrubbed].", "The 109 th Congress enacted chemical security legislation as Section 550 of the DHS appropriations legislation, P.L. 109-295 .

The enacted provisions also are found in H.R. 6348 . These provisions combine certain elements of H.R. 5695 , as reported by the House Homeland Security Committee, and S. 2145 , as reported by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. For example, the enacted law directs DHS to establish risk-based security performance standards for facilities, and requires facility owners or operators to prepare vulnerability assessments and facility security plans.

The sudden, accidental release in December 1984 of methyl isocyanate in an industrial incident at the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, and the attendant loss of thousands of lives and widespread injuries spurred legislative proposals to reduce the risk of chemical accidents in the United States. For example, federal environmental laws were enacted in 1986 and 1990 to mitigate and reduce the risk of accidental releases of hazardous chemicals from manufacturing facilities, processing plants, and storage tanks. (These laws are discussed below.) The Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975 was passed to protect the public and environment in the event of an accident during transportation of chemicals. Other federal laws coordinate preparedness planning and response to significant chemical spills (e.g., the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act).", "The threat of terrorism manifested on September 11, 2001, prompted renewed congressional attention to the potential risks to public health and the environment posed by facilities handling large quantities of hazardous chemicals.

The vast majority of the ... victims of the attack were civilians. In addition, the attack represented the first known case of suicide attacks carried out by international terrorists in the United States. The September 11 attack also marked the first successful act of international terrorism in the United States since the vehicle bombing of the World Trade Center in February 1993.", "Other potentially important trends identified by intelligence agencies include:", "an increase in activity by loosely affiliated extremists, both domestically and internationally; and the propensity of such groups to focus on producing mass casualties.

Loosely affiliated terrorist groups, in particular, have demonstrated a growing interest in chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, but explosives are still the most frequently employed weapons.", "During the 1990s, both international and domestic terrorists attempted to use explosives to release chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities. Most of these attempts were abroad in war zones such as Croatia, including attacks on a plant producing fertilizer, carbon black, and light fraction petroleum products; other plants producing pesticides; and a pharmaceutical factory using ammonia, chlorine, and other hazardous chemicals. All of these facilities were close to population centers. In the United States, there were at least two instances during the late 1990s when criminals attempted to cause releases of chemicals from facilities. One involved a large propane storage facility, and the other a gas refinery.", "Evidence that U.S. chemical facilities may be used by terrorists to gain access to chemicals also exists. For example, one of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers, Nidal Ayyad, became a naturalized U.S. citizen, graduated from Rutgers University, and worked as a chemical engineer at Allied Signal, from which he used company stationery to order chemical ingredients to make the bomb. According to a U.S. Prosecutor in the case against the bombers, though \"some suppliers balked when the order came from outside official channels, when the delivery address was a storage park, or when [a co-conspirator] tried to pay for the chemicals in cash,\" others did not. Moreover, testimony at the trial of the bombers indicated that they had successfully stolen cyanide from a chemical facility and were training to introduce it into the ventilation systems of office buildings.

The most accurate, and therefore the most useful, risk assessments generally are for familiar, frequently occurring hazards and events with impacts that are experienced with some regularity, such as severe storms or floods. In contrast, the risk of terrorist activity is unfamiliar (at least in the United States), rarely experienced, and likely to vary significantly over time, depending on rather unpredictable social and political phenomena.", "The risk of terrorism targeting chemical facilities is particularly difficult to assess for at least three reasons:", "There are few prior examples of terrorists targeting chemical facilities; Numerous factors theoretically may increase or decrease risks; and Interactions among factors influencing risks are dynamic and changing.", "In part, these difficulties stem from the nature of terrorism and the terrorists' deliberate efforts to do what is least expected\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, to defy prediction. For these reasons, most experts have not tried to quantify risks; existing analyses of chemical terrorism risks in the open literature are speculative and qualitative.", "Until the mid to late 1990s, reports focused on the acquisition and use of chemical weapons, such as sarin or mustard gas. One of the most comprehensive of these reports was a 1995 review of the open literature on terrorism that was prepared for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. According to this review of the literature, \"[t]hose authors who have speculated about the future terrorist use of chemical agents in particular have generally rated its likelihood as quite high.\"", "According to some, the risk also appears to be increasing. Many experts today believe that factors that might have inhibited proliferation and use of chemicals as weapons in the past are eroding. For example, some experts hypothesized several years ago that the combination of chemical and strategic skills necessary to create and deploy chemical weapons would prevent the lone terrorist from using them. Security experts now believe that lack of personal expertise no longer limits chemical weapon use, because there is a tendency for terrorists with similar extreme views to affiliate loosely with others with complementary skills and abilities. Moreover, the rising level of education worldwide means that more people have the requisite training in chemical engineering, and the Internet has simplified communications, training, and cooperation within geographically dispersed terrorist groups.", "Others have argued that chemical attacks would be unlikely, due to the difficulties of producing and effectively delivering chemical agents in sufficient amounts to produce mass casualties. However, while this may be true with regard to military use on a large scale, where weapons are delivered by advanced systems, it is not necessarily relevant to terrorists who may have more limited ambitions. A 1999 report by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO, now the Government Accountability Office) summarized the situation\u00e2\u0080\u0094", "... many conflicting statements have been made in public testimony before Congress ... concerning the ease or difficulty with which terrorists could effectively disseminate a chemical or biological agent on U.S. soil and cause mass casualties.", "GAO studied the threat and concluded that the ease or difficulty for terrorists to cause more than 1,000 casualties depends on the chemical or biological agent selected. The report stated\u00e2\u0080\u0094", "Experts from the scientific, intelligence, and law enforcement communities told us that terrorists do not need sophisticated knowledge or dissemination methods to use toxic industrial chemicals such as chlorine. In contrast, terrorists would need a relatively high degree of sophistication to successfully cause mass casualties with some other chemical and most biological agents.", "On the other hand,", "\"[t]errorists with less sophistication could make a chemical or biological weapon and disseminate agents, but these would be less likely to cause mass casualties.\"", "Other factors that might have inhibited chemical use by some terrorists in the past might not apply to loosely affiliated terrorist groups. For example, some experts argue that terrorists supported by nation-states have been reluctant to use chemical weapons for fear of offending other nations and neutral parties, particularly if the sponsors were signatories of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Another possible deterrent to chemical use, fear of retaliation, probably is of little concern to attackers with no identifiable homeland or headquarters. Lack of a homeland might also lessen concern about environmental damage that may be associated with chemical production. Finally, one must presume that occupational safety would be of limited concern to terrorists who are not accountable to a government, and who are willing to sacrifice their own lives for a religious, political, or social cause.", "However, many experts believe that the relative risk of terrorism involving chemical weapons remains small. This point was stressed by John V. Parachini, a senior associate at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Monterey Institute of International Studies at a 1999 hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on National Security, Veterans Affairs, and International Relations. Referring to the risk of any use of chemical or biological weapons he stated:", "... attacks with chemical and biological weapons are strikingly infrequent and the number of fatalities and casualties are far lower than those caused by conventional explosives. According to an analysis of 105 U.S. incidents featured in the Monterey Institute database from 1900 to 1998, only one fatality resulted from a [chemical or biological weapon] attack. This incident involved a 1973 assassination of an Oakland, California school superintendent by the Symbionese Liberation Army."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Severity of Harm", "paragraphs": ["It is generally agreed that chemical agents are likely to be the least lethal of the three \"weapons of mass destruction.\" In part, this judgment reflects the difficulty of producing and delivering large quantities of a lethal chemical to the target area prior to release. On the other hand, industrial chemicals and pesticides are readily available for purchase, and are stored in large quantities in thousands of locations throughout the United States, often near population centers. A key question for chemical facilities then is \"How much damage could terrorists do using existing stationary chemical manufacturing, processing, distribution, and storage facilities?\"", "There are two key sources of information for answering this question: accident reports and hazard assessments conducted by facility personnel or outside experts. There is no comprehensive database for either kind of information, but various groups have used publicly available data to estimate hazard potential, usually limited to accidental releases of chemicals from chemical facilities.", "A 1998 report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) and the National Environmental Law Center, Too Close to Home: Chemical Accident Risks in the United States , addressed the distribution of chemical facilities in the United States relative to population distribution. It stated that \"more than 41 million Americans live within range of a toxic cloud that could result from a chemical accident at a facility located in their home zip code.\" Those 41 million Americans live in zip codes that contain manufacturing companies with \"vulnerable zones\" extending more than three miles from the facility, the report states. A \"vulnerable zone\" is the geographic area that could be affected by the worst possible accident at a facility. According to the report, the estimate of 41 million Americans at risk may underestimate the hazard, because it was based on \"assumptions about facility and atmospheric conditions that would lead to small vulnerability zones.\" To produce the estimate, the study author stated that he used standard methodology used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and data on chemical storage from EPA's 1995 Toxics Release Inventory, a database of routine releases of industrial chemicals from manufacturing facilities.", "Hazard estimates by James C. Belke, an EPA employee in the Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Prevention Office, are more detailed. Based on a preliminary analysis of approximately 15,000 facility risk management plans for chemical facilities that were filed under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r) before September 25, 2000, Belke concluded that the median distance from a facility to the outer edge of its vulnerable zone is 1.6 miles in the case of toxic worst case scenarios, and 0.4 miles for flammable worst case scenarios. However, many facilities reported vulnerable zones potentially extending 14 miles from the facility (primarily for releases in urban areas of chlorine stored in 90-ton rail tank cars) and 25 miles (for releases in rural terrain of chlorine stored in 90-ton rail tank cars). Other chemicals for which reported vulnerable zones equaled or exceeded 25 miles include anhydrous ammonia, hydrogen fluoride, sulfur dioxide, chlorine dioxide, oleum (fuming sulfuric acid), sulfur trioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrocyanic acid, phosgene, propionitrile, bromine, and acrylonitrile.)", "Belke found the median population \"affected\" in a worst case accident was 15 people, for a flammable substance, while the median for toxic substances was 1,500 people. (\"Affected\" means potentially exposed. It is highly unlikely that all people within the vulnerable zone would be exposed due to a single release. However, anyone within the zone could be in the path of the chemical released, given certain environmental conditions.) Further EPA analysis of risk management plans submitted by facilities handling chemicals covered by the CAA Section 112 revealed that at least 123 plants reported a worst-case scenario with a vulnerability zone containing more than a million people. The analysis also found that more than 700 plants could threaten 100,000 people, and at least 3,000 facilities could threaten 10,000 people in the vicinity.", "The Department of Justice (DOJ) analyzed EPA data and concluded that among facilities submitting risk management plans to EPA, more than 7,000 facilities projected worst case scenarios for toxic substances that could potentially affect more than 1,000 people. Almost 1,700 facilities reported the possibility that a less extreme accident might potentially affect more than 1,000 people.", "Histories of actual accidents (as opposed to hypothetical worst-case scenarios) for facilities submitting risk management plans to EPA prior to October 21, 1999, were summarized in a working paper prepared by the Center for Risk Management and Decision Processes at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Of 14,500 reporting facilities, 1,145 reported 1,913 accidents between June 21, 1994 and June 20, 1999. Of the 1,145 facilities reporting accidents, 346 facilities had multiple accidents. Half of the chemicals for which risk management planning is required under the CAA Section 112(r) were involved in accidents. Half of the accidents resulted in reported injuries to workers. Accidents caused a reported 1,897 injuries and 33 deaths to employees, 141 injuries and no deaths to non-employees. No deaths were reported off-site. However, over 200,000 community residents were involved in evacuations and shelter-in-place incidents.", "Further analysis by the Wharton group revealed that the risk of accidental chemical releases and of worker injuries or property damage increased with the size of the facility (from 10 to 1,000 full-time equivalent employees or FTEs). Note that this refers to accidents of any kind, not to worst-case events. In addition, facilities reporting that they handled large amounts and many types of chemicals had much higher accident rates than facilities handling smaller amounts and fewer types of chemicals. The probability that a facility had experienced a chemical accident of any size approached 100% for the very largest chemical manufacturers. Toxic chemicals were more strongly associated with worker injuries, while flammable chemicals were more strongly associated with property damage. No regional trends in accident rates were discovered (i.e., facilities in various geographical regions had similar accident rates).", "Risk management plans submitted to the EPA report the worst-case potentially affected population for a release from a single process. As such, these populations may under-represent the population potentially affected as a consequence of a terrorist attack. Approximately 70% of RMP facilities possess reportable quantities of chemicals in amounts greater than a single process. For roughly 10% of RMP facilities, the quantity of chemical on-site is more than 10 times the quantity in the single process used to calculate the worst-case scenario. Some 250 facilities report having 100 times as much chemical on-site as is found in the single process. Thus, the EPA methodology for calculating the potentially affected population in the worst case, which was developed for accidental releases, may understate the potential worst-case consequences of a terrorist attack.", "In contrast to the above figures, which all were based on hypothetical or actual accidents described in risk management plans, the Washington Post reported March 12, 2002, that a classified study conducted by the U.S. Army Surgeon General dated October 29, 2001, found that a terrorist attack resulting in a chemical release in a densely populated area could injure or kill as many as 2.4 million people. According to the news article, the study found \"even middle-range casualty estimates from a chemical weapons attack or explosion of a toxic chemical manufacturing plant are as high as 903,400 people.\" The worst-case estimate of 2.4 million casualties from a chemical release was roughly half the surgeon general's estimate for casualties due to widespread use of biological weapons, according to the report. The Army Surgeon General recently explained that the estimate of 2.4 million casualties is of \"the number of people who might request medical treatment during a total release of a large industrial chemical manufacturing plant, in a densely populated area, and under ideal weather conditions for maximum exposure.\" As in most studies of this kind, some question the magnitude and likelihood of the casualty estimates.", "In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security used EPA data to estimate the number of potential fatalities that might result if all the various chemicals at a facility were released suddenly. The purpose of the exercise was to allow DHS to prioritize chemical facility sites for inspections. Assuming that released chemicals would move in the direction of the prevailing winds, DHS determined possible fatalities within a wedge-shaped zone. It identified two facilities that threaten at least one million people downwind. DHS selected 360 facilities for its attention in the near term based on these estimates.", "In July 2004, the Homeland Security Council issued 15 national planning scenarios to guide federal, state, and local homeland security preparedness activities. Included in these scenarios are two that refer to industrial chemical releases. One describes a terrorist assault on a petroleum refinery while the other treats the release of a large volume of chlorine from an industrial facility. The planning figures cited for the hypothetical refinery attack include 350 fatalities and an additional 1,000 casualties. For the chlorine release, 17,500 fatalities, 10,000 severe injuries, and 100,000 additional casualties are postulated.", "More recent calculations by DHS, based on more sophisticated models, have reduced hazard estimates.", "In our best estimate, based on an incredible amount of modeling that we've done, the highest-risk facility in the United States would produce under 10,000 potential fatalities and less than 40,000 people that would demonstrate some effects in terms of anywhere from a near-death experience from exposure to inhalation of the toxic chemical to a minor skin blemish caused by irritation through contact with the chemical."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chemical Site Vulnerability", "paragraphs": ["CRS identified two publicly available reports that assess site security at U.S. chemical plants.

ATSDR researchers concluded:", "\"security at chemical plants ranged from fair to very poor;\" chemical plant security managers \"were very pessimistic about their ability to deter sabotage by employees, yet none of them had implemented simple background checks for key employees such as chemical process operators\"; and \"none of the corporate security staff had been trained to identify combinations of common chemicals at their facilities that could be used as improvised explosives and incendiaries.\"", "The full ATSDR report was never made public, but a DOJ report noted that", "... among the 'soft targets' that the ATSDR identified as potential terrorist sites were chemical manufacturing plants (chlorine, peroxides, other industrial gases, plastics, and pesticides); compressed gases in tanks, pipelines, and pumping stations; and pesticide manufacturing and supply distributors.", "The DOJ released a study April 18, 2000, describing the risk of terrorism aimed at chemical plants.

Two of the plants were among the 123 plants nationwide that projected potential risks to more than 1,000,000 residents in the event of a worst-case accident or attack. The 30 companies constituted more than half of the 61 sites in the region required to file risk management plans. Fifteen of the sites to which reporters gained unchallenged access were water treatment facilities in Pennsylvania and Maryland.", "In May, another Tribune-Review article described a similar investigation of 30 additional plants in Houston, Baltimore, and Chicago. The report concluded that security was lax at some of \"the potentially deadliest plants\" in all three cities; access was easy to some sites owned by corporations with large security budgets; employees, customers, neighbors, and contractors \"not only let a stranger walk through warehouses, factories, tank houses and rail depots, but also gave directions to the most sensitive valves and control rooms\"; and access to 19 sites was allowed due to \"unguarded rail lines and drainage ditches, dilapidated or nonexistent fences, open doors, poorly angled cameras and unmanned train gates.\"", "Chemical manufacturers and users contacted by reporters said that they had bolstered security recently. Several site managers reported that they made immediate changes in procedures or construction plans in response to security breaches by the reporters.

Responses to the survey indicated that surveyed workers believed nearly three-quarters of the plants had improved systems to guard toxic chemicals and had conducted drills to respond to an intrusion by terrorists. On the other hand, according to employees who responded to questionnaires, fewer than half had improved communications, emergency response training, warning signals, or protective equipment, or contacted local first responders about the hazards on their sites.

The act defined \"hazardous substances\" to include chlorine, anhydrous ammonia, methyl chloride, ethylene oxide, vinyl chloride, methyl isocyanate, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, toluene diisocyanate, phosgene, bromine, anhydrous sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, and at least 100 other chemicals to be designated by EPA. EPA was directed to designate chemicals posing the greatest risks to human health or to the environment, based on three criteria: severity of potential acute adverse health effects, the likelihood of accidental releases, and the potential magnitude of human exposure. EPA promulgated a list of 77 acutely toxic substances, 63 flammable gases and volatile flammable liquids, and \"high explosive substances\" (59 Federal Register 4478, January 31, 1994). Fourteen chemicals met EPA criteria for listing as both toxic and flammable substances. The list was amended several times, notably on January 6, 1998 (63 Federal Register 640-645) to exclude explosive substances, and on March 13, 2000 (65 Federal Register 13243-13250) to exclude flammable substances when used as a fuel, or held for sale as a fuel at a retail facility. Selected categories of industries with large numbers of reporting facilities are identified in Table 1 .", "The CAA Section 112(r) imposes \"a general duty\" on owners and operators of facilities producing, processing, handling or storing any \"extremely hazardous substance\" to detect and prevent or minimize accidental releases and to provide prompt emergency response to a release in order to protect human health and the environment. The act requires owners and operators of covered facilities to prepare Risk Management Plans (RMPs) that summarize the potential threat of sudden, large releases of certain chemicals, including the results of off-site consequence analysis (OCA) for a worst-case chemical accident, and facilities' plans to prevent releases and mitigate any damage. Plans were to be submitted to EPA and made \"available to the public\" by June 21, 1999. EPA is required to review RMPs regularly, and if necessary, require revisions. EPA has delegated this responsibility to some states and localities. (All states have authority to review RMPs at facilities that are major sources of air pollution, which are required to obtain permits under Title V of the Clean Air Act.) Plans must be revised and resubmitted to EPA every five years. Many facilities were required to submit updates by the end of June 2004.", "In October 1996, the Accident Prevention Subcommittee of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee to EPA created the Electronic Submission Workgroup to consider the technical and practical issues associated with an electronic database of risk management plans. In spring 1997, the workgroup unanimously agreed that EPA should provide full, unrestricted access via the Internet to most RMP information. However, advisors did not reach consensus regarding access to OCA data.", "There were concerns that in facilitating electronic access to the general U.S. public through the Internet, EPA also would be facilitating access to these data internationally, which might permit misuse by terrorists.

National security concerns centered on the OCA data and their potential utility to terrorists. An interagency agreement was reached in late October 1998 that OCA data would not be included in RMP information placed on the Internet. Instead, EPA would make \"appropriate\" OCA data available in some form on request, but access would be restricted and not anonymous. The possibility that OCA data could have been distributed via the Internet remained, however, because it could have been obtained and distributed by any citizen under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), according to the EPA Legal Counsel.", "To address the security concerns raised by the Section 112(r) requirements, the Clinton Administration submitted draft legislation to Congress May 7, 1999. Congress enacted an amended version of the legislation as an amendment to S. 880 , the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act ( P.L. 106-40 ). The new law amended Section 112 of the CAA to exempt OCA data from disclosure under FOIA, and limited public availability until EPA and DOJ issued regulations in August, 2000.", "The final RMP regulation on data access was published August 4, 2000.

At the federal reading rooms, members of the public may read OCA information for up to 10 facilities per calendar month and for all facilities with potential effects in the jurisdiction of the local emergency planning committee. State and local officials and other members of the public may share OCA information as long as the data are not conveyed in the format of sensitive portions of the RMP or any electronic database developed by EPA from those sections.

For example, EPA advised pesticide companies and applicators to be especially vigilant about physical security of chemicals and equipment. The Agency issued a \"chemical safety alert\" tailored to the security needs of the pesticide industry, based on an earlier paper on site security of chemical plants that first was issued in February 2000.

It aimed to assure supply to downstream users of chemical products, to protect and assure the quality of chemical stockpiles, and to reduce the risk of malicious use of inherently hazardous chemicals. The Strategy noted that \"there is currently no clear, unambiguous legal or regulatory authority at the federal level to help ensure comprehensive, uniform security standards for chemical facilities.\" In particular, the Strategy observed that federal laws might be out-of-date and no longer effective for monitoring and controlling access to dangerous substances.

The fact that security can be expensive also was noted.", "The Strategy described the importance of water from a public health and an economic standpoint and noted that security of the water sector against terrorism had been greatly enhanced since September 11, 2001. Challenges facing the water sector, according to the Strategy, included the need to protect against intentional release of toxic chemicals so as to protect the safety of people who reside or work near water facilities. The Strategy proposed that EPA and DHS identify better ways to secure key points of storage and distribution; improve monitoring and analysis, information exchange, and contingency planning; and manage risks due to interdependencies with other critical infrastructures.", "The energy sector was divided into two sections: electricity and the oil/natural gas industries. Overall, energy was described as \"essential to our economy, national defense, and quality of life.\" The Strategy proposed that DHS and DOE work with state and local governments and industry to identify \"appropriate levels of redundancy\" and requirements for \"designing and enhancing reliability.\" In addition, DHS and DOE were to work with oil and natural gas industry representatives to \"define consistent criteria for criticality, standard approaches for vulnerability and risk assessments,\" and \"physical security training for industry personnel.\" An advisory task force was to be convened by DHS and DOE to identify appropriate planning requirements and approaches.

Another potential disadvantage of the strategy is that some \"safer\" tactics may simply spread a risk around, shift the risk to other locations or populations, or substitute one risk for another. For example, in replacing an acutely toxic chemical (that produces relatively severe health effects after a short exposure) with a less acutely toxic chemical, one might increase chronic risks (due to low-level, long-term exposures) or environmental risks (e.g., due to the chemical's persistence)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deterrence", "paragraphs": ["A third approach to reducing risks aims to reduce theft, rather than direct attacks, by making dangerous chemicals in use at a facility less attractive to criminals, for example, by introducing a color or other property that facilitates detection and tracking by authorities (so-called \"taggants\"), or by creating and storing antidotes to toxic effects. A disadvantage of the use of taggants is that they act as contaminants, and therefore may impede chemical processes.

They argue that communities have a right to be informed about hazards to which they might be exposed, and that free access to information is important to ensure public accountability of facility managers. Opponents of limiting public information also point out that citizens need information to assess facility compliance with laws, and if necessary, to petition the Administration or the courts for enforcement. Unsafe practices and inadequate risk management plans, in particular, should be publicized, they contend, so that communities may exert political or social pressure on plant managers to improve the inherent safety of their facilities. Moreover, these groups want access to information about similar facilities handling comparable chemicals across the United States, so that plans and accident rates can be compared and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of various safety measures. Informed citizens can work with local plant managers to reduce the risk of accidents, they argue.

Should we allocate resources to prevent worst-case scenarios, or everyday risks that add up over time? Are risks due to chemical terrorism worse than risks of equal or greater magnitude due to explosions or firearms? Should we emphasize measures to reduce terrorist risks that also may improve federal efforts to prepare for and respond to other disasters, as the President's National Strategy suggests? To what extent are we willing to sacrifice access to information about facilities in our neighborhoods, privacy, or government accountability for the sake of risk reduction? Are we willing to shift federal resources to DHS and away from other programs? The answers to such questions depend on value judgments and are likely to lead to diverse policy approaches and decisions about particular federal initiatives to reduce the threat of terrorism.", "For example, on the one hand, it often is argued that federal expenditures are most efficient when they are allocated with respect to relative risks and risk reduction opportunities. According to this view, relatively more federal funding should be provided to programs targeting risks that are greater and more clearly documented (e.g., to prevent smoking or motor vehicle accidents), than for programs targeting small, hypothetical risks (e.g., from exposure to pesticide residues on food). Based on this reasoning, the risks of chemical terrorism in the United States would deserve relatively few resources, because they are hypothetical and very small. This is especially true for individual chemical facilities. Such reasoning might leave some chemical facilities vulnerable to attack. As explained by the President of the Louisiana Chemical Association, \"Worst-case scenarios are just that Virtually every safety system in every process would have to fail for a worst-case scenario to actually happen.\" Will the federal government or some plant operators find such a scenario incredible, and thus, not worth additional security investments? What cost is justified for risk reduction at individual chemical facilities?", "On the other hand, some have argued that the distribution of risk is more important than the absolute or relative magnitude of risk. Scholars at the Brookings Institution, for example, argue that federal resources to combat terrorism should be devoted primarily to avoiding or mitigating potentially catastrophic terrorist acts. Catastrophic events, in which many people are killed or injured at once often strain local social, political, and economic systems, as well as emergency response resources, as was well illustrated by the attack on the World Trade Center and again during the hurricane season of 2005. Thus, the Brookings report focuses on protecting against nuclear, chemical, or biological terrorism and large-scale attacks at airports, seaports, nuclear and chemical facilities, stadiums, big commercial buildings, monuments, and American icons, as opposed to preventing numerous smaller attacks that might produce an equal number of casualties over a longer period of time.", "President Bush has directed the DHS Secretary to set priorities for critical infrastructure protection \"with an emphasis on critical infrastructure and key resources that could be exploited to cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the use of a weapon of mass destruction,\" but with consideration of numerous other potential effects of terrorist acts. As a result, DHS has been developing a vulnerability-assessment tool, working its way through, \"in priority order, first with the nuclear energy sector, and with the chemical sector, and shortly to follow many others across the top tier of consequences, vulnerabilities and threats.\"", "Still others object to reliance on any form of cost-benefit accounting with respect to public health and environmental risk management, because quantitative, analytic tools often do not consider risk factors and management options that they consider important. For example, one cannot produce a reliable estimate of benefits that might accrue from basing decisions on the so-called \"precautionary principle\" or most other preventive management tools, because specific kinds of damages and clean-up costs may never occur, and thus cannot be validated or corrected. Moreover, it can be argued that quantitative analysis is biased against preventive measures, because the hypothetical benefits, as well as the hypothetical risks, accrue (or not) in the future and generally are discounted (reduced in value). Many observers feel this kind of process inevitably estimates that preventive options will have relatively high short-term costs and relatively low and uncertain long-term benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsibility and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Deciding who should be responsible for achieving results (or who should be held accountable) requires consideration of many factors, including statutory authority, resource availability, technical competence, political feasibility, and moral or ethical constraints.

In addition, responsibility may be shared or distributed among several private and public entities. For example, in the case of chemical plant safety, responsibility probably will be divided in some manner to include owners/operators of facilities, insurers, and some unit of government. It is up to policy makers to decide upon the appropriate distribution of each component.", "Generally, people agree that the federal government is responsible for protecting citizens and the homeland, and that business owners are responsible for not causing hazards for their employees, neighbors, and assets. However, people have different views about who should be held accountable for the consequences of an act of terrorism, what level of protection from risk is acceptable, whether the private sector is likely to achieve that level of protection without public assistance or oversight, and who should bear the costs of achieving greater safety. These different views largely reflect general political philosophies (e.g., regarding the appropriate role of government and the value of public involvement in risk management decisions), but they also are influenced by specific knowledge of, and attitudes toward, the chemical industry, EPA, and other governmental and non-governmental entities.", "Some argue that the risks of terrorism for individual chemical facilities are so small that many facility managers are unlikely to invest sufficient resources to adequately ensure site security.

Federally mandated standards are likely to ensure a greater level of safety, according to this view, because administrative rule-making procedures provide for public comments, including comments by people potentially at risk if a terrorist attacks, but who do not directly profit from neighboring facilities. Voluntary chemical site security measures advocated by trade associations do not suffice, it is argued, because they do not cover all potentially dangerous facilities and have no standards, no timelines, no hazard reduction policies, no measurable hazard reduction goals, no accountability, and are not enforceable. However, at least some trade associations require independent audits of risk management plans, as discussed below.", "Recent testimony by Robert Stephan, Assistant Secretary of Infrastructure Protection, indicates that approximately 20% of chemical facilities that are relatively hazardous are not voluntarily signed up to an industry security code and are not covered by MTSA.

DHS has authority to inspect facilities and order compliance. Failure to comply with an order may be punished with a civil penalty of $25,000. There are no criminal penalties for noncompliance, although criminal penalties are authorized for unauthorized disclosure of \"protected information.\" In the event of repeated compliance failures, DHS may order a facility to cease operations. The law is silent on numerous issues, including the criteria for weighing risks of various facilities, federal preemption of state and local right-to-know laws, how to facilitate congressional oversight, and the role of IST."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "H.R. 1562", "paragraphs": ["Two other chemical facility security bills in the House were similar to proposals in the 108 th Congress. H.R. 1562 was introduced by Representative Fossella. It offers an approach somewhat similar to that of S. 994 , as reported in the 108 th Congress. H.R. 1562 would make DHS the lead agency overseeing chemical facility security, but it would require consultation between DHS and EPA. The bill would give the DHS Secretary discretionary authority to select facilities that should conduct vulnerability assessments and security planning, but it would require designation of high-priority facilities. H.R. 1562 would exempt from its requirements drinking water treatment facilities required to conduct vulnerability assessment under the Safe Drinking Water Act and facilities subject to the MTSA, unless the owner or operator of such a facility petitioned the Secretary to be subject to the requirements of this act in lieu of the former act. Vulnerability assessments and plans would be focused in H.R. 1562 on security (i.e., hardening) and emergency measures, in order to prevent and respond to releases caused by terrorism, rather than on inherent safety measures that might reduce the consequences of an unauthorized release, regardless of cause.", "H.R. 1562 also would protect from public disclosure under FOIA and state and local disclosure laws the certification documents submitted by facility managers indicating that they have complied with assessment, planning, and implementation requirements. (This is in addition to a provision that protects from public disclosure information related to vulnerability assessments and security plans.) H.R. 1562 also would withhold such information from civil judicial or administrative proceedings (except with respect to compliance with the chemical facility security legislation), thus shielding facility owners from lawsuits based on those documents. Criminal penalties are provided for unauthorized knowing disclosure of protected information by government officials.", "H.R. 1562 would authorize DHS to disapprove any assessment or plan and to order revision if it did not comply with regulations, or if the plan or implementation were insufficient to address the results of a vulnerability assessment or a threat of a terrorist release. Civil, but not criminal, penalties would be available if facility owners or operators failed to comply with an administrative order."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "H.R. 2237", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 2237 (introduced by Representative Pallone and similar to S. 157 / H.R. 1861 in the 108 th Congress) would build on existing EPA authority to oversee chemical facilities but would require consultation with DHS. It would require EPA to designate \"certain combinations of chemical sources and substances of concern\" as high priority categories based on the severity of the threat posed by an unauthorized release, proximity to population centers, and other criteria. Owners and operators of facilities within high priority categories would be required to conduct vulnerability assessments, identify hazards, and prepare prevention, preparedness, and response plans to eliminate or significantly lessen the potential consequences of an unauthorized release. Plans would be required to incorporate inherently safer technology, if practicable. Copies of vulnerability assessments and plans would be submitted to EPA and updated periodically.", "H.R. 2237 would protect vulnerability assessments and plans from public disclosure under FOIA, but H.R. 2237 would allow disclosure of information under state or local laws, if the state or local government received the information independently of DHS.", "H.R. 2237 would direct EPA to review each assessment and plan, determine compliance, and certify that determination. EPA would be authorized to issue compliance orders 30 days after notifying a chemical source that its assessment or plan was inadequate and offering compliance assistance, if the plan was not revised to comply with EPA requirements. If DHS notified a chemical source that its plan or implementation was insufficient to address a threat of terrorist attack, and the chemical source took inadequate action in response to that notice, DHS would be authorized to secure necessary relief to abate the threat from a district court in the district where the threat existed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Legislation", "paragraphs": ["In addition to these comprehensive proposals to enhance the security of chemical facilities, bills have been introduced that address a specific category of facility or chemical.

S. 2781 was reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on September 21, 2006.

At issue are risks to public health and safety, environmental protection, civil rights and duties, national security, and privacy. Some are advocating a strategy of relative risk analysis and analysis of risk management options to reveal the best course of action. However, information appears to be inadequate for quantitative evaluation of the risks of chemical releases, whether deliberate or accidental, and the nature of terrorism makes prediction difficult. Moreover, there is no universally accepted level of tolerable risk, no obvious basis for a comparison of relative risks and benefits, and no established federal mechanism for ensuring responsible management of the risks of chemical terrorism.", "A variety of federal policy options are available for enhancing chemical security. In choosing among options, policy makers face three key issues: how to evaluate the risks versus the benefits of public disclosure; how to determine and prioritize the relative importance of diverse risks; and who to hold responsible for achieving results. Section 550 of P.L. 109-295 , the FY2007 DHS appropriation, resolved these issues temporarily by providing three years of regulatory authority for DHS. The law requires vulnerability assessments for high-risk chemical facilities and implementation of security plans to address hazards revealed in such assessments. Other legislative proposals that were considered by the 109 th Congress would have done the same, but also addressed issues such as how to facilitate congressional oversight of DHS implementation, the role of inherently safer technology, the criteria used to designate facilities as more or less \"risky,\" and whether state and local right-to-know laws should be preempted by the federal provisions.
