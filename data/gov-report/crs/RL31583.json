These flexibility authorities apply primarily to programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the largest source of federal aid to K-12 education.", "In general, federal K-12 education assistance program requirements include activities or outcomes that state or local educational agencies (SEAs, LEAs) are expected to provide or achieve in order to establish accountability for use of funds consistent with the purposes of authorizing statutes. These requirements are usually intended to provide target accountability, ensuring that funds are focused on eligible localities, pupils, and purposes; outcome accountability, ensuring that funds are used effectively to improve student achievement and improve the quality of K-12 instruction; and fiscal accountability, ensuring financial integrity and providing that federal funds constitute a net increase in resources.", "Special flexibility authorities allow exceptions to these general requirements; they include Ed-Flex, Secretarial case-by-case waivers, ESEA Title I-A schoolwide programs, flexibility for small rural LEAs, the Innovative Programs block grant, Transferability authority, plus the State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Program (State-Flex and Local-Flex). In general, these authorities: (a) increase the ability of states or LEAs to use federal aid more completely in accordance with their own priorities; (b) are significantly limited in terms of the number of states and LEAs that may participate, the number and size of the programs affected, or the range of requirements that may be waived; (c) sometimes require a degree of accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes in return for increased flexibility, although the primary outcome requirements are applicable to all states and LEAs participating in Title I-A and other ESEA programs; (d) often attempt to require reports on ways in which the authorities have been used and the impact of flexibility on pupil achievement; and (e) have been adopted in a policy context of substantially increased accountability requirements and authorized degrees of flexibility in general with respect to some aspects of the ESEA and related programs.", "Major issues regarding special forms of flexibility in federal K-12 education programs include the following: How significant are the degrees of flexibility allowed under these authorities? Is there substantial state or local interest in the authorized forms of flexibility? For what purposes have special flexibility authorities been used in the past, and is there evidence that these have resulted in increased pupil performance or had other major impacts? And are the outcome accountability requirements consistent with the increased flexibility provided under these authorities?

In particular, the NCLB extended some flexibility authorities that had been established earlier, and initiated new ones. This report provides an overview of these authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs. It will be updated infrequently to incorporate major new developments in the implementation of these authorities or new information on their use and impact.", "\"Flexibility\" is defined for purposes of this report as authority under which federal program requirements, particularly restrictions on the use of federal aid, may be waived by, or on behalf of, state or local aid recipients meeting certain eligibility criteria. In some cases, this flexibility is granted in return for meeting specified accountability requirements related to program outcomes. Such flexibility includes provisions for consolidation of multiple programs, or for transfer of funds among programs, so that federal assistance may be used for a broader range of activities or purposes than ordinarily would be allowed, as well as the authority to waive specified types of program requirements.", "In general, these flexibility authorities apply to federal aid programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), the largest source of federal aid to K-12 education. In contrast, almost none of these authorities involve the second largest source of federal aid, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). For this reason, as well as the existence of a number of issues regarding requirements and flexibility that are specific to that program, the IDEA will not be discussed further in this report, and discussions of federal involvement in K-12 education in this report should be understood to apply to the ESEA and to exclude the IDEA. ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, and the 110 th Congress is considering whether to amend and extend the ESEA. This report will be updated regularly to reflect major legislative developments and available information.", "This report begins with a review of the general nature of federal K-12 education program requirements, including their sources, purposes, and the concerns expressed by some grantees about them. This is followed by a description of the current special flexibility authorities under which many of these requirements may be waived or otherwise made inapplicable, along with an analysis of issues specific to individual authorities. This section is divided between authorities initially adopted before the NCLB and authorities initiated in that legislation. The report concludes with an analysis of selected cross-cutting issues regarding these special flexibility authorities overall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Nature of Federal K-12 Program Accountability Requirements", "paragraphs": ["We begin this report with a brief review of the general types of program requirements applicable to ESEA and related federal K-12 programs. Many of these requirements may be waived, in part or in whole, for some or all states and LEAs under the special flexibility authorities discussed later. We refer to these as \"accountability requirements\" because they are intended to provide accountability by assuring that federal funds are used in ways that are consistent with the purposes of the federal statutes authorizing the programs. Typically, federal programs of aid to elementary and secondary education exhibit a mix of relatively specific and explicit requirements in such areas as eligibility of pupils to be served, allocation of funds, or (increasingly) outcomes, along with substantial flexibility in many other important respects, such as instructional methods or grade levels to be served.", "Federal K-12 education programs generally focus upon one or more of the following: (a) student populations with special educational needs, such as disadvantaged or limited English proficient (LEP) pupils; (b) a specific aspect of instructional services, such as educational technology or recruitment and professional development of teachers; (c) development, demonstration, and dissemination of innovative instructional approaches, such as charter schools or demonstrations of comprehensive school reform; or (d) a specific subject area, such as instruction in math or science. Most of the larger federal programs, such as ESEA Title I-A, fall into category (a), while several programs of small to moderate size are in categories (b)-(d). Almost all federal K-12 education programs, in all of categories (a)-(d), are sometimes referred to as \"categorical\" programs, because their focus is targeted or limited in one or more important respects. In contrast, one ESEA program\u2014the Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A\u2014provides support for such a broad range of activities that it is generally considered to be a \"block grant\" at the other end of the intergovernmental assistance spectrum."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sources and Forms of Accountability Requirements", "paragraphs": ["There are three general sources of federal requirements or related guidance to state and local recipients of federal aid. An important distinction (at least in theory) can be made between \"requirements\" and \"non-regulatory policy guidance.\" \"Requirements\" must be met by grantees, as a matter of law. While they are always derived ultimately from the authorizing statute for a program, or other federal statutes or judicial actions, they may appear in the form of regulations, in addition to statutory text. Program regulations, which are published initially in the Federal Register , then later integrated into annual updates of the Code of Federal Regulations , supplement statutory language primarily with respect to a limited number of major issues or topics which are complex, where U.S. Department of Education (ED) officials place high priority on grantees taking certain specific actions, and where statutory text is deemed by ED to provide insufficient guidance. One example would be ESEA Title I-A requirements regarding curriculum content and pupil performance standards and assessments. In a few cases, authorizing statutes explicitly provide that ED is to publish regulations addressing certain issues, although ED may issue regulations with respect to any aid program which it administers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Non-Regulatory Policy Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In contrast, \"non-regulatory policy guidance\" is also published by ED for many programs. Such \"non-regulatory policy guidance\" may be published in the form of extensive questions and answers regarding several aspects of a program, or more specific \"Dear Colleague\" policy letters from the U.S. Secretary of Education to chief state school officers or other state and local officials. As this designation implies, grantees are not legally required to follow this \"guidance,\" which is generally intended to answer relatively specific questions regarding topics such as uses of funds or selection of pupils to be served. Nevertheless, the typical perception and use of \"non-regulatory\" guidance may be more complex than this stated intent would imply. Grantees may assume that they will face fewer effective challenges to their use of federal aid if they follow such \"non-regulatory\" guidance, and may often treat such guidance as if it were equivalent to regulations, even if they are not explicitly \"required\" to do so.", "A somewhat analogous form of \"non-regulatory guidance\" may be found in the \"competitive priorities\" established by ED for competitive or discretionary (i.e., not formula) grant programs. In these grant competitions, ED typically sets certain priorities for applications which would receive preferential consideration in the awarding of grants. For example, a priority might be established for applicants which would use funds to provide services in schools with high percentages of pupils from low-income families. While applicants are not required to meet these priorities, it is obvious that they will have a much greater likelihood of receiving support if they do so. These priorities are not \"regulations\"; they are typically published only in the announcement of the grant competition in the Federal Register .", "Over the past several years, especially since adoption of the IASA in 1994, there has been a trend toward the publication of regulations which are less voluminous and address fewer aspects of many federal elementary and secondary education programs than in the past. For several programs, ED has published no regulations at all, implying that guidance in the statute is sufficient and requires no supplementation by regulations, although in most cases some form of \"non-regulatory policy guidance\" is provided.", "For ESEA programs where some regulations are still published, such as ESEA Title I-A, the regulations are generally somewhat briefer, and often address fewer issues, than was the case prior to the early 1990s. For example, proposed program regulations for ESEA Title I-A after enactment of the IASA in 1994 followed a rather \"minimalist\" approach in that they addressed relatively few program issues, primarily standards, assessments, and accountability; schoolwide programs; participation of children who attend private schools; and allocation of funds within states and LEAs. More recently, following enactment of the NCLB of 2001, ED embraced a similar strategy. With respect to ESEA Title I-A, for example, it has thus far published regulations on a relatively limited number of topics. The Department has stated:", "The Secretary intends to regulate only if absolutely necessary; for example, if the statute requires regulations or if regulations are necessary to provide flexibility or clarification for State and local educational agencies. Rather than regulating extensively, the Secretary intends to issue nonregulatory guidance addressing particular legal and policy issues under the Title I programs. This guidance will inform schools, parents, school districts, States, and other affected parties about the flexibility that exists under the statute, including different approaches they may take to carry out the statute's requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Purposes of Accountability Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Federal K-12 education assistance program requirements include a broad range of activities, services, or outcomes that SEAs, LEAs, and other aid grantees are expected to provide, perform, or achieve with, or in return for, federal grants, in order to show evidence that program goals are being met\u2014that is, to establish accountability for appropriate use of federal aid funds. Federal elementary and secondary education program requirements are usually intended to provide one or more of three basic types of accountability for use of funds consistent with the purposes of statutes that authorize the programs. These intended forms of accountability include", "target accountability : assuring that funds are focused on eligible localities, pupils, and purposes, usually for the ultimate purpose of promoting more equal educational opportunities; outcome accountability : assuring that funds are used effectively to improve student achievement and enhance the quality of K-12 instruction\u2014either in specific subject areas or for particular types of pupils, or overall; and fiscal accountability : assuring financial integrity and providing that federal aid funds constitute a net increase in resources for the eligible pupils or purposes, rather than potentially replacing (supplanting) state or local funds that would otherwise be available for the same purpose.", "Specific types of requirements intended to support one or more of these purposes include requirements to", "target resources on specific \"high need\" pupil groups or types of localities or schools, limit the authorized uses of funds to certain high priority types of services, conduct audits or assure that federal funds supplement, and do not supplant, state and local resources, enhance parental participation or provide for equitable treatment of pupils attending non-public schools, implement minimum qualifications for school staff, report to parents and the general public of information on program activities and their impact, meet certain student achievement and other outcome goals, and evaluate the effectiveness of federally supported instructional services.", "Grantees that violate any of these types of regulations implicitly face the possibility of having to repay funds to the federal government, or being prohibited from receiving further grants, although such sanctions are rarely invoked. In some cases, authorizing statutes explicitly provide for more limited, specific sanctions for states or LEAs which fail to meet some requirements.", "In addition to such program-specific requirements, a number of general requirements apply to all recipients of federal education assistance under any program. Many of these are published in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), as well as the financial management requirements contained in relevant \"circulars\" published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Other regulations that are generally applicable to ED programs include those related to civil rights and privacy of student records. LEAs that participate in the federal child nutrition programs administered by the Department of Agriculture must comply with a variety of related requirements\u2014for example, they must provide free or reduced-price school lunches to pupils from low-income families. Finally, federal regulations published by federal agencies other than ED may be applicable to LEAs and schools in their role as employers (e.g., regulations related to workplace safety, environmental protection, access for persons with disabilities, labor relations, etc.).", "However, state and local educational agencies are given wide latitude in other aspects of the use of federal education assistance. Such matters as grade levels, subject areas, and instructional techniques have typically been left almost totally to state and local discretion. If a requirement is applied to instructional methods under the ESEA and related programs\u2014for example, the requirement applied to selected programs under the NCLB that instructional methods be \"scientifically based\"\u2014it is almost always broad, leaving great scope to state and LEA discretion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns About Selected Federal Program Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program-Specific Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Complaints about ESEA and related program-specific requirements by proponents of greater flexibility are often focused on a selected range of particular types of requirements. Program-specific requirements that are often the focus of criticism include (a) explicit or implicit prohibitions against commingling (mixing) of funds under different federal programs with each other or with revenues from state and local programs; (b) restrictions on the use of resources purchased with federal program funds for activities other than those conducted under that program; (c) requirements that aid be targeted on certain types of pupils or schools; (d) eligibility thresholds for special forms of flexibility (e.g., ESEA Title I-A schoolwide programs); and (e) ESEA Title I-A outcome accountability requirements under the NCLB.", "In general, prohibitions against commingling of funds\u2014(a) above\u2014arise from efforts to establish fiscal accountability. Restrictions on the use of instructional resources to the pupils eligible to be served (b), as well as requirements to target aid on pupils and schools with the greatest incidence of poverty (c), are intended to focus limited federal funds on those with the greatest needs. The eligibility thresholds for certain forms of flexibility, such as ESEA Title I-A schoolwide programs (d), have rationales that are discussed later in this report. Finally, the new or expanded outcome accountability requirements (e), which are a key element of the NCLB, are intended to increase the effectiveness of federally supported education services and to help shift the focus away from other types of requirements toward improved outcomes.", "Nevertheless, from a state or local perspective, these requirements may sometimes seem to be unnecessarily inflexible, especially in relatively low enrollment LEAs that may receive small grants under each of a variety of federal programs. While the categorical approach of most of the larger ED programs directs aid at high-need pupil groups like disadvantaged and LEP pupils, such an approach may have undesirable (and unintended) effects. Some of these effects may include fragmentation of services to children, with challenges for coordinating special program instruction with their regular instruction; inefficient use of resources, that may remain unused when not required by the special needs pupils; treatment of partial needs when a more coherent focus on the whole child and her/his entire instructional program might be more effective, especially with respect to children with multiple special needs; or instruction of pupils in separate settings, whether or not this is explicitly required by the legislation, when this might not be the most effective instructional technique. The traditional federal categorical approach has been criticized as leading to fragmented instruction, and focusing more on targeting resources and inputs than on improving achievement and other outcomes for pupils. Difficulties may also arise from efforts to implement federal programs in states and LEAs with widely varying educational policies and demographic conditions.", "Some of these problems with categorical program structures and associated requirements may be based on misunderstandings of the requirements of federal statutes and regulations, or overly strict state or local interpretations of these. Others may be the inevitable effects of efforts to ensure that federal aid is focused on pupils most in need, coupled with grantee efforts to avoid problems with federal program monitoring and audits. Whatever their basis, and regardless of whether regulatory burdens have been reduced in recent years, state and local education officials sometimes complain about these, and other, constraints on the use of federal funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cross-Cutting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["A 1998 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, based on a survey of staff in a nationally representative sample of LEAs, concluded that in addition to the program-specific varieties of requirements discussed above, LEA staff frequently expressed concern about certain cross-cutting requirements applicable to recipients of federal K-12 education assistance. First, LEA staff complained that it was difficult to obtain current, accurate, and concise information on the wide variety of federal requirements with which they must comply, and that existing sources of technical assistance on these matters were inadequate. The authors of the GAO report concluded that LEA staff often respond to such information gaps in a cautious manner that unnecessarily limits their flexibility\u2014namely, that they often are unaware of, or do not exercise, degrees of flexibility that are available to them. Second, staff in most of the surveyed LEAs expressed concern about the costs of meeting their administrative responsibilities under federal education programs, including the preparation of required reports.

Technical amendments were made to P.L. 106-25 by the NCLB of 2001.

Under this provision, the Secretary of Education is authorized to waive most requirements associated with any program authorized by the ESEA. The waivers must be specifically requested by SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes or schools (via their LEAs). Waiver requests must include \"specific, measurable educational goals ... and the methods to be used to measure annually such progress for meeting such goals and outcomes\" for pupils eligible to be served by the relevant programs.", "With respect to types of requirements that may not be waived, the provisions regarding case-by-case waivers are generally the same as those for the Ed-Flex program. However, there are four types of requirements that may not be waived under the ESEA Title IX-D case-by-case waiver authority in addition to those that cannot be waived under Ed-Flex: (1) prohibitions against consideration of ESEA funds in state school finance programs; (2) prohibitions against use of funds for religious worship or instruction; (3) certain prohibitions against use of funds for sex education (under ESEA Title IX, Section 9526); and (4) the eligibility requirements for charter schools under the Public Charter Schools program (ESEA Title V-B-1). ESEA Title IX-D also has no authority analogous to the Ed-Flex provision that requirements generally not subject to waiver may be waived if the underlying purposes of the statutory requirements continue to be met to the satisfaction of the Secretary.", "Waivers granted under the authority of ESEA Title IX-D may not exceed four years, except that they may be extended if the Secretary determines that the waiver has contributed to improved student achievement and is in the public interest. In contrast, waivers are to be terminated if the Secretary determines that pupil performance or other outcomes are inadequate to justify continuation of the waivers, or if the waiver is no longer necessary. The Secretary of Education is required to publish a notice of the decision to grant a waiver in the Federal Register . According to a memorandum from ED's Office of the Inspector General dated April 5, 2007, the Department had failed for several years to publish such notices. Apparently in response to a draft version of this memorandum, ED did publish (on March 12, 2007) a list of waivers granted under ESEA Title IX-D between the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 ( P.L. 107-110 ) in January 2002 and December 31, 2006. A total of 197 waivers were granted during this period; however, relatively few of these were substantive. Almost two-thirds (128 or 65%) were waivers of a 5.0% administrative cost limitation on formula grants for Indian education under ESEA Title VII, Part A, and another 24 were extensions of the period during which funds under an ESEA program could be obligated. Of the remaining 45 waivers granted, 18 were related to the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, 5 were granted to allow states to participate in a pilot program using growth models of adequate yearly progress, 6 allowed LEAs to provide supplemental educational services (SES) rather than school choice in schools during their first year of improvement under the ESEA Title I-A accountability provisions, and 6 allowed LEAs identified as needing improvement to act as SES providers. The remaining 10 \"general programmatic waivers\" allowed exceptions to the ESEA Title I-A requirements for fiscal accountability (comparability) or school selection and allocation, or to a limitation on authority to consolidate state administrative funds under a variety of ESEA programs.", "The Secretary is also required under ESEA Title IX-D to submit to Congress annual reports on the effects and effectiveness of waivers that have been granted, beginning in FY2002.

In a schoolwide program, federal aid provided under Title I-A plus many other federal K-12 education programs may be used to improve services to all pupils, rather than limiting services to particular pupils deemed to be the most disadvantaged. If they meet the intent and purposes of Title I-A and the other federal programs, and address the needs of the programs' intended beneficiaries, schoolwide programs are exempted from a variety of regulations under Title I-A and most other programs, with specified exceptions, such as regulations regarding health, safety, civil rights, parental participation, services to private school pupils and teachers, or fiscal accountability. Title I-A and other federal program funds must be used so that they supplement, and do not supplant, other federal and non-federal funds that the school would otherwise receive. Further, only commingling or flexibility in the use of funds is authorized with respect to the IDEA in schoolwide programs; all of the IDEA's programmatic requirements must still be met.", "Although the schoolwide program authority applies to a wide variety of federal K-12 education programs, it is of significance primarily with respect to Title I-A. This is because almost all of the other programs affected typically are focused on LEAs overall, not individual schools. Further, to the extent that the non-Title I-A programs are focused on individual schools, they are not otherwise (i.e., in schools not eligible to conduct schoolwide programs) focused on groups of pupils with specific educational needs (except for the IDEA, where the schoolwide program authority is specifically limited). Nevertheless, the ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, combining them with state and local funds without the need for separate accounting, is in itself quite a significant form of flexibility in comparison to the traditional \"targeted assistance\" Title I-A program format, under which funds may be used only to serve the lowest achieving individual pupils in a school.", "There are few additional requirements that schoolwide programs are required to meet in return for this increased flexibility. The number of schoolwide programs has grown rapidly in recent years, and a large majority of the pupils served by Title I-A are now in schoolwide programs; they constitute more than half of Title I-A schools and a large majority of pupils participating in Title I-A programs. The eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs was reduced from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families by the NCLB. Before this, many of the Ed-Flex and other waivers granted between 1994 and 2001 had allowed schools below the 50% threshold to operate schoolwide programs.", "The rationale for providing schoolwide program authority to relatively high poverty schools is that (a) in such schools, all pupils are disadvantaged, so most pupils are in need of special assistance, and it seems less equitable to select only the lowest-achieving individual pupils to receive Title I-A services, and (b) the level of Title I-A grants should be sufficient to meaningfully affect overall school services in high poverty schools, since these funds are allocated on the basis of the (relatively large) number of low-income pupils in these schools. The NCLB has reduced the eligibility threshold to a level that is approximately the national average percentage of pupils from low-income families, which may raise questions regarding the validity of both aspects of this rationale for schools that just meet the new threshold. In addition, there is little direct evidence of the achievement effects of this expansion of schoolwide programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flexibility for Small, Rural LEAs", "paragraphs": ["A form of flexibility under which small, rural LEAs may transfer funds among selected ESEA programs was initially authorized under P.L. 106-554 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001.

These funds may be used for any activity authorized under any of these programs or under ESEA Titles I-A (Education for the Disadvantaged), III (English Language Acquisition and Enhancement), and IV-B (21 st Century Community Learning Centers).", "The primary rationale for this authority is that the smallest LEAs need special flexibility due to the small size of grants which they receive under a number of separate programs. These amounts, typically based in large part on LEA enrollment, are often too small to support separate programs of sufficient size and scope to be effective. Allowing such LEAs to combine and/or transfer funds among a limited range of program activities may facilitate more effective use of those funds.", "The degree of special flexibility provided to eligible small, rural LEAs under this \"REAP Flex\" authority is similar to a different Transferability authority (described below) that is available to almost all LEAs under the NCLB. The major differences are that the small, rural LEA authority applies to 100% of the funds under the affected programs, while the broader Transferability authority applies to only 50% (or in some cases less) of such funds; and the small, rural LEA authority includes more programs into which funds may be transferred (ESEA Titles III and IV-B). In addition, perhaps the greatest advantage of the small, rural schools flexibility authority is that LEAs eligible for it are also eligible for supplementary grants that may be used for any of the purposes for which combined or transferred funds may be used under the flexibility authority.", "According to a study released by ED in July 2007, participation in REAP Flex is widespread, with approximately 4,781 LEAs eligible and an estimated 51% of these participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority in 2005-2006.

Rural LEAs reported that they found this flexibility to be particularly useful because the amount of formula allocations they received under many of the eligible programs was too small to fund substantial school improvement activities.

Although the identification of aid programs as \"categorical\" versus \"block grants\" is always somewhat judgmental, ESEA Title V-A is the one major K-12 education program currently administered by ED that is almost universally considered to be a block grant. In the field of education, block grants are aid programs covering an exceptionally wide range of educational activities and types of students, and providing a great deal of flexibility to states and LEAs in using the funds. They are often constructed through consolidation of a number of preceding categorical programs that are more limited in the purposes or activities they support; in the case of Title V-A, the initial consolidation took place in 1981.", "After reservation of 1% of appropriations for grants to the Outlying Areas, ESEA Title V-A funds are allocated to the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in proportion to their total population aged 5-17 years, except that no state is to receive less than 0.5% of total grants to states. A majority of Title V-A funds must be allocated by SEAs to LEAs on the basis of state-developed formulas. These formulas must meet general criteria of taking into consideration each LEA's enrollment of pupils in public and private (non-profit) schools, and incorporating adjustments to provide increased grants per pupil to LEAs with the greatest numbers or percentages of \"high cost\" pupils, including those from economically disadvantaged families and those living in sparsely populated areas or areas of concentrated poverty.", "The specific minimum percentage of funds that must be suballocated to LEAs varies depending on the program's aggregate funding level and whether the state receives the minimum grant amount (0.5% of total grants to states). All states must suballocate to LEAs an amount equal to at least 85% of the grant which they received under this program for FY2002. In addition, most states are to suballocate to LEAs 100% of their Title V-A grants in excess of the FY2002 level; however, for states receiving the minimum grant amount, the minimum share of Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level that must be suballocated to LEAs is only 50%.", "Of the funds that may be retained by states, no more than 15% may be used for administrative costs; the remainder is to be used for one or more of seven specified types of programs and services.

Others are broad, such as \"promising education reform projects,\" \"activities that encourage and expand improvements throughout the area served by the local educational agency,\" or \"programs to improve the academic achievement of educationally disadvantaged elementary and secondary school students.\" It is essentially because of the existence of these broad, \"catchall\" categories of authorized use of funds by LEAs and states that Title V-A is generally considered to be a block grant.

Chapter 2 was the legislative response to a Reagan Administration proposal for a much broader block grant into which almost all federal K-12 education programs would have been consolidated. The block grant initially reduced the number of federal education programs. However, many new categorical programs were authorized in the years immediately following adoption of the consolidated program, including some that were essentially direct successors to programs initially consolidated into the block grant (e.g., aid for magnet schools).", "The most recent study by ED of the program ( Study of Educational Resources and Federal Funding: Final Report , August 2000), based on a survey of a representative sample of LEAs, found that 58% of recipient LEAs used \"a great deal\" of their Title V-A funds for instructional materials, while 39% of LEAs used substantial funds for educational technology, and 34% of LEAs for supplemental targeted academic services. Large LEAs were found to be especially likely to use Title V-A funds for teacher professional development services and school-based improvement efforts. Resources or services funded by this program were found to be infrequently targeted at particularly high-need pupils or schools. It was also reported that the primary factors influencing decisions on the use of Title V-A funds were long-term LEA plans and the priorities of individual schools.", "Appropriations have steeply declined over the life of Title V-A, from $442 million in FY1982, the first year of funding, to $99 million for FY2007. Further, P.L. 110-161 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008, provides zero funds for Title V-A, raising the possibility that the program is being effectively terminated, at least in terms of direct appropriations. One reason for this trend is that there have been few constituencies promoting increased funding for the program. Although it is apparently popular with a broad range of state and local public education officials, as well as many private school administrators, its support seems to be diffuse. In recent years, the direct appropriation for Title V-A has been supplemented by funds transferred into the programs under the REAP Flex (see above) and Transferability (see below) authorities, and this trend seems likely to continue as possibly the only source of funding for this program.", "Limited information on the effects of Title V-A services may have reduced incentives to maintain the program's funding level. Title V-A has tended to receive less favorable treatment in funding decisions than programs that could demonstrate targeting of funds, or a linkage to improved educational outcomes, particularly for high need pupil groups. In part to address this concern, ESEA Title V-A was amended by the NCLB to require participating states to prepare, and submit to ED, annual summaries of \"how assistance under this part is contributing toward improving student academic achievement or improving the quality of education for students\" (Section 5122(a)(2)).

With the major exceptions of the Transferability authority, the Innovative Programs block grant, and Title I-A schoolwide programs, states and/or LEAs are allowed to waive a variety of federal program requirements in return for some degree of accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. However, the outcome accountability requirements are essentially just increased attention to, and/or consequences related to, outcome accountability requirements that are applicable to all states and LEAs participating in Title I-A and other ESEA programs.

According to this GAO report, SEA staff in some states think Ed-Flex is of limited value because of the relatively few programs and requirements that may be waived.

At the same time, the ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used to allow a limited number of states to participate in a growth model pilot for determining adequate yearly progress (AYP) under the ESEA Title I-A accountability provisions, a widely supported modification of that program.", "As was discussed above, a recent study prepared for ED found that under the two recently-adopted forms of flexibility authority that are widely used\u2014REAP Flex and Transferability\u2014this authority was most often used to move funds out of ESEA Title II-A (Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting Fund) and, to a lesser extent, Title IV-A (Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities), and most frequently into Titles I-A (Education for the Disadvantaged) and V-A (Innovative Programs block grant). Many LEAs reported using these authorities to partially compensate for reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, to better target resources on schools failing to meet adequate yearly progress standards under Title I-A, or to be able to use funds with the high degree of flexibility allowed under Title V-A.", "In the pre-NCLB era, Secretarial waivers, Ed-Flex and other pre-NCLB flexibility authorities during the mid- to late-1990s were most often used to waive the following requirements: (1) the minimum low-income pupil percentage threshold for ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility (before this was reduced under the NCLB); (2) within-LEA targeting of Title I-A funds on schools with the highest number or percentage of pupils from low-income families; (3) deadlines for adoption and implementation of standards and assessments under ESEA Title I-A; and (4) a series of limitations on the use of funds under two pre-NCLB programs related to teacher recruitment and training: the Class Size Reduction (CSR) and Eisenhower Professional Development Programs. Each of these categories is briefly discussed below.", "Although schoolwide programs offer a great deal of flexibility to use funds under not only Title I-A but also most other federal programs in ways that might not ordinarily be allowed, it has been questioned whether schools with relatively low percentages of their pupils from low-income families should be granted this authority. If schools with relatively low poverty rates receive permission to operate schoolwide programs, the scope of these programs might be limited (since the size of a school's Title I-A grant is based on its number of children from low-income families), and it would be difficult for such a modest program to have a significant schoolwide impact. Further, no systematic evidence is available that schoolwide programs are more effective than more traditional \"targeted assistance\" Title I-A programs in improving the education of disadvantaged pupils.", "The use of waivers to maintain or expand the number of schools participating in Title I-A would tend to disperse Title I-A funds among an increased number of relatively low-poverty schools, reducing the concentration of funds on high-poverty schools. As noted above, Ed-Flex places restrictions on, but does not prohibit, waivers regarding ESEA Title I-A school selection.", "The use of waivers to delay meeting deadlines for implementing ESEA Title I-A standard and assessment requirements arguably undercut the most substantial pre-NCLB outcome accountability requirement. This increasingly important aspect of federal requirements is discussed further below.", "With respect to the former CSR and Eisenhower programs, LEAs and states frequently requested the waiver of requirements intended to: focus teacher hiring on the early elementary grades; require small LEAs to form consortia if their CSR grants were too small to pay the salary of a new teacher; ensure that minimum shares of teacher training funds would be used to support instruction in the subject areas of mathematics and science; or to limit the share of CSR funds used for professional development (as opposed to hiring new teachers). Such waivers appear generally to have been requested to accommodate relatively strict and specific limitations on the use of funds to varying local conditions.", "Following enactment of the NCLB, some of these formerly common uses of Ed-Flex and other pre-NCLB flexibility authorities are no longer as relevant as in the past. As noted earlier, the NCLB lowered the schoolwide program eligibility threshold to 40% of pupils from low-income families nationwide (although some may still seek Ed-Flex or Secretarial waivers for schools below 40% to conduct schoolwide programs). The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a broader and more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. As noted earlier, relatively few substantive waivers have been grated under the ESEA Title IX-D during the post-NCLB era."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Impact of Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["Regarding the impact of special forms of flexibility on pupil achievement or other outcomes, only limited information has been available. Although states that received Ed-Flex authority have been required to submit annual reports to ED on waivers granted and their impact, the information reported by the original 12 Ed-Flex states (under the pre- P.L. 106-25 authority) was of limited value, and no reports have yet been published on the actual purposes of waivers or their effects in states under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. Anecdotal information on the achievement effects of a number of Ed-Flex and Secretarial waivers in a limited number of LEAs was included in a 1999 ED report ( Waivers: Flexibility to Achieve High Standards ). The information in this report was primarily limited to whether affected LEAs or schools met state AYP standards in effect at the time.", "At the same time, supporters of special flexibility authorities often point to broader forms of evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems. These arguments are reflected in a 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex, the authors of which concluded that Ed-Flex authority has supported standards-based reform in the affected states in three major ways:", "Ed-Flex \"facilitates the coordination of programs and strengthens the planning process,\" by encouraging LEAs and schools to develop instructional programs without regard to the perceived constraints of many standard federal or state program requirements. Ed-Flex \"provides the opportunity for States to streamline the administration of programs\" by reducing paperwork deemed unessential to meeting basic purposes of federal programs. Ed-Flex \"supports the use of resources in a way that can, together with the implementation of standards-based approaches, lead to increased student achievement and reduction in the gap in achievement between different populations\" by shifting oversight focus away from inputs or procedures and toward outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Availability and Dissemination of Information on Use and Impact of Special Flexibility Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Given the limited amount of data showing improved pupil achievement outcomes in states, LEAs, or schools to which special forms of flexibility have been granted, the conclusions by ED (immediately above) should presumably be considered to be debatable. This is related to a final aspect of this set of issues: Will sufficient information be available on the use of special flexibility authorities, and their effects on pupil achievement, to make it possible to analyze or judge their benefits and impact?", "As mentioned earlier, while the statutes authorizing several forms of flexibility include significant requirements for reporting to and by ED on the use of waivers and other special authorities, and the pupil achievement and other effects of these activities, little relevant information has been disseminated by ED. Efforts by ED to compile and publish information on the use of waiver or other special flexibility authorities seem to have been a priority only infrequently. This makes it very difficult to evaluate the significance, advantages, and disadvantages of these flexibility authorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Are the Outcome Accountability Requirements Consistent with the Increased Flexibility Provided under These Authorities?", "paragraphs": ["A basic question regarding all special forms of flexibility is whether the increased emphasis on outcomes that is typically associated with them\u2014whether or not such additional outcome requirements are substantial\u2014is an adequate substitute for other forms of accountability requirements, such as required targeting of services on priority activities or high need pupil groups, which may be diminished through the grant of flexibility.", "In general, the outcome accountability requirements associated with either obtaining or maintaining the special flexibility authorities in this report are a combination of (a) goals established by the states and LEAs themselves, either in the implementation of programs such as Ed-Flex or in competing for (and ultimately implementing) State-Flex or Local-Flex authority; and (b) meeting the state-established adequate yearly progress (AYP) requirements under ESEA Title I-A. In some cases, such as the Innovative Programs block grant or Title I-A schoolwide programs, there is no direct linkage between the flexibility authority and any form of outcome accountability.", "Regarding (a) above, the most substantial evidence is contained in a GAO study, which found that states granted Ed-Flex authority under the original (pre- P.L. 106-25 ) legislation differed substantially in the clarity and specificity of their outcome goals related to the granting of waivers. Five of the original 12 Ed-Flex states had set no specific objectives at all for LEAs or schools being granted waivers, and only one of the states had established outcome objectives that were specifically linked to the LEAs, schools, and pupils affected by the waivers. The GAO study further concluded that ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation by the states was limited, involving mostly the collection of annual reports from the states with highly varying degrees of detail in the information they provided.", "If such practices continue, then the most significant (and the only concrete) outcome accountability requirement associated with any of the special flexibility authorities is (b) above, meeting AYP requirements. Thus, the current flexibility authorities do not actually require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states\u2014that is, accountability for pupil outcomes beyond that which is applicable to all other states and LEAs participating in Title I-A and other ESEA programs. Instead, they place increased emphasis on, attention to, and consequences for failing to meet, generally applicable outcome accountability requirements.", "Although this outcome requirement is not an additional one, in comparison to states and LEAs which do not receive special flexibility authority, it may nevertheless be substantial, as states continue to implement the AYP and related requirements under the NCLB. While all schools, LEAs, and states are required to meet these requirements, and are to face a variety of consequences if they fail to do so, those with special flexibility authority would have an additional incentive to meet the requirements (i.e., to maintain their eligibility to exercise the flexibility authority), and an additional negative consequence of failing to do so.", "While limited, such an enhancement of outcome accountability requirements may be consistent with the nature of the special flexibility authorities described in this report. In many respects, both the additional flexibility and the increased outcome accountability are quite limited. At the same time, these provisions take effect in the context of recent legislation, particularly the NCLB, which substantially expands both outcome accountability requirements and, at least in some major respects, flexibility in the use of federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools, whether or not they have been granted one of the special flexibility authorities described in this report.", "Finally, some proponents of high degrees of state and local flexibility in the use of federal K-12 education aid funds often argue that no increase in outcome or other accountability requirements is necessary to justify the granting of special forms of flexibility. To such proponents, increasing the ability of states and LEAs to use federal funds for purposes which they deem to be most appropriate and effective is sufficient justification for such policies, and is most likely to lead to improved pupil outcomes.", "At the same time, critics of these authorities might argue that there is no justification for granting special forms of flexibility in return for little or nothing more than the same outcome accountability requirements which are applicable to states, LEAs, and schools which have not been granted such authority. Such critics often defend the full range of generally applicable accountability requirements as embodying important national priorities, and are concerned that special flexibility authorities not only have insufficient accountability provisions, but have been used thus far largely for purposes that have not been proven to increase program effectiveness."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
