With roughly three-quarters of world purchasing power and almost 95% of world consumers living outside U.S. borders, more attention is being paid to the potential of small business export promotion programs to grow small businesses and contribute to national economic output. In addition, some Members of Congress believe the contributions of small businesses to commercial innovation and economic opportunities for firms and workers could be enhanced through greater access to growing international markets.", "Consistent with these policy goals, the Small Business Administration (SBA) provides export promotion and financing services to small businesses through its loan guaranty programs, management and training programs, and other initiatives. SBA's Office of International Trade (OIT) coordinates these activities as it assists with four stages of export promotion: (1) identifying small businesses interested in export promotion; (2) preparing small businesses to export; (3) connecting small businesses to export opportunities; and (4) supporting small businesses once they find export opportunities.", "The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-240) elevated trade within SBA by establishing an assistant administrator to lead OIT and report directly to the SBA administrator. The act also first authorized the precursor to what is now known as the \"State Trade Expansion Program\" (STEP), which provides grants to states and territories to assist small businesses based on a trade promotion plan developed by the applicant state. The STEP program was appropriated $18.0 million for FY2016.", "In FY2016, SBA's export-related loans amounted to approximately $1.5 billion (approximately 5.0% of the value of SBA's annual loan portfolio). Although SBA has three loan programs that are specifically targeted toward exporters, most of SBA's lending support for export-related activities occurred through its broader loan programs. Surveys indicate that relatively few clients of SBA's management and training programs request trade-related counseling.", "This report begins with the history, role, and scope of SBA's export promotion activities and the creation of OIT. Next, it uses quantitative and qualitative data from SBA to provide performance analysis of SBA's international programs. This report concludes with a discussion of three policy issues for Congress.", "First, export promotion programs could have a policy rationale if barriers to entry are indicative of a market failure to efficiently allocate investment toward small exporters (e.g., because of disproportionately high costs to comply with trading regulations or insufficient information about the net benefits of trade). Many of these conditions, though, could be due to higher risk profiles for small exporters instead of a market failure.", "Second, export promotion is sometimes viewed as important to U.S. trade \"competitiveness,\" by boosting U.S. exports in sectors that are cutting-edge, or have become displaced by lower-cost producers overseas. Some critique this theory by arguing that these policies are economically inefficient, if they distort capital from flowing to activities with the highest economic return.", "Third, the range of federal export promotion programs has led to administrative challenges among some small-business clients and potentially led to the duplication of services using taxpayer money. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-125) enacted reforms intended to address some of these concerns.

Only 1% of small businesses in the United States export. With roughly three-quarters of world purchasing power and almost 95% of world consumers living outside U.S. borders, more attention is being paid to the potential of small business programs to increase employment in the export sector.", "Advocates of export promotion programs also argue that helping small businesses to export will lead to more jobs. A commonly held view is that small businesses are the major source of job creation in the U.S. economy and thus policymakers should try to encourage the growth of small businesses as a means to increase employment. Economists have debated for decades the extent to which small businesses contribute to job creation. More recent studies indicate that small business owners have different aspirations concerning the growth of their firms and that small, new firms (i.e., startups) are more likely to expand than small businesses generally.", "Economists generally do not view job creation as a justification for providing federal assistance to small businesses. They argue that in the long term such assistance will likely reallocate jobs within the economy, not increase them. In their view, jobs arise primarily from the size of the labor force, which depends largely on population, demographics, and factors that affect the choice of home versus market production.

Next, the report describes the three major forms of SBA trade-related assistance: (1) export-promotion-focused loans, (2) management and training programs, and (3) the State Trade Expansion Promotion (STEP) grant program. It then uses quantitative data from SBA and qualitative data from other sources to present performance analysis of SBA's international programs.", "The report also discusses three policy issues for Congress. First, are there market barriers impeding smaller firms from exporting? Second, is there a compelling interest for the government to promote exports in the name of national \"competitiveness\"? Third, are SBA's export promotion policies duplicative of other federal programs? These policy issues could arise in future debates over the size and scope of SBA's international trade programs.

A survey of the empirical literature suggests that access to finance and the cost of credit not only pose barriers to small business trade financing in many countries (including the United States) but also constrain small businesses more than large firms. Smaller firms often find it difficult to obtain commercial bank financing (especially long-term loans) for a number of reasons, including lack of collateral, difficulties in proving creditworthiness, inadequate credit history, small cash flows, higher risk premiums, underdeveloped bank-borrower relationships, and high transaction costs.

Specifically, economic theory indicates that in most instances firms and workers will locate to the most efficient and productive areas to do business in the long run, without the assistance of government policy. From this perspective, government policies, such as export promotion programs, that create incentives to engage in one form of economic activity, potentially at the expense of another, result in net social loss of economic efficiency because finite resources are not being used to produce their maximum output for the lowest cost. Economic theory indicates that these policies create a distortion in the market, such that resources are directed from an area of higher productivity to an area of lower productivity.", "At the same time, most economists believe that some government assistance could be justified in the presence of a market failure , in which the market is unable to efficiently allocate resources on its own. If there is indeed a market failure, then there could be an economic basis for small business export promotion programs (assuming the costs of these programs were less than the aggregate increase in economic activity).", "Although studies indicate that smaller firms face barriers to exporting, many of these conditions are not necessarily indicative of a market failure. Higher risk profiles for small exporters could be justified by their higher rates of failure and compounded by their ability to absorb risks associated with international transactions (e.g., currency fluctuations, transportation costs).

However, other experts are divided concerning the merits of encouraging the development of sectors that produce tradable goods and services as a means to improve net exports, increase jobs, and encourage productivity growth.", "Proponents of national trade competitiveness theory believe individual countries have a compelling policy interest to increase the real (inflation-adjusted) income of their citizens, often through promoting growth in specific, tradable sectors. Supporters of trade competitiveness theory are largely focused on strategies that guide individual businesses in the marketplace. These firm-level strategies are then applied to the national level to inform public policy. Specifically, government policy can either reduce a business's profit (e.g., through national regulations) or increase a business's bottom line (e.g., by subsidizing production) such that domestic firms in the near term can have a greater financial profit in a head-to-head \"competition\" with their international competitors.

In part, this notion comes from the belief that small businesses are the primary source of job creation in the United States and that access to international markets could further increase the number of jobs created by small businesses. In a related argument, proponents of small business exports say that small businesses are critical for innovative, international supply chains. For example, in an article for the Washington Post , then-SBA Administrator Karen Mills described small businesses' supply chain networks with larger firms and small businesses' innovations in production as being important in the promotion of U.S. international economic competitiveness.", "In contrast, economic theory generally does not support international competitiveness as a national policy goal. A 1994 article by economist Paul Krugman provides an argument against trade competitiveness theory based on the economic theory of comparative advantage. In summary, Krugman argues that firms might compete with one another, but countries trade with each other. To support this statement, Krugman says that firms go out of business when they fail to compete in the marketplace, but countries do not. When a country fails to be competitive in a particular industry, national resources (e.g., capital, labor) are then used toward production in a different industry. Krugman argues that this process allows for a more efficient allocation of resources because countries are guided by market signals to specialize in the industry in which they possess a comparative advantage instead of using government resources to provide incentives for economic activity in an industry in which they are relatively less efficient in production. In summary, Krugman reaffirms traditional economic theories that contend that government policies that promote employment in certain sectors redirect employment from other sectors and that productivity gain (in the form of higher wages) for workers in the higher-valued industries is passed along to other workers in the form of higher prices (and lower productivity).", "Even if other countries are providing government incentives for their national small businesses to export, some economists would still say that Krugman's thesis holds. According to this logic, the United States should not engage in policies that lead to an inefficient allocation of resources and net loss in national welfare because its trading partners do so. Others expand upon Krugman's theoretical reasoning by arguing that the drive for national competitiveness, relative to another country, could be used to justify trade protectionism, restrict capital or labor mobility, increase unemployment by sending political signals of support for certain industries, or engage in \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" policies of international retaliation that consume national resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Duplication of Services", "paragraphs": ["In the past, Congress has passed legislation to increase export promotion programs targeting small business across various federal agencies.

SBA and Commerce noted that both agencies have begun to clarify counseling roles and responsibilities through an interagency communiqu\u00e9. GAO recommended that SBA consult with Ex-Im and Commerce more closely to provide specific guidance regarding the agencies' export promotion counseling to small business and to identify ways to share client information. SBA has been responsive to some of GAO's concerns, but it has noted that legislation generally prevents SBA from sharing specific client information outside of the agency without prior consent. GAO also recommended that SBA and Ex-Im may be able to explore options to harmonize export financing products and assist lenders in more easily adapting to the rules for both agencies' products. In any case, co-location of some of these services (in the form of U.S. Export Assistance Centers) could help to reduce the burdens on small businesses in obtaining comprehensive export counseling assistance.", "Improving export program efficiencies has been the focus of several recent bills and could also become a larger issue if Congress grants the President the authority to reorganize certain business- and trade-related offices (and entire agencies) across the federal government under a single agency. In his FY2015 budget recommendation, President Obama included SBA as one agency whose trade-related functions could be consolidated under a single agency for trade promotion. In the 112 th Congress, the Reforming and Consolidating Government Act of 2012 ( S. 2129 ) would have provided the President with much of this authority.", "In the 113 th Congress, several bills were introduced to help small businesses exporters, including the following:", "The Export Coordination Act of 2013 ( H.R. 1909 ) would have helped to clarify the role of each federal agency in each part of the export process. More specifically, the bill would have revised the duties of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) and expanded its membership, and it would have required the Secretary of Commerce to make available more information on trade missions, trade fairs, and related activities. The TRADE (Transparent Rules Allow Direct Exporting) for Small Businesses and Jobs Act ( H.R. 1916 ) would have assisted small businesses in increasing their exports and entering new markets by helping companies better understand foreign regulations and directing trade agencies to monitor and collect up-to-date information on changes to tariff and nontariff laws, regulations, and practices and to display this information in a clear and easy-to-read format. The Small Business Export Growth Act ( S. 1179 ) would have encouraged greater coordination between state and federal resources by creating a working group on the TPCC to streamline efforts among state and federal export promotion and assistance agencies, identify opportunities to consolidate unnecessary government offices, and require SBA to conduct greater export outreach to small businesses. The State Trade Coordination Act of 2013 ( H.R. 1926 ) would have required increased representation and integration of state trade programs into federal trade promotion programs and established information sharing and reporting metrics between the states and the federal government.", "In the 114 th Congress, P.L. 114-125 enacted provisions that were similar to versions of the bills from the 113 th Congress, above, or subsequent versions of those bills introduced in the 114 th Congress. In particular, Sections 504 and 505 of P.L. 114-125 contained provisions that are intended to increase coordination of federal export promotion programs, reform the Export.gov web portal to be more accessible to small business exporters, integrate state trade programs into federal trade programs, and clarify the role of the TPCC in promoting state and federal export promotion programs. Both the SBA's AA for International Trade and the Secretary of Commerce have various roles in these trade promotion reforms, and the act mandates that these agencies produce plans for carrying out the reforms as well as a set of reporting metrics. These deliverables to Congress could inform the debate about small business trade promotion policy in the 115 th Congress, and be possibly subject to congressional oversight hearings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
