{"id": "R42832", "title": "Choice and Mobility in the Housing Choice Voucher Program: Review of Research Findings and Considerations for Policymakers", "released_date": "2012-11-21T00:00:00", "summary": ["As is evidenced by the name of the program, \"choice\" is one of the key components of the nation's largest federal housing assistance program, the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV, or voucher) program. The choice aspect of the program\u2014that eligible families can use their federal subsidies to rent the housing they choose in the private market\u2014differentiates it from the other major federal housing assistance programs, including public housing and project-based Section 8 rental assistance, which offer assistance tied to specific units of housing. Those programs have long been criticized for isolating and concentrating poor families, particularly minority families, in high-poverty communities with limited opportunities, particularly in urban areas. Thus, the HCV program was designed, in part, to promote \"mobility,\" or make more areas accessible to low-income families and encourage them to move to areas with greater opportunities. Further, courts have directed communities to use vouchers as a remedy for racial segregation in public housing.", "Despite these goals, most families participating in the Section 8 HCV program live in racially segregated communities that have medium or high levels of poverty. There is little consensus on why this occurs, as the housing choice a family makes may reflect the many constraints a family faces in using its voucher, the understanding the family has of the choices to be made, and/or the family's own preferences.", "A number of demonstrations and studies have looked at how vouchers can be used to deconcentrate poverty and the effects of moving families out of areas of concentrated poverty. Taken together, the research to-date has not shown convincing evidence that programs designed to move low-income families to neighborhoods with low-poverty and racially/ethnically integrated neighborhoods have resulted in families successfully and permanently moving to such communities. Most studies have shown that families given vouchers with mobility goals have struggled to make initial moves to areas that would be considered \"areas of opportunity\" (i.e., those with very low concentrations of poverty). Further, those families that did initially relocate to low-poverty and more racially integrated neighborhoods, over time and with subsequent moves, often ended up living in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of poverty and less racial integration than the low-poverty neighborhoods to which they had initially moved.", "Researchers have also looked beyond families' locational outcomes at the effects of moving on various measures of family well-being. While one of the motivating goals behind these mobility policies and demonstrations has been to improve families' economic well-being and their children's educational outcomes, studies have not found evidence that the tested mobility policies have had major positive impacts in these areas. Early studies found some initial employment and earnings impacts and some mixed findings regarding children's outcomes, although later research has called those initial findings into question. Some positive impacts were found in the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration involving physical and mental health, housing satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, perceived safety, and overall perceived well-being. But in other areas of interest to policymakers, such as family economic well-being\u2014employment and children's educational outcomes\u2014no impacts were found from MTO.", "The fact that many families with vouchers continue to live in high or medium-poverty, racially segregated neighborhoods, paired with the research findings to-date about the limited impacts of tested mobility programs, leads to several questions and considerations policymakers may choose to explore. One question is whether policy changes to the voucher program, or to other federal assisted housing programs, could help to better achieve the goals of poverty deconcentration and reducing racial or ethnic segregation. Another question is whether these goals are of the same, greater, or less importance than other program goals, such as promoting affordability and housing stability. The way policymakers choose to answer these questions could have implications for the direction of federal housing policy.", "These questions are particularly relevant now for several reasons. One reason is the current fiscal climate. In a constrained budget environment, policymakers face difficult tradeoffs in funding federal programs. In determining priorities for limited federal funding, the effectiveness and efficiency of all federal housing assistance programs, including the largest\u2014the HCV program\u2014may be reexamined. In fact, reforms to the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program have been considered every year for at least the last decade. While the choice and mobility aspects of the program have not been a primary driver of those reform efforts, these aspects of the program may receive more attention, especially given recently-released research findings. The results of the final evaluation of the MTO demonstration have only been published in the last couple of years and are being considered and debated by social science researchers as well as housing policy advocates.", "This report explores the concept of choice and mobility in federal housing policy, particularly in the Section 8 HCV program.

Families seeking assistance would apply to the local public housing authorities (PHAs) that administered federal housing assistance programs (i.e., public housing) and if a subsidized unit became available, it would be offered to the family. It is well documented that for the first several decades of the public housing program, families were directed to specific public housing developments based on their race. The housing developments to which black families were directed were generally in less-desirable geographic areas and of poorer physical condition than those to which white families were directed. ", "This systematic racial segregation was eventually outlawed and several large PHAs were subject to court-ordered desegregation strategies (e.g., the Gautreaux Fair Housing program, discussed later in this report). However, many public housing developments, particularly in urban areas, remained racially segregated. These same housing developments have been characterized by severe distress, both physical and social, offering challenging circumstances and limited opportunities for the families that reside in them. The problems have been most acute in urban areas, where public housing helped contribute to the concentration of extreme poverty in inner-city, primarily black communities, and where joblessness, crime, and myriad other social problems were growing.", "It is against the backdrop of this history that \"choice\" has come to be considered a critical component in today's assisted housing policy. The concept of choice in federal housing policy is driven by two policy goals, neither of which the traditional public housing program appeared to have accomplished. One is to support the autonomy of individual families and their right to choose where they wish to live. The other is to promote racial desegregation and poverty deconcentration, by providing low-income families with the option to move to low-poverty and racially integrated areas. Both implicit and explicit in this goal is the desire to improve families' well-being, particularly their economic well-being.", "Encouraging moves to low-poverty neighborhoods is premised on the idea that low-poverty neighborhoods create better life outcomes, particularly for children. The disparities in health, education, exposure to violence, and employment outcomes between high-poverty and low-poverty neighborhoods are well documented. However, beyond a general agreement that individuals benefit from living in low-poverty neighborhoods, there are many unresolved questions. Researchers have not concluded why, how, and how much neighborhoods matter, and researchers continue to debate which differences in neighborhoods (e.g., differences in resources, social networks, role models, civic engagement, etc.) lead to differences in neighborhood features (e.g., school quality or crime levels). ", "Congress included among the stated goals of today's largest federal housing assistance program, the Housing Choice Voucher program, the promotion of choice and mobility and the deconcentration of poverty. The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-276 ), which created the modern HCV program, identified public housing as plagued by a series of problems, including the concentration of extremely poor people in extremely poor neighborhoods, and it included among its purposes: ", "\"facilitating mixed income communities and decreasing concentrations of poverty in public housing\"; and creating the voucher program as \"a market-driven program that will assist in making tenant-based rental assistance under such section more successful at helping low-income families obtain affordable housing and will increase housing choice for low-income families.\"", "While few observers argue against the concept of providing low-income families with housing choice, there have been criticisms of the way that choice is provided through the Housing Choice Voucher program. Similarly, while there is little disagreement that systematic segregation is untenable and that areas of highly concentrated poverty with limited economic opportunity are undesirable, there is disagreement about how necessary racial and/or economic integration is to individual and family well-being."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Housing Choice Voucher Program", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Elements", "paragraphs": ["The Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), is arguably the federal government's largest housing mobility program, serving roughly 2 million low-income families. While choice and mobility are among the goals of the program, another primary goal is to make decent housing affordable to low-income families. This section of the report describes the program's structure and the ways in which that structure shapes the choices of the program participants. It also describes the design elements that have been incorporated into the program's structure to allow for and encourage families' moves to low-poverty and racially integrated neighborhoods. ", "The Section 8 HCV program provides eligible low-income families with subsidies that they can use to rent the housing of their choice from private market landlords. Families are generally eligible to receive a voucher if they are very low-income (earning 50% or less of the local area median income) or if they are low-income (earning 80% or less of the local area median income) and meet other special criteria such as being elderly or having disabilities. The program is fully federally funded, but it is administered by local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs). Eligible families apply directly to PHAs for housing vouchers. Families that receive a housing voucher must find a unit that meets the program's housing quality standards (HQS) and is considered to have a reasonable rent when compared to similar units in the local market and on the premises. Families have a limited amount of time to search for a unit, as determined by the PHA, but which must be 60 days at minimum. Landlord participation in the program is voluntary, so families must not only find units that meet their needs and the program standards, but also units with landlords willing to accept their vouchers.", "The amount of assistance available to a household is based on the local area's Fair Market Rent (FMR). FMR is determined by HUD and is equal to the 40 th or 50 th percentile of the distribution of an area's rents, depending on the affordability of the local area. In setting maximum benefit levels in each community, PHAs have the discretion to apply a ratio between 90% and 110% to the FMR according to the conditions of the local market. The resulting \"payment standard\" varies by bedroom size and serves as the basis for setting a household's subsidy amount. A household's voucher benefit is calculated as the PHA's payment standard, less the household's rent contribution, which is generally equal to 30% of the household's income. The 30% contribution is the standard for what is considered \"affordable\" for a low-income family to pay towards housing costs. A household may choose to spend up to 40% of its income for rent within the first year of participation and more than 40% of its income on rent after the first year of participation. ", "The structure of the program thus specifies the minimum quality of the unit and the maximum cost to the household to ensure that decent housing is made affordable to low-income families. The housing quality standards guarantee that subsidized families live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing and capped tenant contributions prevent participating families from having a high rent burden. On the other hand, these specifications do limit the units that are available to program participants. HUD's flexibility in setting the FMR, PHAs' flexibility in setting payment standards, and families' flexibility in determining the amount of their income to be contributed to rent can serve to make more expensive units, potentially including those in low-poverty neighborhoods, more available to low-income families. These features, however, may result in more expensive federal subsidies or higher rent burdens for families.", "Other program features, such as portability requirements and other deconcentration policies, are specifically intended to support and encourage the mobility of low-income families."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Portability", "paragraphs": ["Portability is a key feature of the current Section 8 HCV program. Portability allows families to move from one PHA's jurisdiction to another PHA's jurisdiction without an interruption of housing assistance. ", "Portability has limits, however. PHAs have the ability to prohibit some families (those that are not residents in the PHA's jurisdiction) from making portability moves during their first year of participation in the program. PHAs may also deny portability moves if they do not have sufficient funding to support the move. Families that are able to make portability moves also face restrictions. The family's income must fall within the income limits of the receiving PHA and the family is subject to the receiving PHA's voucher payment standards, subsidy standards, search time policies for the portability move, and may be subject to rescreening for eligibility. HUD advises that families should \"pay close attention to portability requirements at both PHAs\" in order to avoid complications during a portability move. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Required PHA Policies to Promote Poverty Deconcentration Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The HCV program regulations require that PHAs inform families of their housing choices and implement policies that expand the housing choices of families. Each PHA is required to provide families living in high-poverty areas with information on the benefits of moving to a low-poverty area. Each PHA must also have a written policy that explains how the PHA encourages the participation of landlords in low-poverty areas. In addition, HUD encourages PHAs to provide families with information about areas inside and outside of the PHA's jurisdiction that have low rates of poverty and that are racially integrated, but it does not require PHAs to do so. The annual performance rating (through the Section 8 Management Assessment Program) of PHAs located in metropolitan areas is partially based on PHAs' expansion of housing opportunities. This is demonstrated by actions such as meeting the required regulations, performing analysis of the opportunities families have to rent in low-poverty and racially integrated areas, and including landlords with units located in high-poverty areas in the list of landlords willing to lease to voucher holders that is provided to program participants. These PHAs can also receive bonus points for their annual performance rating based on the number of families with children living in low-poverty areas.", "PHAs are provided with fees for administering the HCV program; however, they do not receive dedicated funding for promoting mobility (e.g., intensive search assistance and mobility counseling), so the cost of any additional mobility efforts a PHA may wish to make will have to be weighed against the costs of the other administrative needs of the program. This is a particularly relevant consideration in recent years, when funding for per-voucher administrative fees has been at reduced levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Families' Moves in the Section 8 HCV Program", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously, families participating in the Section 8 HCV program are responsible for obtaining housing with their vouchers. After receiving the voucher, families must find a unit that meets the price and quality constraints of the program and may do so with varying levels of search and housing location support. ", "According to the most recent study, published in 2000, approximately 31% of families issued vouchers were unable to use the voucher to successfully lease housing. While the \"success rate\" may have increased or decreased since 2000 due to policy changes or external factors, long-term trends in the program suggest that the inability of all families to use their vouchers to lease units continues to be an issue. ", "Families that are able to successfully enter into leases with their vouchers are not necessarily moving to low-poverty neighborhoods. According to a recent study, approximately 51% of voucher holders live in medium-poverty neighborhoods (with poverty rates between 10% and 30%). Another 21% of voucher holders live in high-poverty neighborhoods (with poverty rates greater than 30%). Only about 27% of voucher holders live in low-poverty neighborhoods (with poverty rates that are 10% or less). ", "In general, this distribution of vouchers across neighborhoods of varying poverty concentrations is comparable to the distribution of other HUD project-based housing units (e.g., public housing and project-based Section 8 properties) in terms of low-poverty neighborhoods, but not in terms of high-poverty neighborhoods. High-poverty neighborhoods had greater proportions of project-based housing units than Section 8 vouchers. This suggests that while Section 8 HCV participants are less likely to be living in high-poverty neighborhoods compared to those who live in other forms of assisted housing, they are no more likely to live in low-poverty neighborhoods.", "Another research study showed that voucher holders are increasingly moving to suburbs; however, the majority of suburban voucher holders are not living in high-income, job-rich suburbs. Approximately 49% of families receiving vouchers lived in suburbs in 2008. This may reflect the program's strategies to encourage mobility, or may reflect the general trend in the suburbanization of poor families. However, it should be noted that while almost half of voucher recipients lived in suburban areas in 2008, approximately 48% of these voucher recipients lived in low-income suburbs. Of the remaining voucher recipients living in suburban areas, approximately 38% lived in moderate-income suburbs and slightly more than 14% lived in high-income suburbs. Similarly, roughly 29% of voucher recipients lived in suburbs with high job accessibility. ", "Although the Section 8 HCV program has program design features that allow program participants to live in any area of their choice and that encourage program participants to select low-poverty areas, only approximately one in four voucher families live in areas with poverty rates lower than 10%. There are several hypotheses that may help explain why voucher holders do not live in low-poverty areas, which are presented below. While there is at least some evidence to support each of these hypotheses, more research may be useful in order to gain a better understanding of how families make their housing decisions and where and why they move and thus inform the debate about how best to encourage moves to low-poverty neighborhoods. ", "(1) The size of the subsidy may prevent families from moving to low-poverty areas . Although there are program design features that attempt to adjust the amount of housing assistance available to families to reflect local conditions, the program provides a subsidy for units that are generally at or below the area's average rent. Low-income housing advocates have criticized the FMRs for \"steering families with housing vouchers to low rent, more segregated neighborhoods that too often lack good schools and other opportunities.\" Further, ethnographic research has indicated that FMRs may only be high enough to allow families to afford the lowest quality or least desirable units in lower-poverty neighborhoods, units that may not be able to consistently pass physical quality inspections. HUD is currently implementing a study of more localized FMRs, which are meant to better target FMRs such that families may have more choices regarding where they can live with their vouchers. ", "On the other hand, there are millions of units that fall within the price constraints of the program and are located in neighborhoods with poverty rates of less than 10%. That is, a national estimate of the number of units with rents below their area's FMR found that there were approximately 5 million units available in neighborhoods with poverty rates of less than 10% in 2008, but that only 27% of voucher holders lived in these neighborhoods. However, many of these lower-rent units in low poverty neighborhoods may not be available to voucher holders if owners decide not to participate in the program or have a preference for non-subsidized renters. ", "(2) Residential segregation may prevent African-American and Hispanic families from moving to low-poverty neighborhoods, which are frequently predominantly white. Residential segregation may affect the moves of families in two ways: (1) African-American and Hispanic families may feel uncomfortable living in predominantly white, non-Hispanic neighborhoods, and (2) owners may be less likely to rent to African-American and Hispanic families, especially those that participate in the Section 8 HCV program. HUD's most recent study on housing discrimination (published in 2005) found that significant housing discrimination against African-American and Hispanic renters remains. ", "(3) Families may have personal preferences for their selections, and may regard their original neighborhood as having important resources, such as cultural communities, social networks, and support systems . Although negative attributes associated with high-poverty neighborhoods, such as high levels of violence, are well known, ethnographic research portrays a more complicated view of life in high-poverty neighborhoods. Despite their challenges, these neighborhoods may also have rich social networks that provide support and identity. Further, research has shown that services for low-income families are concentrated in high-poverty areas. Therefore, a move to a low-poverty neighborhood can be a move away from family, friends, and important community resources. However, it is difficult to generalize about the preferences of individual families, given that they can vary significantly from family to family. ", "(4) Aspects of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and the way it is administered may facilitate families' choices to stay in areas with concentrated poverty . As noted earlier, families can only use their vouchers to lease units that meet minimum quality standards, have costs within the limits of their subsidies, and for which the landlord is willing to accept the voucher. All of these factors may serve to limit the choices available to low-income families. Additionally, recent ethnographic research observing a subset of families in their housing searches suggests that the rules associated with the use of the Section 8 vouchers, as well as limited information available to families in the search process, may contribute to families selecting units in high-poverty neighborhoods. This research observed that families often did not plan their moves, and instead made moves under distress. For instance, some families moved to new units because their current units would no longer meet the program's housing quality standards and they were afraid that they would lose their voucher. Families making unplanned moves also had difficulty finding high-quality units in high-quality neighborhoods during the search period. Families participating in the research frequently did not have the time and resources (e.g., access to transportation and child care) necessary for the housing search. Instead, families relied upon the lists of landlords accepting Section 8 vouchers provided by the PHAs, and these lists mostly contained units located in high-poverty neighborhoods. Although this limited research is not conclusive, it does suggest that families might make different housing choices if they had more time and support."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Review of Mobility Research", "paragraphs": ["While the hypotheses and research discussed in the previous section of this report consider what choices families make given the options and constraints of the HCV program, another set of studies have considered what happens when families' choices are explicitly constrained for the purpose of promoting poverty deconcentration and racial desegregation.

When that litigation was settled in the mid-1970s, the Chicago Housing Authority and HUD were found to be administering the federal public housing program in a discriminatory manner and were ordered by the courts to pursue desegregation strategies, including providing mobility vouchers to public housing residents. Researchers used this court-ordered desegregation solution as an opportunity to study how moves to mostly-white suburban neighborhoods can affect poor, predominantly minority families that had been living in public housing. Initial findings from Gautreaux indicated that such moves had some positive earnings and educational outcomes for families, although later research called into question the extent of those initial findings. A second, smaller version of Gautreaux was begun in 2002. Results to-date of Gautreaux II have been limited. With the initial Gautreaux findings in mind, Congress authorized HUD in the early 1990s to conduct a similar, but more methodologically robust, study to test the effects of moving poor families living in project-based housing into low-poverty neighborhoods with vouchers. The results from this Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration have not indicated any earnings or children's education impacts, although they have shown some positive adult health and mental health impacts. ", "Additional research on the effects of relocating poor families has come out of the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program, particularly Chicago's Plan for Transformation. While lacking the controls and research design of MTO, observations about the experiences of low-income families displaced by public housing demolition and revitalization have added to the conversation about housing mobility.", "Taken together, the research to-date has not shown convincing evidence that programs designed to move low-income families to neighborhoods with lower concentrations of poverty and lower concentrations of minority households have resulted in families remaining in low-poverty communities. Studies have shown that families given vouchers with mobility goals have struggled to make initial moves to areas that would be considered \"areas of opportunity,\" (i.e., those with very low concentrations of poverty or racial/ethnic minorities). Further, with the exception of the first Gautreaux program, those families that did initially relocate to lower-poverty and more racially integrated neighborhoods, over time and with subsequent moves, often ended up living in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of poverty and less racial integration than the lower-poverty neighborhoods to which they had initially moved. ", "Looking beyond locational outcomes, the studies have not found evidence that mobility moves have had major positive impacts on families' economic and children's educational outcomes. Among those families that stayed in lower-poverty neighborhoods (Gautreaux), initial limited employment and earnings impacts were found and impacts were mixed regarding children's outcomes, although later research has called those findings into question. Some positive impacts were found in MTO around health, housing and neighborhood satisfaction, and perceived safety, but in other areas of interest to policymakers, such as family economic well-being, employment, and children's educational outcomes, positive impacts have not been found.", "These limited findings have raised questions about the extent to which neighborhood matters in influencing the life outcomes of poor families, particularly in terms of economic and children's educational outcomes. However, the issues of low lease-up and of families' subsequent moves in particular have made it difficult to fully assess the impacts of moving to lower-poverty or more racially diverse neighborhoods. It is speculated that these factors may have served to mask positive outcomes that could have been achieved with different program design. Similarly, the fact that many relocating families initially moved to neighborhoods that were only somewhat less disadvantaged than their original neighborhoods may also have weakened the outcomes. This may be particularly relevant when assessing children's educational outcomes, as research has shown that many relocated families stayed within the same school district. Finally, it is important to note that, of this research, only the experimental MTO research is able to fully control for selection bias. Since families were not randomly assigned to participate in any of these studies besides MTO, it is impossible to know if some unobserved family characteristics are actually driving differences in outcomes.

Units with rents that are higher than the maximum subsidy level plus the tenant contribution are unavailable, and in some communities, that may mean units in low-poverty and/or racially integrated communities are unavailable. One option to expand family choice, and potentially promote mobility, would be to increase subsidy levels. However, that comes at increased federal costs for each subsidy. At a time when the federal budget is under intense scrutiny and the program serves only a fraction of those eligible, it may be difficult to advocate for such an increase. Another option would be to eliminate caps on tenant contributions towards rent.

This same research found that families who initially moved to low-poverty neighborhoods but subsequently moved to higher-poverty neighborhoods did so because they had problems with their unit (such as passing quality inspections) or their landlord (such as raising rent). The authors of the research note that families moving to low-poverty neighborhoods with cost-constrained vouchers are likely to live in the lowest cost housing\u2014and hence poorest quality housing\u2014in the community, whereas if they were to live in a higher-poverty community where rents are lower, they may have access to better quality housing.", "Another way to expand tenant choices is to require landlords to accept vouchers. Participation in the voucher program is voluntary for landlords, except in those communities that have adopted so-called \"source of income discrimination\" prohibitions that apply to housing assistance. Requiring landlords to accept vouchers will likely increase success rates and make more units available for voucher holders to choose from.

These concerns, among others, have led to calls for reform of HOPE VI to minimize its displacement effect, and some of those reforms have been integrated into the new Choice Neighborhoods program.
