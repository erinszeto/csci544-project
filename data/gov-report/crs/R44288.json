The United States ratified the UNFCCC in 1992. Accordingly, the United States and the other 195 UNFCCC Parties already have legally binding but qualitative obligations under the treaty. COP21 intends to finalize an agreement under the UNFCCC to address climate change from 2020 on. A major focus is to lay out a path toward stabilizing greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere to avoid a 2o Celsius (3.6oF) increase in global temperature. The expected agreement would replace the Kyoto Protocol, to which the United States is not a Party. The Kyoto Protocol contains obligations for a limited set of the highest income countries to the year 2020.", "This report identifies critical issues regarding (1) the expected Paris Agreement and (2) a Decision that would give effect to the Agreement. The Congressional Research Service (CRS) draws on the draft negotiating texts, publicly available reports, and commentaries to suggest likely outcomes. These are not predictions. While many stakeholders are optimistic that agreement will be reached, the conclusions are far from certain.", "There are many issues under negotiation. The main issues include (with key terms italicized) the following:", "Which provisions will be legally binding, and on which Parties? Will responsibilities be differentiated among Parties with different circumstances and capacities? Will all Parties agree to modify the existing bifurcation into Annex I and developing country Parties? Is resolution possible if the Agreement does not ensure differentiated but efficacious participation of all Parties? Will a durable Agreement, intended to provide a multi-decade framework, include binding processes for all Parties to ensure progression toward the long-term UNFCCC objective? Might greater priority be given to adaptation to climate change, particularly with regard to financing and capacity-building? Will Parties find common ground on Means of Implementation (MOI), including assistance in financing, capacity building, and access to technologies? Will all Parties accept a common transparency framework with international reviews of national performance and consultations to address noncompliance? Would Parties with historically high contributions to current GHG concentrations agree to address loss and damage from climate change, or would Parties that feel most vulnerable to climate change accept an agreement without it? Will an agreement set long-term goals to avoid future temperature increases of 2o Celsius (3.6oF) or lower, or to impose deadlines to achieve decarbonization of economies?", "Legal form and force: A new agreement could be internationally legally binding but not add legally binding obligations for the United States. If it does not, a new agreement may constitute an executive agreement that may not require the advice and consent of the Senate under the Constitution. Some in Congress, however, suggest that an executive agreement could be an \"end run\" or violate the treaty clause of the Constitution.", "Financing: Financing beyond 2020 remains a crucial issue for the Paris deal. Some Parties seek to make financing pledges legally binding; scale up amounts on a timetable; restrict contributors to public funds from developed country Parties, and pay for loss and damage in developing countries. The United States and many current donor countries oppose proposals to pay for loss and damage.", "Worldwide Participation: Very broad participation has already been achieved by the negotiating process. While only a few Annex I Parties of the 1992 UNFCCC took on specific obligations to produce national plans to mitigate their GHG emissions, 174 Parties to the UNFCCC\u2014almost 90%\u2014voluntarily submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) prior to the Paris conference, almost all containing pledges to limit or reduce their GHG emissions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["N ational delegations from more than 190 countries and the European Union will gather in Paris, France, on November 29, 2015, to try to negotiate an agreement to address climate change.

The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has drawn on the draft texts of an agreement and a decision under negotiation, and publicly available reports and views to provide a current sense of what may be likely outcomes. These are not predictions. While many stakeholders are optimistic that an agreement will be reached, the nature of the expected agreement and the provisions within it are far from certain. Several delegations hold strenuously to opposing positions that may not be bridged through negotiations. Particularly contentious are issues regarding whether pledges to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should be quantified and legally binding, whether financial assistance should be quantified and legally binding, and whether any obligations regarding loss and damage should be included in the accord. These issues are substantive and have complicated international climate negotiations for over two decades. The prospects for reaching agreement on them are discussed later in this report.

While further articulation of the purpose of an agreement is expected in the negotiations at the 21 st meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, most Parties understand the work of the COP to be identifying next steps to bring their GHG emission trajectories more closely in line with meeting the Article 2 objective of the UNFCCC.

The Decision may also identify issues not resolved at COP21 that should be decided by the Parties in 2016 and beyond. ", "Most Parties have indicated an intention to negotiate a legally binding Agreement; however, their willingness to include specific provisions that legally bind them to substantive obligations is less clear. For example, the UNFCCC already contains many legally binding obligations for all Parties; however, the United States delegation may oppose an Agreement that would establish new substantive obligations on the United States, such as making the GHG emission reduction in the U.S. INDC legally binding. Likewise, there are a number of Parties currently treated as developing countries (because they are not listed in Annex I of the Convention) that have submitted INDCs conditional on receiving financial assistance to achieve their pledges. These countries oppose any provisions that would make such contributions legally binding under the Agreement without these conditions. Thus, even a legally binding Agreement is likely to include provisions that are exhortatory (\"should\"), not binding (\"shall\"). ", "Very broad participation has already been achieved by the negotiating process. For example, while only a few Annex I Parties of the 1992 UNFCCC took on specific obligations to produce national plans to mitigate their GHG emissions (e.g., under the Kyoto Protocol), already a large majority of Parties to the UNFCCC have submitted INDCs in preparation for the COP21. Many, if not most, Parties may abide by their pledges even if they are not legally enforceable. China's chief negotiator stated on November 19 that \"China will ensure that the INDC targets will be accomplished in whatever circumstances. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will abide by our promises.\" Others, such as Mexico, the European Union, and the United States have already enacted much of their programs into law\u2014though the United States faces uncertainty while the Clean Power Plan, a major regulation to reduce emissions from power plants, is being challenged in litigation. ", "While pledges to provide financial assistance to low-income countries had heretofore been restricted to the highest-income \"developed country\" Parties, the recent negotiations have sparked countries across the economic spectrum to announce their intentions to contribute to global climate finance. For example, China recently announced a pledge to provide $3.1 billion in new financing to developing countries. Further, countries such as Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, Mongolia, and Peru have pledged financial contributions to the Green Climate Fund. Nonetheless, as discussed below, resolving how to embody \"differentiation\" in a new Agreement may be one of the most challenging issues in Paris. (See text box above.)", "The expected Agreement is likely to require all Parties to communicate Nationally Determined Contributions (or Commitments) (NDCs) that include self-differentiated pledges to mitigate their GHG emissions according to guidelines clearly defined by the COP meeting as the Parties to the Agreement (the CMA). Flexibility in the schedule and content of these communications may be extended to countries with the lowest capacity. A requirement to submit communications is not a foregone conclusion, however, as some developing country Parties continue to oppose such an obligation for themselves.", "Many observers expect the Agreement to include some exhortations or requirements for Parties to include progression , or at least not allow \"backsliding,\" on the GHG mitigation in their NDCs. There may be exceptions, particularly for developing countries, in the event of natural disasters or other catastrophes that interrupt their efforts.", "Adaptation is very likely to take a higher profile in the Paris Agreement in comparison to past accords, and possibly will be a required component of NDCs. The most likely adaptation options are processes that enhance cooperation, including sharing of information and building of technical and governance capacities. The final texts may raise the priority of adaptation for available funds. Specification of amounts of financing, or scaling up levels of financing, seems unlikely, as it is likely to be particularly contentious within the overall financing debate (discussed below). ", "The Agreement seems likely, at a minimum, to reiterate existing obligations (under the UNFCCC) for financing, technology cooperation, and capacity-building. It may recall the existing collective pledge to aim to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to assist developing country Parties. Less likely options would set that amount as a floor for the post-2020 period, with other options implying mandatory increases in perpetuity from 2020. ", "Calls for guidelines for (transparent) reporting and review of financing and other means to assist Parties to meet their obligations could make it into a final Agreement. Alternatively, they could be included in the Decision. Parties seeking to strengthen existing guidelines under the Convention to improve transparency of non-Annex I Parties' GHG mitigation policies and performance may need to trade them off with accepting greater transparency for financing. Any new guidelines for financial arrangements are likely, however, to include balance between reporting from donors and recipients.", "An Agreement would likely include review and resubmittal of NDCs through the life of the Agreement to provide durability over time. It is less certain that accord would be reached on a periodicity of every five years. Greater flexibility and assistance would likely be given to the Least Developed Country Parties (LDCs).", "A Global Stocktake would periodically\u2014possibly every five years\u2014review the performance of Parties in aggregate against the objective of the UNFCCC or a long-term goal (e.g., avoiding an increase of global mean temperature of 2 o C or 1.5 o C above the pre-industrial level) if set in the Agreement.

Placeholders to define \"developed country Parties\" and \"developing country Parties\" appear in the Definitions article of the draft as well; whether quantified pledges for GHG emission mitigation and/or financing are legally binding for all Parties, only developed country Parties, or no Parties; whether to further characterize, in the Agreement, the UNFCCC's objective as avoidance of a temperature goal (2 o C, 1.5 o C, or well below either), or to \"decarbonize\" economies, and whether the responsibilities to achieve any long-term goal might be allocated to Parties individually; whether financing heretofore pledged collectively by most of the highest-income Parties, to aim to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020, should be included in the Agreement, quantified, required to continually increase over time, be prescribed by formula, or be limited to \"developed country Parties\" rather than all Parties \"in a position to do so.\" Some propose a major break from the UNFCCC's commitment to support \"agreed incremental costs\" to help developing countries meet their substantive obligations, by adding options to meet all the country-specified needs of all developing countries. Some proposals would alter the terms of pledged financing to require it to come entirely, or in large part, from public funds (i.e., as opposed to private sector or alternative methods of financing); whether a transparency framework would apply only to developed country Parties or to all Parties, based on a criterion (e.g., regarding a Party's capacity), immediately or at a designated time in the future. Some Parties assert that international reviews violate national sovereignty, while others point out that those countries have already acceded to more rigorous reviews (for example, by the International Trade Organization or the International Monetary Fund); whether the Agreement will contain principles or provisions to address \"loss and damage\" beyond the existing processes of the Warsaw Mechanism. Parties that perceive themselves as vulnerable to climate change seek provisions to provide them with funds for \"loss and damage\" that they may suffer even with adaptation efforts. Some Parties may hold out for commitments to providing funds, such as a portion of the Green Climate Fund, and means to relocate populations displaced by climate change. More likely options would explore and support cooperation on risk management and risk transfer (i.e., through insurance); additional challenges including the provision for technology cooperation and transfer; support for sustainable development policies; methods to facilitate compliance; strategies to control international emissions (e.g., from international aviation and shipping); and the role that market-based mechanisms and the private sector would play in Parties meeting their NDCs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenging Issues Less Likely to Impede Agreement", "paragraphs": ["Technology cooperation or transfer: Existing processes to encourage technology development and diffusion are likely to continue, though some Parties have proposed options for developing countries to receive finances for research and development, or intellectual property rights, at no cost. Others oppose such proposals. Facilitating compliance with the Agreement: The Kyoto Protocol included stronger mechanisms to assess and encourage compliance with its binding GHG targets; the Agreement may include provisions that build on those hard-negotiated provisions. The most likely options in the draft include advice and assistance to Parties that need it, or preparations of \"statements of concern,\" to less likely processes that could result in a \"declaration of non-compliance\" to requirements that a Party prepare a \"compliance action plan.\" GHG emissions from international transport: The European Union and others requested reinsertion in the draft a proposal to address GHG emissions from international aviation and shipping. The proposal calls for a process, mandatory or exhortatory, to pursue \"concrete measures\" to limit or reduce these emissions. Currently, Parties are required to inventory and report these emissions, but the emissions were not included in the mitigation targets in the Kyoto Protocol. Rather, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization were tasked with addressing those emissions. Market- and non-market mechanisms: Most of the Annex I Parties seek to permit market-based mechanisms (emissions trading or pricing) as a means to help meet their GHG mitigation pledges. Other Parties oppose market-based mechanisms, but propose non-market approaches, the mechanism for sustainable development mentioned above, or other cooperative approaches.

As noted earlier, China's chief negotiator stated in November 2015 that \"China will, under any circumstances, fulfill its INDC pledge\u2026 Once we make a promise and set a target, we will carry it through no matter what challenges we face.\" Mexico and South Korea have set their programs into law for the most part, as have a number of other emerging economies. ", "The absence of an agreement may not have an effect on other Parties' pledges, as observers have noted that some pledges do not go beyond business-as-usual trajectories. Russia's INDC is consistent with its economy-oriented efforts to improve energy and industrial efficiency and with its growing forests. Some analysts conclude that China may peak its emissions earlier than its target of 2030 because of its efforts to reform the economy; ensure energy security; and reduce pollution, traffic, and water demand. Others suggest a similar situation for India. ", "On the other hand, some Parties, including the United States, have yet to put policies in place that will fully achieve their INDCs. Further, some Parties have indicated that they would condition achieving their INDCs on adequate international financing; the financing they anticipate may not be forthcoming without an Agreement, though an Agreement may not include all the financing they anticipate, either.", "Finances reportedly available to assist low-income Parties were $62 billion in 2014 under the non-binding 2010 Cancun pledge, though not (yet) the $100 billion pledged by 2020. Most of those funds are coming from philanthropic and other private sources, not dependent on public funds. The funds are well below what some say are needed and some Parties are proposing in the Paris negotiations. It is unclear whether reaching a binding agreement\u2014or not\u2014in Paris would substantially affect financial flows over time. Market-based and cooperative mechanisms may emerge in the context of quantified pledges made that further increase available financing.", "One impact, if no binding agreement were reached in Paris, might be on advocates of international accords as a vehicle to promote cooperative climate change policies and of treaties under the United Nations more generally. Disillusionment with the UNFCCC process may increase. This could shift efforts to other venues, including sub-national governments, bilateral agreements, and pressure on private companies. Such shifts may yield faster results, and likely more diverse and fragmented ones. ", "Any assessment that Paris may \"fail\" is significantly premised on the idea that outcomes are driven by the international process, rather than by nations themselves determining their own policies and actions; or that the United Nations negotiations can drive governments to go beyond what domestic impetus and support provide. Numerous analyses, however, have argued that this is not the case. For example, the Kyoto Protocol may have extracted binding commitments from several countries that were beyond what could be achieved in domestic policies and politics. But those commitments were not accompanied in all cases with GHG emission reduction outcomes. ", "A significant component of the arrangements in Paris is inclusion of civil society and non-state entities in the events. Associated events will highlight efforts of indigenous communities, youth, women, local governments, states, and provinces to address their GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. Programs centered on private sector initiatives are also scheduled, and the French government is striving to compile and sustain a focal point for sharing information on their performance.

On the other hand, it is also possible that the new subsidiary agreement would not impose any new legal obligations on the United States, but merely provide for political support or aspirational goals.", "Whether the new subsidiary agreement would require congressional action depends on the nature and content of the agreement. If the agreement were to impose new legal obligations on the United States concerning emission reduction targets, then congressional action would likely be required for that agreement to have legal force in the United States. During Senate deliberations on the UNFCCC in 1992, George H.W. Bush Administration officials testified that, in the view of the Administration, the degree of congressional involvement in U.S. adoption of any future protocols to the UNFCCC would depend on the nature of those agreements. The Administration also declared that any future agreement containing specific GHG emission targets likely would need to take the form of a treaty and be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent to ratification, stating:", "[T]reatment of any given protocol would depend on its subject matter.... If a protocol [containing targets and timetables] were negotiated and adopted, and the United States wished to become a party, we would expect such a protocol to be submitted to the Senate.... We would expect amendments [to the Convention] to be submitted to the Senate [for its advice and consent]. However, should there be an amendment which we did not believe would require Senate advice and consent, we would consult with the Senate prior to such a determination. ", "The George H.W. Bush Administration noted, as an example, that changes to the lists of parties included in Annex I and Annex II of the UNFCCC would likely not be submitted to the Senate: \"Normally the Senate does not approve changes to the parties in the agreement.\" ", "Correspondingly, the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations wrote in its report on the treaty:", "[A] decision by the Conference of the Parties to adopt targets and timetables would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent before the United States could deposit its instruments of ratification for such an agreement. The Committee notes further that a decision by the executive branch to reinterpret the Convention to apply legally binding targets and timetables for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to the United States would alter the \"shared understanding\" of the Convention between the Senate and the executive branch and would therefore require the Senate's advice and consent. ", "Currently, the UNFCCC does not require any specific (i.e., quantified and binding) reductions in GHG emissions. Therefore, it would appear that a new agreement that contains specific targets for GHG emission reduction would impose new obligations on the United States. The understanding of the Senate and the executive branch at the time of U.S. ratification of the UNFCCC, along with U.S. historical practice concerning the entering of major environmental agreements, supports the view that any new legally binding agreement requiring a quantified obligation of the United States to reduce GHG emissions would need to take the form of a treaty, ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. ", "Parties to the UNFCCC could negotiate a subsidiary agreement that may not be legally binding. The United States regularly makes agreements with foreign entities that are not intended to be legally binding, either as a matter of international or domestic law. The executive branch has often entered into these agreements without seeking approval from Congress. While adherence to such arrangements might carry significant moral or political weight with their participants, these non-legal arrangements do not have the effect of modifying participants' existing legal obligations under domestic statutes and international legal agreements. The primary means Congress uses to exercise oversight authority over the making of non-legally binding agreements is through its appropriations power or via other statutory enactments, by which it may limit or condition actions the United States may take in furtherance of the arrangement.
