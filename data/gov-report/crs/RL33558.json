Together with volatile fossil fuel prices and the possibility of greenhouse gas controls, the federal incentives for nuclear power helped spur renewed interest by utilities and other potential reactor developers. License applications for as many as 31 new reactors were announced, and NRC issued licenses for four reactors at two plant sites in early 2012.

Following the Fukushima accident, preconstruction work was suspended on two planned reactors at the South Texas Project. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which owns the Fukushima plant, had planned to invest in the South Texas Project expansion, but TEPCO's financial condition plunged after the accident. New U.S. safety requirements resulting from the Fukushima disaster could raise investor concerns about higher costs. On the other hand, after the accident the Obama Administration reiterated its support for nuclear power expansion as part of its clean energy policy.", "The recent applications for new power reactors in the United States followed a long period of declining nuclear generation growth rates. Until the COLs were issued for the Vogtle and Summer projects, no nuclear power plants had been ordered in the United States since 1978, and more than 100 reactors had been canceled, including all ordered after 1973. The most recent U.S. nuclear unit to be completed was the Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA's) Watts Bar 1 reactor, ordered in 1970 and licensed to operate in 1996. But largely because of better operation and capacity expansion at existing reactors, annual U.S. nuclear generation has risen by about 20% since the startup of Watts Bar 1. The U.S. nuclear power industry currently comprises 100 licensed reactors (excluding the four permanently closed in 2013) at 62 plant sites in 31 states and generates about 19% of the nation's electricity. TVA's board of directors voted August 1, 2007, to resume construction on Watts Bar 2, which had been suspended in 1985; the renewed construction project was to cost about $2.5 billion and be completed in 2013. However, TVA announced on April 5, 2012, that completing Watts Bar 2 would cost up to $2 billion more than expected and take until 2015. At TVA's request, NRC in March 2009 reinstated the construction authorization for the two-unit Bellefonte (AL) nuclear plant, which had been deferred in 1988 and canceled in 2006. The TVA board voted on August 18, 2011, to complete construction of Bellefonte 1 after the Watts Bar 2 project is finished. Completing Bellefonte 1 was projected at that time to cost $4.9 billion, with operation to begin by 2020.

Nuclear plant operators must evaluate the implications of updated seismic and flooding models, including all potential flooding sources. Plant operators must identify and verify the adequacy of flood and seismic protection features at their sites. Station blackout regulatory actions . NRC issued an order on March 12, 2012, that required U.S. reactors to implement mitigation strategies \"that will allow them to cope without their permanent electrical power sources for an indefinite amount of time.\" Under the order, installed equipment at each plant must be sufficient to maintain or restore cooling until portable on-site equipment and supplies could take over. The portable on-site equipment would have to provide sufficient cooling until \"sufficient offsite resources\" could be brought in to maintain cooling indefinitely. Enough equipment and personnel would be required to protect all affected reactors at a multi-unit plant. NRC is currently preparing permanent regulations based on the mitigation strategies order. Reliable hardened vents for Mark I containments . NRC on March 12, 2012, ordered nuclear plants to install \"reliable, hardened\" vents for the containments in Mark I reactors (the type at Fukushima). The vents would be designed to reduce containment pressure before damage occurred to the reactor core. NRC modified the order in June 2013 to require that the vents continue to function after core damage occurred, which could prevent hydrogen generated by overheated fuel cladding from leaking into the reactor building, as occurred at Fukushima. Because venting after core damage has occurred could release radioactive core material into the environment, NRC is also considering a requirement that vents include filters or that other strategies be implemented to reduce such emissions.

In addition, NRC set a benchmark that reactor containments should be successful at least 90% of the time in preventing major radioactive releases during a core-damage accident. Therefore, the benchmark probability of a major release from containment failure during a core melt accident would average less than one in 100,000 per reactor per year. (For the current U.S. fleet of about 100 reactors, that rate would yield an average of one core-damage accident every 100 years and a major release every 1,000 years.)

To pay any such damages, each licensed reactor with at least 100 megawatts of electric generating capacity must carry the maximum liability insurance reasonably available, which was raised from $300 million to $375 million on January 1, 2010. Any damages exceeding $375 million are to be assessed equally against all 100-megawatt-and-above power reactors, up to $121.3 million per reactor (increased for inflation from $111.9 million on September 10, 2013). Those assessments\u2014called \"retrospective premiums\"\u2014would be paid at an annual rate of no more than $19.0 million per reactor (up from $17.5 million), to limit the potential financial burden on reactor owners following a major accident. According to NRC, 104 commercial reactors, including the four closed in 2013, are currently covered by the Price-Anderson retrospective premium requirement.", "For each nuclear incident, the Price-Anderson liability system currently would provide up to $13.6 billion in public compensation.

On top of those payments, a 5% surcharge may also be imposed, raising the total per-reactor retrospective premium to $127.4 million and the total available compensation to about $13.6 billion. Under Price-Anderson, the nuclear industry's liability for an incident is capped at that amount, which varies over time depending on the number of covered reactors, the amount of available insurance, and the inflation adjustment. Payment of any damages above that liability limit would require congressional approval under special procedures in the act.", "EPACT05 increased the limit on per-reactor annual payments to $15 million from the previous $10 million, and required the annual limit to be adjusted for inflation every five years. As under previous law, the total retrospective premium limit is adjusted every five years as well. For the purposes of those payment limits, a nuclear plant consisting of multiple small reactors (100-300 megawatts, up to a total of 1,300 megawatts) would be considered a single reactor. Therefore, in the event of a severe release a power plant with six 120-megawatt small modular reactors would be liable for retrospective premiums of up to $121.3 million, rather than $727.8 million (excluding the 5% surcharge).", "The Price-Anderson Act also covers contractors who operate DOE nuclear facilities. EPACT05 set the liability limit on DOE contractors at $10 billion per accident, to be adjusted for inflation every five years. The first adjustment under EPACT, raising the liability limit to $11.961 billion, took effect October 14, 2009. The liability limit for DOE contractors previously had been the same as for commercial reactors, excluding the 5% surcharge, except when the limit for commercial reactors dropped because of a decline in the number of covered reactors. Price-Anderson authorizes DOE to indemnify its contractors for the entire amount of their liability, so that damage payments for nuclear incidents at DOE facilities would ultimately come from the Treasury.

As stated by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in its major study The Future of Nuclear Power : \"Our position is that the prospect of global climate change from greenhouse gas emissions and the adverse consequences that flow from these emissions is the principal justification for government support of the nuclear energy option.\" The Obama Administration is including nuclear power as part of its clean energy strategy.", "However, some environmental groups have contended that nuclear power's potential greenhouse gas benefits are modest and must be weighed against the technology's safety risks, its potential for nuclear weapons proliferation, and the hazards of radioactive waste. They also contend that energy efficiency and renewable energy would be far more productive investments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.", "Proposals to reduce carbon dioxide emissions\u2014through taxation, a cap-and-trade system, or other regulatory controls\u2014could significantly increase the cost of generating electricity with fossil fuels and improve the competitive position of nuclear power. A federal Clean Energy Standard that includes nuclear power, as proposed in President Obama's January 2011 State of the Union Address, could provide a similar boost to nuclear energy expansion. Utilities that have applied for nuclear power plant licenses have often cited the possibility of federal greenhouse gas controls or other mandates as one of the reasons for pursuing new reactors.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule on June 18, 2014, to address CO 2 emissions from existing power plants. The potential effect of the proposed rule on nuclear power has become a significant policy question. The formula in the proposed rule for setting state CO 2 goals explicitly accounts for some existing nuclear capacity and reactors under construction, providing a potential incentive for states to try to keep those plants operating. However, EPA's proposed rule allows states to develop their own plans for meeting the CO 2 emission rate goals, making it difficult to predict how nuclear energy might ultimately fare.", "The proposed EPA standards would set state-specific goals for the amount of CO 2 that could be emitted in 2030 for each megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated. EPA projects that, under those proposed emissions rates, U.S. power plants would produce 30% less CO 2 by 2030 than they did in 2005 (the base year in President Obama's Climate Action Plan ).", "The unadjusted baseline for the proposed standards was developed by dividing 2012 power plant CO 2 emissions in each state by the amount of electricity generated by fossil fuel-fired plants. In the case of Ohio, which EPA provided as an example, the unadjusted CO 2 emission rate for fossil plants in 2012 was 1,897 lbs./MWh (compared with the average rate for coal-fired plants of about 2,000 lbs./MWh). To develop the 2030 standard, EPA adjusted each state's baseline rate with four groups of actions, or \"building blocks,\" that the agency determined states could reasonably achieve:", "1. Increase efficiency of existing coal-fired steam units by 6%; 2. Replace some coal-fired generation with increased output from underutilized natural gas combined-cycle units; 3. Prevent projected losses of 6% of each state's existing nuclear generating capacity, complete five nuclear reactors currently under construction, and increase generation from renewable energy; and 4. Implement energy efficiency measures to reduce projected electricity demand. ", "The nuclear adjustment was made by calculating the projected annual electricity generation from reactors under construction within each state (if any), along with the electricity generated by 6% of each state's existing nuclear capacity, which EPA deems to be at risk of shutdown. These amounts are added to each state's total fossil fuel-fired electrical generation, resulting in a decrease in the CO 2 generation rate per megawatt-hour.", "In the Ohio example, the state has no reactors under construction but has two operating nuclear reactors, with total generating capacity of 2,150 megawatts. Six percent of that capacity is projected to generate 993,077 MWh per year, which EPA added to total generation from fossil fuel sources, renewable energy sources, and electricity generation avoided through efficiency measures, as described in the \"building blocks.\" The increase in total electric generation spreads CO 2 emissions among more megawatt-hours, so the rate of CO 2 /MWh goes down. The nuclear additions plus the other changes described above result in a proposed 2030 standard for Ohio of 1,338 lbs. of CO 2 per MWh\u2014a 29.5% reduction from the unadjusted baseline.", "Although the state standards for CO 2 emission rates would be binding, each state could meet them using whatever mix of options it chose. A state would not have to employ the same \"building blocks\" in its compliance plans that EPA used to calculate the standards. According to an EPA explanation , each state \"is free to meet that goal in the way that works best for that state. It can rely more or less heavily on specific measures such as efficiency or renewable energy, or even pursue others such as increases in transmission efficiency or new gas generation.\" Additional nuclear reactors beyond the five already under construction would also be an option.", "Because of the state flexibility, the effect of the EPA proposal on nuclear power is inherently uncertain. EPA's emission rate methodology might encourage states to take steps to ensure that nuclear plants currently under construction were completed, and to prevent the shutdown of existing nuclear capacity, because if they did not, they would need to find alternative ways to meet the CO 2 emission rate standard. For example, if Ohio's two nuclear plants closed, the state would lose 993,077 MWh of zero-carbon electricity in its CO 2 rate formula and would need to increase other low-carbon electricity sources or take other steps beyond those already in the EPA building blocks.", "The Nuclear Energy Institute, representing the nuclear industry, issued a statement praising the EPA proposal for recognizing \"the need to maintain and expand the use of nuclear energy.\" However, nuclear industry officials have expressed unhappiness that the nuclear \"building block\" includes only the 6% of existing nuclear capacity considered to be \"at risk,\" rather than all existing nuclear capacity. According to a media report , the industry is concerned that including only 6% of existing nuclear in the state goal calculations would not provide states with enough incentive to prevent nuclear plants from being shut down and replaced by cheaper gas plants. In the Ohio example, only 993,077 MWh of carbon-free generation would have to be replaced with other options if both the state's reactors were shut down, under the EPA proposal. But if all the state's nuclear electricity were included in the nuclear building block, then 16.95 million MWh (about 9% of the state's total 2012 generation) would have to be replaced if the Ohio reactors shut down (2,150 megawatts operating at 90% of capacity for a year).", "On the other hand, a news release by the Nuclear Information and Resource Service, a group critical of the nuclear industry, contended that EPA's proposed rule \"would encourage states to provide ratepayer subsidies for continued operation of nuclear reactors that cannot compete economically in the current electricity marketplace.\"", "For more details, see CRS Report R43652, State CO2 Emission Rate Goals in EPA's Proposed Rule for Existing Power Plants ."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Nuclear Power Research and Development", "paragraphs": ["The Obama Administration's FY2015 funding request for nuclear energy research and development totaled $863.4 million.
