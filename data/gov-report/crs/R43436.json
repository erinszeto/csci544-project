Title II of the DMCA, titled the \"Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act,\" added a new Section 512 to the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the U.S. Code) in order to limit the liability of providers of Internet access and online services that may arise due to their users posting or sharing materials that infringe copyrights. Congress was concerned that without insulating Internet intermediaries from crippling financial liability for copyright infringement, investment in the growth of the Internet could be stifled and innovation could be harmed.", "The \u00a7 512 \"safe harbor\" immunity is available only to a party that qualifies as a \"service provider\" as defined by the DMCA, and only after the provider complies with certain eligibility requirements. The DMCA's safe harbors greatly limit service providers' liability based on the specific functions they could perform: (1) transitory digital network communications, (2) system caching, (3) storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users, and (4) information location tools. In exchange for the shelter from most forms of liability, the DMCA requires service providers to cooperate with copyright owners to address infringing activities conducted by the providers' customers. The safe harbor thus reflects a \"grand bargain\" between creative content-producing industries and Internet companies that seeks to both promote investment in the Internet and protect copyright holders' intellectual property rights.", "The DMCA expressly states that a service provider is not required to actively monitor its service for infringing activity. However, \u00a7 512 requires a service provider, upon proper notification by the copyright owner of online material being displayed or transmitted without authorization, to \"expeditiously\" remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material. In addition, a service provider must remove or disable access to material upon acquiring actual knowledge that materials or activities on its system or network are infringing (for example, actual knowledge can be obtained by the copyright holder's notification) or when the service provider becomes aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent (so-called \"red flag\" knowledge). Service providers that meet the eligibility conditions of the \u00a7 512 safe harbor are thus shielded from liability for unknowingly hosting content that infringes copyrights, whereas \u00a7 512 provides copyright holders a simple and cost-effective procedural mechanism for remedying online infringement of their intellectual property rights. Courts have found that the burden of actively monitoring online copyright infringement lies on copyright holders.", "This report focuses primarily on the third safe harbor functional category, \"storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users,\" which includes any website that stores digital content that users have uploaded for public consumption or for sharing purposes, such as popular social media and online services YouTube, Facebook, Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Blogger. The report will describe and analyze the statutory language establishing the safe harbor as well as discuss federal court cases that have considered the scope and application of the DMCA safe harbors and the extent to which online service providers can be held indirectly liable for copyright infringement committed by their users."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Online service providers (OSPs) and Internet service providers (ISPs) provide critical infrastructure support to the Internet, allowing millions of people to access online content and electronically communicate and interact with each other. The potential for computer users to infringe intellectual property rights using the Internet, specifically copyrights, could expose \"intermediary\" service providers to claims of secondary liability, such as contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. Concerned about this significant legal vulnerability of service providers, Congress passed the \"Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act,\" Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998, in an effort to adapt copyright law to an evolving digital environment. The act added a new Section 512 to the Copyright Act (Title 17 of the U.S. Code), which provides limitations on the liability of OSPs and ISPs against claims of copyright infringement arising from their users' activities on their digital networks. ", "The act's legislative history indicates that Congress wanted to provide service providers with \"more certainty ... in order to attract the substantial investments necessary to continue the expansion and upgrading of the Internet.\" At the same time, Congress desired to preserve \"strong incentives for service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect and deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital networked environment.\" The DMCA therefore includes several conditions that the service provider must satisfy in order to qualify for \u00a7 512 \"safe harbor\" protection from most infringement liability, and requires that the service providers' activities be encompassed within one of four specified categories of conduct. The safe harbors correspond to the following four functional operations that might otherwise constitute copyright infringement: (1) transitory digital network communications, (2) system caching, (3) storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users, and (4) information location tools. ", "One federal district court assessed the \"dual purpose and balance\" of \u00a7 512 in the following manner:", "Congress created tradeoffs within the DMCA: service providers would receive liability protections in exchange for assisting copyright owners in identifying and dealing with infringers who misuse the service providers' systems. At the same time, copyright owners would forgo pursuing service providers for the copyright infringement of their users, in exchange for assistance in identifying and acting against those infringers.", "A public interest group has praised the importance of the DMCA's safe harbor provisions to the development of the Internet:", "Without these protections, the risk of potential copyright liability would prevent many online intermediaries from providing services such as hosting and transmitting user-generated content. Thus the safe harbors have been essential to the growth of the Internet as an engine for innovation and free expression.", "Although all four safe harbors will be described at the beginning of this report, the primary focus for the rest of the report will be on the third category that encompasses the function of many popular Internet businesses today: \"storage of information on systems or networks at direction of users.\" This safe harbor is essential to the business model of most ISPs and OSPs that permit user generated content (UGC) to be stored or shared using their networks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Copyright is a federal grant of legal protection available to the creator or owner of certain original works of creative expression, including books, movies, photography, art, and music.

Unauthorized use of a copyrighted work by a third party in a manner that implicates one of the copyright holder's exclusive rights constitutes infringement. The copyright holder may file a lawsuit in federal court against an alleged infringer for a violation of any of the exclusive rights conferred by copyright. The Copyright Act provides several civil remedies to the copyright holder that is harmed by infringement, including the possibility of obtaining injunctive relief, actual damages suffered by the copyright owner due to the infringement, statutory damages, and costs and attorney fees.", "The rights conferred by a copyright do not last forever. Copyrights are limited in the number of years a copyright holder may exercise his/her exclusive rights. In general, an author of a creative work may enjoy copyright protection for the work for a term lasting the entirety of his/her life plus 70 additional years.

The concept of secondary infringement has its roots in tort law and the notion that one should be held accountable for directly contributing to another's infringement. The federal courts have recognized secondary infringement liability in copyright and trademark law, while the Patent Act contains provisions that expressly authorize it. Because online service providers often solely provide the means for their users to upload and distribute content, rather than providing the content themselves, service providers are more likely to be charged with secondary infringement liability rather than sued for direct infringement.", "In copyright law, there are three common theories of indirect infringement liability: contributory, vicarious, and inducement liability. For contributory copyright infringement liability to exist, a court must find that the secondary infringer \"with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another.\" \"Vicarious\" infringement liability in copyright law is possible where a defendant \"has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities.\" In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court expressly adopted a relatively new theory of secondary infringement in copyright cases referred to as \"inducement liability.\" In Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. , the Court articulated the standard for inducement liability:", "[O]ne who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties. ...

In most cases, the UGC is protected by copyright (whether owned by the user or a third party), although online posting or sharing of the material may be authorized by the copyright holder (for promotional purposes, for example), the copyright holder may not object to the posting, or the particular unauthorized activity could nevertheless qualify for a liability defense such as \"fair use.\" ", "A commonly used UGC technology is the \"cyberlocker\" or \"file hosting service,\" which provides online storage in the Internet \"cloud\" for users' digital files.

SEB S.A., the Supreme Court described a two-part test for the willful blindness doctrine:", "1. The defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists. 2. The defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.", "The Court believed that these two requirements of the willful blindness doctrine provide \"an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.\" The differences between these three standards, according to the Court, are as follows:", "\"[A] willfully blind defendant is one who takes deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing and who can almost be said to have actually known the critical facts.\" \"[A] reckless defendant is one who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing.\" \"[A] negligent defendant is one who should have known of a similar risk but, in fact, did not.\"", "The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc. was the first appellate court to consider the application of the common law willful blindness doctrine in the DMCA context. The court acknowledged that the DMCA does not expressly mention willful blindness. Nevertheless, the court held that the doctrine could apply in certain circumstances \"to demonstrate knowledge or awareness of specific instances of infringements under the DMCA,\" for example, if a service provider makes deliberate efforts to avoid obtaining knowledge of specific infringing activity. ", "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC also agreed with the Viacom appellate court that \"a service provider cannot willfully bury its head in the sand to avoid obtaining such specific knowledge.\" However, in the case at hand, the court found \"no evidence that Veoh acted in such a manner,\" but instead noted that \"Veoh promptly removed infringing material when it became aware of specific instances of infringement.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Right and Ability to Control\" Infringing Activity", "paragraphs": ["Section 512(c)(1)(B) specifies that for a service provider to be eligible for the safe harbor applicable to online storage functions, the provider must not receive a \"financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity\" that it has the \"right and ability to control.\" The federal courts have held that the ability of a service provider to remove or block access to materials posted on its website or stored on its network is not enough to prove that the service provider had the \"right and ability to control\" the infringing activity. Instead, the courts have required evidence of \"something more\" than the service provider's technical ability to remove or block infringing materials, which demonstrates the service provider's ability to exert \"substantial influence on the activities of users.\" For example, the federal district court in Perfect 10, Inc. v. Cybernet Ventures, Inc. found the requisite control where the service provider had established a monitoring program by which its webmasters received \"detailed instructions regard[ing] issues of layout, appearance, and content.\" The service provider also forbade certain types of content and refused access to users who failed to comply with its instructions. In addition, the appellate court in Viacom International, Inc. v. YouTube, Inc. suggested that \"inducement of copyright infringement under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte expressed concern about what he referred to as a \"whack-a-mole game by copyright owners\" who have to deal with repeated unauthorized postings of their content. He explained the issue as follows:", "By most accounts, good faith service providers have acted expeditiously in responding to Section 512 notices by removing or disabling links to infringing content.", "However, copyright owners are increasingly facing a scenario that simply wasn't anticipated during the enactment of 512 \u2013 the need of copyright owners to send a voluminous amount of notices seeking removal of infringing content followed by the almost immediate reappearance of the same infringing content.", "At the hearing, content owners argued that \u00a7 512, as currently written and interpreted by the courts, places too much burden on copyright owners to police infringing activity online, whereas service providers urged Congress to keep the current DMCA framework unchanged and instead rely upon voluntary industry agreements and private industry solutions (such as content filtering systems) to address any infringement problems.
