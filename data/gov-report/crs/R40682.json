In Afghanistan, 30,000 more troops are deploying this year while in Iraq, troops will gradually decline to 35,000 to 50,000 by August 31, 2011 with all troops to be out of Iraq by December 31, 2011. The most commonly cited measure of troop strength is \"Boots on the Ground\" or the number of troops located in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Based on average monthly Boots on the Ground figures, the number of troops in Afghanistan and Iraq increased from 5,200 in FY2002 to a peak of 187,900 in FY2008 primarily because of increases in Iraq beginning with the invasion in March 2003. In FY2009, total troop strength is expected to remain the same as planned increases in Afghanistan offset declines in Iraq. By FY2012, overall troop strength for the two wars is likely to decline to 67,500 when the withdrawal from Iraq is expected to be complete.", "For Afghanistan, troops in-country grew gradually from 5,200 in FY2002 to 20,400 in FY2006. Between FY2006 and FY2008, average strength there jumped by another 10,000 to 30,100. Under the Administration's plans, CRS estimates that average monthly Boots on the Ground in Afghanistan may increase to 50,700 in FY2009 with a further increase to 63,500 the following year once all new units are in place. Currently, additional increases have not been approved.", "For Iraq, troops in-country nearly doubled between FY2003 and FY2004 reaching 130,600. By the following year, average strength grew by another 13,000 to 143,800, with that level maintained in FY2006. During the surge in troops initiated by President Bush, average troop strength in Iraq grew by 7,000 or 6% in FY2007 and another 9,500 or 9% in FY2008, reaching a peak of 157,800. CRS estimates that average troop strength in Iraq will decline to 135,600 in FY2009, 88,300 in FY2010, 42,800 in FY2011, and 4,100 in FY2012. While it is not clear whether war costs will change precisely in tandem with troop levels, these changes can provide a benchmark to assess requests. Based on changes in troop levels and other adjustments, CRS estimates that war costs could be about $8 billion less than the Department of Defense (DOD) $141 billion request for FY2009, and about $13 billion below its $130 billion request for FY2010. For the next year, FY2011, CRS estimates that DOD's requests could be $42 billion more than the current planning figure of $50 billion. And in FY2012, CRS estimates war costs could be $20 billion higher than the Administration's estimate of $50 billion.", "Although Boots on the Ground is the most commonly cited measure of troop strength, that measure does not include over 100,000 other troops deployed in the region providing theater-wide support for Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), the Afghan War, and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the Iraq War. Before the 9/11 attacks, the United States had deployed about 26,000 troops in the Central Command region, which includes Afghanistan and Iraq. Based on the most comprehensive DOD measure of troop strength, 294,000 troops were deployed for OEF and OIF as of December 2008, a tenfold increase since 2001.This more inclusive measure may more accurately capture the overall demand for troops. The Administration has not indicated how its plans would affect troops providing support in the region.

According to the President, these additional troops are intended to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.\" In the winter of 2008 before leaving office, President Bush approved deploying an additional Brigade Combat Team (BCT) of about 9,000 to Afghanistan in January 2009. Still pending is a DOD request for an additional 9,000 troops that could be deployed in Afghanistan sometime in the winter of 2009. ", "Last October, General David McKiernan requested about 35,000 more combat troops for Afghanistan composed of four Brigade Combat Teams with support. Later, 4,000 trainers were added, bringing the total request to 39,000. About 30,000 of that request has been approved by either former President Bush or President Obama. With these increases, CRS estimates the number of U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan is expected to reach about 63,450 by the end of FY2009, double that of the prior year; this estimate is somewhat lower than the Administration's estimate of 68,000.", "If some 31,000 coalition troops from NATO nations serving in the International Security Assistance Force are included, average monthly foreign troop strength in Afghanistan would be about 81,000 in FY2009, and 93,450 in FY2010. These figures do not include from 10,000 to 17,000 more U.S. troops dedicated to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), most of whom provide support in the region.

In addition, the policy would meet the deadlines set in the January 1, 2009 Security Agreement with Iraq that requires all U.S. combat troops to move outside of cities by the end of June 2009, as recently took place, and that all U.S. troops leave Iraq by December 31, 2011.", "The Administration has not explained the effect of these withdrawals on other troops deployed for OIF, or the Iraq War, which includes not only U.S. troops located in Iraq but also some 80,000 to 90,000 troops providing theater-wide support in neighboring areas. CRS uses OIF and the Iraq War interchangeably in this report. ", "The President reportedly considered options ranging from the 16-month withdrawal proposed during the campaign to a 23-month alternative reportedly favored by some in the military. Ultimately, the President adopted a 19-month plan.", "DOD spokesmen have suggested that increasing troop levels in Afghanistan depends, at least in part, on decreasing troop levels in Iraq if the services are to continue current 12-month tours. During the surge in troops in 2007 and 2009, tours grew to 15 months, a move that proved very unpopular.", "These two decisions about troop levels are reflected in the FY2009 Supplemental request sent to Congress in early April and the FY2010 war request submitted in early May 2009 with the regular budget. The FY2009 Supplemental covers DOD's war costs for the rest of this fiscal year that ends September 30, 2009 because DOD received only part of its war funding in the FY2009 bridge fund enacted last summer. According to statute, the Administration is to include a full year of war costs with the regular budget in FY2010, and provide separate budget displays for each war, and troop strength levels as well as the underlying assumptions. DOD provided general information about troop levels but not the underlying assumptions or separate budget displays for each operation in its FY2010 request.", "The Administration's decisions to reduce the number of troops in Iraq reflects declining levels of violence and peacefully conducted provincial elections that took place in January 31, 2009, while its decision to increase troop levels in Afghanistan reflects rising levels of violence and elections slated for August of 2009. Another important element in decisions about troop levels is the effectiveness of Afghan and Iraqi security forces, where the U.S. has invested $38.9 billion thus far to train and equip these forces.

Most troops were located in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and on ships in the region, including some conducting over flight operations for Northern and Southern Watch to contain Saddam Hussein after the first Gulf War.", "Based on the most comprehensive measure of troop strength, DOD's Defense Manpower Data Center's Location Report , capturing all troops deployed for both wars, there were 294,000 U.S. troops in the region for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom in December 2008, more than ten times the level seven years ago (see Figure 1 and Box 1 ). Figure 1 shows the number and location of these U.S. troops in December 2008, with an allocation between OEF or OIF based on where personnel are located that generally reflects guidelines developed by the Joint Staff, Joint Chiefs of Staff and Central Command. These allocations may or may not match distributions of war costs, which are collected separately by each service.", "This figure of 294,000 troops is over 100,000 higher than the December 2008 total of 181,000 reported in DOD's oft-cited Boots on the Ground,\" (BOG) report. Military leaders, DOD press spokesmen and Members of Congress use the monthly BOG figures to give a snapshot of the number of troops deployed in-country in Afghanistan and in Iraq. For example, Admiral Mullen, Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there were 150,000 troops in Iraq \"right now\" on November 17, 2008, and Pentagon press secretary, Geoff Morrell said in January 2009 that the proposal to add 30,000 troops in Afghanistan would double the number there. ", "DOD has reported these Boots on the Ground figures to Congress each month since 2008. As of the most recent data for April 1, 2009, DOD reported that there were 178,400 Boots on the Ground in Afghanistan and Iraq, slightly lower than in December 2008 reflecting the withdrawal of some troops from Iraq offset by the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan.", "Part of the difference between DOD's Boots-on-the-Ground figures and the Location Report is definitional. Boots on the Ground reports only personnel in Afghanistan or in Iraq while the Location Report counts deployments of all military personnel tracked as part of OEF and OIF, including primarily personnel providing support in neighboring countries, as well as about 2,000 OEF personnel engaged in counter-terror operations in the Philippines. Relying primarily on guidelines developed by staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Central Command, CRS allocated troops to each operation based on their location (see Figure 1 and Box 1 ).

At one end of the spectrum, Boots on the Ground figures reflect once-a-month headcounts collected from the services by the Joint Staff that include only troops located in-country in Afghanistan and Iraq. At the other end of the spectrum, the Defense Manpower Data Center data captures all deployments during each month for those in the 28 countries, plus Navy members aboard ships in the region who are deemed part of OEF and OIF.

CBO does not provide explanations or rationale for its projections. Although CBO does not calculate a per person or per BCT-equivalent cost, it appears that a 9,000 troop BCT would initially save about $7 billion a year under the more rapid scenario, rising to $9.6 billion per BCT during a steady-state. In the more gradual drawdown, annual savings per BCT would grow from $7 billion to about $8.4 billion once a steady-state is reached. ", "Based on DOD's reported obligations, CRS estimates that withdrawing an average BCT in Iraq would save about $7.2 billion and one in Afghanistan about $8.2 billion. CBO's figures may be higher because State/USAID and VA Medical costs may be included as well as DOD costs.

In only three cases do the Joint Staff and Central Command allocations differ, affecting about 770 military personnel; in these cases, CRS selected the operation most closely associated with that country. In some cases, countries have assigned missions but no personnel are shown as deployed.", "The Joint Staff guidelines were developed to meet a new congressional reporting requirement to submit monthly \"the total number of troops deployed in support of OIF and OEF, . . . delineated by service and component (active, Reserve or National Guard).\" Although the services largely agreed with the country designations, there were some differences, and\u00a0some concerns were raised that\u00a0linking personnel and operations would not capture cases where military personnel at one location worked on both OEF and OIF (e.g. Qatar) or where the focus\u00a0shifted over time (e.g., Navy Afloat personnel).", "According to these allocations, the OEF mission includes primarily troops deployed in Afghanistan and about 5,000 to 15,000 troops in other countries. ", "The OEF operation includes military personnel deployed in the following countries: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Seychelles, Sudan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Egypt, and Yemen.", "For the OIF operation, while most troops are in Iraq, another 30,000 to 40,000 are deployed in Kuwait, about 15,000 other troops in Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, plus an additional 15,000 to 20,000 on ships afloat in the region. ", "The OIF mission includes: Iraq, At Sea, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oil platforms, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, and UAE, Israel, Jordan.", " Table D -1 and Table D -2 show monthly troop levels for the Joint Staff's Boots on the Ground in Afghanistan and Iraq and for OEF and OIF as reported in Central Command's Operations Reports to compare the number of military personnel located in-country and a total that also includes those providing theater-wide support, or conducting other counter-terror operations related to OEF.
