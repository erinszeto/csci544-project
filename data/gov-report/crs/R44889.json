Reclamation was founded in 1902 to aid in the settlement of the arid American West. Today, Reclamation manages hundreds of dams and diversion projects, including more than 300 storage reservoirs in the 17 western states. These projects provide water to approximately 10 million acres of farmland and 31\u00a0million people. Reclamation is the largest wholesale supplier of water in the West and the second-largest hydroelectric power producer in the nation. Reclamation facilities also provide substantial flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. Operations of Reclamation facilities often are controversial, particularly for their effects on fish and wildlife species and because of conflicts among competing water users.", "The multipurpose federal Central Valley Project (CVP) in California is one of Reclamation's largest water-conveyance systems (see Figure 1 ). The CVP extends from the Cascade Range in Northern California to the Kern River in Southern California. In an average year, it delivers approximately 5 million acre-feet of water to farms (including some of the nation's most valuable farmland); 600,000 acre-feet to municipal and industrial users; 410,000 acre-feet to wildlife refuges; and 800,000 acre-feet for other fish and wildlife needs, among other purposes. The project is made up of 20 dams and reservoirs, 11 power plants, and 500 miles of canals, as well as conduits, tunnels, and other storage and distribution facilities. A separate major project operated by the state of California, the State Water Project (SWP), delivers about 70% of its water to urban users (including water for approximately 25 million users in the South Bay [San Francisco Bay], Central Valley, and Southern California); the remaining 30% is used for irrigation. Two federal and state pumping facilities in the southern portion of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers' Delta (Delta) near Tracy, CA, are a hub for water deliveries from both systems. Further complicating water deliveries of the CVP and SWP is a complex system of state water rights, in which some water deliveries are prioritized based on prior agreements with water rights holders that predate the CVP (e.g., Sacramento River Settlement Contractors and San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors).", "In recent years, parts of the West have been subject to prolonged drought conditions, including a severe drought in California that lasted from 2012 to 2016. Rain and snowstorms in Northern and Central California in the winter of 2016-2017 improved water supply conditions in the state in 2017. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, as of July 2017, about 1% of the state was classified as suffering from severe drought conditions and more than 75% of the state was drought-free. This figure represents a drastic improvement from July 2016, when 59% of the state was in severe drought conditions, and July 2015, when 94% of the state fell under this designation.", "Although by most metrics the drought in California has ended, debate regarding the possible detrimental effects of certain federal water supply-related authorities, as well as the federal role in water resources development more broadly, continues. Although some argue that a rollback of existing environmental protections should be only a temporary measure taken during times of drought (if at all), others contend that the drought in California magnified an issue that needs to be addressed, regardless of hydrological conditions. They also note that the need for expedited construction of new surface water storage exists throughout the West.", "Central to addressing water shortages in California from the federal and state perspective is the coordinated operation of the CVP and the SWP. Whereas the CVP serves mostly agricultural water contractors, the SWP serves largely urban or municipal and industrial contractors; however, both projects serve some contractors of both varieties. The operation of the SWP has been of interest to Congress because there is a federal nexus with respect to the CVP. In considering CVP-related questions, a key point of debate has been the extent to which recent delivery cutbacks have been due to drought, compared to other factors (i.e., environmental restrictions related to state water quality criteria and endangered species, among other things). Recent deliveries to CVP and SWP contractors are shown below in Figure 2 .", "Dating to the 112 th Congress, several bills were proposed to address drought in California (including operations of the CVP) and elsewhere.

Section 102 would amend the act's definition of anadromous fish to limit coverage to those fish found in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers as of October 30, 1992.

The 1956 act provides for contracts to have a provision allowing conversion of water service contracts (9(e) contracts) to repayment contracts (9(d) contracts). It also provides that contractors who have repaid obligations shall have a \"first right\" to a stated share of project water for irrigation \"(to which the rights of the holders of any other type of irrigation water contract shall be subordinate) ... and a permanent right to such share or quantity,\" subject to state water rights laws and provided \"that the right to the use of water acquired under the provisions of this Act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigated and beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.\" Such a change would appear to give water service contractors long-term certainty over water supplies from the CVP. Finally, this section also would repeal certain authorities for fish and wildlife restoration charges that were authorized under Section 3404 of CVPIA and would direct that parties be charged only for water actually delivered. Currently, some contractors pay for water based on acreage irrigated under contracts with Reclamation, and they must pay for contracted water regardless of whether water is delivered to the entire area (in drought years, this provision can be particularly onerous)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 104: Facilitated/Expedited Water Transfers", "paragraphs": ["Several provisions of Section 104 deal with water transfers.

Further, it would add a new section that would prohibit environmental mitigation requirements as a condition to any transfer. Section 104 also would add a new subsection to Section 3405 of CVPIA, which would clarify that water transfers that could have been made before enactment of CVPIA may go forward without being subject to that act's requirements for water transfers. In addition, Section 104 would add language to specify that water use related to the CVP must be measured by contracting district facilities only up to the point where surface water is commingled with other water supplies.

First, Section 105 would remove the existing mandate that the Secretary of the Interior modify CVP operations to provide flows to protect fish, making this action optional rather than required and stipulating the new term \"reasonable water flows\" to provide further guidance for this authority. Section 105 would direct that any such flows provided on an optional basis be derived from the 800,000 acre-feet of water for fish and wildlife purposes under Section 3406(b)(2) of the CVPIA (also known as (b)(2) water). Thus, flows in excess of this amount for fish and wildlife purposes would appear not to be authorized under this legislation. The 800,000 acre-feet for fish and wildlife purposes would be a ceiling rather than a floor under this provision. Section 105 also would remove the requirement that the Secretary of the Interior consult with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife regarding modification of CVP operations for fish and wildlife and instead would require consultation with the U.S. Geological Survey.", "Section 105 of H.R. 23 also would allow (b)(2) flows to be used for purposes other than fish protection. Under this section, fish and wildlife purposes would no longer be the \"primary\" purpose of such flows. It also would adjust accounting for (b)(2) water by directing that all water used under that section be credited based on a methodology described in the legislation. It appears that state water quality requirements, the Endangered Species Act (ESA; P.L. 93-205 ), and all other contractual requirements could be met via use of the (b)(2) water if the bill is enacted; however, this is not entirely clear in the language. This section also would direct that (b)(2) water be reused.", "In addition, Section 105 would alter the provisions of CVPIA related to reductions in deliveries for (b)(2) water. It would mandate an automatic 25% reduction of (b)(2) water when Delta Division water supplies are forecast to be reduced by 25% or more from the contracted amounts. Currently under CVPIA, the Secretary is allowed to reduce (b)(2) deliveries by up to 25% when agricultural deliveries of CVP water are reduced. Thus, whereas under CVPIA the reduction was optional and could be up to 25%, under the amended section there would be a mandatory trigger for 25% reductions.", "Finally, Section 105 would deem pursuit (as opposed to accomplishment) of fish and wildlife programs and activities authorized by the amended Section 3406 as meeting the mitigation, protection, restoration, and enhancement purposes of Section 3402 of CVPIA.

This section also would prohibit the requirement of donations or other payments or any other environmental restoration or mitigation fees to the CVPRF as a condition to providing for the storage or conveyance of non-CVP water, delivery of surplus water, or for any water that is delivered for groundwater recharge.

Historically, these payments have fluctuated. Section 106(d) also would require completion of fish, wildlife, and habitat mitigation and restoration actions by 2020, thus shortening the likely time such payments would be in place and thereby reducing water and power contractor payments into the CVPRF. Currently, the CVPRF payments continue until restoration actions are complete; then, payments are to be cut substantially.

It is not clear how implementation of the accord would affect implementation of the WIIN Act, which also provided directives for CVP operations. Although the bill does not explicitly repeal portions of WIIN, there does appear to be overlap between the two pieces of legislation. For instance, if the CVP were to be operated \"in strict conformance\" with the Bay Delta Accord and without regard to ESA, as required under this section, it would appear to negate the changes under the WIIN Act that authorized certain operational parameters based on the current biological opinion (BiOp) for CVP operations.", "Section 108(b) would prohibit federal or state adherence to any condition restricting the exercise of valid water rights in order to conserve, enhance, recover, or otherwise protect any species that is affected by operations of the CVP or SWP.

In addition, other changes to CVPIA, such as broadening the use of water flows and expanding the use of funds for fish and wildlife restoration under Section 105 may provide more water to irrigators or other water users under certain circumstances but may lower conservation efforts for salmon and other fish populations. Similar trade-offs characterize other sections of Title I, such as directing the renewal of existing contracts for 40 year periods under Section 103.

They note that such an approach has the potential to alter the distribution of water deliveries associated with the CVP and SWP and could set a negative precedent for other areas. Supporters note that such a change is warranted due to its potential to make more water available to some users than under current law and regulatory restrictions, which they argue are overly stringent and ineffective.

This section would alter ongoing implementation of the SJRRS and declare that the legislation satisfies certain requirements of California state law. Opponents argue that the changes would preempt state law, effectively repeal the implementing legislation, and amount to a significant setback for restoring the San Joaquin river fishery. Proponents of these changes argue that the settlement has fallen short of its goals and has had negative impacts on water users, thus the new strategy is justified.", "Overall, provisions under this title could be interpreted as weakening environmental protections and restrictions imposed under the CVPIA, ESA, and SJRRS. Whether some or all of these authorities have achieved their goals, and the extent to which they have resulted in unforeseen and/or unjustified effects on CVP and SWP water users, may be key to their consideration. Another outstanding question is how some of the provisions in Title I (e.g., using the Bay-Delta Accord as an operational guide) might be reconciled with what was previously enacted under the WIIN Act, as well as other plans that might eventually impact CVP operations (e.g., the California WaterFix).", "The provisions under Title I of the bill raise questions regarding CVP water supplies for users and the environment. Selected questions relevant to this title might include the following: ", "Exactly how much more water would be expected to be available to CVP water users under H.R. 23 , under various scenarios? How much more water would be available for export from the Delta, and how would the bill affect reservoir releases?

Although many support proposed requirements for expedited completion of the studies as an important step toward construction of the projects, the previous Administration noted concerns with these provisions. In October 2015 testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Obama Administration Deputy Secretary of the Interior Michael Connor noted that two of these projects (NODOS/Sites Reservoir and Los Vaqueros Reservoir) were dependent on participation and funding by nonfederal partners. The Obama Administration also argued that requiring completion of the remaining ongoing studies (Upper San Joaquin/Temperance Flat and San Luis Low Point Improvement Project) by a specific date could compromise Reclamation's ability to make an informed decision on construction and solicit adequate input from partners. It is unclear whether the Trump Administration shares any of these sentiments and whether the studies would be more or less likely to be completed if deadlines were in place. Notably, the WIIN Act authorized federal funding for these projects (either at the 50% or 25% cost-share level, depending on the project type) and authorized the construction of any projects that met certain thresholds set in that act.

Supporters of similar provisions have noted that they are not against the assertion of federal reserved water rights when those rights are specifically set out in statute or identified by courts. However, in previous testimony before Congress, Reclamation argued that the requirements of H.R. 23 have the potential to impact the ability of DOI agencies, such as the National Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, to exercise water rights associated with their land reservations, including the agencies' ability to protect groundwater-dependent resources located on federal lands. Other witnesses have pointed out that under certain interpretations, the bill has the potential to render less likely the settlement of future Indian Water Rights claims, which in some cases necessitate the federal limitation of state-based rights for tribal water rights that are judged to be senior in status. It appears as though most new federal policies or actions related to reserved water rights would be subject to the bill's requirements, including its requirements for coordination with state laws and authorities.
