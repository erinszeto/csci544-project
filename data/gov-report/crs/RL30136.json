Relevant House rules include those governing debate, decorum, and the Speaker's power of recognition. For example, a Representative cannot deliver a special order longer than 60 minutes because this would violate House Rule XVII, clause 2, which limits individual Members to \"one hour in debate on any question.\" When a Member's 60-minute special order expires, he or she cannot even ask unanimous consent to address the House for an additional minute. The Member can speak again, however, if time is yielded under another Representative's special order.

Although special orders routinely begin once legislative business is completed, the Speaker is not required to recognize Members for special orders as soon as legislative business ends.

Recognition alternates between the majority and minority for both the initial special order and subsequent special orders in each time category (i.e., five-minute special orders; longer special orders). In recognizing individual Members, the chair follows the order specified in the list of special order requests submitted by each party's leadership (see \" Reservation of Special Orders \" section). No special orders are allowed after midnight on any day . On Tuesdays , after all legislative business is completed, the chair can recognize Members for five-minute special orders and unlimited longer special orders until midnight. On every day but Tuesday, after the five-minute special orders, the chair can recognize Members for no more than four hours of longer special orders. The four hours are divided equally between the majority and minority.

When less than four hours remains until midnight, each party's two-hour period is prorated.", "Each party's leadership usually chooses a designee to deliver a leadership special order during the party's first hour of longer special orders. This designee will sometimes lead a thematic special order and yield time to other party Members.

The majority leader's designee then led a 60-minute special order on the 1997 balanced budget agreement, during which he yielded time to other Republican Members.", "To summarize, under the Speaker's current announced policies, there are generally three stages to each day's special order period:", "1. five-minute special orders by individual Members ; 2. special orders longer than five minutes (normally 60 minutes in length) by the party's leadership or designee ; and 3. special orders longer than five minutes (length varies from 6 minutes to 60 minutes) by individual Member s ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reservation of Special Orders", "paragraphs": ["Members reserve five-minute and longer special orders through their party leadership: Democratic Members reserve time through the Office of the Majority Leader, and Republican Members reserve time through the Republican cloakroom or the party leadership desk on the House floor.

As mentioned earlier, each party's leadership sometimes reserves a 60-minute special order to present party views on a particular bill or policy issue. In addition, Members of both parties may coordinate their special orders to debate legislation. For example, in the 104 th Congress, the two parties reserved consecutive, 60-minute special orders to conduct a \"real give-and-take kind of debate\" of H.J.Res. 159 (a proposed constitutional amendment to require two-thirds majorities for bills increasing taxes). Majority and minority Members participated in each party's 60-minute special order. In a departure from regular practice, these special orders took place in the middle of the day before the House considered the joint resolution.", "The special order period also provides a forum where Members can practice and hone their debate skills. Veteran Representatives have advised new Members, in particular, to reserve special orders for this purpose:", "... before you participate in general debate on a bill ... get some practice. Get a special order and have a few of your friends participate with you. Get the feel of being in the well of the House, how the lectern can move up and down, how the microphones work. Practice in the somewhat stilted language of yielding to other colleagues and so forth, so that when you do get into the real legislative fight it isn't all new; you have a little bit of the feel of debating in the House.", "During special orders, freshmen majority Members also have an opportunity to gain experience presiding as Speaker pro tempore."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Earlier Announced Policies of the Speaker", "paragraphs": ["The Speaker's current announced policies on special orders build upon earlier policies, mainly those implemented on February 23, 1994.

Civility examined the public's perception of rising incivility in the House and recommended actions to reduce this perception and actual breaches in decorum.", "The report pointed out that incivility was more likely to take place during special orders and one-minute speeches than during other periods of House floor proceedings. According to Civility , unparliamentary language \"that would be taken down in regular debate was more likely to be tolerated or 'cautioned'\" during special orders. The report attributed this situation to the low number of Members present during special orders\u2014it was unlikely a Member would make a timely demand that unparliamentary words be taken down and, even if this demand was made, \"it would be all but impossible to locate the Members needed to vote\" on an appeal of the chair's ruling.
