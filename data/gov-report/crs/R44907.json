Since 1994, Mexico has grown to become a major location for vehicle and parts manufacturing, while production in the United States and Canada has remained fairly steady, except during recessions. In addition to NAFTA trade liberalization commitments, growth of the Mexican vehicle industry was assisted by unilateral Mexican measures that removed restrictive trade and investment barriers, as well as Mexico's lower labor costs, the government's investment in training engineers and technicians to operate and manage motor vehicle plants, and numerous free trade agreements that give Mexican vehicles and parts tariff-free access to countries where U.S. exports face a tariff.

NAFTA requires that 62.5% of a vehicle's net cost and 60% of the cost of parts originate in the NAFTA region in order for those products to have duty-free access to the United States. This is the highest such requirement for motor vehicles of any U.S. trade agreement. In general, vehicle and parts manufacturers support retaining the current rules of origin, whereas the United Auto Workers union seeks to require a higher percentage of regional content, which it believes would reduce the share of parts produced in non-NAFTA countries.", "The Trump Administration announced its negotiating objectives for NAFTA renegotiation on July 17, 2017, but it has not enumerated negotiating objectives specific to the automotive industry.

The pact also required that vehicles and parts have at least 50% U.S. or Canadian content in order to benefit from the tariff exemption. No Japanese or European auto manufacturers produced vehicles in the United States or Canada at the time, and when they later opened plants, they did not benefit from tariff-free movement of parts and vehicles across the border. The effect of the Auto Pact was to create an integrated U.S. and Canadian market for motor vehicles and parts, while ensuring that a specified share of vehicle manufacturing remained in Canada. ", "As a result of the Auto Pact, U.S. and Canadian motor vehicle industries were generally integrated by the 1980s. The agreement did not lead to major changes affecting automotive trade, although it adjusted the system of tariffs applied to imports from Europe, Japan, and other sources outside North America.

Mexico's export-oriented industries began in 1965 with the establishment of the maquiladora program, which allowed foreign-owned businesses to set up assembly plants in Mexico to produce for export, as part of the Border Industrialization Program created under President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz. ", "The Border Industrialization Program was a response to the 1964 termination of the U.S. Bracero Program, which had allowed Mexican workers to cross into the United States for seasonal employment. Under the industrialization program, maquiladoras could import intermediate materials duty-free with the condition that a certain percentage of the final product be exported. Maquiladoras were originally restricted to the U.S.-Mexico border region and normally participated in production sharing with their U.S. facilities. Manufacturers in other regions of Mexico faced much more restrictive trade and investment barriers, which were eventually eliminated after NAFTA. ", "Under Mexico's Border Investment Program, maquiladoras operated under the following special rules: ", "lower trade and foreign investment restrictions than other sectors in Mexico; access to duty-free imports of intermediate materials with the condition that a percentage of the final production was exported; duty-free import of manufacturing equipment with the condition that it would be exported if the company ceased to operate under the program; and exemption from Mexican laws requiring majority Mexican ownership and from prohibitions on foreign ownership of real estate near borders and coastlines. ", "Maquiladora operations increased rapidly during the 1970s and 1980s. As Mexican labor costs were very low compared with those in the United States, U.S.-based automotive manufacturers initially used maquiladoras to make labor-intensive products such as wire harnesses, assemblies of wires that carry electricity to lights, dashboard indicators, and other components. Over time, manufacturers began producing more sophisticated components, such as brakes and suspensions, in maquiladoras. ", "Maquiladora production of auto parts was intended to supply auto assembly plants in the United States and Canada, and it was not integrated with domestic assembly of automobiles in Mexico. At the time, companies such as General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, and Volkswagen, which were assembling vehicles in Mexico, were subject to trade and investment restrictions under a series of Mexican auto decrees that also required a minimum proportion of Mexican content. (See box below on Mexico's Auto Decrees.) Automobiles produced in Mexico were generally not exported to the United States and Canada and in some cases did not meet U.S. or Canadian safety and emissions standards. Imports of new vehicles from the United States and Canada into Mexico were not allowed prior to 1989. ", "After NAFTA took effect, Mexico merged the maquiladora operations and Mexican domestic assembly-for-export plants into one program called Maquiladora Manufacturing Industry and Export Services (IMMEX). NAFTA regulations continued to allow maquiladoras to import products duty-free into Mexico, regardless of the country of origin of the products. This phase also allowed maquiladora operations to increase sales to the Mexican domestic market. However, in 2001, rules of origin established in NAFTA replaced the previous special tariff provisions that applied only to maquiladora operations, so that any products that qualified as North American origin could be imported duty-free into Mexico for any purpose. At the same time, some inputs imported by maquiladoras from non-NAFTA countries became subject to Mexican tariffs, raising costs for maquiladoras that imported from countries such as Japan or China.

Most of the market-opening measures of NAFTA resulted in the removal of tariffs and quotas applied by Mexico on imports from the United States and Canada. Mexican tariffs were substantially higher than those of the United States at the time NAFTA was negotiated. Moreover, many Mexican products entered the United States duty-free under the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences. Prior to NAFTA, the United States assessed the following tariffs on imports from Mexico: 2.5% on automobiles, 25% on light-duty trucks, and a trade-weighted average of 3.1% for automotive parts. In comparison, Mexico's more restrictive tariffs on U.S. and Canadian automotive products were 20% on automobiles and light trucks and 10%-20% on auto parts.", "NAFTA helped lock in Mexico's automotive-industry reforms by phasing out the restrictive auto decrees. It also included the gradual removal of many nontariff barriers to trade, provided for uniform country-of-origin provisions, enhanced protection of intellectual property rights, required less restrictive procurement practices by the Mexican government, and eliminated performance requirements on investors from other NAFTA countries.

The major recent growth in the North American market occurred largely in Mexico, which now accounts for about 20% of total continental vehicle production ( Figure 4 ). In general, recent investments in U.S. and Canadian assembly plants have involved modernization or expansion of existing facilities, while Mexico has seen new assembly plants. ", "In addition, many parts manufacturers have opened plants in Mexico to be close to the growing number of vehicle assembly plants. Parts plants in all three countries supply manufacturers of automotive systems (such as brake and seating systems) and motor vehicle assembly plants in the other NAFTA countries. Estimates show that some motor vehicle parts and components cross the U.S. border more than eight times in the production and assembly process. Parts trade has grown more rapidly than trade in assembled vehicles. Mexico's exports of parts to the United States have increased by 85% since 2010; U.S. exports of parts to Mexico have grown by 64% over the same period ( Figure 5 ).", "At least three factors have spurred Mexico's rise as a motor vehicle manufacturing center, in addition to the removal of trade barriers in NAFTA. These include Mexico's lower labor costs, the Mexican government's investment in its educational system to graduate engineers and technicians to operate and manage vehicle and parts plants, and Mexico's growing network of free trade agreements with many countries outside the NAFTA region. In some cases, Mexico's vehicle exports have tariff-free access to countries that impose tariffs on vehicles made in the United States or Canada. The impact of these factors on U.S. and Mexican motor vehicle manufacturing exports is reflected in Table 1 .", "In the absence of NAFTA, it is possible that vehicles assembled in North America would potentially use more Asian- and European-produced parts. For example, of the vehicle engines imported into the United States in 2015, about 60% originated in Mexico or Canada, but engines were also imported from Japan (11%), Germany (nearly 6%), and South Korea (more than 5%). Similar competition exists for transmissions, power trains, electric and electronic equipment, steering and suspension parts, brake systems, and vehicle lighting equipment. U.S. tariffs on auto parts imports from most countries with large automotive industries are about 1.7%, compared to zero in NAFTA, so favorable tariff treatment alone does not generally provide a large incentive to produce parts in Mexico for the U.S. market.", "Motor vehicle assembly plants are found in 14 U.S. states; Canada's province of Ontario; and in 11 Mexican states ( Figure 6 ), showing the concentrated north-south corridor in the United States from Mississippi and Alabama north to Michigan that is often called \"automobile alley.\" Motor vehicle parts manufacturing plants, not included in the map, are located in nearly every state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Motor Vehicle and Parts Trade", "paragraphs": ["Motor vehicle and parts trade accounted for more than 20% of U.S. merchandise trade with other NAFTA signatories in 2016, slightly more than the shares in 2006 and 2007 before the recession ( Figure 7 ).", "The United States exports more than 2 million motor vehicles a year; Canada and Mexico are the two largest markets for those vehicles ( Figure 8 ). ", "The United States has trade deficits in assembled vehicles with both Canada and Mexico ( Figure 9 ). In 2016, the United States trade balance on vehicle trade with Canada was -$20.4 billion, and with Mexico, -$45.3 billion. Similarly, the United States imported more vehicle parts from Mexico than it exported, resulting in a $26 billion deficit in 2016. Only in U.S. motor vehicle parts trade with Canada did the United States record a surplus ($7 billion) in 2016. The vehicle parts exported from the United States to Canada (and Mexico) often come back to the United States in finished motor vehicles. ", "Official trade statistics such as those showing the motor vehicle and parts trade balance include both intermediate inputs and final products. In effect, gross exports double count the value of intermediate goods that cross international borders more than once. This is of special relevance in the motor vehicle industry: a vehicle assembled in the United States has more than 10,000 parts that come from multiple producers in different countries and may travel back and forth across borders several times. One company producing seats for motor vehicles, for example, incorporates components from four different U.S. states and four Mexican locations into its products, with final assembly in the Midwest.", "Because of the complexities of modern supply chains, economists studying manufacturing tend to examine value added rather than trade flows. An industry's value added is an estimation of the difference between its sales and its purchases of components and other inputs. ", "Mexico uses relatively more foreign content in its automotive industry than Canada and the United States: 55% of the value added of Mexican automotive exports came from foreign sources in 2014 ( Figure 10 ). In contrast, the United States had an import intensity of 36%, while Canada was an intermediate 47%. This indicates that U.S. motor vehicle manufacturing retains a large base of U.S. component and assembly operations that has not been displaced by imports. Foreign value added in U.S. motor vehicle manufacturing rose significantly between 2002 and 2008, due in part to increasing flows of parts and components from Mexico and China, but the share of foreign content has stabilized since 2008. In Mexico, however, the share of foreign value added rose through at least 2011. This may be due to new investments in assembly plants that are using imported engines and other components.

Thus, agreements such as NAFTA include rules of origin to make certain that transshipment and light processing of goods largely produced in non-NAFTA countries\u2014such as simple assembly or repackaging\u2014are not used to circumvent higher duties. Determining the country of origin is fairly straightforward when a product is \"wholly obtained\" from, or manufactured in, only one country. However, when a finished product's component parts are manufactured in many countries, determining origin can be a complex process.", "Rules-of-origin requirements differ in each trade agreement because they are individually negotiated among the parties to the agreement. For importers to benefit from a trade agreement, they must demonstrate that their imports meet the respective rules-of-origin criteria. ", "In NAFTA, the rules of origin affecting motor vehicles and parts are established by a method intended to ensure that a certain percentage of the value of a manufactured product (as determined by the cost of inputs, labor, and other direct costs of processing operations) originates in the NAFTA region. This regional value content (RVC) test involves specific equations to determine the value of originating materials, the adjusted value of the product, the value of non-originating materials, and other costs, such as processing operations and shipping ( Figure 11 ).", "In U.S. trade agreements, including NAFTA, three alternative methods are often used to calculate RVC in automotive products. Trade agreements often give manufacturers and importers more than one option for calculating the RVC, because one method of calculation may be more beneficial than the other for particular companies or industries. The three types of RVC calculations are the following: ", "\"Build- D own\" Method: determines the regional value content by subtracting the value of the non-originating merchandise from the adjusted value of the finished product. The adjusted value includes all costs, profit, general expenses, parts and materials, labor, shipping, marketing, and packing. Since the build-down method allows manufacturers to count all the costs involved in building and marketing the final automobile or the component, a higher percentage (55%) is associated with this calculation in comparison to the other two allowable methods of calculating regional value content. \"Build- U p\" Method : starts with the value of originating materials. The value of NAFTA inputs is added together, and if their total value exceeds 35% of the adjusted value of the vehicle or the component, the product would qualify for the benefits of the agreement. The build-up method is included in trade agreements principally to benefit manufacturers of exports other than automobiles. \" Net Cost\" Method : captures only the costs involved in manufacturing, including factory labor, materials, and direct overhead. Other costs, such as sales promotion, marketing, royalties, and profit, are excluded from the calculation. The use of a small, easily identifiable set of input costs is thought to make the net cost method easier to use in calculating RVC. As the net cost method excludes selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) costs, profits, expenses, royalties, and promotional costs, its 35% RVC requirement is approximately equivalent to the 55% RVC requirement under the build-down method described above."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NAFTA Motor Vehicle Rules of Origin Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The use of an RVC test to determine the origin of motor vehicles and parts under NAFTA was intended to accommodate the global sourcing strategies of vehicle manufacturers by creating incentives for them to source from within the NAFTA region. However, it is possible that the savings on tariffs from sourcing within the NAFTA region may not provide sufficient inducement to alter an already established supply chain. The U.S. tariff rate for imports of passenger cars from most countries is 2.5% of the value of the import, and avoiding this relatively low tariff alone would be unlikely to prompt manufacturers to build cars in the NAFTA region. The substantially higher U.S. light truck tariff at 25%, however, results in significant savings for manufacturers that build trucks in the NAFTA region to serve the U.S. market. This high tariff on imported trucks is possibly one reason why nearly all pick-up trucks sold in the United States are manufactured in North America.", "U.S. free trade agreements have had a range of rules of origin ( Table 2 ). NAFTA has the highest RVC requirement for automotive products, at 62.5% (meaning that the majority of the parts in the vehicle have to originate in the NAFTA region to receive the tariff benefit). This reflects the fact that the North American auto market was already highly integrated at the time of the negotiation of NAFTA. RVC rules in other trade agreements vary by percentage from 30% to 50%. The 1989 Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement considered a vehicle to be domestic if it had at least 50% U.S. or Canadian content.", "Since tariff rates on motor vehicles tend to be higher in the markets of U.S. trade partners than in the United States, tariff savings in the foreign market could provide an incentive for vehicle manufacturers in the United States to meet preferential rules-of-origin requirements. For example, tariffs for automobiles in Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement trading partners can be as high as 20%.
