An alien may be subject to detention pending an administrative determination as to whether the alien should be removed, and, if subject to a final order of removal, pending efforts to secure the alien's removal from the United States. The immigration detention scheme is multifaceted, with different rules that turn on several factors, such as whether the alien is seeking admission into the United States or has been lawfully admitted into the country; whether the alien has engaged in certain proscribed conduct; and whether the alien has been issued a final order of removal. In many instances DHS maintains discretion to release an alien from custody. But in some instances, such as when an alien has committed specified crimes, the governing statutes have been understood to allow release from detention only in limited circumstances.", "The immigration detention scheme is mainly governed by four INA provisions that specify when an alien may be detained:", "1. INA Section 236(a) generally authorizes the detention of aliens pending removal proceedings and permits aliens who are not subject to mandatory detention to be released on bond or on their own recognizance; 2. INA Section 236(c) generally requires the detention of aliens who are removable because of specified criminal activity or terrorist-related grounds after release from criminal incarceration; 3. INA Section 235(b) generally requires the detention of applicants for admission, such as aliens arriving at a designated port of entry as well as certain other aliens who have not been admitted or paroled into the United States, who appear subject to removal; and 4. INA Section 241 (a) generally requires the detention of aliens during a 90-day period after the completion of removal proceedings and permits (but does not require) the detention of certain aliens after that period.", "These provisions confer substantial authority upon DHS to detain removable aliens, but that authority has been subject to legal challenge, particularly in cases involving the prolonged detention of aliens without bond. DHS's detention authority is not unfettered, and due process considerations may inform the duration and conditions of aliens' detention. In 2001, the Supreme Court in Zadvydas v. Davis construed the statute governing the detention of aliens following an order of removal as having implicit, temporal limitations. The Court reasoned that construing the statute to permit the indefinite detention of lawfully admitted aliens after their removal proceedings would raise \"serious constitutional concerns.\" In 2003, however, the Court in Demore v. Kim ruled that the mandatory detention of certain aliens pending their removal proceedings, at least for relatively brief periods, was constitutionally permissible. The interplay between the Zadvydas and Demore rulings has called into question whether the constitutional standards for detention prior to a final order of removal differ from those governing detention after a final order is issued. Several lower courts have interpreted Demore to mean that mandatory detention pending removal proceedings is not per se unconstitutional, but that Zadvydas cautions that if this detention becomes \"prolonged\" it may not comport with due process requirements.", "Additionally, some lower courts have recognized constraints on DHS's detention power that the Supreme Court has not yet considered. For instance, some courts have ruled that the Due Process Clause requires aliens in removal proceedings to have bond hearings when detention becomes prolonged, where the government bears the burden of proving that the alien's continued detention is justified. In addition, a settlement agreement known as the \" Flores Settlement,\" which is enforced by a federal district court, currently limits DHS's ability to detain alien minors who are subject to removal. Further, while litigation concerning immigration detention has largely centered on the duration of detention, some courts have considered challenges to the conditions of immigration confinement, generally under the standards applicable to pretrial detention in criminal cases. Some courts have also restricted DHS's ability to take custody of aliens detained by state or local law enforcement officials upon issuance of \"immigration detainers.\"", "In short, while DHS generally has broad authority over the detention of aliens, that authority is not without limitation. As courts continue to grapple with legal and constitutional challenges to immigration detention, Congress may consider legislative options that clarify the scope of the federal government's detention authority."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) authorizes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and in some cases requires\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain non-U.S. nationals (aliens) arrested for immigration violations that render them removable from the United States. The immigration detention regime serves two primary purposes. First, detention may ensure an apprehended alien's presence at his or her removal hearing and, if the alien is ultimately ordered removed, makes it easier for removal to be quickly effectuated. Second, in some cases detention may serve the additional purpose of alleviating any threat posed by the alien to the safety of the community while the removal process is under way. ", "The INA's detention framework, however, is multifaceted, with different rules turning on whether the alien is seeking initial admission into the United States or was lawfully admitted into the country; whether the alien has committed certain criminal offenses or other conduct rendering him or her a security risk; and whether the alien is being held pending removal proceedings or has been issued a final order of removal. ", "In many cases detention is discretionary, and DHS may release an alien placed in formal removal proceedings on bond, on his or her own recognizance, or under an order of supervision pending the outcome of those proceedings. But in other instances, such as those involving aliens who have committed specified crimes, there are only limited circumstances when the alien may be released from custody.", "This report outlines the statutory and regulatory framework governing the detention of aliens, from an alien's initial arrest and placement in removal proceedings to the alien's removal from the United States. In particular, the report examines the key statutory provisions that specify when an alien may or must be detained by immigration authorities and the circumstances when an alien may be released from custody. The report also discusses the various legal challenges to DHS's detention power and some of the judicially imposed restrictions on that authority. Finally, the report examines how these legal developments may inform Congress as it considers legislation that may modify the immigration detention framework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legal and Historical Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Immigration Authority and the Power to Detain Aliens", "paragraphs": ["The Supreme Court has long recognized that the federal government has \"broad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens,\" including with respect to their admission, exclusion, and removal from the United States. This authority includes the power to detain aliens pending determinations as to whether they should be removed from the country. The Court has predicated this broad immigration power on the government's inherent sovereign authority to control its borders and its relations with foreign nations. Notably, the Court has \"repeatedly emphasized that 'over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over' the admission of aliens,\" and that \"Congress may make rules as to aliens that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.\" ", "Despite the government's broad immigration power, the Supreme Court has repeatedly declared that aliens who have physically entered the United States come under the protective scope of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies \"to all 'persons' within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.\" Due process protections generally include the right to a hearing and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before deprivation of a liberty interest. And one of the core protections of the Due Process Clause is the \"[f]reedom from bodily restraint.\" But while the Supreme Court has recognized that due process considerations may constrain the federal government's exercise of its immigration power, there is some uncertainty regarding when these considerations may be consequential. ", "Generally, aliens seeking initial entry into the United States typically have more limited constitutional protections than aliens present within the country. The Supreme Court has long held that aliens seeking entry into the United States have no constitutional rights regarding their applications for admission, and the government's detention authority in those situations seems least constrained by due process considerations. Thus, in Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei , the Supreme Court upheld the indefinite detention of an alien who was denied admission into the United States following a trip abroad. The Court ruled that the alien's \"temporary harborage\" on Ellis Island pending the government's attempts to remove him did not constitute an \"entry\" into the United States, and that he could be \"treated as if stopped at the border.\"", "Nevertheless, some courts have suggested that the constitutional limitations that apply to arriving aliens pertain only to their procedural rights regarding their applications for admission, but do not foreclose the availability of redress when fundamental liberty interests are implicated . Thus, some lower courts have concluded that arriving aliens have sufficient due process protections against unreasonably prolonged detention, and distinguished Mezei as a case involving the exclusion of an alien who potentially posed a danger to national security that warranted the alien's detention. Furthermore, regardless of the extent of their due process protections, detained arriving aliens may be entitled to at least some level of habeas corpus review, in which courts consider whether an individual is lawfully detained by the government.", "But due process considerations become more significant once an alien has physically entered the United States. As discussed above, the Supreme Court has long recognized that aliens who have entered the United States, even unlawfully, are \"persons\" under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. That said, the Court has also suggested that \"the nature of that protection may vary depending upon [the alien's] status and circumstance.\" In various opinions, the Court has suggested that at least some of the constitutional protections to which an alien is entitled may turn upon whether the alien has been admitted into the United States or developed substantial ties to this country. ", "Consequently, the government's authority to detain aliens who have entered the United States is not absolute. The Supreme Court, for instance, construed a statute authorizing the detention of aliens ordered removed to have implicit temporal limitations because construing it to allow the indefinite detention of aliens ordered removed\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least in the case of lawfully admitted aliens later ordered removed\u00e2\u0080\u0094would raise \"serious constitutional concerns.\" Declaring that the government's immigration power \"is subject to important constitutional limitations,\" the Court has determined that the Due Process Clause limits the detention to \"a period reasonably necessary to secure removal.\" ", "Additionally, while the Supreme Court has recognized the government's authority to detain aliens p ending formal removal proceedings, the Court has not decided whether the extended detention of aliens during those proceedings could give rise to a violation of due process protections. But some lower courts have concluded that due process restricts the government's ability to indefinitely detain at least some categories of aliens pending determinations as to whether they should be removed from the United States.", "In sum, although the government has broad power over immigration, there are constitutional constraints on that power. These constraints may be most significant with regard to the detention of lawfully admitted aliens within the country, and least powerful with regard to aliens at the threshold of initial entry into the United States. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Development of Immigration Laws Concerning Detention", "paragraphs": ["From the outset, U.S. federal immigration laws have generally authorized the detention of aliens who are subject to removal. The first U.S. law on alien detention was the Alien Enemies Act in 1798, which subjected certain aliens from \"hostile\" nations during times of war to being detained and removed. But Congress passed no other laws on the detention of aliens for nearly a century. Starting in 1875, however, Congress enacted a series of laws restricting the entry of certain classes of aliens (e.g., those with criminal convictions), and requiring the detention of aliens who were excludable under those laws until they could be removed. In construing the government's detention authority, the Supreme Court in 1896 declared that \"[w]e think it clear that detention or temporary confinement, as part of the means necessary to give effect to the provisions for the exclusion or expulsion of aliens, would be valid.\" Over the next few decades, Congress continued to enact laws generally mandating the detention and exclusion of proscribed categories of aliens seeking entry into the United States, as well as aliens physically present in the United States who became subject to removal.", "In 1952, Congress passed the INA, which distinguished between aliens physically arriving in the United States and those who had entered the country. Aliens arriving in the country who were found ineligible for entry were subject to \"exclusion,\" and those already present in the United States who were found to be subject to expulsion were deemed \"deportable.\" For aliens placed in exclusion proceedings, detention generally was required, unless immigration authorities, based on humanitarian concerns, granted the alien \"parole,\" allowing the alien to enter and remain in the United States pending a determination on whether he or she should be admitted. In the case of deportable aliens, detention originally was authorized but not required, and aliens in such proceedings could be released on bond or \"conditional parole.\" Congress later amended the INA to require, in deportation proceedings, the detention of aliens convicted of aggravated felonies, and authorized their release from custody only in limited circumstances, such as when the alien was a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who did not pose a threat to the community or a flight risk. ", "In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), which made sweeping changes to the federal immigration laws. IIRIRA replaced the INA's exclusion/deportation framework, which turned on whether an alien had physically entered the United States, with a new framework that turned on whether an alien had been lawfully admitted into the country by immigration authorities. Aliens who had not been admitted, including those who may have unlawfully entered the country, could be barred entry or removed from the country based on specified grounds of inadmissibility listed under INA Section 212. Aliens who had been lawfully admitted, however, could be removed if they fell under grounds of deportability specified under INA Section 237. A standard, \"formal\" removal proceeding was established for deportable aliens and most categories of inadmissible aliens. But IIRIRA created a new \"expedited removal\" process that applied to a subset of inadmissible aliens. This process applies to arriving aliens and certain aliens who recently entered the United States without inspection, when those aliens lack valid entry documents or attempted to procure their admission through fraud or misrepresentation.", "IIRIRA generally authorized (but did not require) immigration authorities to detain aliens believed to be removable pending those aliens' formal removal proceedings, but permitted their release on bond or \"conditional parole.\" IIRIRA, however, required the detention of aliens who were inadmissible or deportable based on the commission of certain enumerated crimes or for terrorist-related grounds, generally with no possibility of release from custody. IIRIRA also generally required the detention of \"applicants for admission,\" including aliens subject to expedited removal, pending determinations as to whether they should be removed (such aliens, however, could still be paroled into the United States by immigration officials in their discretion). This mandatory detention requirement has been applied even if those aliens were subsequently transferred to formal removal proceedings. Finally, IIRIRA created a detention scheme in which aliens with final orders of removal became subject to detention during a 90-day period pending their removal, and the government could (but was not required to) continue to detain some of those aliens after that period.

This detention framework is multifaceted, with different rules turning on whether the alien is seeking admission into the United States or was lawfully admitted within the country; whether the alien has committed certain enumerated criminal or terrorist acts; and whether the alien has been issued a final administrative order of removal. Four provisions largely govern the current immigration detention scheme:", "1. INA Section 236(a) generally authorizes the detention of aliens pending formal removal proceedings and permits (but does not require) aliens who are not subject to mandatory detention to be released on bond or their own recognizance; 2.

The statute is primarily administered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency within DHS largely responsible for immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States. Section 236(a) authorizes immigration authorities to arrest and detain an alien pending his or her formal removal proceedings. Detention under INA Section 236(a) is discretionary, and immigration authorities are not required to detain an alien subject to removal unless the alien falls within one of the categories of aliens subject to mandatory detention (e.g., aliens convicted of specified crimes under INA Section 236(c), discussed later in this report). ", "If ICE arrests and detains an alien under INA Section 236(a), and the alien is not otherwise subject to mandatory detention, the agency has two options: ", "1. it \"may continue to detain the arrested alien\" pending the removal proceedings; or 2. it \"may release the alien\" on bond in the amount of at least $1500, or on \"conditional parole.\" ", "Generally, upon release (whether on bond or conditional parole), the alien may not receive work authorization unless the alien is otherwise eligible (e.g., the alien is an LPR). And ICE may at any time revoke a bond or conditional parole and bring the alien back into custody.", "In the event of an alien's release, ICE may opt to enroll the alien in an Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, which allows ICE the ability to monitor and supervise the released alien to ensure his or her eventual appearance at a removal proceeding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Initial Custody Determination and Administrative Review", "paragraphs": ["Following the arrest of an alien not subject to mandatory detention, an immigration officer may, at any time during formal removal proceedings, determine whether the alien should remain in custody or be released. But when an alien is arrested without a warrant, DHS regulations provide that the immigration officer must make a custody determination within 48 hours of the alien's arrest, unless there is \"an emergency or other extraordinary circumstance\" that requires \"an additional reasonable period of time\" to make the custody determination. DHS has defined \"emergency or other extraordinary circumstance\" to mean a \"significant infrastructure or logistical disruption\" (e.g., natural disaster, power outage, serious civil disturbance); an \"influx of large numbers of detained aliens that overwhelms agency resources\"; and other unique facts and circumstances \"including, but not limited to, the need for medical care or a particularized compelling law enforcement need.\"", "After ICE's initial custody determination, an alien may, at any time during the removal proceedings, request review of that decision at a bond hearing before an immigration judge (IJ) within the Department of Justice's (DOJ's) Executive Office for Immigration Review. While the alien may request a bond hearing, INA Section 236(a) does not require a hearing to be provided at any particular time. If there is a bond hearing, regulations specify that it \"shall be separate and apart from, and shall form no part of, any deportation or removal hearing or proceeding.\" During these bond proceedings, the IJ may, under INA Section 236(a), determine whether to keep the alien in custody or release the alien, and the IJ also has authority to set the bond amount. Following the IJ's custody decision, the alien may obtain a later bond redetermination only \"upon a showing that the alien's circumstances have changed materially since the prior bond redetermination.\"", "Both the alien and DHS may appeal the IJ's custody or bond determination to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the highest administrative body charged with interpreting federal immigration laws. The filing of an appeal generally will not stay the IJ's decision or otherwise affect the ongoing removal proceedings. The BIA, however, may stay the IJ's custody determination on its own motion or when DHS appeals that decision and files a motion for a discretionary stay. Moreover, if ICE had determined that the alien should not be released or had set bond at $10,000 or greater, any order of the IJ authorizing release (on bond or otherwise) is automatically stayed upon DHS's filing of a notice of intent to appeal with the immigration court within one business day of the IJ's order, and the IJ's order will typically remain held in abeyance pending the BIA's decision on appeal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standard and Criteria for Making Custody Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Following the enactment of IIRIRA, the DOJ promulgated regulations to govern discretionary detention and release decisions under INA Section 236(a). These regulations require the alien to \"demonstrate to the satisfaction of the officer that . . . release would not pose a danger to property or persons, and that the alien is likely to appear for any future proceeding.\" Based on this regulation, the BIA has held that the alien has the burden of showing that he or she should be released from custody, and \"[o]nly if an alien demonstrates that he does not pose a danger to the community should an [IJ] continue to a determination regarding the extent of flight risk posed by the alien.\" ", "Some federal courts, however, have held that if an alien's detention under INA Section 236(a) becomes prolonged, a bond hearing must be held where the burden shifts to the government to prove that the alien's continued detention is warranted. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit ) has reasoned that, given an individual's \"substantial liberty interest\" in avoiding physical restraint, the government should prove by clear and convincing evidence that the detention is justified. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed the proper allocation of the burden of proof for custody determinations under INA Section 236(a). On the one hand, the Court has held that the statute does not itself require the government to prove that an alien's continued detention is warranted or to afford the alien a bond hearing. On the other hand, the Court has not decided whether due process considerations nonetheless compel the government to bear the burden of proving that the alien should remain in custody if detention becomes prolonged. ", "While INA Section 236(a) and its implementing regulations provide standards for determining whether an alien should be released from ICE custody, they do not specify the factors that may be considered in weighing a detained alien's potential danger or flight risk. But the BIA has instructed that an IJ may consider, among other factors, these criteria in assessing an alien's custody status:", "whether the alien has a fixed address in the United States; the alien's length of residence in the United States; whether the alien has family ties in the United States; the alien's employment history; the alien's record of appearance in court; the alien's criminal record, including the extent, recency, and seriousness of the criminal offenses; the alien's history of immigration violations; any attempts by the alien to flee prosecution or otherwise escape from authorities; and the alien's manner of entry to the United States. ", "The BIA and other authorities have generally applied these criteria in reviewing custody determinations. In considering an alien's danger to the community or flight risk, \"any evidence in the record that is probative and specific can be considered.\" The BIA has also instructed that, in deciding whether an alien presents a danger to the community and should not be released from custody, an IJ should consider both direct and circumstantial evidence of dangerousness, including whether the facts and circumstances raise national security considerations.

No court may set aside any action or decision by the Attorney General under this section regarding the detention or release of any alien or the grant, revocation, or denial of bond or parole.", "Even so, the Supreme Court has determined that, absent clear congressional intent, INA provisions barring judicial review do not foreclose the availability of review in habeas corpus proceedings because \"[i]n the immigration context, 'judicial review' and 'habeas corpus' have historically different meanings.\" Thus, despite INA Section 236(e)'s limitation on judicial review, the Court has held that the statute does not bar federal courts from reviewing, in habeas corpus proceedings, an alien's statutory or constitutional challenge to his detention. The Court has reasoned that an alien's challenge to \"the statutory framework\" permitting his detention is distinct from a challenge to the \"discretionary judgment\" or operational \"decision\" whether to detain the alien, which is foreclosed from judicial review under INA Section 236(e). Lower courts have similarly held that they retain jurisdiction to review habeas claims that raise constitutional or statutory challenges to detention. For that reason, although a detained alien may not seek judicial review of the government's discretionary decision whether to keep him or her detained, the alien may challenge the legal authority for that detention under the federal habeas statute.", "The Supreme Court has also considered whether a separate statute, INA Section 242(b)(9), bars judicial review of detention challenges.

But the Court has declined to read the statute as barring all claims that could technically \"arise from\" one of those three actions. Thus, the Court has held that INA Section 242(b)(9) does not bar review of claims challenging the government's authority to detain aliens because such claims do not purport to challenge an order of removal, the government's decision to seek removal, or the process by which an alien's removability is determined.

Eventually, in Zadvydas v.

Davis , discussed above, the Supreme Court in 2001 ruled that the indefinite detention of aliens after the completion of removal proceedings raised \"a serious constitutional problem,\" at least for those who were lawfully admitted, and thus construed INA Section 241(a)(6)'s post-order of removal detention provision as containing an implicit six-month time limitation. In 2003, the Court in Demore v. Kim held that the mandatory detention of aliens pending removal proceedings under INA Section 236(c) was \"constitutionally permissible,\" but did not decide whether there were any constitutional limits to the duration of such detention. Later, though, some lower courts ruled that the prolonged detention of aliens pending removal proceedings raised similar constitutional issues as those raised after a final order, and, citing Zadvydas , construed INA Section 236(c) as containing an implicit temporal limitation. In 2018, the Supreme Court held in Jennings v. Rodriguez that the government has the statutory authority to indefinitely detain aliens pending their removal proceedings, but left the constitutional questions unresolved.", "The Jennings case involved a class action by aliens within the Central District of California who had been detained under INA Sections 235(b), 236(c), and 236(a), in many cases for more than a year. The plaintiffs claimed that their prolonged detention without a bond hearing violated their due process rights. In 2015, the Ninth Circuit upheld a permanent injunction requiring DHS to provide aliens detained longer than six months under INA Sections 235(b), 236(c), and 236(a) with individualized bond hearings. The court expressed concern that the detention statutes, if construed to permit the indefinite detention of aliens pending removal proceedings, would raise \"constitutional concerns\" given the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Zadvydas . Although the Supreme Court in Demore had upheld DHS's authority to detain aliens without bond pending removal proceedings, the Ninth Circuit construed Demore's holding as limited to the constitutionality of \"brief periods\" of detention, rather than cases when the alien's detention lasts for extended periods. ", "Recognizing the constitutional limits placed on the federal government's authority to detain individuals, the Ninth Circuit, as a matter of constitutional avoidance, ruled that the INA's detention statutes should be construed as containing implicit time limitations. The court therefore interpreted the mandatory detention provisions of INA Sections 235(b) and 236(c) to expire after six months' detention, after which the government's detention authority shifts to INA Section 236(a) and the alien must be given a bond hearing. The court also construed INA Section 236(a) as requiring bond hearings every six months. In addition, the court held that continued detention after an initial six-month period was permitted only if DHS proved by clear and convincing evidence that further detention was warranted. ", "In Jennings , the Supreme Court rejected as \"implausible\" the Ninth Circuit's construction of the challenged detention statutes. The Court determined that the Ninth Circuit could not rely on the constitutional avoidance doctrine to justify its interpretation of the statutes. The Court distinguished Zadvydas , which the Ninth Circuit had relied on when invoking the constitutional avoidance doctrine, because the post-order of removal detention statute at issue in that case did not clearly provide that an alien's detention after the 90-day removal period was required. According to the Jennings Court, the statute at issue in Zadvydas was sufficiently open to differing interpretations that reliance on the constitutional avoidance doctrine was permissible. But the Jennings Court differentiated the ambiguity of that detention statute from INA Sections 235(b) and 236(c), which the Court held were textually clear in generally requiring the detention of covered aliens until the completion of removal proceedings. And the Court also observed that nothing in INA Section 236(a) required bond hearings after an alien was detained under that authority, or required the government to prove that the alien's continued detention was warranted after an initial six-month period. According to the Court, the Ninth Circuit could not construe the statutes to require bond hearings simply to avoid ruling on whether they passed constitutional muster. Having rejected the Ninth Circuit's interpretation of INA Sections 235(b), 236(a), and 236(c) as erroneous, the Court remanded the case to the lower court to address, in the first instance, the plaintiffs' constitutional claim that their indefinite detention under these provisions violated their due process rights.", "In short, the Jennings Court held that the government has the statutory authority to detain aliens potentially indefinitely pending their removal proceedings, but did not decide whether such indefinite detention is unc onstitutional . While the Supreme Court has not yet addressed the constitutionality of indefinite detention during removal proceedings, the Court had indicated in Demore v. Kim that aliens may be \"detained for the brief period necessary for their removal proceedings.\" And in a concurring opinion in Demore , Justice Kennedy declared that a detained alien \"could be entitled to an individualized determination as to his risk of flight and dangerousness if the continued detention became unreasonable or unjustified.\" ", "After the Jennings decision, some lower courts have concluded that the detention of aliens during removal proceedings without a bond hearing violates due process if the detention is unreasonably prolonged. Some courts have applied these constitutional limitations to the detention of aliens arriving in the United States who are placed in removal proceedings, reasoning that, although such aliens typically have lesser constitutional protections than aliens within the United States, they have sufficient due process rights to challenge their prolonged detention. In reaching this conclusion, some courts have addressed the Supreme Court's 1953 decision in Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei , which upheld the detention without bond of an alien seeking entry into the United States. These courts determined that Mezei is distinguishable because, in that case, the alien had already been ordered excluded when he challenged his detention, and the alien potentially posed a danger to national security that warranted his confinement.", "In addition, while the Jennings Court held that INA Section 236(a) does not mandate that a clear and convincing evidence burden be placed on the government in bond hearings, some courts have concluded that the Constitution requires placing the burden of proof on the government in those proceedings.", "At some point, whether in the Jennings litigation or another case, the Supreme Court may decide whether the indefinite detention of aliens pending removal proceedings is constitutionally permissible. In doing so, the Court may also reassess the scope of constitutional protections for arriving aliens seeking initial entry into the United States. The Court may also decide whether due process compels the government to prove that an alien's continued detention is justified at a bond hearing. The Court's resolution of these questions may clarify its view on the federal government's detention authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Detention of Alien Minors", "paragraphs": ["As discussed, DHS has broad authority to detain aliens pending their removal proceedings, and in some cases detention is mandatory except in certain limited circumstances. But a 1997 court settlement agreement (the \" Flores Settlement\") currently limits the period in which an alien minor (i.e., under the age of 18) may be detained by DHS. Furthermore, under federal statute, an unaccompanied alien child (UAC) who is subject to removal is generally placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), rather than DHS, pending his or her removal proceedings. In 2019, DHS promulgated a final rule that purports to incorporate these limitations with some modifications.", "The Flores Settlement originates from a 1985 class action lawsuit brought by a group of UACs apprehended at or near the border, who challenged the conditions of their detention and release. The parties later settled the plaintiffs' claims regarding the conditions of their detention, but the plaintiffs maintained a challenge to the INS's policy of allowing their release only to a parent, legal guardian, or adult relative. In 1993, following several lower court decisions, the Supreme Court in Reno v. Flores upheld the INS's release rule, reasoning that the plaintiffs had no constitutional right to be released to any available adult who could take legal custody, and that the INS's policy sufficiently advanced the government's interest in protecting the child's welfare.", "Ultimately, in 1997, the parties reached a settlement agreement that created a \"general policy favoring release\" of alien minors in INS custody. Under the Flores S ettlement, the government generally must transfer within five days a detained minor to the custody of a qualifying adult or a nonsecure state-licensed facility that provides residential, group, or foster care services for dependent children. But the alien's transfer may be delayed \"in the event of an emergency or influx of minors into the United States,\" in which case the transfer must occur \"as expeditiously as possible.\" In 2001, the parties stipulated that the Flores Settlement would terminate \"45 days following [the INS's] publication of final regulations implementing this Agreement.\"", "In 2008, Congress enacted the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), which \"partially codified the Flores Settlement by creating statutory standards for the treatment of unaccompanied minors.\" Under the TVPRA, a UAC must be placed in ORR's custody pending formal removal proceedings, and typically must be transferred to ORR within 72 hours after DHS determines that the child is a UAC. Following transfer to ORR, the agency generally must place the UAC \"in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,\" and may place the child with a sponsoring individual or entity who \"is capable of providing for the child's physical and mental well-being.\"", "In 2015, the Flores plaintiffs moved to enforce the Flores Settlement, arguing that DHS (which had replaced the former INS in 2003) violated the settlement by adopting a no-release policy for Central American families and confining minors in secure, unlicensed family detention facilities. In response, the government argued that the Flores Settlement did not apply to accompanied minors. In an order granting the plaintiffs' motion, the federal district court ruled that the Flores Settlement applied to both accompanied and unaccompanied minors, and that accompanying parents generally had to be released with their children. In a later order, the court determined that, upon an \"influx of minors into the United States,\" DHS may \"reasonably exceed\" the general five-day limitation on detention, and suggested that 20 days may be reasonable in some circumstances.", "In 2016, the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling that the Flores Settlement applies to both accompanied and unaccompanied minors, but held that the settlement does not require DHS to release parents along with their children. In any event, the effect of the Flores Settlement has been that DHS typically will release family units in their entirety pending removal proceedings, apparently because of the risks and difficulties that releasing the children only (while keeping the parents in detention) would pose, and the absence of a state licensing scheme for family detention facilities. Moreover, a federal district court has ruled that a \"government practice of family separation without a determination that the parent was unfit or presented a danger to the child\" likely violates due process.", "On August 23, 2019, DHS published a final rule that it claims \"parallel[s] the relevant and substantive terms of the Flores Settlement\" with some important modifications. Among other things, the rule c reates an alternative federal licensing scheme for DHS family detention facilities (which are not eligible for state licensing) that would enable DHS to detain minors together with their accompanying parents throughout the removal proceedings. This modification arguably conflicts with the Flores Settlement's \" general policy favoring release\" of alien minors from government custody. Yet DHS argues that the modification is compelled by changed circumstances, including the increased number of family unit apprehensions since 1997, and that detaining families together pending their removal proceedings \"will enable DHS to maintain family unity \" while enforcing federal immigration laws .", "Under the terms of the 2001 stipulation, the Flores Settlement will terminate 45 days after the government publishes final regulation s \"implementing the A greement. \" The key question in the Flores litigation likely will be whether the final rule \" implement [s] the Agreement\" within the meaning of the settlement's termination provision. If the court overseeing the Flores Settlement concludes that the rule meets that criteria, the DHS rule will effectively supersede the Flores Settlement. That said, w hile the final rule modifies the Flores Settlement to some degree, it largely incorporates the terms of that agreement . Thus, if the rule is upheld, DHS's detention authority over alien minors would remain subject to some constraints ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conditions of Confinement", "paragraphs": ["Although the INA describes when an alien subject to removal may be detained and released from custody, neither the INA nor its implementing regulations currently provide any specific standards for the conditions of confinement. ICE, however, has developed \"Performance-Based National Detention Standards\" (PBNDS) governing the treatment of detained aliens. These standards apply to all ICE detention facilities, contract detention facilities, and state or local government facilities used by ICE through intergovernmental service agreements. ", "The PBNDS require, among other things, clean and safe facilities; adequate food services; access to medical care; adequate bedding and personal hygiene; reasonable disability accommodations; communication and language assistance; access to telephone and mail; visitation rights; access to recreational programs; religious accommodations; work opportunities; and access to legal materials. In addition, CBP, the DHS component with primary responsibility for immigration enforcement along the border, has created similar standards governing the detention of aliens in CBP custody (e.g., arriving aliens in expedited removal proceedings).", "While the Supreme Court has generally addressed challenges to the duration of immigration detention, the Court has not addressed challenges to the conditions of immigration confinement. Lower courts, however, have considered detained aliens' constitutional challenges to the conditions of their confinement, generally under the standard applicable to pretrial detention in criminal cases. Under that standard, a detainee's conditions of confinement violate his or her right to due process if they amount to \"punishment.\" To meet that threshold, a detainee must show that prison officials intended to punish him or her, or that the conditions of detention are not reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective. ", "More specifically, in cases involving claims of inadequate medical treatment, courts have typically analyzed such claims under the \"deliberate indifference\" standard. This standard looks to whether the detaining authority \"knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\" ", "In addition, even though aliens seeking initial entry into the United States typically have lesser constitutional protections than aliens within the United States, some courts have held that aliens detained at the border have substantive due process protections, such as the right to be free from \"inhumane treatment\" or \"gross physical abuse.\" These cases suggest that aliens detained at the border may sometimes challenge the conditions of their confinement.", "In the past, some courts have rejected constitutional challenges to the conditions of immigration detention (or, in some cases, conditions of release), concluding that, while the alleged conditions may have been unpleasant or restrictive, they did not amount to a due process violation. As the Supreme Court once stated in a case about pretrial detention, \"[l] oss of freedom of choice and privacy are inherent incidents of confinement in such a facility. And the fact that such detention interferes with the detainee's understandable desire to live as comfortably as possible and with as little restraint as possible during confinement does not convert the conditions or restrictions of detention into 'punishment.'\" Other courts, however, have ruled unconstitutional conditions of immigration confinement that are particularly unreasonable, such as the deprivation of medical care and other basic necessities. ", "As for minors, the Flores Settlement provides that those apprehended by DHS may be detained only in a \"safe and sanitary\" facility. The Flores Settlement also requires that state-licensed facilities comply with applicable state child welfare laws and building codes, and provide various services including routine medical care and education. In a few instances, the federal district court overseeing the Flores litigation has ruled that DHS violated the Flores Settlement by exposing minors to substandard conditions.", "Additionally, Congress, through appropriations legislation, has imposed certain requirements on the conditions of detention. For example, Congress has directed CBP and ICE to report their compliance with applicable detention facility standards (such as the PBNDS), and to provide certain other detention-related information, including the average length of detention and any instances in which an individual has died while in DHS custody.", "Thus, while federal statutes or regulations generally do not specify the standards for immigration detention, there are some important legal constraints on the treatment of detained aliens."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Immigration Detainers", "paragraphs": ["Generally, upon issuing an administrative warrant, ICE may arrest and detain an alien pending a determination about whether the alien should be removed from the United States. But if an alien is in criminal custody by state or local law enforcement officers (LEOs) (e.g., if an alien is arrested by local police), ICE may take custody of the alien through the use of an \"immigration detainer.\" An immigration detainer is a document by which ICE advises the LEOs of its interest in individual aliens whom the LEOs are detaining, and requests the LEOs to take certain actions that could facilitate removal (e.g., holding the alien temporarily, notifying ICE before releasing the alien). ", "ICE's predecessor agency, the INS, had long issued detainers for potentially removable aliens in criminal custody. Eventually, in 1986, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which, among other things, explicitly authorized the use of detainers for deportable aliens who were arrested for violating controlled substance laws. Citing this authority, as well as its general immigration enforcement powers under the INA, the INS promulgated two separate regulations on detainers, one governing aliens arrested for controlled substance offenses, and another governing aliens arrested for other criminal offenses. In 1997, the INS merged both regulations into one, and that regulation is currently codified at 8 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7 287.7. The detainer regulation, as amended, provides the following:", "Any authorized immigration officer may at any time issue a Form I-247, Immigration Detainer-Notice of Action, to any other Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency. A detainer serves to advise another law enforcement agency that the Department seeks custody of an alien presently in the custody of that agency, for the purpose of arresting and removing the alien. The detainer is a request that such agency advise the Department, prior to release of the alien, in order for the Department to arrange to assume custody, in situations when gaining immediate physical custody is either impracticable or impossible. ", "The regulation further instructs that, upon issuance of a detainer, the LEO \"shall maintain custody of the alien for a period not to exceed 48 hours\" beyond the time when the alien would have otherwise been released (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) to facilitate transfer of custody to ICE.", "Although the detainer regulation instructs that LEOs \"shall maintain custody\" of an alien, reviewing courts have construed the regulation as being permissive rather than mandatory. For example, the Third Circuit has reasoned that the regulation calls a detainer a \"request,\" that INA Section 287(d) does not require state or local LEOs to detain aliens subject to removal, and that DHS's (and the former INS's) policy statements have construed detainers as being \"requests rather than mandatory orders.\" And the Third Circuit has also ruled that construing immigration detainers as mandatory would run afoul of the \"anti-commandeering\" principles of the Tenth Amendment, which prohibits the federal government from compelling state and local officials to enforce a federal regulatory scheme. ", "As a result of judicial construction of the detainer regulation, LEOs may (but need not) notify ICE about an alien's release date and hold the alien pending transfer to ICE. Given the permissive nature of detainers, some state and local jurisdictions have restricted compliance with detainers except in limited circumstances (e.g., the alien has been convicted of or charged with a serious crime). Despite these restrictions, ICE generally issues detainers \"[r]egardless of whether a federal, state, local, or tribal [LEO] regularly cooperates\" with the detainer request.", "While DHS regulations authorize immigration detainers for removable aliens in criminal custody, courts have addressed legal challenges to the continued detention of aliens who would have otherwise been released from criminal custody (e.g., on bail, upon completion of sentence), but who remain detained pending their transfer to ICE. ", "For example, in the past, ICE issued detainers so long as there was \"reason to believe\" the alien was subject to removal. But some courts have invalidated, on statutory or constitutional grounds, the use of detainers that are based only on ICE's representations about an alien's removability or the initiation of an investigation into the alien's immigration status. In Moreno v. Napolitano , a federal district court ruled that ICE's issuance of a detainer without an administrative arrest warrant exceeded its statutory authority under the INA absent a determination that the alien was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained. In Morales v. Chadbourne , which involved the detention of a naturalized U.S. citizen, the First Circuit held that a detainer constitutes a new arrest under the Fourth Amendment, and must be supported by probable cause of the alien's removability. And in Orellana v. Nobles County , a federal district court held that a detainer claiming a \"reason to believe\" that an alien is subject to removal \"does not provide a constitutionally sufficient basis\" to detain an alien absent a \"particularized assessment\" of the alien's likelihood of escaping.", "In response to these court rulings, ICE in 2017 created new immigration detainer guidelines. Among other things, ICE officers \"must establish probable cause to believe that the subject is an alien who is removable from the United States before issuing a detainer.\" And the detainer must come with either an administrative arrest warrant or a warrant of removal (if the alien has been ordered removed) signed by an authorized ICE officer.", "Despite ICE's revised detainer policy, some courts have held that, under the Fourth Amendment, immigration detainers supported by probable cause that an alien is removable still do not justify the alien's continued detention by state or local LEOs unless there is probable cause that the alien has committed a criminal offense giving those LEOs a basis to detain the alien for criminal prosecution. These rulings are largely informed by the Supreme Court's 2012 decision in Arizona v. United States , which held that a state statute authorizing police officers unilaterally to arrest an alien suspected of being removable was preempted by federal law, which exclusively gave the authority to enforce civil immigration laws to federal immigration officers. So these courts reason, because state and local LEOs generally lack the authority to enforce civil immigration laws, they may not hold an alien under an immigration detainer unless there is an independent basis\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as probable cause of a crime\u00e2\u0080\u0094to justify the continued detention.", "In City of El Cenizo v. Texas , however, the Fifth Circuit held that state and local LEOs do not need probable cause of a crime to hold an alien pursuant to an immigration detainer. The court reasoned that many state laws permit seizures without probable cause of a crime, such as those relating to mentally ill individuals, and that \"civil removal proceedings necessarily contemplate detention absent proof of criminality.\" The circuit court also distinguished Arizona because that case \"involved unilateral status-determinations [by the state] absent federal direction ,\" while a detainer \"always requires a predicate federal request before local officers may detain aliens for the additional 48 hours.\"", "Courts are thus divided over whether immigration detainers are permissible under the Fourth Amendment. Some courts have held that a detainer need be supported only by probable cause of an alien's removability to avoid constitutional violations, while other courts require probable cause of criminal activity before an alien may be held pending transfer to ICE. Given that ICE considers detainers to be integral to its efforts to arrest and remove aliens convicted of specified crimes, the split in court opinion on the circumstances when detainers may be honored could have significant consequences for ICE's enforcement policies in different jurisdictions.

But the governing laws on detention may differ depending on the circumstances, including (1) whether the alien is seeking initial admission into the United States or had been lawfully admitted into the country; (2) the type of removal proceedings in which the alien is placed; (3) whether the alien has committed specified criminal or terrorist-related activity; (4) whether the alien is a UAC or falls within some other category subject to special rules for detention; and (5) whether the alien is being held for formal removal proceedings or has been ordered removed and is awaiting effectuation of the removal order.", "Typically, DHS may detain aliens who are placed in formal removal proceedings, but may release the alien on bond, on his or her own recognizance, or under an order of supervision pending the outcome of those proceedings. In some cases, such as those involving aliens who have committed specified crimes, or aliens arriving in the United States who are placed in expedited removal proceedings, detention is mandatory and the alien may not be released from custody except in limited circumstances. Furthermore, DHS generally must detain aliens who have received final orders of removal for up to 90 days while their removal is effectuated, and the agency retains the discretion to detain certain classes of aliens after that 90-day period has lapsed.", "However, there are some constraints on DHS's detention power. The Supreme Court has determined that the indefinite detention of aliens after formal removal proceedings would raise \"serious constitutional concerns,\" at least for those who were lawfully admitted into the United States and became subject to removal. And while the Court has recognized that governing statutes confer broad authority to DHS to detain aliens without bond pending their removal proceedings, some lower courts have held that due process requires the government to provide detained aliens with bond hearings after prolonged periods of detention and to prove that any continued detention is justified. Furthermore, DHS's ability to detain family units pending their proceedings remains constrained by the Flores Settlement, which limits the length of detention of alien minors. In addition, while detention litigation has largely centered on the duration of detention, detained aliens have also sometimes brought challenges to the conditions of their confinement. And more recently, some courts have imposed restrictions on DHS's ability to take custody of aliens in state or local law enforcement custody through immigration detainers. ", "As courts continue to grapple over the scope of DHS's detention power, Congress may consider legislative proposals that would either limit or expand that authority. For instance, some recent bills would end mandatory detention entirely, afford all aliens the opportunity to be released on bond pending removal proceedings, and require DHS to prove that any continued detention is warranted. Certain bills would also require DHS to promulgate regulations for detention facilities; require the periodic inspection of those facilities; or impose standards governing the conditions of detention, such as requiring medical screenings and access to food, water, shelter, and hygiene. As for custody determinations, some bills would require DHS to consider ATD programs instead of bond or conditional parole, and require placing some aliens in such programs (e.g., asylum applicants). Other bills would generally require the release of aliens considered \"vulnerable,\" such as those who are detained with children, and limit the amount of any bond. In addition, some bills would create time limitations for an IJ to conduct bond hearings, and require periodic bond hearings while an alien remains in custody.", "Conversely, some bills would specify that an alien may be detained for an indefinite period pending removal proceedings, and require the alien to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he or she is not a flight or escape risk in order to be released. Some bills would also expand the classes of aliens subject to mandatory detention to include aliens present in the United States without inspection, criminal gang members, and aliens arrested for (but not yet convicted of) specified crimes. Other bills would override the Flores Settlement effectively to extend INA Section 235(b)(1)'s mandatory detention scheme governing applicants for admission to family units. Finally, some bills would clarify DHS's detainer authority to provide that ICE may issue detainers so long as there is probable cause that an alien is removable.
