In contrast, more market-oriented program parameters can reduce potential for overproduction and high taxpayer costs, but may provide less support to farmers when prices decline rapidly, particularly if the guarantee is based on current prices.

For an area-based program (such as county or district), farms might suffer a loss but not receive payment if the program payment trigger also requires a loss at the area level. Also, some say the lack of county data might make program administration difficult. National-level programs can be easier to administer (e.g., less data and fewer calculations required) but benefits might not match individual needs if national-level payments do not correspond to local farm losses. ", "By design, a trigger based on individual farm loss would provide better farm-level yield protection than an area trigger. However, a lower payment rate (or limiting factor on payments) might be needed for budgetary purposes, since farm yield variability is greater than for a larger geographic area and hence the program could trigger payments more often. In contrast, an area-wide plan would provide less protection against individual yield risk while perhaps offering more price protection, depending on how the program is constructed.

If under the next farm bill, payments are made on planted acres instead of historical base acres (\"recoupling\"), benefits would be more closely tied to producer loss.

ACRE was intended to help farmers manage their revenue risks (not just price risk as under other farm programs) and protect against losses from multi-year price declines. Under ACRE, payments for an eligible crop required meeting two separate revenue triggers at both the state and farm levels. While the revenue aspect has been conceptually attractive for many, some have criticized ACRE's use of state crop yields to determine guarantee and payment levels. They point out that a crop loss problem in one part of a state might be offset by better yields in another part, resulting in minimal or no risk protection at a more local level. Another criticism is that, because ACRE payments are determined with season-average prices calculated by USDA at the conclusion of the marketing year, payments arrive at least a year after harvest. ", "ARRM addresses these issues by using a five-year Olympic average revenue trigger based on yields in crop reporting districts (CRDs), which are multi-county areas, rather than statewide yields. This change is designed to shift the program's risk protection closer to the farm. In addition, the program uses harvest prices from the crop insurance program (which are based on current futures market prices for harvest-time contracts) for calculating actual and guarantee levels of revenue. This would speed up the payment delivery because crop insurance prices are available many months before season-average farm prices can be calculated. Like ACRE, the program has revenue triggers at both the CRD and farm levels.

For non-insurable crops, the guarantee is 1.20 times 50% of higher of (adjusted NAP or CCP yield) times planted acreage times NAP price.", "Geographic loss trigger: Eligible farms must be located in a secretarial-disaster-declared county (or contiguous county) or have an overall yield loss greater than 50% with at least one crop having at least a 10% yield loss due to disaster-related conditions.", "Eligible acres: All planted or prevented planted acreage.", "Payment calculation: 60% of (program guarantee minus total farm revenue) where total farm revenue is sum for all crops of (harvested production times national average farm price) plus government payments plus crop salvage value.", "Payment limit: Payments are limited such that the guaranteed level cannot exceed 90% of expected farm income. Total payments per person may not exceed $100,000 for SURE plus the three livestock-related disaster programs of the 2008 farm bill. Since 2009, SURE payments are not available to producers if their three-year average adjusted gross income (AGI) is $500,000.", "Conservation compliance: Yes.", "Cost to producer: Participants must purchase crop insurance (or NAP if crop insurance is not available) on all crops in their farming operation such that SURE is supplemental, not primary, insurance.", "Budget cost estimate: Due to its expiration on September 30, 2011, SURE has no baseline funding in future years.", "WTO status: Notified as non-product-specific AMS (i.e., amber box) but eligible for non-product-specific de minim i s exemption.", "Appendix B. Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and Agriculture Policy ", "The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction (or joint committee) established in the 112 th Congress was instructed to develop a bill to reduce the federal deficit by at least $1.2 trillion over the 10-year period ending in FY2021. The committee was established under the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). Because of its authority, the joint committee's budget recommendations had potential to significantly affect the development of the next farm bill.", "Legislative Process and Timeline of Joint Committee", "Any legislation resulting from the joint committee recommendations was to proceed under special \"fast track\" procedures that would prevent amendments and limit debate. The BCA allowed both chambers of Congress to pass the original legislation reported by the joint committee with no amendments on a simple majority vote. For the proposal to be considered under the special, expedited procedures, however, it had to be approved by the joint committee by November 23, 2011. Leaders of the joint committee declared an impasse on November 21, 2011, and ended their efforts without passing a bill. ", "A simple majority of the 12 members would have sufficed to move the bill to both chambers for an up or down vote. Ultimately, to become law, the joint committee's bill was required to be passed by both chambers of Congress by December 23, 2011. If a joint committee proposal cutting the deficit by at least $1.2 trillion was not enacted by January 15, 2012, then an automatic spending reduction process that includes sequestration (the cancellation of budgetary resources) would ensue. Congressional committees whose jurisdiction was likely to be impacted by a joint committee proposal\u2014for example, the House and Senate Agriculture Committees\u2014were free to submit their own recommendations to the joint committee. However, no specific policy restrictions or requirements were placed on the joint committee. Hence, it was under no formal obligation to incorporate any recommended actions. ", "House and Senate Agriculture Committees' Letter to the Joint\u00a0Committee", "On October 17, 2011, the leadership of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees offered a letter to the joint committee recommending $23 billion in net deficit reduction from mandatory programs in the agriculture committees' jurisdiction. The unofficial consensus of those claiming to have knowledge of committee intentions was that the $23 billion would be allocated by cutting $13 billion from commodity support, $6 billion from conservation, and $4 billion from nutrition programs. The letter by the leadership of the agriculture committees also said that they were finalizing the specific farm policies that would achieve the $23 billion in deficit reduction and that a complete legislative package would be provided by November 1, 2011. However, no legislative package was forwarded by the agriculture committee leadership to the joint committee. According to news sources, regional differences over the potential \"farm safety net\" design appeared to be the most prominent obstacle to an agreement among agricultural policymakers. On November 21, 2011, the chairs of the House and Senate Agricultural Committees announced that they had developed a package to save $23 billion, but because the joint committee failed to reach an overall agreement, their effort on the package had ended. The agriculture committee leadership is expected to continue the process of reauthorizing the farm bill through the agriculture committees. ", "Concerns with the Joint Committee Fast-Track Process", "Given the 10-year time frame of the joint committee's budget recommendations, many within the broader U.S. agricultural community were concerned that the joint committee's budget recommendations (whether influenced by the agriculture committee leadership's proposal or not) would have provided the framework for the next farm bill, thus precluding the full congressional debate that traditionally underlies the development of U.S. farm policy. As a result, certain agriculture-related interest groups\u2014such as nutrition, agricultural research, renewable energy, rural development, and conservation\u2014feared that they would be shut out of the process.", "After the House and Senate Agriculture Committee leadership issued its October 17 letter to the joint committee, Members of Congress, the news media, and several issue-specific advocacy groups spoke out against the \"secret nature\" of the leadership's policy recommendations and the joint committee's fast-track process, which they said circumvented the traditional open debate of farm policy legislation. On November 3, 2011, Congressman Kind delivered a letter to the joint committee\u2014co-signed by 26 other Members of Congress and endorsed by several advocacy groups\u2014urging it to \"resist any attempt to use the expedited deficit reduction process to create new farm bill programs and entitlements that have not been reviewed by the Congress.\"", "Draft Proposal ", "On November 18, 2011, the press reported on a draft proposal of farm bill recommendations. The document was subsequently described in the press as a preliminary draft under discussion by some but not all members of the agriculture committees' leadership. In the absence of action by the joint committee, proposals in the draft reportedly have been considered as a starting point for farm bill deliberations in 2012.", "The draft borrowed heavily from proposals by Members of Congress and others. The draft contained multiple titles, including a proposal for the farm safety net. Legislative language was not released, which precludes a detailed description of the plan. ", "In broad terms, the proposal would have eliminated most of the current farm programs (except marketing loans) and replaced them with the Ag Risk Coverage (ARC) program as a free supplement to subsidized crop insurance coverage. Producers of most program crops (except cotton) would select one of the following two options. ", "The revenue option is designed to protect against both yield and price declines at the farm level (compared with the state level under the current ACRE program). A payment would be made on 60% of planted acreage when a producer's farm revenue (yield times price) drops below 87% of the farm's five-year average (excluding the high and low years). Losses below 75% of farm revenue would not be covered (crop insurance, if purchased by producers, would cover these losses). Reportedly, the revenue option would be attractive to producers in the Midwest and Plains because it would build on what many consider favorable benefits from the crop insurance program for corn, soybeans, and wheat. The price option would make payments on planted acreage to producers when the national average price during the first five months of the marketing year drops below a reference (target) price. This option is similar to counter-cyclical payments under the 2008 farm bill, except that price protection would be higher than current levels. Reportedly, the price option is designed to be attractive to rice, peanut, and sorghum producers because crop insurance has been viewed as less attractive for these crops. ", "Cotton would be handled separately in an attempt to resolved a long-standing trade conflict with Brazil under the World Trade Organization. The draft described the new cotton program as a stand-alone revenue protection program. Cotton producers have been advocating a separate county-based insurance program (see \" Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX) (Sponsor:\u00a0National\u00a0Cotton\u00a0Council) .\"", "For specialty crops, crop insurance coverage would be expanded. For dairy, current programs would be replaced with a new margin-based payment program, combined with provisions to reduce farm output when margins (milk price minus feed costs) decline.
