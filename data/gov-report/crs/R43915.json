President Obama established adaptation as a prominent part of his Climate Action Plan in June 2013. The November 2013 Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, directed agencies to undertake vulnerability assessments and planning for adaptation. The Administration aimed efforts at reducing agencies' own risks, taking advantage of \"no-regrets\" adaptation opportunities, and actions that promote resilience to climate changes.", "Scope of Report", "This report reviews current actions (as of January 2015) of selected federal departments and agencies to adapt their own missions, infrastructure, operations, and personnel to projected climate change. (It does not address federal programs meant primarily to assist others to adapt, although the boundary is often hard to delineate.) This synthesis is not comprehensive. It identifies common approaches among agencies, examples of specific actions, and notable barriers the federal government faces.", "As of December 2014, almost 40 federal departments and agencies had, to varying degrees, produced climate change adaptation plans, climate change vulnerability assessments, adaptation milestones, and/or metrics to evaluate adaptation performance. These efforts have identified wide-ranging vulnerabilities to potential climate changes, as well as some opportunities.", "Most agencies are in formative stages of their assessments and strategic planning. Some agencies are embarking on more detailed analyses and limited implementation actions. Overall, few examples are apparent of day-to-day agency decisions or actions that are different as a result of their adaptation efforts. Numerous challenges face federal officials in their efforts, including constrained resources, data gaps regarding location-specific climate changes or existing facilities, insufficient personnel training, and\u2014sometimes\u2014low priority among priorities. CRS identified few on-the-ground adaptations and few evaluations, as yet, of the effectiveness and efficiency of alternative adaptation approaches and actions.", "It may not be possible to tally budgetary resources associated with federal adaptation efforts. While some are reported in the President's budget proposals, many are indivisible from the activities with which they are associated, reflecting more of a change in how efforts are undertaken than a change in level of effort.", "Role of Congress", "In light of agencies' risk assessments and adaptation planning, Congress may consider whether agencies have appropriate statutory authorities to take various climate change adaptation actions; how to make data pertinent to adaptation more accessible and usable by federal agencies and the public; the appropriate priority for federal adaptation efforts in the context of agency missions and budgetary constraints; and timeliness of activities. Congress may provide federal agencies direction on how they should organize and fund their adaptation efforts; whether and how to measure and evaluate program performance (e.g., effectiveness at reducing risks to property, lives, and habitats relative to the federal and private investment of an adaptation measure); and desirable reporting and accountability to Congress and the public. Congress also may assess the role, costs, benefits, and timing of adaptation in the context of discussions regarding climate change mitigation and other broad policy fields such as natural disaster, infrastructure, energy, environmental, agricultural, federal lands, defense, health, tax, and budget policies.", "The President's FY2016 budget request and other related administrative announcements roughly concurrent with its release on February 2, 2015, are not addressed in this report. While the President's FY2016 budget request and other recent announcements (e.g., executive order on flooding and proposed FEMA rules) may mention adaptation (or \"resilience\") to climate change, most pertain to programs outside the narrow scope of this report: assessments and actions that agencies may be undertaking to address potential risks to their missions, property, operations, and personnel.

President Obama established adaptation as a prominent part of his Climate Action Plan, released in June 2013. The November 2013 Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change , continued the Administration's focus on federal climate change preparedness through agency and department adaptation planning. As of December 2014, more than 30 federal departments and agencies had, to varying degrees, produced climate change adaptation plans, vulnerability assessments, adaptation milestones, or adaptation performance metrics to address the potential vulnerabilities of their missions, property, operations, and/or personnel to climate change. Agency efforts identified wide-ranging vulnerabilities that could result from climate changes, as well as some opportunities.", "For Congress, federal adaptation efforts may raise questions of authorization, appropriations, and oversight. For example, some Members of Congress may be concerned that federal agency climate change adaptation planning may divert resources and attention from other, more near-term asset management and mission challenges. In contrast, other Members may believe that current federal action to adapt to climate change is insufficient. Key policy issues include determining the level, nature, and mechanisms for investment in federal agency adaptation.", "This report aims to synthesize information on the federal government's efforts to adapt itself to a changing climate. It is largely based on a CRS review of the adaptation planning documents released by selected federal departments and agencies as of late 2014, as well as several reviews by other organizations. Part I of the report provides an introduction to federal adaptation efforts and challenges and a synthesis of these efforts. Part II provides summaries of these efforts at the department and/or agency levels.", "The report's focus is the state of climate change knowledge and planning by federal agencies addressing the potential vulnerabilities of their missions, property, operations, and/or personnel related to projected climate change. The review is not intended to address how agencies and their programs may help or hinder nonfederal entities in adapting to climate change, although the lines between these topics are sometimes blurry. For example, agencies may consider that achieving their core missions may be at risk unless they assist nonfederal entities in addressing climate change-related risks. Programs within the Department of Agriculture (USDA) may consider that they must assist agricultural producers in anticipating and preparing for climate change in order to maintain productivity. Or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has a mission to help communities finance drinking water infrastructure, may consider that expanding the water utility sector's understanding of climate change risks is important to delivering future water services.", "This report is not comprehensive.

As examples, numerous federally owned and federally supported assets may face increasing flood risk as a result of projected sea-level rise. The opening of Arctic waters with less summer sea ice increases opportunities for resource development, tourism, and shipping, while also raising concerns for security, safety, and protection of natural and cultural resources. Similarly, while many factors contribute to the incidence of wildfires, some researchers expect further warming and, in some areas, precipitation changes to increase risks of wildfires on federally owned lands.", "Additional researchers have identified highways, railways, and aviation facilities that have experienced failures in recent years due to high temperatures and other extreme weather, which are expected to increase with climate change. The Department of Defense (DOD) expects that thawing permafrost and rising sea levels will affect military training, installations, and land management in some locations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) considers that climate change will affect the department's mission and strategic goals. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) expects that changing climate conditions will increase demand for genetically engineered crops, resulting in a corresponding increase in numbers of permits, field trials, inspections, and other demands on APHIS resources.", "Numerous resource managers, engineers, economists, and others have identified benefits of anticipating and preparing for climate change. For example, some analysis suggests that every dollar spent on certain risk mitigation projects to reduce the consequences of natural disasters can generate several times more in monetary benefits. Based on such findings, many researchers and observers believe that anticipating the wide array of likely impacts and reducing risks through adaptation measures would be more efficient than incurring damage, responding to the immediate event, and then adapting reactively. The benefits of adaptation are expected to increase as the climate system moves further and further from historical \"climate normals,\" and as man-made and natural systems increasingly exceed their thresholds of tolerance and resilience. A range of stakeholders has recommended that federal agencies begin the adaptation process.", "What is meant by \"adaptation\" to ongoing and expected climate change varies widely. For some, adaptation may be development of new varieties of plants that will grow optimally in the expected climate. For others, it may mean new investments to address opportunities and risks associated with the opening of sea routes in the Arctic, or to protect or replace infrastructure at risk (e.g., from flooding with more extreme rainfall or from higher temperatures).

The executive order reshuffled and upgraded preceding organizational arrangements. Notably, it sunset and built on the work of the Interagency Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (CCATF), begun in 2009 (discussed later). In its place, E.O. 13653 established a higher-level coordinating Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience (the Council), chaired by the White House and drawing on at least 33 White House offices and federal agencies, to be represented at the Deputy Secretary level. The Council's administration was provided by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).

E.O. 13653 also required agencies to track their implementation of federal high-priority adaptation actions.", "E.O. 13653 also created a State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience composed of invited elected officials including 8 governors, 16 county and local officials, and 2 tribal leaders. At its final meeting on July 16, 2014, the Task Force provided recommendations to the Council.

E.O. 13653 Section 2(c) charged a variety of interagency working groups with ensuring that climate change risk considerations were incorporated into their processes. Those groups included the Steering Committee on Federal Infrastructure Permitting, the Task Force on Ports, the Interagency Working Group on Coordination of Domestic Energy Development and Permitting, and the Federal Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice. Many observers would consider more mainstreaming a positive and important objective. Some instances of mainstreaming adaptation efforts in agencies are identified in a later section of this report.", "On December 18, 2014, CEQ issued updated draft guidance for review and public comment on when and how federal agencies should consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their evaluations of proposed federal actions under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

To illustrate some ways in which climate changes may be relevant, the guidance provides the following description:", "For example, a proposed action may require water from a stream that has diminishing quantities of available water because of decreased snow pack in the mountains, or add heat to a water body that is exposed to increasing atmospheric temperatures. Such considerations are squarely within the realm of NEPA, informing decisions on whether to proceed with and how to design the proposed action so as to minimize impacts on the environment, as well as informing possible adaptation measures to address these impacts, ultimately enabling the selection of smarter, more resilient actions.", "The temporal bounds for considering climate change risks to a project under NEPA review would be determined by the life span of the proposed project, so that this guidance might be most relevant to long-lived projects including infrastructure that may have a useful life of several decades or more.

Most agencies' assessments have been at a \"high level\"\u2014broad views with generalized information, though some have been preparing detailed assessments for locations that appear to have mission-critical vulnerabilities.

For example, the Departments of Energy and Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), among others, released climate change adaptation plans dated in 2014 that do not contain evidence of having conducted the vulnerability assessments or adaptation planning required by Section 5, \"Federal Agency Planning for Climate Change Related Risk,\" of E.O. 13653. Their \"plans\" may contain many pages of descriptions in general terms of potential climate change impacts, but do not evidence the location- and event-specific analysis displayed by many other agencies. In some cases, it is also apparent that little updating occurred in the 2014 releases of planned actions identified in the 2012 documents. Acknowledgements of the modicum of current information on adaptation planning in these agencies, and explanations of the reasons (e.g., other pressing priorities, greater priority to serving the agencies' customers, lack of financial or expert resources, etc.) might be more useful to Congress and other readers than the generalized and outdated presentations provided.", "CRS found few specific adaptation actions, either planned or taken, that tangibly alter federal vulnerabilities at this point in time. Certainly, selected actions resulting in risk reductions are apparent in some agencies. Some may provide significant risk reductions over time. This seems especially likely where agencies have identified mission-critical infrastructure that may be vulnerable to certain aspects of climate change, or secondary effects that may result from, say, outages or overload of electricity supply during extreme events. These examples appear to represent the leading edge rather than the norm. The challenge in identifying on-the-ground adaptation actions may reflect the high level of aggregation of most agency-level reporting. It is likely that some federal programs are acting to reduce their vulnerabilities to climate in ways that may not be captured in agency-level planning processes.

[T]he crux of this report is, rather than creating a stovepipe within the DOD organizational structure to deal with climate change, we are going to integrate climate change considerations into the normal processes, the day-to-day jobs of everybody.\"", "A few active examples include the following:", "The Northwoods Climate Change Response Framework of the U.S. Forest Service in northern Wisconsin. It encompasses a team of land management agencies, private forest owners, conservation organizations, and others to share information and experience, develop tools to factor climate change into decision making, and implement those new tools. The Exotic Plant Management Teams of the National Park Service (NPS) identify, control, and manage plant species that are new to, and may have substantial impacts on, park resources. Such efforts may help protect parks from invasive species whose ranges shift because of climate change, although the teams' mandate is broader than, and not formally part of, NPS's climate adaptation framework. A 2012 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Facilities Design Guide incorporated climate change-related principles that \"could be used by NASA facilities project managers when determining design requirements and writing statements of work, and by Architect-Engineer firms who might have limited experience working with NASA.\" This guidance is limited to principles and references to requirements and standards, and is a step toward considering what design modifications might be merited in a particular project.

DOD, in its FY 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap , concluded that \"A changing climate will have real impacts on our military and the way it executes its missions. The military could be called upon more often to support civil authorities, and provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in the face of more frequent and more intense natural disasters. Our coastal installations are vulnerable to rising sea levels and increased flooding, while droughts, wildfires, and more extreme temperatures could threaten many of our training activities. Our supply chains could be impacted, and we will need to ensure our critical equipment works under more extreme weather conditions. Weather has always affected military operations, and as the climate changes, the way we execute operations may be altered or constrained.\" The report further noted that climate change-related effects have been observed at DOD facilities. \"The Department of Agriculture estimates an increase of as much as 100 percent in the number of acres burned by wildfires annually by 2050, putting residents and firefighting employees at greater risk, further impacting the agency's budget and resources, and reducing its capacity to provide other critical services.\u00a0Fire suppression funding has already grown from 16 percent in 1995 to 42 percent of the U.S. Forest Service's budget.\" USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) is evaluating whether its commodity crop programs encourage adaptation to a changing climate or the status quo. Many NASA facilities have been damaged or closed temporarily in recent years by tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires. An agency-wide assessment noted that more than two-thirds of its infrastructure property value\u2014assets worth about $20 billion\u2014are within 16 vertical feet of current sea level and at risk from sea-level rise (see Figure 5 ) alone. The assessment found that \"changing climate will impact facility operations (e.g., water management, energy demands), natural resources (e.g., tidal marsh habitat and increase in invasive species, increase in pest species), infrastructure that is vital to mission success (e.g., flooded buildings and launch assets, buildings too hot to work in), quality of life in the community (e.g., increased number of hot days), and the region's economy (e.g., increased percentage of public funds for utility costs, firefighting, and flood control).\" NASA identified climate-related vulnerabilities to its missions including launch capabilities, space operations, ground systems, and training and test facilities. NASA is pursuing detailed analysis and planning at a minimum of eight facilities. NPS found that \"The widespread nature of climate change effects amplifies ongoing resource impacts such as habitat fragmentation, water scarcity, pollution, invasive species, etc.\" It plans to \"mainstream\" climate change adaptation at a policy level; it is proposing that its fundamental mission of preserving lands in their historical condition may need to be rethought in an era of shifting climates and habitats. NPS is also analyzing specific park and facility issues associated with climate change. EPA plans to examine how climate change may put at risk more contaminant releases due to severe weather, flooding, or sea-level rise at Corrective Action sites, Superfund sites, Brownfield sites, chemical storage facilities, or landfills. Saltwater intrusion and increased ground water salinity in coastal aquifers may also increase the permeability of clay liners installed at waste sites such as landfills, allowing contaminants to spread to nearby properties. Contaminant releases may increase the risk of adverse health and environmental impacts.", "The Text Box above describes an action at Hoover Dam that could help improve an agency's resilience to a changing climate, though it is not an adaptation to projected climate change per se. The likelihood of complementary benefits of actions that improve the resilience of agencies to climate changes and that provide other benefits may make it difficult to discern and evaluate, now and in the future, the degree to which agencies are making adaptations and what effect they may have.", "Most agencies and multiagency consortia are regionalizing their approaches to climate change adaptation. This facilitates their assessments according to physically linked locations. Looking more broadly, this is also a complicating factor as definitions of regions often differ across programs and agencies.
