Most Catholics in Northern Ireland (45%) consider themselves Irish, and many desire a united Ireland (nationalists).", "On April 10, 1998, the UK and Irish governments and key Northern Ireland political parties reached a negotiated political settlement.

It called for devolved government\u2014the transfer of power from London to Belfast\u2014with a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee in which unionist and nationalist parties would share power; it also contained provisions on decommissioning (disarmament) of paramilitary weapons, policing, human rights, UK security normalization (demilitarization), and the status of prisoners.", "Despite a much-improved security situation since 1998, full implementation of the peace accord has been challenging. For many years, decommissioning and police reforms were key sticking points that generated instability in the devolved government.

These challenges include reducing sectarian strife, fully grappling with Northern Ireland's legacy of violence (often termed dealing with the past); addressing lingering concerns about paramilitary and dissident activity; and promoting further economic development. Brexit also may have significant political and economic repercussions for Northern Ireland. The future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was a central issue in the UK's withdrawal negotiations with the EU and has posed a key stumbling block to approving the withdrawal agreement in the UK Parliament. Brexit also has renewed questions about Northern Ireland's status within the UK in the longer term.", "Successive U.S. Administrations and many Members of Congress have actively supported the Northern Ireland peace process. For decades, the United States provided development aid through the International Fund for Ireland (IFI). In recent years, congressional hearings have focused on the peace process, police reforms, and the status of public inquiries into several murders in Northern Ireland in which collusion between the security forces and paramilitary groups is suspected.

This civil rights movement was met with violence by some unionists, loyalists, and the police, which in turn prompted armed action by nationalists and republicans. Increasing chaos and escalating violence led the UK government to deploy the British Army on the streets of Northern Ireland in 1969 and to impose direct rule from London in 1972 (between 1920 and 1972, Northern Ireland had its own regional government at Stormont, outside Belfast).", "For years, the British and Irish governments sought to facilitate a negotiated political settlement to the conflict in Northern Ireland. After many ups and downs, the two governments and the Northern Ireland political parties participating in the peace talks announced an agreement on April 10, 1998.

While the agreement acknowledged that a substantial section of the population in Northern Ireland and a majority on the island desired a united Ireland, it recognized that the majority of people in Northern Ireland wished to remain part of the UK. If the preferences of these majorities were to change, the agreement asserted that both the British and Irish governments would have a binding obligation to bring about the wish of the people; thus, the agreement included provisions for future polls to be held in Northern Ireland on its constitutional status should events warrant.", "The Good Friday Agreement set out a framework for devolved government\u2014the transfer of specified powers over local governance from London to Belfast\u2014and called for establishing a Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Committee in which unionist and nationalist parties would share power. To ensure that neither unionists nor nationalists could dominate the Assembly, the agreement specified that \"key decisions\" must receive cross-community support. The Executive Committee would be composed of a first minister, deputy first minister, and other ministers with departmental responsibilities (e.g., health, education, employment).", "In addition, the Good Friday Agreement contained provisions on several issues viewed as central to the peace process: decommissioning (disarmament) of paramilitary weapons; policing; human rights; UK security normalization (demilitarization); and the status of prisoners. Negotiations on many of these areas had been extremely contentious. Experts assert that the final agreed text thus reflected some degree of \"constructive ambiguity\" on such issues.", "Finally, the Good Friday Agreement created new \"North-South\" and \"East-West\" institutions. A North-South Ministerial Council was established to allow leaders in the northern and southern parts of the island of Ireland to consult and cooperate on cross-border issues.

The text of the agreement states \"those who hold office should use only democratic, non-violent means, and those who do not should be excluded or removed from office.\" Unionists argued, however, that Sinn Fein could not assume its ministerial posts on the Executive Committee until the IRA had surrendered at least some of its weapons. Sinn Fein countered that the Good Friday Agreement did not specify a start date for decommissioning. The IRA had been observing a cease-fire since 1997, but it viewed decommissioning as tantamount to surrender and had long resisted such calls.", "In the fall of 1999, former U.S. Senator George Mitchell (who had chaired the peace talks) led a review of the Good Friday Agreement's implementation. This review succeeded in getting unionists to drop their precondition that the IRA had to decommission first, before Sinn Fein representatives could assume their ministerial posts. After 27 years of direct rule from London, authority over local affairs was transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive on December 1, 1999.

As a result, Trimble resigned as First Minister on July 1, 2001. Negotiations led by the British and Irish governments to restore the devolved government proved difficult. Finally, in late October 2001, the IRA announced that it had put a quantity of arms, ammunition, and explosives \"beyond use\" to \"save the peace process.\" The UUP agreed to rejoin the Executive, and the Assembly reconvened in November 2001. Trimble was reelected First Minister, and Mark Durkan, the new leader of the SDLP, was elected Deputy First Minister.", "In April 2002, the IRA carried out a second act of decommissioning. Still, unionists continued to worry about the IRA's long-term commitment to the peace process. In early October 2002, police raided Sinn Fein's Assembly offices and arrested four officials as part of an investigation into a suspected IRA spy ring.

Immediately after the elections, the DUP asserted that it would not enter into government with Sinn Fein until the IRA disarmed and disbanded; the DUP also refused to talk directly to Sinn Fein. ", "For much of 2004, negotiations to restore the devolved government continued but remained stalemated. Talks were further complicated by a December 2004 bank robbery in Belfast, which police believed was carried out by the IRA, and the January 2005 murder of a Belfast man, Robert McCartney, during a bar brawl involving IRA members. These incidents increased pressure on the IRA and Sinn Fein to address the additional issue of IRA criminality. In April 2005, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams effectively called on the IRA to abandon violence and pursue politics as an \"alternative\" to \"armed struggle.\"", "In July 2005, the IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign. It instructed all members to pursue objectives through \"exclusively peaceful means\" and to \"not engage in any other activities whatsoever.\" All IRA units were ordered to \"dump arms.\" Although many analysts asserted that the IRA's statement was the least ambiguous one ever, unionists were wary, noting that it did not explicitly address the issue of IRA criminality or whether the IRA would disband. The DUP and other unionists also wanted Sinn Fein to support Northern Ireland's new police service. In September 2005, Northern Ireland's Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) announced that the IRA had put all of its arms beyond use, asserting that the IRA weaponry dismantled or made inoperable matched estimates provided by the security forces.

It called for negotiations between November 2006 and March 2007 on forming a new devolved government; during this time, the DUP would agree to share power with Sinn Fein and Sinn Fein would agree to support the police service and join the Policing Board.

The 2006 St. Andrews Agreement called for the devolution of policing and justice powers by May 2008, but the DUP and Sinn Fein remained at odds over this timeline. The DUP maintained that May 2008 was merely an aspirational date to which it was not committed.", "In July 2008, the lack of progress on devolving police and justice powers from London to Belfast prompted Sinn Fein to block the regular meetings of the Executive Committee, essentially bringing the formal work of the Assembly to a standstill. Executive Committee meetings resumed in late November 2008 following a DUP-Sinn Fein agreement on a road map for devolving authority for policing and justice affairs. As part of the road map, the DUP and Sinn Fein agreed that a Northern Ireland Justice Department would be established, as well as an independent attorney general for Northern Ireland. In addition, the parties agreed on a system for choosing a justice minister. Although Executive Committee ministerial portfolios are normally allocated based on party strength, the two sides asserted that given the sensitive nature of this position, the new justice minister would be elected by a cross-community vote in the Assembly.", "Nevertheless, progress on transferring police and justice powers to the devolved government remained slow. Nationalists increasingly warned that the failure to do so could lead to renewed political instability.

As part of the deal, the Hillsborough Agreement also established a timeline for developing a new mechanism to address how contentious sectarian parades in the region were managed. On March 9, 2010, the Northern Ireland Assembly approved the Hillsborough Agreement.

The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)\u2014Northern Ireland's former, 92% Protestant police force\u2014was long viewed by Catholics as an enforcer of Protestant domination. Human rights organizations accused the RUC of brutality and collusion with loyalist paramilitary groups. Defenders of the RUC pointed to its tradition of loyalty and discipline and its record in fighting terrorism. The Good Friday Agreement called for an independent commission to make recommendations to help \"ensure policing arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos and symbols, are such that ... Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy widespread support from ... the community as a whole.\"", "In September 1999, this independent commission (the so-called Patten Commission) released a report with 175 recommendations. It proposed a new name for the RUC, a new badge, and new symbols free of the British or Irish states. Other key measures included reducing the size of the force from 11,400 to 7,500, and increasing the proportion of Catholic officers (from 8% to 30% in 10 years).

London responded that amendments would deal with human rights training, promoting 50-50 recruitment of Catholics and Protestants, and oversight responsibilities. The Police (Northern Ireland) Bill became law in November 2000. Recruitment for the future Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began in March 2001, but it was unclear whether the SDLP or Sinn Fein would support it or join the 19-member Policing Board, a new democratic oversight body. To help ensure nationalist support, London proposed further concessions in July 2001, including halving the antiterrorist \"Special Branch\" and prohibiting new recruits from using plastic bullets.", "In August 2001, the SDLP broke with Sinn Fein and accepted the British government's additional concessions on policing. The SDLP agreed to nominate representatives to the Policing Board and urged young Catholics to join the new police service. The UUP and the DUP also agreed to join the Policing Board, which came into being on November 4, 2001. That same day, the RUC was renamed the PSNI, and the first class of recruits drawn 50-50 from both Catholic and Protestant communities began their training. Sinn Fein maintained that the changes in the police service were largely cosmetic and continued to charge that the new PSNI\u2014like the RUC before it\u2014would be unduly influenced by elements of the security services opposed to the peace process. Some say that Sinn Fein's absence from the Policing Board discouraged more Catholics from joining the PSNI, and prevented the PSNI's full acceptance by the nationalist community.", "Following the suspension of Northern Ireland's devolved institutions in October 2002, Sinn Fein asserted that its acceptance of the PSNI and the Policing Board hinged on a deal to revive the devolved government and the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to a restored Assembly and Executive. As noted previously, in January 2007, Sinn Fein members voted to support the police and join the Policing Board. Sinn Fein members assumed their places on the Policing Board in late May 2007, following the reestablishment of the devolved government.

In making this decision, UK officials asserted that Catholic officers now made up almost 30% of the PSNI, and as such, the 50-50 process had fulfilled the goal set out by the Patten Commission. Although some nationalists viewed this decision as premature, many unionists applauded it, viewing the 50-50 rule as unfairly discriminating against Protestants.", "In recent years, concerns have increased that not enough Catholics have been seeking to join the PSNI, partly because of lingering suspicions about the police within the Catholic/nationalist community but also because of fears that Catholic police recruits may be key targets of dissident republicans. According to one news report, of the 401 new officers recruited to join the PSNI between 2013 and 2015, only 77 were Catholic.

The DUP and Sinn Fein agreed to allow the UK parliament to implement changes to the welfare system in Northern Ireland and on a financial package worth \u00a3585 million (roughly $832 million) to soften the effects of the welfare and tax credit cuts (funded from the Northern Ireland budget).

Instead, the Haass proposals called for establishing a commission to hold public discussions throughout Northern Ireland on the use of flags and emblems (among other issues) to try to find a way forward. The December 2014 Stormont House Agreement essentially endorsed this idea and asserted that a new Commission on Flags, Identity, Culture and Tradition would be set up, composed of 15 members (with 7 to be appointed by Northern Ireland's main political parties and 8 drawn from outside the government).", "As for parading, the Haass proposals recommended transferring authority over parading from the Parades Commission to the devolved government and establishing two new institutions: one to receive all event notifications and promote community dialogue and mediation; and another to make decisions in cases where parading and protest disputes remained.

Several legal processes for examining crimes stemming from the Troubles also exist.

Some observers point out that more than 3,000 conflict-related deaths have never been solved. In 2005, a Historical Enquiries Team (HET) was established within the PSNI to review over 3,200 deaths relating to the conflict between 1968 and 1998, but, despite the HET's efforts, progress was slow; the HET was wound down at the end of 2014, and its work was taken over by another, smaller unit within the PSNI.

The ICIR would enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about conflict-related violence. It would be established by the British and Irish governments with a five-year mandate and would be entirely separate from the justice systems in each jurisdiction.

Controversy also arose over the UK government's assertion in its policy paper that \"the HIU must protect information that, if [publicly] disclosed, would or would be likely to prejudice national security\" and that \"where the HIU proposes to disclose information of this nature, it will be required to refer the matter to the UK government, which may prevent disclosure, if necessary.\" Victims groups and many nationalists strongly objected to such \"national security caveats,\" viewing them as essentially providing the UK government with a veto over the release of information by the proposed HIU.", "Divisions over such \"national security caveats\" appear to be a key reason that a final deal on establishing the HIU (and the other bodies to deal with the past) was not possible in the Fresh Start Agreement. In February 2016, then-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers stated that the proposed national security provisions have \"led some to assume that the government will be constantly seeking to block the onward disclosure by the HIU of information to victims' families and the public. This is simply not the case.\" She went on to note that during the Fresh Start talks, the UK government offered a \"significant compromise,\" in which families would be told whether the government had required the HIU to withhold certain sensitive information, and that the families or the HIU director would have the right to challenge this decision in Northern Ireland's High Court.

At the same time, unionists have voiced concerns that the HIU could unfairly target former soldiers and police officers, and many argue that any measures to deal with the past in Northern Ireland should contain a statute of limitation on the prosecution of former soldiers. Nationalists strongly reject any such statute of limitations or amnesty to prosecutions.

According to one recent press report, concerns appear to be growing within the UK government that a \"no deal\" Brexit could change the dynamics and lead to a border poll on Irish unification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Many experts contend that Brexit could have serious negative economic consequences for Northern Ireland. According to a UK parliamentary report, Northern Ireland depends more on the EU market (and especially that of the Republic of Ireland) for its exports than does the rest of the UK. Approximately 52% of Northern Ireland exports go to the EU, including 38% to the Republic of Ireland. UK government statistics indicate that Ireland is the top external export and import partner for Northern Ireland. Analysts worry in particular that a \"hard Brexit\" outside of the EU's single market and customs union could jeopardize Northern Ireland's extensive cross-border trade with Ireland, as well as integrated labor markets and industries that operate on an all-island basis. Some analysts note that access to the EU single market has been one reason for Northern Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment, and they suggest that Brexit could deter future investment. Post-Brexit, Northern Ireland also stands to lose EU regional funding (roughly $1.3 billion between 2014 and 2020) and agricultural aid (direct EU farm subsidies to Northern Ireland are nearly $375 million annually).", "UK officials assert that the government is determined to safeguard Northern Ireland's interests and \"make a success of Brexit\" for Northern Ireland. UK and DUP leaders maintain that the rest of the UK is more important economically, historically, and culturally to Northern Ireland than the EU. They note, for example, that the UK is the most significant market for businesses in Northern Ireland, with sales to other parts of the UK worth one and a third times the value of all Northern Ireland exports and nearly four times the value of exports to Ireland (in 2016). UK and DUP officials insist that Northern Ireland will continue to trade with the EU (including Ireland) and that Brexit offers new economic opportunities for Northern Ireland outside the EU."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy", "paragraphs": ["Successive U.S. Administrations have viewed the Good Friday Agreement as the best framework for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. The Clinton Administration was instrumental in helping the parties forge the agreement, and the George W. Bush Administration strongly backed its full implementation. U.S. officials welcomed the end to the IRA's armed campaign in 2005 and the restoration of the devolved government in 2007. ", "The Obama Administration remained engaged in the peace process. In October 2009, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Northern Ireland, addressed the Assembly, and urged Northern Ireland's leaders to reach an agreement on devolving policing and justice powers. In February 2010, President Obama welcomed the resulting Hillsborough Agreement. In June 2013, President Obama visited Northern Ireland in the context of a G8 summit meeting and noted that the United States would always \"stand by\" Northern Ireland. The Obama Administration welcomed the conclusion of both the December 2014 Stormont House Agreement and the November 2015 Fresh Start Agreement.", "Like its predecessors, the Trump Administration has offered support and encouragement to Northern Ireland. In March 2017, Vice President Mike Pence noted that, \"the advance of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland is one of the great success stories of the past 20 years\" and paid tribute to Senator Mitchell and his role in the peace process. In November 2017, the State Department spokesperson expressed regret at the impasse in discussions to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing institutions, urged continued dialogue, and asserted that the United States remained \"ready to support efforts that ensure full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent follow-on cross-party agreements.\"", "Many Members of Congress have actively supported the peace process for decades. Encouraged by progress on police reforms, several Members prompted the Bush Administration in December 2001 to lift a ban on contacts between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the new PSNI. Congress had initiated this prohibition in 1999 because of the former RUC's human rights record. More recently, congressional hearings have focused on the peace process, policing reforms, human rights, and the status of public inquiries into several past murders in Northern Ireland in which collusion between the security forces and paramilitary groups is suspected; these murders have included the 1989 slaying of Belfast attorney Patrick Finucane and the 1997 killing of Raymond McCord, Jr. Some Members of Congress have urged the Trump Administration to name a special envoy for Northern Ireland to signal that the United States remains committed to the region, especially in light of the stalemate in reestablishing the devolved government.", "On the economic front, the United States is an important source of investment for Northern Ireland. According to one study, foreign direct investment by U.S.-based companies in Northern Ireland totaled \u00a31.48 billion (nearly $2.1 billion) between 2003-2004 and 2015-2016 and was responsible for creating 13,875 jobs. Between 2009 and 2011, a special U.S. economic envoy to Northern Ireland worked to further economic ties between the United States and Northern Ireland and to underpin the peace process by promoting economic prosperity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Fund for Ireland", "paragraphs": ["The United States has provided aid to the region through the International Fund for Ireland (IFI), which was created in 1986. Although the IFI was established by the British and Irish governments based on objectives in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, the IFI is an independent entity. The IFI supports economic regeneration and social development projects in areas most affected by the civil unrest in Northern Ireland and in the border areas of the Republic of Ireland; in doing so, it has also sought to foster contact, dialogue, and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists. The United States has contributed more than $540 million since the IFI's establishment, roughly half of total IFI funding. The EU, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand also have provided funding for the IFI. During the 1980s and 1990s, U.S. appropriations for the IFI averaged around $23 million annually; in the 2000s, U.S. appropriations averaged $18 million each year.", "According to the fund, the vast majority of projects that it has supported with seed funding have been located in disadvantaged areas that have suffered from high unemployment, a lack of facilities, and little private sector investment. In its first two decades, IFI projects in Northern Ireland and the southern border counties focused on economic and business development and sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and technology. In 2006, amid an improved economic situation, the IFI released a five-year \"Sharing this Space\" program, in which the IFI announced that it would began shifting its strategic emphasis away from economic development and toward projects aimed at promoting community reconciliation and overcoming past divisions.", "Successive U.S. Administrations and many Members of Congress have backed the IFI as a means to promote economic development and encourage divided communities to work together. Support for paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland has traditionally been strongest in communities with high levels of unemployment and economic deprivation. Thus, many observers have long viewed the creation of jobs and economic opportunity as a key part of resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland and have supported the IFI as part of the peace process. Many U.S. officials and Members of Congress also encouraged the IFI to place greater focus on reconciliation activities, and were pleased with the IFI's decision to do so in 2006.", "However, critics have questioned the IFI's effectiveness, viewing some IFI projects as largely wasteful and unlikely to bridge community divides in any significant way. Others suggest that the IFI was never intended to continue in perpetuity. Some also argue that it is time to move the U.S. relationship with Ireland and Northern Ireland onto a more mature and equal footing, and that U.S. development assistance undermines this goal.", "Between FY2006 and FY2011, neither the Bush nor the Obama Administration requested funding for the IFI in the President's annual budget request. Administration officials maintained that the lack of a funding request for the IFI did not signal a decreased U.S. commitment to Northern Ireland; rather, they asserted that the IFI was expected to begin winding down as an organization. The 2006 \"Sharing this Space\" program was intended as the \"last phase\" of the IFI, and in its 2009 Annual Report, the IFI stated that it would no longer be seeking contributions from its donors. Despite the lack of an Administration request, Congress continued to appropriate funding for the IFI between FY2006 and FY2010 ($17 million for FY2010), viewing these contributions as an important and tangible sign of the ongoing U.S. commitment to the peace process.", "In FY2011, however, amid the U.S. economic and budget crisis, some Members of Congress began to call for an end to U.S. funding for the IFI as part of a raft of budget-cutting measures. Many asserted that U.S. contributions to the IFI were no longer necessary given Ireland and Northern Ireland's improved political and economic situation (relative to what it was in the 1980s). The sixth FY2011 continuing resolution ( P.L. 112-6 ) did not specify an allocation for the IFI, nor did the final FY2011 continuing resolution ( P.L. 112-10 , the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriation Act of 2011).", "Other Members of Congress continued to support U.S. funding for the IFI, noting the financial woes in Ireland and Northern Ireland stemming from the 2008-2009 global recession and increasing concerns about the possibility of dissident violence, and ongoing sectarian tensions in the region. They pointed out that in light of these evolved circumstances, the IFI itself reversed course, announcing it would continue functioning for the near term. Press reports indicated that the British and Irish governments also supported the IFI's continuation, as did Northern Ireland's Executive. Subsequent to the FY2011 budget deliberations, the Obama Administration allocated $2.5 million from FY2011 Economic Support Fund (ESF) resources to the IFI in the form of a grant for specific IFI activities to support peace and security in Ireland and Northern Ireland.", "For FY2012, the Obama Administration requested $2.5 million in ESF funding for the IFI in its annual budget request, asserting that \"a permanent political settlement in Northern Ireland remains a priority foreign policy goal of the United States\" and that \"cross-community relations continue to be hampered by a lack of economic development and high unemployment.\" The FY2012 budget request also noted an increase in sectarian-driven hate crimes and paramilitary-style shootings and assaults in Northern Ireland, and that U.S. assistance would seek to counter these negative trends \"by addressing the root causes of violence and intolerance.\" For similar reasons, in its FY2013 and FY2014 budget requests the Administration proposed $2.5 million for the IFI, as part of its ESF request for the Europe and Eurasia region aimed at promoting peace and reconciliation programs. The Obama Administration did not request funding for the IFI in its subsequent annual budget requests.", "According to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), U.S. funding provided between FY2011 and FY2014 enabled the United States to meet an existing $7.5 million commitment to the IFI's Peace Impact Program, targeting those communities in Ireland and Northern Ireland most prone to dissident recruitment and activity. In June 2016, the Obama Administration allocated $750,000 from FY2015 ESF resources to the IFI in the form of a grant to support activities aimed at promoting a sustained peace in Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland; examples of programs to be supported included cross-community workshops on violence prevention and job training for unemployed youth in communities with high rates of joblessness and sectarian violence. For similar purposes as described for FY2015, the Obama Administration allocated $750,000 from FY2016 ESF funds to the IFI in the form of a grant in December 2016, and the Trump Administration allocated $750,000 from FY2017 ESF funds to the IFI in August 2018, also in the form of a grant. The Trump Administration did not request funding for the IFI in its FY2018 or FY2019 budget requests."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
