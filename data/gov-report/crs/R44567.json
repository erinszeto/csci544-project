Although the CPS's primary purpose is \"to provide detailed labor force characteristics of the civilian non-institutional population and the monthly unemployment rate, a leading economic indicator,\" the survey also produces housing vacancy data and includes regular supplements that gather additional data.

The bureau proposes replacing as much of the mail phase of the 2020 census as possible by offering the public an online response option. In past censuses, the bureau generally followed up with nonrespondents by telephoning them or visiting their homes. The bureau proposes using administrative records, \"data the public has already provided to the government,\" as well as \"information from commercial sources,\" to reduce the extent of nonresponse follow-up in 2020. For whatever nonresponse follow-up remains necessary, the bureau proposes \"using sophisticated operational control systems\" to send employees into the field and \"track daily progress.\"", "The bureau estimates that these innovations could save more than $5 billion.

Summarized below are activities the bureau intended to undertake in FY2017. The budget justification cautioned that insufficient funding for these activities will prevent the bureau from conducting the 2018 census end-to-end test \"with planned systems and operations integration.\" The 2018 test will be the final one before \"2020 production\" begins. If\u2014according to what the budget justification maintained\u2014the bureau cannot prepare adequately for this test and thus cannot reduce the risk inherent in redesigning 2020 census operations, especially the technology supporting field work, it will have to opt for a less innovative, more expensive census.", "The bureau planned to conduct a nationwide 2016 address canvassing test early in FY2017. It was to involve procedures for both in-office and in-field canvassing and \"ensure the address quality and housing unit coverage\" required for a successful census. It also was to \"demonstrate the feasibility of collecting address and spatial data on devices that range from laptops to smartphones,\" running on \"multiple operating systems.\" The 2017 test of the decennial census was to \"mirror key dates and milestones\" for the 2020 census. One 2020 operation that was to undergo its first field test in FY2017 was \"update enumerate,\" in which the bureau was to update certain addresses in the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing System and enumerate the corresponding housing units simultaneously, and was to use the nonresponse follow-up strategy planned for 2020. Part of the 2017 test was to occur \"in an urban site with representative groups\" whose English-language proficiency is limited and who historically have been difficult to enumerate. The bureau was to examine as well \"comprehensive data capture solutions for paper-based data collection operations\" and test responses via the Internet and real-time data processing \"using cloud services.\" The 2017 test was to focus, too, on developing systems to make field operations more efficient, including \"automated enumeration instruments\" on handheld computers and \"dynamic case management\" for streamlining field operations. More broadly, the test was to focus on integrating operations and systems, particularly with the bureau's new information technology (IT) system, CEDCaP. Because of funding uncertainties, the bureau announced on October 18, 2016, that it would scale back the 2017 test, retaining the test of census compliance with a national sample, but ceasing plans to test field operations in three Puerto Rican municipios, the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North and South Dakota, and the Colville Indian Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land in Washington State. At the time, the bureau stated that it would consider including these areas in the 2018 census test. In FY2017, the bureau was to continue researching and testing various administrative records to determine their suitability for the 2020 census. This work was to include \"testing the coverage and quality of the records for obtaining information from non-responding housing units.\"", "Taking another \"significant\" step in FY2017, as the budget justification stated, the bureau was to begin the \"very long and arduous\" process of leasing space for six regional centers to support 2020 census operations.", "In addition, the bureau was to start \"planning the 2020 Census Communications and Partnership Programs\" in FY2017.
