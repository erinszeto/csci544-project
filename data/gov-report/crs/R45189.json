Specifically, it is the first instance over the past several presidencies in which the average and median wait times from nomination to confirmation of a President's first-year nominees were both shorter than the average and median wait times of his immediate predecessor's first-year nominees.", "The decline in the average and median wait times for President Trump's first-year nominees (relative to President Obama's first-year nominees) occurred, in part, as a result of the shorter time nominees waited on the Executive Calendar to be confirmed once reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. For example, President Trump's first-year nominees waited, on average, 34 days from committee report to confirmation (with a median wait of 19 days). In contrast, President Obama's first-year nominees waited, on average, 60 days from committee report to confirmation (with a median wait of 43 days).", " Table 4 reports, for nominees confirmed during a President's first year in office, the number of U.S. circuit and district court nominees who waited a specified period of time from nomination to confirmation.

Ho, was confirmed 59 days after being nominated. Another one of his circuit court nominees, Amul R. Thapar, was confirmed 65 days after being nominated.

In these instances, the procedural track, for a nomination to move forward without unanimous consent, involves the Senate, after taking up the nomination, voting on a cloture motion to bring floor debate to a close. If the requisite majority under Senate rules supports closing debate, an \"up-or-down\" confirmation vote on the nomination must be held after a limited period for consideration.", "During the first year of the Trump presidency, the cloture process (rather than unanimous consent) has been the primary means by which confirmation votes have been reached on U.S. circuit and district court nominations. Cloture was used for each of the 12 circuit court nominations that received a final up-or-down vote and for 5 of the 6 district court nominations that received a final vote.

Some scholars, for example, have noted that as the confirmation process itself has become more contentious, Senators might use roll call votes for many, if not all, nominations as a way to slow down the process or to indicate their concerns, more generally, with the judicial appointment process. Roll call votes might also provide Senators who are motivated by ideological or policy considerations with a way to express their views about, or attempt to influence, the appointment process.
