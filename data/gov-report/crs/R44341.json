The action came in response to Executive Order 13783, in which President Trump directed federal agencies to review existing regulations and policies that potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy resources. Among the E.O.'s specific directives was that EPA review the CPP, which was one of the Obama Administration's most important actions directed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.", "The Clean Power Plan was promulgated in August 2015 to reduce GHG emissions from the generation of electric power. Fossil-fueled electric power plants are the largest individual U.S. sources of GHG emissions, accounting for about 29% of the U.S. total from all sources. The rule set individual state targets for average emissions from existing power plants\u2014interim targets for the period 2022-2029 and final targets to be met by 2030. The targets for each state were derived from a formula based on three \"building blocks\"\u2014efficiency improvements at individual coal-fired power plants and increased use of renewable power and natural gas combined-cycle power plants to replace more polluting coal-fired units. Although EPA set state-specific targets, states would determine how to reach these goals, not EPA.", "EPA has said it would expect the rule's targets to reduce total power plant CO2 emissions by about 32% when fully implemented in 2030 as compared with 2005 levels. A variety of factors\u2014some economic, some the effect of government policies at all levels\u2014have already reduced power sector CO2 emissions more than \u00be of this amount as of 2016.", "Although EPA is proposing to repeal the CPP, it did not propose repeal of the GHG \"endangerment finding,\" the 2009 agency finding that emissions of CO2 and other GHGs endanger public health and welfare. Without addressing the finding, EPA appears to have a continuing obligation to limit emissions of CO2 from power plants. Thus, in addition to the proposed repeal of the CPP, EPA has issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit information on systems of emission reduction that it might require in a future rule to replace the CPP.", "Besides EPA's proposal to repeal the rule, the rule is the subject of ongoing litigation in which a number of states and other entities have challenged it (while other states and entities have intervened in support of it). On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed implementation of the rule for the duration of the litigation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard oral arguments in the case in September 2016, but agreed to an EPA request to continue to hold the case in abeyance while the agency proceeds to repeal the CPP.", "This report provides background information, discusses the statutory authority under which EPA promulgated the rule, and describes the rule's current status as of November 2017. The Clean Power Plan relies on authority asserted by EPA in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This section has been infrequently used and seldom interpreted by the courts, so a number of questions have arisen regarding the extent of EPA's authority and the mechanisms of implementation.", "The report also summarizes the provisions of the Clean Power Plan rule as it was finalized on August 3, 2015, including", "how large an emission reduction would be achieved under the rule nationwide, how EPA allocated emission reduction requirements among the states, the potential role of cap-and-trade systems and other flexibilities in implementation, what role the actions of individual power plants (i.e., \"inside the fence\" actions) and actions by other actors, including energy consumers (i.e., \"outside the fence\" actions) might play in compliance strategies, and what role there would be for existing programs at the state and regional level, such as the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and for broader GHG reduction programs such as those implemented in California.", "The report also discusses options that Congress has to influence EPA's action."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["O n October 10, 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan (CPP), an Obama Administration rule that would limit carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired power plants.

The economy and the health, safety, and well-being of the nation depend on a reliable and affordable power supply, which many contend would be adversely affected by controls on GHG emissions from power plants. At the same time, an overwhelming scientific consensus has formed that there are risks, potentially catastrophic, of greenhouse gas-induced climate change. To determine how the CPP addresses these issues, congressional committees asked EPA officials numerous questions about the rule, and individual Members wrote EPA seeking additional information about the rule's potential impacts. Following the rule's proposal, EPA received more than 4.3 million public comments, the most ever for an EPA rule. EPA responded to questions and comments by making numerous changes to the rule between proposal and promulgation. Congressional and public interest has continued since the final rule was promulgated.", "Besides EPA's proposal to repeal the rule, the rule is the subject of ongoing litigation: a number of states and other entities have challenged it, while other states and entities have intervened in support of it.

Some important context includes the following:", "The Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA in 2007 determined that \"air pollutant,\" as used in the CAA, covers GHGs. EPA thereafter determined that GHGs are air pollutants that were \"reasonably anticipated to endanger both public health and welfare.\" In December 2010, EPA entered into a settlement agreement to issue New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs) for GHG emissions from electric generating units (EGUs) under Section 111(b) of the CAA and emission guidelines under Section 111(d) covering existing EGUs. As discussed further below, EPA finalized NSPSs for GHG emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired EGUs at the same time as the CPP. In the context of U.S. commitments under a 1992 international treaty, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), President Obama pledged in 2009 to reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, consistent with an 80% reduction by 2050. The President set a further goal as the U.S. national contribution to global GHG reductions under the 2015 Paris Agreement: a 26% to 28% reduction from 2005 levels to be achieved by 2025, consistent with a straight-line path to an 80% reduction by 2050. Other countries have also pledged GHG emissions abatement. Parties to the Paris Agreement (currently 143) are legally bound to submit GHG emission reduction pledges, although they are not bound to the quantitative targets themselves. As of April 27, 2017, 165 intended nationally determined contributions\u2014covering more than 190 countries, including all major emitters\u2014had been submitted. The PA entered into force on November 4, 2016, and the United States is a Party, following President Obama's communication of U.S. acceptance of the agreement in September 2016. The U.S. Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is registered in the interim Registry of NDCs. ", "Fossil-fueled EGUs account for 29% of U.S. GHG emissions.

As the figure indicates, U.S. GHG emissions increased during most of the years between 1990 and 2007. GHG emissions decreased substantially in 2008 and 2009 as a result of a variety of factors\u2014some economic, some the effect of government policies at all levels. Since 2010, emissions have fluctuated but have not surpassed 2009 levels.", "The figure also compares recent U.S. GHG emission levels to the 2020 and 2025 emission goals. Based on 2015 GHG emission levels, the United States is more than halfway to reaching President Obama's 2020 goal (17% below 2005 levels). U.S. GHG levels in 2015 were 11% below 2005 levels.", " Figure 2 illustrates the percentage change in net U.S. GHG emissions, U.S. economic activity measured as gross domestic product (GDP, adjusted for inflation), and U.S. population between 1990 and 2015.

CO 2 emissions account for the vast majority (99% in 2015) of GHG emissions from the electricity sector. As illustrated in Figure 3 , CO 2 emissions from electricity generation generally increased between 1990 and 2007, but have generally decreased since that time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: What other steps has EPA taken to reduce GHG emissions?", "paragraphs": ["A: Prior to the promulgation of this rule, EPA had already promulgated GHG emission standards for light-duty and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, using its authority under Section 202 of the CAA. Light-duty vehicles (cars, SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks) and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (including buses, heavy trucks of all kinds, and on-road work vehicles) are collectively the largest emitters of GHGs other than power plants. Together, on-road motor vehicles accounted for 23% of U.S. GHG emissions in 2015. ", "GHG standards for light-duty vehicles first took effect for Model Year (MY) 2012. Allowable GHG emissions will be gradually reduced each year from MY2012 through MY2025. In MY2025, emissions from new vehicles must average about 50% less per mile than in MY2010. The standards for heavier-duty vehicles began to take effect in MY2014. They will require emission reductions of 6% to 23%, depending on the type of engine and vehicle, when fully implemented in MY2018. A second round of standards, to address later medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, was promulgated on August 16, 2016. The new standards cover model years 2018-2027 for certain trailers, and model years 2021-2027 for semi-trucks, large pickup trucks, vans, and all types and sizes of buses and work trucks. The standards are expected to lower CO 2 emissions by approximately 1.1 billion metric tons over the life of the covered vehicles, according to EPA.", "EPA determined that the promulgation of standards for motor vehicles also triggered Clean Air Act requirements that new major stationary sources of emissions (power plants, refineries, etc.) obtain permits for their GHG emissions, and install the Best Available Control Technology, as determined by state and EPA permit authorities on a case-by-case basis, prior to construction. The Supreme Court partially upheld that position in June 2014, provided that the sources were already required to obtain permits for other conventional pollutants. ", "The GHG permitting requirements for stationary sources have been in place since 2011 but were limited by EPA's \"Tailoring Rule\" to the very largest emitters\u2014about 200 facilities as of mid-2014. The Supreme Court's June 2014 decision invalidated the Tailoring Rule, but found that EPA could limit GHG permit requirements to \"major\" facilities, so-classified as a result of their emissions of conventional pollutants. In so doing, the Court limited the pool of potential GHG permittees to a number similar to what the Tailoring Rule would have provided.", "In 2016, EPA also promulgated GHG (methane) emission standards for new oil and gas sources and for new and existing municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. Although these rules have been promulgated, they are being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. President Trump's Executive Order 13783 requires EPA to review the methane emission standards for oil and gas sources. In addition, EPA announced that it will reconsider fugitive emissions monitoring and other requirements that are part of the oil and gas methane standards and has proposed to stay the compliance date for those requirements for two years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Statutory Authority", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Q: Under what authority did EPA promulgate the Clean Power Plan rule?", "paragraphs": ["A: EPA cited Section 111(d) of the CAA for its authority to promulgate the CPP. Section 111(d) requires EPA, among other things, to issue regulations providing for states to submit plans to EPA to impose \"standards of performance\" for existing stationary sources for any air pollutant that meets certain criteria. The first criterion is that the air pollutant must not already be regulated under certain other CAA provisions, which are discussed further below. The second criterion is that CAA Section 111(b) NSPSs apply to the source category for the air pollutant. EPA finalized Section 111(b) NSPSs for new, modified, or reconstructed power plants for CO 2 when it issued the CPP rule. EPA often refers to Section 111(d) regulations as \"emission guidelines.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: What does Section 111(d), the authority EPA cited for the Clean Power Plan, bar EPA from regulating?", "paragraphs": ["A: CAA Section 111(d) bars EPA from regulating an air pollutant pursuant to Section 111(d) if the air pollutant is already regulated as a criteria pollutant under a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) under CAA Section 108 or, per EPA's interpretation, as a hazardous air pollutant (HAP) under CAA Section 112. CO 2 is not regulated as a criteria pollutant or a HAP under either of these provisions. ", "Because the House and Senate passed different versions of CAA Section 111(d) in the 1990 CAA amendments, controversy exists over EPA's authority per the Section 112 criterion. Under the House's provision, CAA Section 111(d)(1)(A)(i) requires EPA to issue a rule under which each state shall submit to EPA a plan adopting standards of performance for any air pollutant that \"is not included on a list published under section 108(a) or emitted from a source category which is regulated under section 112.... \" Because EPA regulates power plants under Section 112 for HAP, some have argued that EPA is barred from regulating power plants under Section 111(d) for CO 2 , although CO 2 is not regulated as a HAP under Section 112. ", "In the final CPP rule, EPA addressed this issue, finding the CAA Section 112 exclusion to \"not bar the regulation under CAA section 111(d) of non-HAP from a source category, regardless of whether that source category is subject to standards for HAP under CAA section 112.\" Describing the House amendment as ambiguous, EPA stated that the \"sole reasonable\" interpretation is that \"the phrase 'regulated under section 112' refers only to the regulation of HAP emissions. In other words, EPA's interpretation concluded that source categories 'regulated under section 112' are not regulated by CAA section 112 with respect to all pollutants, but only with respect to HAP.\" ", "In making this argument, EPA also cited the Senate's 1990 amendment to CAA Section 111(d)(1)(A)(i), which is published in the U.S. Statutes at Large but not in the U.S. Code . The Senate's amendment excludes from Section 111(d) regulation any air pollutant \"included on a list published under section 108(a) or 112.... \" As such, the Senate language excludes air pollutants regulated under Section 112, rather than source categories, from Section 111(d) regulation, which is consistent with EPA regulating power plants for CO 2 under Section 111(d).

", "EPA's 2005 Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) delisted coal-fired electric utility steam generating units from Section 112 of the CAA and, instead, established a cap-and-trade system for mercury under Section 111(d); however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated CAMR in 2008. The court found that EPA's delisting of the source category from Section 112 was unlawful and that EPA was obligated to promulgate standards for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants under Section 112. The court, therefore, did not reach the question of whether the flexible approach taken by EPA for mercury controls (i.e., a cap-and-trade system) met the requirements of Section 111(d).", "In 1996, EPA used its Section 111(d) authority to regulate emissions of methane and non-methane organic compounds from large landfills. These regulations set numeric emission limits and required designated landfills to use certain types of control equipment . In August 2016, EPA revised emission guidelines for existing landfills operating prior to July 17, 2014.", "EPA also used its Section 111(d) authority for another emission guideline rule for large municipal waste combustors, which EPA proposed in 1989 and finalized in 1991 pursuant to a consent decree. However, the 1990 CAA amendments added a new CAA Section 129 specifically to address emissions from solid waste incinerators, including municipal waste combustors. Section 129 required Section 111 NSPS and emission guidelines for solid waste incinerators to meet certain requirements, so the 1991 rule for large municipal waste combustors was superseded by a later rule intended to comply with Section 129. EPA adopted the remaining Section 111(d) emission guidelines for acid mist from sulfuric acid production units, fluoride emissions from phosphate fertilizer plants, total reduced sulfur emissions from kraft pulp mills, and fluoride emissions from primary aluminum plants. Additionally, EPA has promulgated six rules that implement Section 111(d) in conjunction with the requirements of CAA Section 129.

As discussed earlier, when EPA sets NSPSs for a source category for an air pollutant under Section 111(b), EPA triggers Section 111(d)'s applicability for existing sources in the Section 111(b) regulated source category for the air pollutant if the air pollutant is neither regulated as a criteria pollutant under a NAAQS nor, according to EPA's interpretation, regulated as a HAP for the source category. Consequently, EPA's adoption of NSPSs for new fossil-fueled power plants for CO 2 triggered Section 111(d)'s applicability for existing fossil-fueled power plants for CO 2 . ", "Conversely, EPA has no authority to set Section 111(d) performance standards for existing sources in a source category for an air pollutant if EPA has no NSPSs for new sources in the source category for the air pollutant. Many of the petitioners challenging the CPP rule for existing power plants are also challenging EPA's NSPSs for new, modified, or reconstructed power plants for CO 2 . Because the CPP rule is predicated on the Section 111(b) NSPS rule, a court decision striking down or repeal of the NSPS rule would undermine the CPP rule's legal basis. Pursuant to Executive Order 13783 , EPA is currently reviewing the NSPS rule. Because EPA has not completed its review, it is unclear what actions, if any, EPA will take with respect to the NSPS rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: How does Section 111 define the term \"standards of performance\"?", "paragraphs": ["A: The term \"standards of performance\" appears repeatedly in CAA Section 111, including in both the Section 111(b) provisions relating to new sources and the Section 111(d) provisions relating to existing sources in a source category.

Then, EPA or states, as applicable, must base the standard for emissions on the degree of emission limitation that is \"achievable\" through the BSER. The CAA does not define these component terms within the definition of \"standard of performance.\" ", "As discussed in more detail below, in the CPP rule, EPA determined the BSER for existing power plants based on three \"building blocks\": (1) efficiency improvements at affected coal-fired power plants, (2) generation shifts among affected power plants, and (3) renewable generating capacity. It then used the BSER to set CO 2 emission performance rates. EPA used a different approach to determine the BSER for new, modified, and reconstructed power plants.", "Courts have expanded on the CAA Section 111 definition of the term \"standards of performance\" and EPA's interpretation of its component terms, but they have done so generally with respect to NSPSs under Section 111(b) rather than emission guidelines for existing sources under Section 111(d). As discussed further below, EPA explains that the interpretation of the term \"standards of performance\" and related terms is guided by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC , 467 U.S. 837 (1984), in which the U.S. Supreme Court stated that if a statute \"is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" However, some opponents of the CPP rule argue that this framework, known as \" Chevron deference,\" should not apply, at least to certain aspects of EPA's interpretation of CAA Section 111."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Final Rule", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Q: By how much would the Clean Power Plan reduce CO2 emissions?", "paragraphs": ["A: EPA's final rule does not set a future level of CO 2 emissions from existing electricity generators.

In EPA's 2015 analysis, the cost associated with a mass-based approach is generally less than that of the rate-based: EPA estimated the annual incremental compliance cost for the mass-based approach to be $1.4 billion in 2020, $3.0 billion in 2025, and $5.1 billion in 2030. The comparable figures for the rate-based costs were $2.5 billion in 2020, $1.0 billion in 2025, and $8.4 billion in 2030. Because states would generally determine how to comply with the goals established by the final rule, EPA referred to these cost estimates as \"illustrative\" and noted that they \"do not represent the full suite of compliance flexibilities states may ultimately pursue.\" EPA described the cost estimates as including \"the net change in the annualized cost of capital investment in new generating sources and heat rate improvements at coal-fired steam-generating units, the change in the ongoing costs of operating pollution controls, shifts between or amongst various fuels, demand-side energy efficiency measures, and other actions associated with compliance.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: What other estimates of the Clean Power Plan's cost are there?", "paragraphs": ["A: On November 9, 2015, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry group, released a study of the CPP's impacts prepared by NERA Economic Consulting. The study concluded that the annual cost of compliance would range from $29 billion to $39 billion in the period 2022-2033 and that 40 states would see average electricity price increases of 10% or more under at least one of the scenarios it modeled. A study released by the National Mining Association projected sharp increases in the cost of both electricity and natural gas as a result of the rule, with a cumulative increase in wholesale electricity costs of $214 billion between 2022 and 2030. ", "Others, including electric power producers and regional transmission organizations, have argued that it is too early to arrive at cost estimates. Much would depend on decisions to be made by the states as to how they would structure their regulatory programs and on projections of the cost of natural gas, coal, renewable power, and end-use efficiency measures between now and 2030.

The agency used global estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) to estimate the value of climate benefits expected under the CPP. The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from CO 2 emission changes, including net changes in agricultural productivity and human health, property damage from increased flood risk, and changes in energy system costs, such as reduced costs for heating and increased costs for air conditioning. The SCC estimates that EPA used in its analysis of the CPP final rule have since been withdrawn by E.O. 13783. As noted below, in proposing to repeal the CPP, EPA has developed a set of new SCC values that resulted in notably different estimates of the monetary value of changes in CO 2 emissions. ", "The air pollution health co-benefits of the CPP reflect reduced exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and ozone. The health co-benefit estimate was expressed as a range. The range primarily reflected the use of concentration-response functions from different epidemiology studies. Health benefits reflected monetized estimates for the contiguous United States, not the rest of the world. A reduction in premature fatalities each year accounted for over 98% of the total monetized health co-benefits in the 2015 RIA.", "With estimated compliance costs rising to a maximum of $8.4 billion in 2030, EPA's 2015 RIA expected that the CPP would yield net benefits of $24 billion to $49 billion in 2030.", "EPA did not monetize other expected co-benefits of this rule in the 2015 RIA, including reduced morbidity from exposure to nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and methylmercury and reduced effects from acid deposition. EPA also did not quantify pollution effects on ecosystems or visibility.

EPA defined the benefits of the proposed CPP repeal as the \"avoided compliance costs\" (i.e., the compliance costs that would have been incurred to implement the CPP); EPA also refers to this category as \"cost savings.\" Likewise, EPA defined the costs of the proposed CPP repeal as the forgone reductions in CO 2 and non-GHG emissions and the associated forgone climate benefits and health co-benefits, respectively. ", "EPA estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal based on the power sector modeling it conducted in 2015 and under the same illustrative scenarios\u2014mass-based and rate-based\u2014but applied several methodological changes. These modifications include the application of new estimates of the social cost of carbon, changing the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings, and using thresholds to exclude portions of the forgone health co-benefits from the benefit-cost comparison. Based on this approach, EPA reported benefits of the proposed repeal in the year 2030 under the mass-based scenario ranging from about $25 billion to $31 billion and costs of the proposed repeal in 2030 ranging from approximately $20 billion to $50 billion. The comparable figures for the rate-based scenario in 2030 were benefits ranging from about $27 billion to $33 billion and costs ranging from approximately $19 billion to $56 billion. EPA broke out the benefits and costs in several ways that resulted in qualitatively different conclusions. Roughly two-thirds of the comparisons in the primary analysis showed net benefits of the proposed repeal and roughly one-third of the comparisons in the primary analysis showed net costs of the repeal. (See the next question for a more detailed discussion.)", "Notably, these estimates do not reflect changes that have occurred in the power sector since 2015, such as changes in expected electricity demand, expected growth in electricity generation by renewable methods, retirement of older generating units, changes in the prices and availability of different fuels, and state and federal regulations. Such changes may have implications for the projected emissions baseline and therefore for the benefits and costs of the CPP. EPA committed to updating the power sector modeling and publishing updated benefit and cost estimates based on this analysis before it finalizes the proposed repeal.", "In the meantime, EPA also estimated the benefits and costs of the proposed repeal using the more recent power sector projections in the Annual Energy Outlook (AEO), which is developed by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. EPA observed that baseline CO 2 emissions (i.e., CO 2 emissions without the CPP) have been lower in each AEO projection released since EPA conducted the 2015 CPP analysis. EPA used the AEO 2017 projections of CO 2 emissions in scenarios with and without the CPP to estimate the forgone reductions in CO 2 emission and non-GHG emissions and the associated forgone benefits and avoided compliance costs. This analysis suggested that using a more recent emissions baseline would result in lower estimates of the emission reductions expected from the CPP, thereby lowering the estimated compliance costs and benefits. EPA emphasized, however, that the estimates it developed using AEO 2017 are not directly comparable to EPA's 2015 estimates because the accounting treatments of demand-side energy efficiency programs differs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: How do the conclusions of EPA's 2017 benefit-cost analysis compare to those from the 2015 analysis?", "paragraphs": ["A: EPA's 2015 analysis of the CPP concluded that monetized benefits outweighed the monetized costs (i.e., resulted in net benefits) under the illustrative scenarios considered. All of the benefit-cost comparisons presented in the 2015 analysis showed positive net benefits on the order of billions of dollars. EPA's comparisons of the benefits and costs to repeal the CPP, however, offer mixed results, with roughly two-thirds of the benefit-cost comparisons showing net benefits of the proposed repeal and roughly one-third of the comparisons showing net costs of the repeal. ", "EPA compared the monetized benefits and costs of the proposed repeal using four different tallies that showed qualitatively different conclusions. The only variable across the four tallies was the level of forgone health co-benefits considered; the estimates of the avoided compliance costs, forgone climate benefits, and forgone energy efficiency savings did not vary. The first tally compared avoided compliance costs to the forgone domestic climate benefits and forgone energy efficiency savings; it did not include any of the forgone health co-benefits. The second tally compared avoided compliance costs to forgone domestic climate benefits, forgone energy efficiency savings, and the forgone health co-benefits. The third and fourth tallies made the same comparison as the second except they each applied a threshold to the forgone health co-benefits, counting only the forgone health co-benefits that exceeded the defined threshold. Specifically, EPA assumed in the third tally that forgone health co-benefits related to particulate matter reductions fell to zero below the lowest measured level (LML) of each long-term particulate matter mortality study; EPA therefore only counted the forgone health co-benefits exceeding the LML. The threshold applied in the fourth tally assumed that health co-benefits related to particulate matter reductions fell to zero below the fine particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standard.", "The first tally provided the most favorable benefit-cost comparison for the proposed repeal as nearly all of the scenarios show the monetized benefits of the proposed repeal exceeding the monetized costs of the repeal. The fourth tally also provided a generally favorable benefit-cost comparison, with most of its scenarios showing net benefits of the repeal. The second and third tallies showed the least favorable benefit-cost comparison for the proposed repeal, with nearly half of the scenarios in each tally showing net costs of the proposed repeal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: What accounts for the differences in EPA's 2017 cost and benefit estimates as compared to the 2015 RIA's estimates?", "paragraphs": ["A: EPA's 2017 analysis presented some different conclusions about the benefits and costs of the CPP relative to its 2015 analysis. One reason for the difference in qualitative conclusions is that some of the benefit-cost comparisons in EPA's 2017 analysis excluded portions of the estimated health co-benefits. For example, one of the benefit-cost comparisons excluded the forgone health co-benefits entirely to focus on the forgone benefits from the \"targeted pollutant,\" CO 2 . In two of the other benefit-cost comparisons, EPA applied a threshold to the forgone health co-benefits, counting only the forgone health co-benefits that exceeded a defined threshold for ambient particulate matter concentration. That is, EPA assumed that health co-benefits would equal zero for any particulate matter reductions beyond a threshold. The Agency established one threshold on the \"lowest measured level\" of long-term particulate matter from two studies on mortality related to particulate matter. EPA based the second threshold on the current federal air quality standard for fine particulate matter. ", "In addition, EPA's estimates of forgone climate benefits under the proposed repeal were lower than the climate benefits it estimated in the 2015 CPP analysis due to changes it made to the social cost of carbon (SCC). The SCC is an estimate of the monetary value of impacts from CO 2 emission changes, including net changes in agricultural productivity and human health, property damage from increased flood risk, and changes in energy system costs, such as reduced costs for heating and increased costs for air conditioning. In 2015, EPA used estimates of the SCC to estimate the global value of climate benefits expected from domestic CO 2 reductions under the CPP. The SCC estimates, however, have since been withdrawn by E.O. 13783. EPA therefore developed new SCC values under E.O. 13783, which highlighted consideration of domestic measures of the SCC as well as the OMB guidance on selection of discount rates. EPA's new SCC estimates are domestic measures of the social cost of carbon\u2014i.e., estimates of the \"direct impacts of climate change that are anticipated to occur within U.S. borders\"\u2014and are discounted at rates of 3% and 7%. The domestic perspective and use of a 7% rate in particular contributed to lower estimates relative to the estimates used in 2015. EPA characterized the new SCC estimates as \"interim values ... for use in regulatory analyses until an improved estimate of the impacts of climate change to the U.S. can be developed based on the best available science and economics\" but did not give a timeline for updates. EPA also presented sensitivity analyses using global measures of the SCC and alternative discount rates but did not directly compare those estimates to the avoided compliance costs of the proposed repeal.", "Finally, EPA changed the accounting treatment of demand-side energy efficiency savings but this did not alter the qualitative conclusions of the benefit-cost analysis. EPA's 2015 analysis treated savings from energy efficiency measures as a negative cost whereas the 2017 analysis treated the energy efficiency savings as a positive benefit. That is, EPA broke out the energy efficiency savings from the compliance cost tally presented in the 2015 analysis and moved energy efficiency savings to the tally of forgone benefits in the 2017 analysis. This meant that the avoided compliance cost tally increased by the same amount that the forgone benefits tally increased and therefore there was no change in the comparison of benefits and costs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Impacts on the Electricity Sector", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Q: How might the Clean Power Plan impact electricity prices and electricity bills?", "paragraphs": ["A: In the 2015 RIA, EPA estimated that the national average retail electricity price in the contiguous United States would increase by less than 1% in both 2025 and 2030 compared to EPA's baseline scenario.

The reliability safety valve would allow for a 90-day reprieve from CO 2 emissions limits. EPA stated that the safety valve could be triggered only in an emergency situation. For example, extreme weather events are \"of short duration and would not require major\u2014if any\u2014adjustments to emission standards for affected EGUs or to state plans.\"", "EPA also implemented a formal memorandum of joint understanding on maintaining electric system reliability with the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission so as to coordinate efforts while the state compliance plans are developed and implemented.

However, the bullet points below offer a few examples, drawn from litigation filings and EPA documents, to illustrate the range of issues. ", "Petitioners challenging the rule have argued that EPA lacks authority under CAA Section 111(d) to regulate CO 2 from power plants because power plants, as a source category, are already regulated for HAP under CAA Section 112. As noted above, EPA has interpreted Section 111(d) as requiring regulation of CO 2 from existing power plants because CO 2 is not a HAP, and other conditions for regulation under Section 111(d) are met. Petitioners have also challenged EPA's design of the CPP as exceeding EPA's scope of authority under Section 111(d). They have argued, for example, that Section 111(d) authorizes EPA to require only measures that can be applied to an individual source's performance by the source's owner or operator (\"inside the fence line\"), such as adoption of pollution control devices or other design or operational standards. Conversely, they say, it does not authorize what they characterize as a reorganization of the nation's electric grid or states' energy economies. EPA has countered, in part, that \"the phrase 'system of emission reduction' \u2026 is capacious enough to include actions taken by the owner/operator of a stationary source designed to reduce emissions from that affected source, including actions that may occur off-site and actions that a third party takes pursuant to a commercial relationship with the owner/operator.\" Various petitioners have challenged different technical or programmatic aspects of the rule as arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of agency discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law pursuant to the judicial review provisions of Section 307 of the CAA. EPA responded to numerous comments along these lines in its rule preamble, Response to Comments documents, and other technical support documents as well as in its response in opposition to the motions to stay. The parties also debated the standards by which a court should evaluate EPA's interpretation and implementation of CAA Section 111. Under Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , a court reviewing an agency rule defers to the agency's interpretation of a statute in cases where the statutory language is ambiguous, if the agency's interpretation is reasonable. In the 2014 Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA decision, however, the Supreme Court opined that where a statutory interpretation by EPA \"would bring about an enormous ... expansion in EPA's regulatory authority\"\u2014which some petitioners claim the CPP rule would do\u2014a court should demand \"clear congressional authorization.\" Some petitioners have argued for CAA Section 111(d) to be interpreted more narrowly than EPA interprets it so as to avoid certain constitutional issues. For example, states and other petitioners have argued that the CPP impermissibly invades traditional state police powers over the electrical grid and commandeers state legislatures. EPA has previewed its responses to such arguments in its Response to Comments and other documents and in its response in opposition to the motions to stay. EPA calls the rule a \"textbook example of cooperative federalism\" and argues that states can opt to do nothing, in which case the federal plan option imposes no new regulatory obligations on states. Some challengers have disputed the adequacy of certain other procedural aspects of the issuance of the rule, alleging impermissible deviation from the proposed rule or impermissible ex parte contacts. Supporters of the rule assert that the final rule is a logical outgrowth of the proposal and comments and that EPA properly followed all other procedural requirements.", "Some of these issues were addressed during oral argument."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Q: Will the proposed repeal affect the Clean Power Plan litigation?", "paragraphs": ["A: On November 9, 2017, the D.C. Circuit ordered that the CPP litigation continue to be held in abeyance (i.e., paused temporarily) for 60 days from th at date to allow EPA\u00a0to reconsider \u00a0the CPP. Because the repeal of the CPP has not been finalized, it is difficult to predict the next steps for the litigation. The court could remand or continue to pause the litigation\u2014actions that the court considered when it first issued the abeyance.

They have been joined by other petitioners including a labor union, a rural electric cooperatives association, several other fossil-fuel-related companies and utilities, and several industry and trade groups. Most of the states and a number of the nonprofit organizations that intervened in support of the CPP case also intervened in the NSPS challenge in support of EPA. As noted above, the finalization of NSPS for new air pollutant sources under Section 111(b) of the CAA is a prerequisite for the use of authority under Section 111(d) to regulate existing sources, so this litigation could threaten EPA's basis for the CPP.", "On March 30, 2017, the D.C.
