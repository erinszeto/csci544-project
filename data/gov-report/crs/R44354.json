It also has a direct interest in establishing trade negotiating objectives and potential consideration of a future Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA). Services account for 78% of U.S. private sector gross domestic product (GDP), 82% of private sector employees in 2015, and an increasing portion of U.S. international trade. \"Services\" refer to a growing range of economic activities, such as audiovisual, construction, and computer and related services; energy; express delivery; e-commerce; financial, legal, and accounting services; retail and wholesaling; transportation; telecommunications; and travel. Services include end-use products, such as legal services and financial products. Many services, such as distribution or transportation services, also facilitate other parts of the economy, helping goods move through global supply chains.", "To open foreign markets to U.S. businesses and address trade barriers to services, which may be in the form of government regulations, the United States has engaged in multiple trade agreement negotiations. The World Trade Organization (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provides the foundation or floor on which rules in other agreements on services are based, including in U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs). Trade in services is addressed in U.S. bilateral and regional FTAs, including the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), concluded in October 2015. However, ongoing negotiation efforts to update GATS are stalled, even as technology and services trade have evolved significantly since GATS went into effect in 1995. To address these issues, 23 parties are engaged in discussions on a potential sector-specific, plurilateral agreement to further liberalize trade in services.", "Negotiations on a proposed Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) were launched in April 2013, with the United States and Australia initially at the lead. TiSA participants account for about 70% of world trade in services and include the European Union, in addition to the United States and Australia. Some key major emerging markets, including Brazil, China, and India, are not currently parties to the TiSA negotiations, though China has indicated an interest in joining. While TiSA negotiations are occurring outside of the WTO, the agreement is reportedly being structured so that it can be potentially \"multi-lateralized\" in the future and incorporated into the GATS, making it applicable to all WTO members.", "The final structure and sectors to be covered in TiSA remain under negotiation, but some key issues have emerged. For the United States, significant interests include expanding market access beyond the current GATS commitments, building disciplines on transparency, setting common rules for cross-border data flows and digital trade, and ensuring fair competition with state-owned enterprises. TiSA participants have conducted 21 negotiating rounds through 2016, and aim to complete negotiations in 2017 but no new rounds are scheduled. The outlook and timeline for the ongoing TiSA negotiations remains uncertain, as participants are tackling difficult and complex issues such as regulatory processes and digital trade frameworks. The new U.S. administration position on TiSA is unclear.", "TiSA is one of several trade agreements that may be considered by Congress in the near future. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation in June 2015 which expires on July 1, 2018, with a possible extension to July 1, 2021. As part of TPA, Congress established principal trade negotiating objectives for services. If agreement on TiSA is reached while TPA is in effect, and if certain statutory requirements are met, TPA would provide for expedited legislative consideration of legislation to implement a final TiSA.

The 1995 World Trade Organization (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and subsequent annexes, established basic rules for global trade in services.

Today, more than half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods traveling within supply chains, while over 70% of the world's services imports are intermediate services. Intermediate services embedded within a value chain include, for example, transportation, logistics, and distribution to move goods along; research and development to invent new products; telecommunications to open e-commerce channels; business services such as legal, accounting, marketing or human resources; and financial services to provide credits for the manufacture and consumption of goods.", "Compared to goods, the basic characteristics of services are complex. Services are intangible and can be conveyed in various formats, including electronically and direct provider-to-consumer contact. To address this complexity, members of the WTO have adopted a system of classifying four modes of delivery for services to measure trade in services (see the text box below). These modes are also used to classify government policies that affect trade in services in international agreements.", "Distinguishing among the various modes of delivery of services is important for analyzing and measuring the volume of services trade, and because the different modes of delivery can raise different policy issues. There are two distinct categories for measuring trade in services: cross-border trade and services supplied through affiliates. ", "Cross-border services trade data measures U.S. exports and imports, and includes Modes 1, 2, and 4, as noted above. Looking at total cross-border trade, in 2015, services accounted for 33.2% of the $2.2 trillion total U.S. exports (of goods and services) and 17.7% of the $2.76 trillion total U.S. imports. The United States has continually realized surpluses in services trade, which have partially offset large trade deficits in goods trade in the U.S. current account.", "Many services require direct contact between the supplier and consumer and, therefore, service providers often need to establish a presence in the country of the consumer through foreign direct investment (FDI) as characterized by Mode 3. In 2013, U.S. firms supplied $1.3 trillion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates. In 2013, foreign firms sold $878.5 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States ( Table 1 ).

These non-tariff barriers (NTBs) are often in the form of government regulations. Governments regulate service industries to pursue legitimate policy objectives and protect consumers from harmful or unqualified providers (e.g., licensing doctors to ensure they have the relevant medical training to protect public health). Concerns may arise if regulations are protectionist or are applied in a discriminatory and unnecessarily trade restrictive manner to foreign service providers that limits market access, favoring domestic providers. Because services transactions more often require direct contact between the consumer and provider than is the case with goods trade, many of the \"trade barriers\" that foreign companies face pertain to the establishment of a commercial presence in the consumers' country in the form of direct investment (Mode 3) or to the temporary movement of providers and consumers across borders (Modes 2 and 4).", "As the world's largest exporter of services, the United States has an interest in opening international markets and has been at the forefront of efforts to liberalize trade in services.

The WTO has allowed exceptions to MFN in plurilateral agreements, such as the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) and WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA).

The group has been referred to as a \"coalition of the willing,\" as each participant sees a national interest in further liberalizing trade in services. The United States has, or is negotiating, regional and bilateral FTAs with most of the TiSA partners (see Figure 1 ). Supporters believe a single plurilateral agreement would ensure a common level playing field across a broad set of countries, simplifying conducting business across multiple TiSA counties, and set a new global standard for services trade that could ultimately be incorporated into the WTO in the future.

This not only gives the industries in those countries room to grow domestically, but could make these emerging markets attractive to foreign providers as well.", "Of those emerging market countries currently not participating, only China has expressed interest in joining TiSA to date.

Reportedly, the United States has expressed concerns about China's readiness to undertake the commitments that TiSA would require, given China's limited implementation of other agreements to date, including its GATS commitments and its failure to date to join the GPA. The EU and some observers have argued for China's participation sooner rather than waiting for the conclusion of TiSA. ", "Other observers argue it would be easier to conclude TiSA negotiations without the involvement of these large emerging economies, and then invite those countries to join once the high level of liberalization commitment is established. Supporting this argument is the concept that the agreement overall is reportedly being structured so that it can be \"multi-lateralized\" in the future and incorporated into the WTO. The chances or timeline of such an event are uncertain, as the TiSA itself remains under negotiation. If TiSA is incorporated into the GATS, in whole or in parts, one concern may be whether it would become harder to update as services evolve, as any new negotiations could be impeded similar to the Doha Round.

As mentioned, the core text of TiSA would reinforce and build on the core disciplines of GATS, including most-favored nation treatment, national treatment, and facilitating agreements between parties to establish sector-specific mutual recognition agreements (MRAs). Transparency. Improved transparency and predictability are key principles the United States seeks in its trading partners. TiSA provisions may include good governance and regulatory practices similar to those in other U.S. FTAs. These commitments go beyond GATS, including requirements to publish current and proposed regulations and provide a sufficient period for anyone to comment. Negotiators are working to reconcile the regulatory obligations with the varied processes for consulting with public stakeholders that are used by various TiSA participants. The United States and EU, for example, have different processes for developing regulations and timelines for permitting public comment. One option may be for TiSA to permit multiple pathways for parties to achieve transparency and public consultation objectives. According to the EU report of the November 2016 round, the Transparency annex is complete though the text is not yet public. Domestic R egulation . The section on domestic regulation would establish rules related to the licensing and qualification requirements for professional services that are set by each party. Movement of Natural Persons. Rules on the movement of foreign nationals (Mode 4) aim to facilitate people providing services through temporary entry and stay for business travel. This has been an issue of concern to Congress. As such, the United States has not yet put forward an offer in this category and may only extend a limited offer, if at all. In the proposed TPP, USTR Ambassador Michael Froman committed that the agreement would not have an impact on U.S. immigration law or policy or visa system. The EU has proposed including commitments on the temporary entry and stay of highly skilled professionals in a separate protocol rather than within the TiSA core text. State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The United States has proposed rules on SOEs, a newer discipline that has gained importance because of the growing economic significance of SOEs in some markets. The TPP SOE chapter is said to be the basis for the TiSA text to ensure non-discrimination, transparency, competition, and fair treatment regardless of ownership. The United States reportedly is seeking to expand on the TPP definition of SOEs to also include cooperatives. Government Procurement. TiSA participants are discussing whether to include disciplines on government procurement of services to complement the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). Most TiSA participants, including the United States and EU, are active or observer parties to the GPA. The TiSA could present an opportunity to encourage or require that all participants become members of the GPA or could build on the GPA commitments. Reportedly, the draft TiSA language is less ambitious than the GPA, and the United States is currently deferring to the existing WTO GPA rather than seeking additional commitments in TiSA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Access", "paragraphs": ["To address market access liberalization commitments, TiSA participants have agreed to a hybrid approach, combining both a negative list and a positive list. Under a negative list, FTA provisions apply to all categories and subcategories of services in all modes of delivery, unless a party to the agreement has listed a service or mode of delivery as an exception. In contrast, under a positive list, each party must specifically opt in for a service sector to be covered and may include limitations. The United States typically uses a more comprehensive negative list approach in its bilateral and regional FTAs for both market access and national treatment. Because of disagreements among the TiSA participants, and in the interest of being compatible with the positive list approach in the GATS, TiSA negotiating parties decided to use a hybrid approach: market access obligations to liberalize service markets are being negotiated under a positive list, while national treatment obligations are being negotiated under a negative list. Each participant's offer is built on the GATS structure for market access commitments, including horizontal commitments and those by individual service sector. The positive list may be viewed as less ambitious because new inventions or sectoral innovations would not be covered under TiSA unless they are explicitly added in the future. As national treatment obligations are made on a negative list basis, each participant's schedule would list any reservations that would be excluded from the obligations (including existing measures, or specific sectors or areas of regulation). One source of contention is whether parties are able to broadly carve out \"new services.\" The EU and some other negotiating parties are pressing to exempt all \"new services\" from all non-discrimination rules to ensure their ability to regulate in the future, but others fear the precedent it would set for future TiSA participants.", "Participants agreed to submit their \"best FTA\" commitments for TiSA market access offers. This concept is not without controversy, as some participants have limited liberalization commitments in other trade agreements.

Many in the business community support TiSA as an opportunity to increase consistency and predictability among trading partners, to eliminate trade barriers, and to strengthen and update multilateral rules on trade in services beyond the WTO GATS. On the other hand, TiSA may raise general debates about agreements to liberalize trade, as well as debates specific to liberalization in the services sector, especially as services can cover sensitive public policy issues like healthcare. Opponents of services liberalization, including some labor unions and civil society groups, are concerned about a number of issues, including the potential impact of TiSA on wages and employment as well as the authority of national, state, and local governments to regulate services. Import-sensitive sectors that might become more open under TiSA, and thus more competitive, may be more likely to oppose it.", "One issue specific to services regulation is that, while USTR is the lead trade negotiator for the United States, individual U.S. states and localities regulate many services. Lawyers, for example, are state-licensed and are often required to re-apply in order to practice in other states. Similarly, insurance services are regulated at a state level. Some observers contend that it is unclear how USTR is consulting with state regulators who would be responsible for implementing any commitments made by USTR. The USTR has taken different approaches in the past. For example, in the proposed TPP, the United States listed all state regulations as non-conforming measures and thus excluded them from any TiSA requirements. Another option could be for USTR to engage a subset of state regulators and potentially open market access in some sectors in a subset of states who voluntarily agree to the commitments.", "One current issue is the application of the TiSA commitments to non-participants. TiSA participants agreed to conduct the negotiations on a non-MFN basis, that is, the benefits of the commitments made by TiSA participants would apply to only those countries that have signed on to the agreement, thereby avoiding \"free-riders.\" ", "Also being debated is whether or not each TiSA participant would be required to automatically extend to all TiSA participants the same benefits that it grants to other countries in future bilateral or regional free trade deals it enters.

Recognizing that outstanding issues remain and the U.S. position under a new administration is unclear, the parties canceled the planned December 2016 meeting but are meeting to determine how best to move forward in 2017. Given the progress to date, it is unlikely new members will join the TiSA negotiations unless they are willing to accept the provisions agreed to thus far in negotiations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The outlook and timeline for the ongoing TiSA negotiations remain uncertain, as participants are tackling difficult and complex issues. The congressional oversight role in trade negotiations could include monitoring progress on the TiSA negotiations and whether they are advancing or fulfilling TPA negotiating objectives on services trade.", "Over the past two years, Congress has conducted oversight of TiSA during House and Senate hearings in the context of digital trade and cross-border data flows, the USTR budget and nominations, and TPA. Some Members voiced support of using TiSA to set \"21 st century rules\" and open markets to expand exports, while others have expressed concern about potential policy impacts in such areas as immigration and cybersecurity. Congress may consider holding TiSA-specific hearings to focus on certain aspects or areas of concern for members.", "Potential policy issues for Congress and negotiators to address include the following.", "To what extent are TiSA negotiations consistent with U.S. trade negotiating objectives on services as defined in the TPA legislation? How would TiSA fit with other existing and potential U.S. FTAs, such as the proposed TPP and T-TIP? What impact would a completed TiSA have on the U.S. economy and various stakeholders? What would be the positive and negative impacts of completing TiSA? Should TiSA participants encourage other countries, such as the emerging economies with potentially large services markets and industries\u2014Brazil, China, and India\u2014to join? Would their presence dilute the negotiations' current level of ambition or spur more countries to join? Would the incorporation of TiSA into the WTO GATS make it more effective because of the expanded geographic reach or less effective if it becomes harder to update due to diverse interest of WTO members? As advancements in information technology expand the number and types of services that can be traded and help to create new types of services, traditional companies and start-ups are pushing for a modernized legal and regulatory framework to reflect the fast-evolving digital world. Is it possible to develop a trade arrangement that is precise enough to be effective and flexible enough to take into account rapid changes in the services sector? How should policymakers balance the responsibility of sovereign governments to regulate services to ensure the safety and privacy of their citizens against the objective of expanding markets in order to increase economic growth and efficiency? Should the United States pursue regulatory cooperation efforts in addition to trade agreements in specific service areas such as cross-border data flows where cultural and legal differences and changes in technology limit what can be achieved in trade agreements? Given that many regulations in the United States are set by states, should federal policymakers involve states on a regular or formalized basis in ongoing and future trade negotiations or regulatory cooperation efforts, and if so, how? Are there significant service trade barriers to U.S. service providers at the sub-central level in key markets overseas?"], "subsections": []}]}]}}
