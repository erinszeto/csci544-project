To limit the amount a state's allocation could fluctuate from one year to the next, BBRA 99 modified the allotment distribution formula and established new floors and ceilings.

From this pool, 1.05% was set aside for the territories that fully exhaust their original allotments. Each such territory received a percentage of the available 1.05% pool equal to that territory's original allotment divided by the sum of original allotments for such territories. Then the states that did fully expend their original allotments within the three-year deadline received access to redistributed funds from the remaining pool equal to the amount by which their three-year spending exceeds their original allotments.

Under prior law, states' allotments under CHIP paid only the federal share of costs associated with separate (non-Medicaid) CHIP programs. The federal share of costs associated with covering targeted low-income children under Medicaid was paid for by Medicaid. State CHIP allotments were reduced by the amounts paid by Medicaid for such costs. BIPA authorized the payment of the costs of targeted low-income children under Medicaid, and the costs of benefits provided during periods of presumptive eligibility, from the CHIP appropriation rather than the Medicaid appropriation, and as a conforming amendment, eliminated the requirement that state CHIP allotments be reduced by these (former) Medicaid payments.

Revision of Methods for Reallocation of Unspent FY2000 and FY2001, and Extension of the Availability of Such Funds . The law also established a new method for reallocating unspent funds from FY2000 and FY2001 allotments. For each of these years separately, a pool of unspent funds was created from the unused allotment amounts of those states that did not fully expend their original allotments within the applicable three-year time frame. From this pool, 1.05% was set aside for the territories that fully exhausted that original allotment. Each such territory received a percentage of the available 1.05% pool equal to that territory's original allotment divided by the sum of original allotments for such territories. For each year separately, each state that did not spend its full original allotment by the three-year deadline retained 50% of its unspent funds. Then the remaining pool was allocated to each state that fully expended (exceeded) its original allotment by the three-year deadline. The redistribution amount for each such state was based on the proportion of its excess spending relative to the total amount of excess spending for all such states.

For such services, these federal CHIP funds could be used to pay the difference between the CHIP enhanced federal matching rate and the regular Medicaid federal matching rate the state received for these children. Qualifying states included those that on or after April 15, 1997 had an income eligibility standard of at least 185% of the FPL for at least one category of children, other than infants.

An initial redistribution was required of up to half of states' unspent FY2005 original allotments as of March 31, 2007 (capped at $20 million per state)\u2014after 2\u00bd years of availability. For a state to forgo unspent FY2005 funds on that date, the state's total CHIP balances (from the FY2005-FY2007 original allotments) as of March 31, 2007, had to be at least double what the state projected to spend in federal CHIP funds in FY2007. These funds were also targeted to shortfall states in the order in which those shortfalls were experienced. The initial redistribution of unspent FY2005 funds did not replace the regular redistribution at the end of the allotment's three-year period of availability. Thus, among the states that did forgo half of their unspent FY2005 funds on March 31, 2007, any amount still unspent at the end of FY2007 was redistributed to other states after having been available for three years.

For FY2009 onward, annual allotments would be available for two years, with unspent funds available for redistribution first to shortfall states and then toward bonus payments, described below. Child Enrollment Contingency Fund . The law established a new contingency fund (for making payments to states for certain shortfalls of federal CHIP funds), which receives deposits through a separate appropriation each year through FY2013, and makes payments of up to 20% of the available national allotment for CHIP to each eligible shortfall state. CHIP performance bonus payment s to offset additional enrollment costs resulting from enrollment and retention efforts.

The law created a state option to waive the five-year bar for Medicaid or SCHIP coverage to pregnant women and children who are lawfully residing in the United States and are otherwise eligible for such coverage when certain requirements are met. State option for providing premium assistance. The law established a state plan option for premium assistance to enroll in employer-based health insurance, and eliminated barriers to providing such premium assistance. States were also required to provide outreach, education, and enrollment assistance for families of children likely to be eligible for premium assistance subsidies under CHIP, or a waiver approved under \u00a71115, and amended the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to streamline coordination between public and private coverage, including making the loss of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility a \"qualifying event\" for the purpose of purchasing employer-sponsored coverage. Quality of care and health o utcomes. The law included provisions to strengthen quality of care and health outcomes of children under Medicaid and CHIP. Improving access to benefits . CHIPRA added or modified several benefits available to children under CHIP (e.g., dental, mental health). Specifically, dental services became a required benefit under CHIP, and subject to certain conditions, states were permitted to provide dental-only supplemental coverage to children enrolled in group or employer coverage who otherwise meet CHIP eligibility criteria. With regard to mental health coverage, the law ensures that the financial requirements and treatment limits applicable to mental health or substance use disorder benefits must be no more restrictive than the financial requirements and treatment limitations applicable to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered under the state CHIP plan. Application of a prospective payment system for services provided by f ederally qualified health centers and rural health clinics . The law required states that operate separate and/or combination CHIP programs to reimburse FQHCs and RHCs based on the Medicaid prospective payment system, and the Secretary is required to report to Congress on the effects of the new prospective payment system on access to benefits, provider payment rates or scope of benefits. Premium grace p eriod. CHIPRA required states to provide CHIP enrollees with a grace period of at least 30 days from the beginning of a new coverage period to make premium payments before the individual's coverage may be terminated, and states must provide notice that failure to make a premium payment within the grace period will result in termination of coverage. Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission . The law established a Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission to review program policies under both Medicaid and CHIP affecting children's access to benefits, and will make recommendations to Congress concerning such access policies. Program integrity and miscellaneous provisions . The law included provisions to improve program integrity and data collection (including some provisions that affected the Medicaid program), and required the Secretary of HHS to conduct a new, independent federal evaluation of 10 states. Extension of Medicaid DSH allotments for Tennessee and Hawaii. The law extended the special DSH allotment arrangements for Tennessee and Hawaii through a portion of FY2012.
