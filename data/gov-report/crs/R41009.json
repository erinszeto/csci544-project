Most jobs in the United States are covered by Social Security. In addition, the Social Security Act extends Social Security coverage to U.S. citizens and resident aliens who are employed abroad by U.S. companies as well as those who are self-employed in a foreign country. Generally, a U.S. worker abroad and his or her employer would be required to contribute both to the U.S. Social Security system and the Social Security system of the country where the work is performed based on the same work. International agreements eliminate dual Social Security taxation in these circumstances by allowing workers and their employers to contribute to only one Social Security system (either the U.S. or the foreign system depending on the terms of the agreement). In addition, international agreements allow workers who divide their careers between the United States and a foreign country to fill gaps in Social Security coverage by combining work credits under each country's system to qualify for benefits under one or both systems. If a worker qualifies for benefits based on combined (totalized) work credits, the benefit payable under either system is prorated to take into account the actual period during which the worker was covered by that system.", "By eliminating dual Social Security taxation, international agreements reduce the cost of doing business abroad. As a result, they can affect the competitiveness and profitability of U.S. companies with foreign operations and promote investment in the United States by foreign companies. In addition, international agreements affect the application of certain provisions of the Social Security Act, including the alien nonpayment provision. The alien nonpayment provision places restrictions on the payment of U.S. Social Security benefits to noncitizens who reside outside the United States, with broad exceptions. These payment restrictions may be waived for beneficiaries who are residents of a country with which the United States has an agreement.", "Since 1977, the President has had the authority to negotiate Social Security agreements with foreign countries. Currently, there are 24 Social Security agreements in force. Another agreement (with Mexico) has been signed, but is not in force. In December 2007, about $28 million was paid in monthly benefits to about 146,200 recipients under U.S. Social Security agreements.", "Many observers agree that international Social Security agreements can be beneficial for U.S. companies and workers. However, some policymakers have expressed concerns about the agreements. Because the agreements impose a cost to the U.S. Social Security system, some policymakers point to the need for greater assurances that the data relied upon by the United States to administer the agreements are complete and accurate, a condition necessary to protect the Social Security trust funds from improper payments. In addition, they point to concerns about the role of Congress in the approval process for potential agreements, as well as the need for enhanced reporting requirements and periodic evaluation of agreements in force. These and other concerns are reflected in legislative proposals such as S. 42 and H.R. 132 in the 111th Congress.", "This report provides an overview of the purpose and operation of international Social Security agreements.

Dual Social Security taxation occurs when a worker from one country is employed or self-employed in another country and both countries require that contributions be paid on the same work. In the United States, Social Security-covered workers and their employers each pay 6.2% of earnings up to $106,800 (in 2010) in Social Security payroll taxes. Workers who are self-employed pay 12.4% of net self-employment income up to $106,800, and they may deduct one-half of payroll taxes from federal income taxes.", "Most jobs in the United States (whether performed by U.S. citizens or noncitizens) are covered by Social Security. The Social Security Administration (SSA) estimates that 94% of workers in paid employment or self-employment in the United States are covered by Social Security. Workers who are not covered by Social Security include", "(1) state and local government workers participating in alternative retirement systems;", "(2) election workers earning less than $1,500 in 2010;", "(3) ministers who choose not to be covered and certain religious sects;", "(4) federal government workers hired before 1984 (elected office holders, political appointees and judges are mandatorily covered regardless of when their service began);", "(5) college students working at their academic institutions;", "(6) household workers earning less than $1,700 in 2010, or those under age 18 for whom household work is not their principal occupation;", "(7) self-employed workers with annual net earnings below $400;", "(8) foreign students and exchange visitors who hold F-1, J-1, M-1, Q1 and Q2 visas if the work is performed in connection with their studies or for the purpose of their visit to the United States (J-1 visa holders who are in the United States for 18 months or longer are required to pay Social Security payroll taxes); and", "(9) foreign agricultural workers who hold H-2A visas.", "The Social Security Act also extends Social Security coverage to U.S. citizens and residents who are employed abroad by U.S. companies (such as in a branch office located in a foreign country). As a result, a U.S. worker and his or her employer generally would be required to contribute both to the U.S. Social Security system and the Social Security system of the country where the work is performed. In addition, U.S. citizens and residents who are employed by a foreign affiliate of a U.S. company are subject to dual taxation if the company has entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, under Section 3121(l) of the Internal Revenue Code to provide U.S. Social Security coverage for employees of a foreign affiliate.", "In some cases, a U.S. company that sends an employee to work in a foreign country may agree to pay both the employee's and the employer's shares of the Social Security tax under the foreign system. Payment of the employee's share of the Social Security tax by the employer may be considered taxable compensation to the employee, thereby increasing the employee's income tax liability. The employer may also agree to pay the additional income taxes on behalf of the employee. SSA estimates that, in some countries, an employer's foreign Social Security costs can be as much as 65% to 70% of the employee's salary when foreign Social Security taxes and additional income taxes paid by the employer on behalf of the employee are taken into account.", "In addition, the Social Security Act extends Social Security coverage to U.S. citizens and residents who are self-employed in a foreign country. As a result, self-employed workers abroad are also affected by dual Social Security taxation.", "International agreements eliminate dual taxation on the same earnings by requiring workers and their employers to contribute to only one Social Security system based on the coverage provisions of the agreements. Each agreement includes coverage rules that determine whether a person's work is covered under the Social Security system of the sending country or that of the foreign country. Under the agreements, there are basic rules of coverage that apply to workers who are sent by an employer to work abroad as well as self-employed workers (see rules regarding the self-employed). In addition, there are special rules and exceptions that apply allowing for variation in the rules of coverage under each agreement. ", "The basic rule of coverage under international agreements is the territoriality rule , which specifies that a worker is covered under the Social Security system of the country where the work is performed, unless the agreement provides for one or more exceptions. Generally, exceptions are provided to \"ensure that a worker is covered under the system of the country to which he or she has the more direct connection.\" A primary exception to the territoriality rule is the detached worker rule . Under this rule, a person who is sent by an employer to work in a foreign country on a temporary basis (generally five years or less ) would continue to be covered under the sending country's system and would be exempt from coverage under the foreign system. Conversely, a person who is sent by an employer to work in a foreign country for more than five years would be covered under the foreign system and would be exempt from coverage under the sending country's system. The basic rules of coverage are summarized in Table 1 .", "For example, if a U.S. worker is sent by an employer to work in Canada and the assignment is expected to last five years or less, he or she would remain covered under the U.S. Social Security system. The worker and his or her employer would be required to contribute only to the U.S. system. Alternatively, if a U.S. worker is sent by an employer to work in Canada and the assignment is expected to last for more than five years, he or she would be covered only under the Canadian Social Security system. The worker and his or her employer would be required to contribute only to the Canadian system. Thus, the detached worker rule allows workers and their employers to avoid paying Social Security payroll taxes under two systems based on the same earnings and minimizes disruptions in Social Security coverage for workers who are transferred abroad on temporary assignments.", "The agreement with Italy is unique in that the primary exception to the territoriality rule is the nationality rule , which specifies that a worker is covered under the Social Security system of his or her country of nationality. For example, if an Italian worker is sent by an employer to work in the United States, he or she would remain covered under the Italian Social Security system, regardless of the period of employment in the United States.", "Generally, different coverage rules apply to self-employed workers. Under most agreements, the general rule of coverage for self-employed workers is the residence rule , which specifies that a person is covered under the Social Security system of the country in which he or she resides. For example, under the agreement with Switzerland, a Swiss citizen who resides in the United States and is self-employed is covered under the U.S. system and exempt from coverage under the Swiss system.", "Some agreements, such as those with Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, use other primary rules of coverage for self-employment. For example, under the agreement with Belgium, a self-employed worker is subject to the territoriality rule if he or she conducts business in only one country and the residence rule if he or she conducts business in both countries. Under the agreement with Germany, the basic rule of coverage for both employees and self-employed workers is the territoriality rule, with exceptions provided, such as those under the detached worker rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Filling Gaps in Social Security Coverage", "paragraphs": ["The second main purpose of international Social Security agreements is to allow workers who divide their careers between the United States and a foreign country to fill gaps in Social Security coverage by combining work credits under each country's system to qualify for benefits under one or both systems. In the United States, a worker must have at least 6 quarters of coverage under the U.S. system (the person must have worked in the United States in Social Security-covered employment for at least 1\u00bd years) to combine U.S. and foreign work credits. This feature of international agreements allows workers who do not meet the minimum coverage requirements under either country's system potentially to qualify for partial benefits under one or both systems. If a worker qualifies for benefits based on combined (totalized) work credits, the benefit payable under either system is prorated to take into account the actual period during which the worker was covered by that system.", "For example, under the U.S. system, a worker generally needs 40 quarters (10 years) of Social Security-covered employment to be eligible for retirement benefits. Because the United States and Canada have entered into an agreement, a U.S. worker who has five years of coverage under the U.S. system and five years of coverage under the Canadian system can meet the minimum coverage requirement for a U.S. Social Security retirement benefit based on combined coverage credits from the U.S. and Canada. The benefit would be prorated to reflect that the worker contributed to the U.S. system for only five years. In the absence of an agreement between the United States and Canada, the worker in this example would not be able to qualify for a retirement benefit under the U.S. system (nor would a U.S. citizen who had worked in Canada be eligible for benefits under the Canadian system).", "Workers may also qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits based on combined work credits. To qualify for SSDI benefits under the U.S. system, a worker must meet the definition of disability, as well as a recent work test and a duration of work test . Under the recent work test, a worker must have earned a certain number of work credits within a specified period. The requirements vary depending on the age of the worker at the time he or she became disabled. For example, a worker who becomes disabled before the age of 24 must have 1\u00bd years of Social Security-covered employment during the three-year period before the disability began. By comparison, a worker who becomes disabled at the age of 31 or later must have five years of Social Security-covered employment during the 10-year period before the disability began. Under the duration of work test, a worker must have a certain number of total work credits, which may have been earned at any time. The requirements vary depending on the age of the worker at the time he or she became disabled. For example, a worker who becomes disabled before the age of 28 must have a total of 1\u00bd years of Social Security-covered employment, while a worker who becomes disabled at the age of 60 must have a total of 9\u00bd years of Social Security-covered employment. In any case, a worker must have at least 6 work credits (1\u00bd years of Social Security-covered employment) to qualify for SSDI benefits, the same minimum number of credits needed under the U.S. system to combine U.S. and foreign work credits under the terms of an international agreement.", "The ability to combine coverage credits under the U.S. system and a foreign system provides workers (and their family members) an opportunity to qualify for benefits under one or both systems that would not be payable otherwise because the worker did not work long enough or recently enough to meet the minimum coverage requirements. In this way, a worker's Social Security contributions are not \"lost\" to the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Goals", "paragraphs": ["By eliminating dual Social Security taxation, international agreements reduce the cost of doing business abroad.

Under U.S. law, there are four types of international agreements: (1) treaties, (2) sole executive agreements, (3) agreements pursuant to treaty, and (4) congressional-executive agreements. Congressional-executive agreements are those that are authorized or approved by Congress, or both. International Social Security agreements fall into the fourth category because they are authorized by Congress in the Social Security Act. In addition, Congress has established in the statute a role for itself in reviewing these agreements.", "The Congressional Record does not provide a discussion of why Congress chose the congressional-executive method over the treaty method for totalization agreements in 1977. However, some discussion of the approval method for totalization agreements occurred during a 1976 hearing before the House Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee on H.R. 14429 , the International Social Security Agreements Act, as described in the next section. A discussion of the characteristics of congressional-executive agreements may shed additional light on the matter. One feature of congressional-executive agreements is that they rely on an ex ante authorization by Congress, in which Congress has the opportunity to establish by law certain terms related to such agreements. With respect to Social Security agreements, Section 233 of the Social Security Act authorizes the President to enter into such agreements with foreign countries, establishes the congressional review process for the agreements and specifies reporting requirements. In addition, congressional-executive agreements usually contain an ex post approval mechanism that provides an opportunity for both houses of Congress (not just the Senate) to approve or reject an agreement. With respect to Social Security agreements, Section 233(e)(2) of the Social Security Act specifies that an agreement shall become effective after a period of 60 days during which the House of Representatives or the Senate is in session (i.e., a period of 60 session days) after an agreement is transmitted to Congress unless the House of Representatives or the Senate adopts a resolution of disapproval."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative History of Section 233 of the Social Security Act", "paragraphs": ["According to congressional testimony by the Commissioner of Social Security in 1976, initial efforts in the United States toward totalization agreements with foreign countries can be found in the Supplementary Agreement to the 1948 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Italy. In his statement, Commissioner James B. Cardwell indicated:", "Under the Supplementary Agreement, which became effective in 1961, both countries declared their adherence to a policy of preventing gaps in social security protection by permitting periods of social security coverage in both countries to be counted in determining benefit rights in both countries.", "The Supplementary Agreement was signed by the United States and Italy in 1951 and ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1953. While the Supplementary Agreement provided for the negotiation of a totalization agreement between the parties (referred to in the Supplementary Agreement as an \"arrangement\"), the Senate ratified the Supplementary Agreement on the condition that any such agreement would be made by the United States \"only in conformity with provisions of statute.\"", "In May 1973, a totalization agreement between the United States and Italy was signed by both countries. Later that year, an attempt was made to enact legislation providing the statutory authority for totalization agreements as required by the Senate in 1953. In November 1973, the Senate approved H.R. 3153 (93 rd Congress), a Social Security bill passed by the House in April 1973, adding a provision authorizing the President to enter into totalization agreements with foreign countries and specifying other terms related to such agreements. The version of the bill approved by the House of Representatives did not include a provision relating to totalization agreements. A conference to resolve differences between the House- and Senate-approved versions of the bill was never held and the legislation was not enacted.", "The provision in H.R. 3153 (93 rd Congress) relating to totalization agreements added by the Senate in 1973 was similar to current law (Section 233 of the Social Security Act), with some notable differences. For example, it provided for a longer period of congressional review. The Senate provision specified that \"such an agreement shall become effective on any date provided in the agreement following 90 calendar days of continuous session of the Congress after the date on which the agreement is transmitted ... \" In addition, the Senate provision did not specify what action by Congress would be required to stop an agreement from taking effect.", "In 1976, the House Ways and Means Committee, Subcommittee on Social Security, held a hearing on the International Social Security Agreements Act ( H.R. 14429 , 94 th Congress), which reflected a proposal supported by the Administration. In contrast to the provision added by the Senate to H.R. 3153 in 1973, H.R. 14429 would have required only that Congress be notified of an international Social Security agreement. Under H.R. 14429 , Social Security agreements, like other types of international agreements, would have been reported to Congress after (rather than before) entering into force. During the hearing on H.R. 14429 , the discussion turned to an alternative \"report and wait\" provision similar to the one added by the Senate to H.R. 3153 in 1973. The Commissioner of Social Security, James B. Cardwell, indicated that the agency had been advised that the Administration would not object to an arrangement in which Congress would be presented with a proposed Social Security agreement and would have 60 days in which to advise the Administration of their position or otherwise the agreement would become effective. Upon questioning by members of the Social Security Subcommittee, Commissioner Cardwell stated that the agency did not have details on how the process would work. However, the Commissioner indicated that it was his opinion that any objection to an agreement would have to come from Congress, and not from a subcommittee or committee or even one House. Commissioner Cardwell offered to seek clarification on the Administration's position with respect to an appropriate process for congressional review of Social Security agreements.", "In a follow-up letter to Honorable James Burke, the Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, Commissioner Cardwell expressed the Administration's support for a provision similar to the one added by the Senate to H.R. 3153 in 1973, except with a shorter period of congressional review. The Commissioner stated that the Administration would not object to an arrangement in which a negotiated totalization agreement could not become effective until after 60 days of continuous session of Congress following transmittal to Congress by the President. Under the Administration's provision, if Congress approved of a proposed agreement, no action by Congress would be needed and the agreement would take effect at the end of the specified review period. If Congress disapproved of a proposed agreement, or wanted to alter any of its provisions, Congress would be required to enact a statute to that effect.", "In 1977, the statutory authority relating to totalization agreements (Section 233 of the Social Security Act) was established under the Social Security Amendments of 1977 ( P.L. 95-216 ). The provision enacted in 1977 was similar to current law, with some notable differences. For example, under a totalization agreement, an individual may qualify for a benefit from both the United States and the foreign country party to the agreement. The 1977 law specified that, with respect to persons who qualify for benefits under both countries' systems, a totalization agreement could provide that the United States would supplement the total benefit amount (U.S. and foreign benefit combined) payable to a U.S. resident to increase it to the amount he or she would have qualified for under the U.S. system based on the minimum Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) available under current law at the time. In addition, the 1977 law provided for a longer period of congressional review than that supported by the Administration. Specifically, it provided that an agreement would go into effect unless the House of Representatives or the Senate adopted a resolution of disapproval within the period following transmittal to Congress \"during which each House of the Congress has been in session on each of 90 days.\"", "The House of Representatives and the Senate initially approved different provisions relating to totalization agreements in considering the 1977 legislation. The provision approved by the House of Representatives specified that each agreement would have to be transmitted to Congress and could not go into effect until after at least one House of Congress has been in session for 90 days. During that period, an agreement could be rejected by action of both Houses of Congress enacting legislation. The provision approved by the Senate specified that (1) each agreement must be transmitted to Congress with a report on the estimated cost and number of individuals affected; (2) an agreement must not be inconsistent with the provisions of Title II of the Social Security Act; and (3) an agreement could not go into effect until after each House of Congress has been in session for 90 days, during which period an agreement could be rejected by action of either House of Congress. The conference agreement followed the Senate provision.", "In 1981, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( P.L. 97-35 ) struck the provision in Section 233 of the Social Security Act permitting an agreement to provide that the United States would supplement a U.S. resident's total benefit amount (U.S. and foreign benefit combined) under an agreement if the total benefit amount was less than the minimum benefit he or she would have qualified for under the U.S. system. This was a conforming amendment related to the elimination of the minimum benefit provision under the same law ( P.L. 97-35 ). Accordingly, there is no current law providing for any such supplemental benefit under an agreement.", "In 1983, the period for congressional review of Social Security agreements was shortened under the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ). The period of congressional review was changed from the period \"during which each House of the Congress has been in session on each of 90 days \" to the period \"during which at least one House of the Congress has been in session on each of 60 days .\" This is the same period of congressional review provided under current law."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selection of Partner Countries", "paragraphs": ["The Government Accountability Office (GAO), in a study conducted in 2005, found that the countries with which the United States has entered into Social Security agreements have been selected without a formal guideline or protocol. SSA officials have stated that the agency has used the same major criteria for selecting partner countries since 1978. According to SSA officials, the major criteria used in selecting agreement countries include (1) whether the other country has a Social Security system of general application that pays periodic benefits on account of death, old age or disability; (2) costs to the trust funds; (3) the number of and cost savings to U.S. employers and workers who would benefit from the elimination of dual taxes; (4) the interest of the other country in negotiating an agreement; (5) the ability of the other country to administer an agreement; and (6) input from other U.S. government agencies such as the Department of State and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.", "In addition, the 2005 GAO Report indicated that SSA is working on initiatives aimed at determining which countries would be suitable partners for future agreements, taking into account the reliability of a country's data and records. According to SSA officials, the agency has sought input from the Department of State and the Department of Commerce working toward developing a more formalized process for identifying potential agreement countries. GAO also reported that SSA has developed a matrix based on 14 economic and administrative factors that may affect a country's ability to determine an individual's eligibility for benefits under an agreement. The purpose of the matrix is to facilitate comparisons among potential agreement countries and evaluate a country's suitability for a future agreement. The matrix also includes factors that could be used to assess the potential impact of an agreement on the Social Security trust funds.", "With respect to SSA's initiatives aimed at determining which countries would be suitable partners for future agreements, SSA noted in October 2009:", "Since 2005, SSA has made significant progress toward formalizing its processes for identifying agreement partner countries and evaluating the reliability of a foreign country's data. These advancements include: (1) developing a standardized questionnaire to elicit information on internal controls and information security policies and procedures in force in a potential partner country to protect the integrity of earnings information and the computer network that stores such information; (2) requiring the completion of the questionnaire and a thorough and successful review by SSA experts in order to enter into formal negotiations on a potential totalization agreement; and (3) expanding the actuarial estimates of potential agreements' impact on the U.S. Social Security Trust Funds from short-range, 5-year estimates of the effect to include both short-range (7 year) and long-range (75 year) estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Negotiation and Conclusion of Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Although there are no statutes or regulations regarding the selection of potential agreement countries, SSA noted that the agency \"has for more than 30 years consistently applied the compatible system, costs/benefits, taxation, practicality and consultative criteria described above in considering possible agreement partner countries.\" In addition, the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements by SSA are governed by the \"Circular 175 Procedure.\" The Circular 175 Procedure refers to regulations developed by the U.S. Department of State to ensure that treaties and other international agreements are carried out within constitutional and other legal limitations, with due consideration of foreign policy implications, and with appropriate involvement of the State Department. The U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual states that \"[n]egotiations of treaties, or other 'significant' international agreements, or for their extension or revision, are not to be undertaken, nor any exploratory discussions undertaken with representatives of another government or international organization, until authorized in writing by the Secretary or an officer specifically authorized by the Secretary for that purpose.\"", "After authorization is granted by the State Department, SSA officials may negotiate, but not conclude, a Social Security agreement with a foreign country.

Following that process, the agreement is signed by an authorized U.S. representative and an authorized representative of the foreign country. After the agreement has been signed, SSA and the foreign Social Security agency meet and address implementation issues, formulating operations procedures to be used in administering the agreement. When that process has been completed, the agreement is forwarded to the U.S. Secretary of State for review. After review at the State Department has been completed, the agreement is sent to the President for review. Finally, the President is required by law to transmit the agreement to Congress for a period of review (60 session days) before the agreement can go into effect.

There are no rules limiting the amount of time that may elapse between the signing of an agreement and its transmittal to Congress. Although most of the current agreements were transmitted to Congress less than one year after they were signed, there has been some variation. For example, the agreement with Denmark was signed in June 2007 and transmitted to Congress less than a year later in February 2008. The agreement with Canada, which had an additional protocol for Qu\u00e9bec, was signed in March 1981 and transmitted to Congress almost three years later in January 1984. The pending agreement with Mexico was signed in June 2004 and has not been transmitted to Congress to date.", "Section 233(e)(2) of the Social Security Act specifies that a Social Security agreement automatically goes into effect unless the House of Representatives or the Senate adopts a resolution of disapproval within 60 session days of the agreement's transmittal to Congress.", "It should be noted that Section 233(e)(2), which allows for the rejection of a totalization agreement upon adoption of a resolution of disapproval by either House of Congress is functionally identical to the legislative veto provision that was held unconstitutional in INS v. Chadha . In that case, the Supreme Court struck down a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that gave either House of Congress the authority to overrule deportation decisions made by the Attorney General. The Court declared that a legislative veto constitutes an exercise of legislative power, as its use has \"the purpose and effect of altering the legal rights, duties, and relations of persons ... outside the legislative branch.\" Accordingly, the Court invalidated the disapproval mechanism, holding that Congress may exercise its legislative authority only \"in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure,\" namely bicameral passage and presentation to the President. In its decision, the Court explicitly acknowledged that its holding was not limited to the provision at issue, but would instead affect other similar laws, stating: \"our inquiry is sharpened rather than blunted by the fact that Congressional veto provisions are appearing with increasing frequency in statutes which delegate authority to executive and independent agencies.\" The Court has emphasized its categorical disapproval of the legislative veto in subsequent cases, noting in Printz v. United States , for instance, that \"the legislative veto, though enshrined in perhaps hundreds of federal statutes ... was nonetheless held unconstitutional\" in Chadha . The maxim delineated in Chadha , as consistently reaffirmed by the Court, is fully applicable in the current context. Accordingly, given that the disapproval mechanism in Section 233(e)(2) authorizes \"congressional invalidation of executive action\" outside the strictures of bicameralism and presentment, there is no discernible basis upon which it may be argued successfully that its utilization by Congress would withstand judicial scrutiny.", "Congress has never rejected a Social Security agreement. As a result, the apparent constitutional infirmity of Section 233(e)(2) has not been an issue. Congressional utilization of the mechanism in Section 233(e)(2) to reject a Social Security agreement could give rise to a judicial challenge, potentially resulting in an invalidation of the disapproval mechanism and a determination that the agreement is effective. Specifically, in considering the effect of the unconstitutional disapproval mechanism, a reviewing court would consider whether the remainder of Section 233 is valid, or whether the entire statute must be nullified. The Supreme Court has held that \"[u]nless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may be dropped if what is left is a fully operative law.\" In Westcott v. Califano , the court noted that \"the existence of a broad severability clause in the Social Security Act reflects the Congressional wish that judicial interpretation of the act leave as much of the statute intact as possible.\" The existence of this severability clause, coupled with the fact that the operative provisions of Section 233 would remain fully functional absent the disapproval mechanism in Subsection (e)(2), gives rise to the likelihood that a reviewing court would invalidate any attempt to utilize the disapproval mechanism, while giving effect to an otherwise properly executed Social Security agreement.", "Before the 1983 Supreme Court Decision of INS v. Chadha , other acts had provisions similar to the legislative veto provision found in Section 233(e)(2) of the Social Security Act.

Two additional automated death data exchanges will be piloted before the end of 2009. SSA intends to expand the death data exchange project to all totalization agreement partner countries.", "GAO reported that SSA had developed a standardized questionnaire to assess the reliability of earnings data in countries that may be considered for future totalization agreements.

Previously, the EaE program was available only to persons over the age of 18 entering the country as lawful permanent residents. Currently, a person of any age who applies for an immigrant visa may elect on the visa application to receive an SSN through the EaE program. SSA noted that \"EaE improves the integrity of our enumeration process because the information needed to assign the SSN is collected and verified by the [f]ederal agencies responsible for conferring immigrant status.

SSA now requires, as a prerequisite for entering into formal negotiations on a totalization agreement, a thorough review of the integrity and reliability of foreign data. SSA has established a formal procedure for obtaining the information necessary to assess the integrity and reliability of foreign data relied upon by the United States to administer social security agreements. SSA has also established procedures for reviewing the information obtained and determining whether the foreign data is reliable and secure. SSA has implemented these procedures, and has reviewed the foreign data in question for all social security agreements negotiated since 2005.", "Because the agreements impose a cost to the U.S. Social Security system, some policymakers point to the need for greater assurances that data pertaining to noncitizen workers and beneficiaries (including dependents and survivors) relied upon by the United States to administer the agreements are complete and accurate, a condition necessary to protect the Social Security trust funds from improper payments. In addition, some policymakers point to the need for changes in the congressional review process for totalization agreements, enhanced reporting requirements and ongoing evaluation of agreements after they enter into force as reflected in current legislative proposals.", "Appendix A. Computation of the Social Security Primary Insurance Amount", "The Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) is the basic Social Security monthly benefit amount payable to an individual upon entitlement to retirement benefits at the normal retirement age (i.e., the PIA does not reflect any adjustments for early or delayed retirement) or disability benefits. In addition, the PIA is the base amount used to determine monthly benefits payable to family members on the worker's record (such as a spouse or surviving spouse).", "Under current law, the PIA is determined by applying a benefit formula to the worker's average lifetime covered earnings. In the first step of the benefit computation, the worker's nominal earnings (up to two calendar years prior to the year of eligibility\u2014for example, earnings prior to the age of 60 in the case of a retirement benefit) are indexed to wage growth to reflect the change in average wages over time. (Earnings in subsequent years are counted at nominal value.) For purposes of computing a basic retirement benefit, the 35 highest years of indexed earnings are then averaged and a monthly amount is computed to determine the worker's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME). If a worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, years of zero earnings are counted in the computation of the AIME. The benefit formula is then applied to the worker's AIME. The benefit formula that applies to individuals who first become eligible for retirement or disability benefits in 2010, or who die in 2010 before becoming eligible for benefits, is", "90% of the first $761 of AIME, plus 32% of AIME over $761 through $4,586, plus 15% of AIME over $4,586", "For example, the PIA for a worker who reaches the age of 62 in 2010, based on an AIME of $5,000, would be $1,971.00. The PIA would be computed as follows:", "90% x $761 = $684.90, plus 32% x $3,825 = $1,224.00, plus 15% x $414 = $62.10", "PIA = $1,971.00", "The worker's PIA is based on the benefit formula that applies in the year the worker first becomes eligible for benefits (the age of 62 for retired-worker benefits, the year of disability for disabled-worker benefits, or the year of the worker's death for survivor benefits ), rather than the first year of benefit receipt. Beginning with the first year of eligibility, the PIA is increased by the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for any intervening years between eligibility and benefit receipt. For example, if an individual who first becomes eligible for retired-worker benefits at the age of 62 in 2010 elects to receive benefits at the normal retirement age (of 66 in 2014), the PIA effective at the normal retirement age would be the PIA calculated using the benefit formula for 2010 (shown above) adjusted annually according to the COLA (if any) effective in December 2010, December 2011, December 2012, and December 2013.", "The dollar amounts that separate the three brackets of AIME in the benefit formula ($761 and $4,586) are referred to as bend points. Under current law, the bend points are indexed to wage growth on an annual basis to provide stable replacement rates over time for workers with similar earnings patterns. (The replacement rate is based on Social Security benefits in the first year of benefit receipt divided by pre-retirement earnings.) For example, the projected long-range constant replacement rate, based on retirement at the age of 67 in 2030 or later, is 55% for a scaled low earner; 41% for a scaled medium earner; and 27% for a maximum earner.", "The percentages that apply to each of the three brackets of AIME in the benefit formula (90%, 32% and 15%) are referred to as formula factors (or replacement factors).
