The VA issued United States Government Life Insurance to World War I servicemembers (1919-1951), National Service Life Insurance for World War II servicemembers (1940-1951), Veterans' Special Life Insurance for Korean War servicemembers (1951-1956), and Veterans' Reopened Life Insurance for disabled World War II and Korean War servicemembers (1965-1966). All of these life insurance programs are currently closed to new issues. ", "The only three VA life insurance programs that provide benefits to the families of servicemembers and veterans, and that are still allowing new issues of life insurance, are S-DVI, SGLI, and VGLI. Congress passed the Insurance Act of 1951 (P.L. 82-23) and established the S-DVI program. S-DVI was created to meet the insurance needs of certain veterans with service-connected disabilities, many of whom would not be eligible for private life insurance due to their service-connected disabilities. Following S-DVI, in 1965, with the authorization of Congress (as part of establishing SGLI), the VA Administrator purchased group life insurance and selected the Prudential Insurance Company of America to cover its policies. In 1974, VGLI became available to former servicemembers under P.L. 93-289 . VGLI provides for the conversion of SGLI after separation from active duty.", "In 1965, the Advisory Council on Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance was established. Initially, the Advisory Council is responsible for reviewing the SGLI programs and advising the VA Secretary on policy matters concerning SGLI. However, in 1974, the Advisory Council became responsible for reviewing the VGLI program as well. The Advisory Council consists of the following six members according to current law: ", "Secretary of the Treasury as chairperson, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget.", "The VA Regional Office and Insurance Center (VAROIC) in Philadelphia, PA, supervises the SGLI and VGLI programs.

The lump sum payment may, at the beneficiary's election, be made as a single check (or electronic transfer) or via an Alliance Account. TSGLI proceeds may, at the beneficiary's election, be made as either a single check (or electronic transfer) or via an Alliance Account. An Alliance Account is an interest-bearing retained asset account administered through the Prudential Insurance Company of America that is similar to a checking account. Like a checking account, proceeds are deposited in the beneficiary's name and he or she is given a draft book, which the beneficiary may use to write drafts for any amount up to the full amount of the proceeds. However, unlike checks, drafts may not be used to make purchases at the point of sale. Instead, the beneficiary must write the draft and deposit it into his or her checking account, where the money will be transferred from the beneficiary's Alliance Account.", "Alliance Accounts are not offered under the S-DVI program, which is administered entirely by the VA.

This amount has not been increased in almost six decades. The $10,000 maximum coverage was part of the S-DVI program at its inception in 1951. By comparison, $10,000 in 1951 would be worth nearly $88,300 in 2012 after adjusting for inflation. Also, policyholders are denied the opportunity to buy additional coverage under the program.", "As of June 24, 2009, less than 4% of veterans who were eligible to participate in the program were insured under S-DVI. According to a recent congressionally mandated study, the lowest area of veteran satisfaction was \"the maximum amount of S-DVI insurance coverage that veterans were authorized to purchase.\" Some critics say the program falls far short of delivering the protection it was originally designed to provide. For example, Brian E. Lawrence, assistant national legislative director of the Disabled American Veterans, said", "Government life insurance programs have limited basic coverage to $10,000 since their inception under the War Risk Insurance Act in 1917. Then, they were an excellent benefit. More than 93 percent of military members adopted the maximum coverage of $10,000 because they knew that in the event of their death, their family members would have the financial resources available to pay for the cost of a home and also to cover the cost of living for a considerable amount of time. For example, Sears, Roebuck and Co. sold prefabricated houses in the early 1900's. Its 1920 catalogue featured 80 models, ranging in price from $4,900 to $6,000. Obviously, $10,000 went much further in 1917 than it does in 2003.", "According to the VA, 49% of the veterans enrolled in the S-DVI program are considered totally disabled and are eligible for a premium waiver for their basic coverage. Of those who were eligible in 2009, only 27% had a Supplemental S-DVI policy. This means that a relatively small percentage of all S-DVI policyholders have $30,000 in total coverage, while a large majority of participants have $10,000 in total coverage. In comparison, the VGLI program offers maximum coverage of $400,000.", "In addition, because coverage for S-DVI is not wholly funded by the premiums paid by policyholders, Congress appropriates funds to subsidize the program. These appropriations are necessary to support veterans who are waived from paying premiums because they are totally disabled from service-connected disabilities. Therefore, if the amount of coverage available to veterans were to increase, the appropriation allocated for the S-DVI program would also have to increase to avoid facing a shortfall.
