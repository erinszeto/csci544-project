The most prominent is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956. Section 1956 outlaws four kinds of money laundering\u2014promotional, concealment, structuring, and tax evasion laundering of the proceeds generated by designated federal, state, and foreign underlying crimes (predicate offenses)\u2014committed or attempted under one or more of three jurisdictional conditions (i.e., laundering involving certain financial transactions, laundering involving international transfers, and stings). Its companion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1957, prohibits depositing or spending more than $10,000 of the proceeds from a predicate offense. Section 1956 violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years. Section 1957 carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Property involved in either case is subject to confiscation. Misconduct that implicates either offense may implicate other federal criminal statutes as well. Federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization (RICO) provisions outlaw acquiring or conducting the affairs of an enterprise (whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce) through the patterned commission of a series of underlying federal or state crimes. RICO violations are also 20-year felonies. The Section 1956 predicate offense list automatically includes every RICO predicate offense, including each \"federal crime of terrorism.\" A second related statute, the Travel Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952), punishes interstate or foreign travel, or the use of interstate or foreign facilities, conducted with the intent to distribute the proceeds of a more modest list of predicate offenses or to promote or carry on such offenses when an overt act is committed in furtherance of that intent. Such misconduct is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years. Other federal statutes proscribe, with varying sanctions, bulk cash smuggling, layering bank deposits to avoid reporting requirements, failure to comply with federal anti-money laundering provisions, or conducting an unlawful money transmission business.", "Section 1956's ban on attempted international transportation of tainted proceeds for the purpose of concealing their ownership, source, nature, or ultimate location is limited to instances where concealment is a purpose rather than an attribute of the transportation (simple smuggling is not proscribed as such), as the Supreme Court explained in Cuellar v. United States, 553 U.S. 550 (2008). In a second case, the Court held that the \"proceeds\" of a predicate offense often referred to the profits rather than the gross receipts realized from the offense. United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507 (2008). Congress responded by defining \"proceeds\" for money laundering purposes as the property obtained or retained as a consequence of a predicate offense, including gross receipts. P.L. 111-21, 123 Stat. 1618 (2009) (S. 386) (111th Cong.).", "The text of the statutes discussed, citations of state money laundering and money transmission statutes, and a list federal predicate offenses with their accompanying maximum terms of imprisonment appear at the end of the report.

The knowledge element cannot be negated by turning a blind eye to reality. Here and throughout Section 1956, knowledge may be inferred from facts indicating that criminal activity is particularly likely.", "Throughout Section 1956, a defendant \"conducts\" a financial transaction when he initiates, concludes, or participates in initiating, or concluding a transaction. The \"financial transaction\" element has two obvious components. It must be a transaction and it must be financial. Both components are defined by statute. Qualifying \"transactions\" may take virtually any shape that involves the disposition of something constituting the proceeds of an underlying crime, including a disposition as informal as handing cash over to someone else. The \"financial\" component supplies the jurisdiction foundation for a Section 1956(a)(1)(A)(ii) crime and each of the other crimes in Section 1956(a)(1). Qualifying transactions must either involve the movement of funds in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or involve a financial institution engaged in, or whose activities affect, interstate or foreign commerce. In either case, the effect on interstate or foreign commerce need be no more than minimal to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement. ", "The majority of Section 1956's crimes are related in one way or another to the commission or purported commission of at least one of a list of predicate offenses (\"specified unlawful activities\"). And so it is the financial transaction promotional offense. The proscribed transaction must involve the proceeds of a predicate offense and be designed to promote a predicate offense. The predicate offenses come in three varieties: state crimes, foreign crimes, and federal crimes. The list of state crimes is relatively short and consists of any state crime that is a RICO predicate offense, that is, \"any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), which is chargeable under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.\"", "The list of foreign crimes recognized as Section 1956 predicate offenses is more extensive than the list of state crimes, and covers among other things extraditable offenses, although crimes under the laws of other countries qualify as predicate offenses only if the financial transaction occurs in this country in whole or in part.", "The list of federal predicate offenses is considerably longer if for no other reason than that the some qualifying offenses are specifically named and others qualify by cross-reference to the voluminous RICO predicate offense list. The crimes listed by name as predicates include offenses such as interstate kidnapping, theft of funds from federally supported programs, and bank robbery. RICO predicates also name bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud as predicates. Moreover, the RICO predicate offense list encompasses by cross-reference the federal crimes of terrorism cataloged in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333b(g)(5)(B). ", "As for the promotional element, some of the lower courts have concluded that it \"may be met by transactions that promote the continued prosperity of the underlying offense.\" One circuit has declared, however, that \"the 'promotion' element of money laundering promotion cannot be met simply by demonstrating that the unlawfully earned monies were used to promote the continued functioning of an 'otherwise legitimate business enterprise.' For instance, paying the bills (payroll, rent, taxes) of a health care provider or a car dealership, even one engaged in frequent acts of fraud, may not suffice to support the promotion element.\"", "The \"proceeds\" in the proceeds element of the offense is defined to consist of \"any property derived from or obtained or retained, directly or indirectly, through some form of unlawful activity, including the gross receipts of such activity.\" ", "The definition answers both the profits v. gross receipts question and several others as well. It makes it clear, for example, that the term includes proceeds from a lawful source, retained through the commission of a predicate offense. It does not necessarily invalidate, however, that line of lower court decisions which held that proceeds must be \"derived from an already competed offense, or a completed phase of an ongoing offense, before they can be laundered.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Transmission or Transportation", "paragraphs": ["The international promotional offense, Section 1956(a)(2)(A), applies to anyone who:", "1.

Since Section 1952(a)(2)(A) proscribes both transportation and attempted transportation, prosecution may be had even though no funds were in fact transported internationally, as long as the government proves a substantial step towards international transportation. The section does not demand that the transported funds flow from a predicate offense or from any other unlawful source; all that is required is that the offender intends to use them to promote a predicate offense. Where the international promotional offense shares common elements with other Section 1956 offenses, they are comparably construed. Thus, similar \"intent to promote\" elements impose the same requirements of proof upon the government regardless of whether the offense charged is a Section 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) financial transaction promotional offense or a Section 1956(a)(2)(A) international transfer promotional offense.

The \"representations\" alluded to are confined to those \"made by a law enforcement officer or by another person at the direction of, or with the approval of, a federal official authorized to investigate or prosecute violations of this section.\" In sting prosecutions under other 1956 sections, the courts have held that the representation need not be explicit; it is enough that a reasonable person would infer from the circumstances that funds to be laundered were the proceeds of a predicate offense. The same construction applies to here. The qualifying state, federal, and foreign predicate offenses are the same for all the Section 1956 offenses including the Section 1956(a)(3)(A) promotional stings offenses.", "Prosecution of Section 1956(a)(3) sting offenses might seem to invite entrapment defense claims. As a general rule, \"[w]here the government has induced an individual to break the law and the defense of entrapment is at issue ... the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was predisposed to commit the criminal act prior to first being approached by government agents.\" Evidence of a defendant's predisposition may include \"(1) the character or reputation of the defendant; (2) whether the government made the initial suggestion of criminal activity; (3) whether the defendant engaged in the activity for profit; (4) whether the defendant showed any reluctance; and (5) the nature of the government's inducement.\" The defense, however, does not appear to have enjoyed a great deal of success in Section 1956(a)(3) cases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concealment", "paragraphs": ["Like promotional money laundering, concealment money laundering comes in three varieties; concealment associated with a financial transaction, concealment associated with foreign transportation or transmission, and concealment associated with a sting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Financial Transactions", "paragraphs": ["Concealment in violation of Section 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) occurs when anyone:", "1. knowing", "A. that the property involved in a financial transaction", "B. represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,", "2.

Thus, the defendant must have known that the transaction, designed to conceal, involved crime-tainted proceeds, but need not have known the precise offense or its specifics. Gross receipts of a predicate offense may serve as qualifying \"proceeds,\" for concealment as well as for promotional offenses. The actions that amount to \"conduct[ing] or attempt[ing] to conduct\" a proscribed transaction\u2014for either concealment or promotional purposes\u2014\"include[] initiating, concluding, participating in initiating, or concluding a transaction.\" The broad definition of \"financial transaction\" found in Section 1956(c)(4) (\"sale.... transfer, delivery, or other disposition\" involving a monetary instrument or a financial institution) applies throughout the section. As with the promotion offenses, the government must show more than a financial transaction; proof that the defendant spent tainted funds, without more will not do. ", "The concealment offense requires \"a design\" to conceal. It is the purpose of the scheme and not its effect that the element condemns. A financial transaction that offers neither the accused nor the property involved any apparent enhanced secrecy protection cannot be said to satisfy the intention to conceal element of the offense. The fact the defendant made no effort to conceal his identity is no defense, however, when the transactions were intended to conceal the nature, location, or origin of the property involved. ", "As a general matter, \"[e]vidence that may be considered when determining whether a transaction was designed to conceal includes: [deceptive] statements by a defendant probative of intent to conceal; unusual secrecy surrounding the transactions; structuring the transaction to avoid attention; depositing illegal profits in the bank account of a legitimate business; highly irregular features of the transaction; using third parties to conceal the real owner; a series of unusual financial moves cumulating in the transaction; and expert testimony on practices of criminals.\" Although the government need not always prove that a transaction was designed to create the appearance of legitimate wealth, efforts to create such an appearance often signal a money laundering violation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Transportation or Transmission", "paragraphs": ["The international concealment offense of Section 1956(a)(2)(B)(i) penalizes anyone who:", "1.

The Court in Regalado Cuellar held that evidence that the defendant attempted to smuggle cash out of the United States was insufficient to support a prosecution for violation of Section 1956(a)(2)(B)(i), absent evidence of a design to conceal the ownership, source, nature, or ultimate location of the funds. It made it equally clear, however, that violations are not limited to those instances where the government can establish that the transportation was intended to create the appearance of legitimate wealth.", "A drafting quirk raises some question concerning the first knowledge element of the Section 1956(a)(2)(B) international transfer offense (\"knowing that the \u2026 funds involved \u2026 some form of unlawful activity\"). Elsewhere, the statute uses the phrase \"knowing that the property in a financial transaction.\" The statute then goes on to say that the phrase \"knowing that the property in a financial transaction\" means that the defendant need not know that \"unlawful activity\" which generates the laundered proceeds constitutes a money laundering predicate offense; it is enough that he knows that a state, federal, or foreign offense generates the proceeds. The statute provides no comparable caveat for the phrase, \"knowing that the \u2026 funds involve\u2026\" Nevertheless, at least one court has held that the same caveat applies to Section 1956(a)(2)(B) international offenses notwithstanding the differences in terminology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stings", "paragraphs": ["The sting concealment offense in Section 1956(a)(3)(B) is much like the promotional sting offense and occurs when an offender:", "1. with the intent to conceal or disguise", "A. the nature,", "B. location,", "C. source,", "D. ownership, or", "E. control of", "2. property believed to be the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity", "3.

Nevertheless, a defendant is still not free to turn a blind eye to representations that the proceeds have a predicate offense taint.", "The \"financial transaction\" element of the offense demands, as in other Section 1956 offenses, either a transaction that affects interstate or foreign commerce or a transaction involving the use of a financial institution engaged in or whose activities affect interstate or foreign commerce. To satisfy the \"financial institution\" prong of the \"financial transaction\" element of the offense, the government need only establish that the transaction involved \"the use of a financial institution\" with an interstate or foreign commerce nexus, not that the institution was itself an integral or essential part of the transaction. To satisfy the \"transaction\" prong, the government need only establish a minimal effect on interstate commerce.", "The representational element does not require undercover agents to have told the defendant in so many words that the transaction involves the proceeds of a predicate offense; it is enough that they \"made the defendant aware of circumstances from which a reasonable person would infer that the property was [the proceeds of a predicate offense].\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evading Reporting Requirements (Smurfing)", "paragraphs": ["Early anti-money laundering efforts sought to enlist the assistance of financial institutions.

Property acquired in exchange for the proceeds or for the proceeds and other involved property is forfeitable as traceable property. The government may confiscate the property on either side of the transaction, but not the property on both sides.", "The Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive fines. Fines are excessive if they are grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the offender's misconduct.
