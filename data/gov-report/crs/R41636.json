Congressional redistricting, often confused with apportionment, is the process of revising the geographic boundaries of areas from which voters elect Representatives to the House. The apportionment process is a function of four factors: (1) population size, (2) the number of Representatives or seats to be apportioned, (3) the number of states, and (4) the method of apportionment.", "Recently, some commentators and Members of Congress have called for a change in the nature of the population used to apportion seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, advocating a change from using all \"persons\" to using all \"citizens.\" Section 2 of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that \"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.\" Consequently, such a change would appear to necessitate a constitutional amendment.", "This report examines the impact on the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives if such a change were to occur, using an estimate of the 2013 citizen population in place of the 2010 apportionment population to determine the potential distribution of seats in the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress.

California would lose four seats relative to its actual distribution of seats as a result of the 2010 apportionment. Texas, Florida, and New York would each lose one seat relative to the number of seats received in the 2010 apportionment.", "On the other hand, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Virginia would each pick up a single seat, if the 2013 citizen population were used to apportion seats rather than the 2010 total apportionment population. Using citizenship status to apportion the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives tends to benefit states with smaller immigrant populations and cost states with larger immigrant populations.", "For those seeking to change the current population standard for apportioning the seats in the House of Representatives, there appears to be at least three possible choices. First, and most obvious, amend the U.S. Constitution. Second, use the citizen population in the redistricting process to geographically define the congressional districts.
