The establishment of Afghanistan as a nationstate dates essentially from 1747, when Ahmad Shah Durrani, a tribal Pashtun (4) chief of the Sadozailine of the Abdali tribe, gained election by his tribe as the ruler (Amir) of territories approximatingthe present boundaries of Afghanistan. Under the Durrani ascendancy, Afghanistan experienced allthe vicissitudes of dynastic chance and survived as a political entity largely as a buffer state whosenorthern and southern boundaries conformed to the high water line of the expanding British andRussian empires, and the periodically resurgent Iranian empire.", "In the 20th century Afghanistan teetered between bursts of Western and Soviet-aided modernization and recurrent reaction spearheaded by the twin sources of rural power in the Pashtunheartland: secular leaders, including tribal chieftains, local notables, or commanders, and Muslimclerics of various kinds, including mullahs and influential pirs (spiritual leaders) of the mystical Sufi Islamic sects, which predominate in Afghanistan and Southern Asia. In many respects the traditionallocal power structure, outside of Kabul and a few other population centers, approximated that in therural, pre-industrial West, with men of property or learning exercising governmental power andclergy providing spiritual guidance, moral authority, and often local political influence. ", "In general, modernization progressed faster among two sections of the population: Tajiks and Uzbeks in the North, who practiced settled agriculture or carried on commerce, and the morecosmopolitan, \"Persianized,\" residents of Kabul of various ethnic origins, including \"detribalized\"Pashtuns. The traditional Pashtun tribes of Southern Afghanistan, many of whom are or werenomadic, have been more resistant to centralization and modernization, but nonetheless have longthought of themselves as the \"real\" Afghans.

Both the Afghan Tajiks and those in Tajikistan have linguistic andcultural connections with Iran, but usually not religious. In matters of religion, the Tajiks, like thePashtuns, follow the Sunni school of Islam, the larger of the two main Islamic divisions. TheUzbeks have ethnic and linguistic connections to Uzbekistan and Central Asia, and are also Sunn iMuslims. The Hazaras are a Shi'a Muslim minority with ethnic ties to Central Asia and religiousties to Iran.", "The language issue also divides the tribal Pashtuns from other Afghans. Dari, a form of classical Persian, has long been the language of the court and of commerce. In fact, more Afghansspeak Dari than Pashto.

Zahir Shah was and remains something of an enigma. He ascended the throne at age 19,and for thirty years largely left the government in the hands of relatives-first by uncles until about1953, and later by his cousin, Prime Minister Mohammad Daoud. Perhaps too late, Zahir Shahfinally took charge of the government in 1963, after Daoud's policy of hostility towards Pakistan (seebelow) led that country to close the common border, cutting of Afghanistan's southern trade linksand devastating the economy. Despite his effort to reduce the role of the royal family and hispromulgation of a new constitution with some limited democratic features, notably an elected, butparty-less bicameral parliament, with limited powers to check and balance the executive authority,Zahir Shah's liberalization program was still-born. This outcome generally has been attributed tothe King's lack of assertiveness and the fear of the country's social and economic elite of beingdisplaced by popularly elected leaders.", "Among other accomplishments, Zahir Shah and his new advisors and officials extended the reach of the central government by expanding the army and the national police system, enlarging thefunctions of the civilian bureaucracy, expanding the national educational system, and bringing acentral government presence down to the local level. Although these developments helped tostrengthen the state and weaken tribalism, their net effect was not wholly positive. The army andpolice were widely regarded as repressive, and the bureaucracy and local governmental apparatuswere said to be corrupt, grasping, incompetent, and dominated, at the upper levels, by the King'srelatives.", "The latter years of Zahir Shah's reign brought significant economic modernization, but not enough to take Afghanistan out of the ranks of the least developed countries. On the positive side,the middle class in Kabul and other cities swelled from an estimate of fewer than a thousand at theend of World War II to almost 100,000 by the early 1970s.

The political opening provided by the 1964 constitution boosted the aspirations of both a smallleftist intelligentsia and radical Islamic counterparts. The Marxist People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan (PDPA) was founded on January 1, 1965, with the explicit goal of contesting theelections held that year under the new constitution-elections that were officially party-less. Theradical leftists tended to dominate parliamentary proceedings, while moderates, who had more tolose, remained cowed by political repression. Most of the major figures who later served in theSoviet-backed Marxist regime, notably Nur Mohamad Taraki, Hafizullah Amin, and Babrak Karmal,were active in the first elected parliament.

The Islamists reacted not only to the rise of the left but also to the long tradition ofco-option of Muslim clerics by the government. ", "Soon after emerging, both the Marxists and the Islamic right split along primarily ethnic lines. The PDPA was divided between a largely Pashtun Kalq (\"masses\") movement under Taraki andAmin, and a more urban and moderate Parcham (\"flag\") wing under Karmal. The split in theIslamist ranks was both ethnic and generational-between the followers of Professor BurnhanuddinRabbani, a Tajik religious scholar who founded the Jamiat-i-Islami (Islamic Society), and thoseattracted to \"Engineer\" Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a Pashtun Kabul University engineering student. Hekmatyar became the leader in an even more radical organization, the Hezb-i-Islami .(IslamicParty).

These territories became part of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province afterPakistan and India gained independence in 1947, but remained loosely tied to Afghanistan throughtrade, nomadic grazing, and family connections. (12) The second foreign policy pillar was the effortto reap maximum gains from the East-West Cold War by playing one superpower off against theother.", "Chronically Strained Relations with Pakistan. The Paktunistan campaign was pursued with particular intensity during the period 1953 to 1963,when the King's cousin, Mohammad Daoud, served as prime minister. The diplomatic agitation andfrequent border incidents led to chronic strains in Pakistan-Afghan relations, including periodicclosures by Pakistan of the common border, driving Afghanistan deeper into dependence on theSoviet Union for aid, trade, and military support. Ultimately, Daoud's policies so harmed theAfghan economy that the King sought and received his cousin's resignation.

The conjunction of Afghan irredentism and the U.S. Cold War alliance with Pakistan caused friction inU.S.-Afghan relations and led Kabul to drift into the Soviet orbit. U.S. arms assistance to Pakistanunder the Mutual Security Program of 1954, which was aimed at checking Soviet expansion, hadunintended consequences in the case of Afghanistan. Partly to placate Islamabad, the EisenhowerAdministration and its successors rejected Kabul's requests for military aid, causing the U.S.S.R.to become Afghanistan's main supplier of arms and military training. Soviet weapons and thepresence of Soviet advisors gave Moscow extensive influence within the Afghan army and air force. The Soviets also constructed important military airfields at Bagram, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Shindand,a gas pipeline to Soviet Central Asia, and a network of surfaced roads linking Afghanistan to theU.S.S.R.

Nixon visited the country in 1953, at theoutset of the Eisenhower Administration, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower visited Kabul in1959. King Zahir Shah, likewise, visited Washington in 1963, about the time that he began takinga more active role in governing the country.

In May 1996 Rabbani and Masud made a deal with Hekmatyar, giving him the presidency, but allof them were routed by the Taliban in September 1996.

By the end of his reign, however, the legitimacy of the Kingand his officials was increasingly contested by university students both on the left and the Islamicright, and by members of the growing middle and professional classes, who were frustrated at beingdenied a meaningful role in national affairs.

Among many Pashtun royalists, he is regarded as a turncoat.", "Acceptable Ethnic Balance. Ethnic and tribal conflict has long been the bane of Afghanistan. The main fault line has been between the Pashtuns,who form a plurality of something less than 40 percent of the population, and the minority Tajiks,Uzbeks, Hazaras, and others. In the best of times the ethnic balance was preserved through a kindof informal social compact that provided for Pashtun control over the main levers of power but leftconsiderable space for the Tajiks, and to a lesser extent the Uzbeks, to participate in the middlelevels of the administration and the army, and to dominate the commercial life of Kabul and othercities.", "Positive Center-Provincial Relations. The third element in past periods of stability has been comparative harmony between the state, whose officialsstaffed the central government ministries and the provincial administrations, and the tribal leaders,Muslim clerics, and other notables who constituted the local power centers outside the capital. Thisrelationship was aided by the fact that relatively few demands were imposed by the centralgovernment, which carried out limited functions. Relations between the state and local forces hadbecome progressively more difficult with the increase of modernization and economic development. The complete breakdown of any semblance of a functioning administration, starting with the Marxistcoup in 1978, including the destruction of the central bureaucracy and the complete disappearanceof the Kabul's involvement in provincial affairs, will make it very difficult to reestablish thestructure of a functioning nation state.", "Harmony Between the State and Islam. Last, but not least, past stability depended heavily on the maintenance of a balance between the spheres of thestate and Islam. For much of the country's history, the state managed provincial and tribal affairsthrough the agency of the mullahs and other clerics, who also enjoyed state patronage. By the 1970s,these relations had become strained owing to the rise of various ideologically Islamist movementsand parties. The Taliban successfully avoided this conundrum by creating a theocratic system thatlargely eliminated the apparatus of the state. Resistance from the Islamists and traditionalists couldcreate a serious challenge to the objectives of the United States, the United Nations, and theinternational community, all of which support in one way or another a modernist developmentagenda, including emphasis on matters such as women's rights and universal secular education.", "Critical Role of Foreign Powers. Interaction with foreign powers has been a critical dimension of Afghan history. In the distant past, Afghanistan wasboth a well-spring of empires and a corridor through which conquerors passed to the richer lands ofwhat are now India and Pakistan. The Afghan Lodhi Dynasty ruled parts of what is now Pakistanand northern India from the mid-tenth century until being displaced by the Moghul Empire in themid-16th century-a muticultural construction which included a large admixture of Afghans in themilitary ranks. In modern times Afghanistan has generally been the object of foreignconquest-especially by Persia, British India, and Russia. The Durrani Dynasty established andmaintained its dominance by fighting off British and Russian incursions. The collapse of Durranirule led to extreme foreign intervention in the form of invasion and occupation by the Soviet Unionand support to the anti-Soviet resistance by a host of powers, including especially the United States,Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. The Taliban came to power with critical Pakistani and SaudiArabian support, while Russia and Iran sought to bolster the Alliance forces of Rabbani and Masud.", "Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the effort to get rid of the Taliban brought the United States, Russia, Uzbekistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics into an uneasycommon cause. The anti-Taliban campaign appeared initially to draw Iran into a more cooperativerelationship with the United States, albeit only tacitly, but Tehran's objectives became less clear withthe defeat of the Taliban and the growing presence of U.S. and other Western military forces in thecountry. Iran's reported reinvolvement in Afghan affairs, including alleged support to both IsmailKhan in Herat and the Uzbek leader, General Dostum, in Mazar-i-Sharif, have troubled U.S. andallied officials.

The country's ethnic divisions lie at heart of the problem of achieving national unity, and constitute the first layer. Even personalambition, the most overt driving force of disunity, operates within an ethnic context. Since theSoviet withdrawal in 1989 ethnicity has been the main common denominator of civil strife. Atpresent, Tajik-Pashtun rivalry is the core issue affecting Afghan politics, with the Pashtuns viewingthe Interim Administration as Tajik-dominated. ", "Regionally-Based Warlords and Commanders.

Haji Qadir was murdered byunknown assassins outside his office in Kabul in early July 2002, a few days after accepting the postof vice-president (one of three so-designated). Last but not least are remnants of the Taliban whoare more known for their role as tribal leaders and commanders, rather than Islamic zealots, whoappear to retain local support, if not strength, in many parts of the Pashtun South.

Finally, the NorthernAlliance benefits from having powerful foreign patrons-Russia, Iran, Uzbekistan, and, more recently,the United States. The Uzbek warlord, General Dostum , controls a vital road connection withCentral Asia and has made and broken several different governments and alliances, and has noapparent Uzbek rivals.

In addition to Dostum, noted above, these include particularlyindependent-minded tribes in southeastern Afghanistan, especially the Shinwaris who inhabitNangahar Province and other areas around Jalalabad and the Kyber Pass. Traditionally the Shinwarisand other eastern Pashtun tribes have engaged in drug production and smuggling, and preyed onKhyber Pass goods traffic. Valuing their independence, they rejected the Durrani supremacy. TheEastern Pashtun tribes often have allied with Tajik and dissident Pashtun challengers to Durrani rule. During the anti-Soviet war, the Shinwaris and other eastern Pashtuns provided the main base ofsupport for competing radical mujahidin groups led by Yunis Khalis and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, bothof whom belong to non-mainstream Pashtun tribes. These are the tribes who assisted U.S. forcesin the assault on the Tora Bora, some of whom also may have facilitated the escape of Al Qaedaforces.

Apart from various kinds of new assistance and debt relief,Musharraf's crackdown on his own Islamic radicals showed that these groups generally lacked strongpublic support, and strengthened his hold on power.

Both of these are extremely complicated issues given Afghanistan'ssocial and economic traditions. Progress on both issues, if it is to occur, clearly depends onfundamental economic and social modernization, which is most likely to occur under a governmentthat has both a progressive outlook and popular support based on participatory politics.", "Narcotics or Development. The U.S. stake in economic development in Afghanistan is even more clear with regard to Afghan's status as theworld's leading producer of opium. Many of the poppy-growing areas are the fiefdoms of triballeaders whose tribes which have for centuries depended on illicit sources of income, including drugsand smuggling. In the recent past, before the Taliban takeover, international agencies reportedly hadsome success in gaining cuts in poppy production in Nangahar and other poppy-growing areas ofsoutheastern Afghanistan, in exchange for economic assistance, but such gains tended to beinconsistent, at best.", "The Karzai administration has announced an ambitious U.S.-backed program to make one-time payments to farmers to destroy their opium crops or face destruction by government agents withoutcompensation. The payments are said to amount to something more than for a wheat crop, but muchless than the value of an opium crop. Reportedly, the United States, the U.K., and other Westerncountries have agreed to finance the program, but U.S. officials are also said to despair of having anymajor impact for three major reasons: (1) the Kabul government simply does not have the staff orreach to have an impact on many of the most important producing areas; (2) the crop is nearly readyfor harvest; and (3) the poppy growers and their affiliated smugglers and warlords will likely fightagainst any effort to forcefully destroy the crops. A decree signed by Chairman Karzai on behalf ofthe interim government, which would make illegal the collection of loans to opium growers, iswidely viewed as unenforceable. (37) Someobservers speculate that malfeasance in the anti-narcoticsprogram in Nangahar Province, and/or the opposition by drug lords, may lie at the root of HajiQadir's assassination in early July 2002.

The same political conditions that have created support for reactionaryreligious ideas have fostered retrogression in the status of women. Both in the refugee camps andin conflict areas, young men were separated from the company of even their female relatives. Someanalysts believe the lack of ordinary contact with women in the refugee camps across the border inPakistan has heightened sex discrimination in Afghanistan beyond traditional levels. Also, becauseof the concerns of women about their safety in a male-dominated society, they sometimes themselvesembrace the veil and burka out of self-protection.

Two regional warlords, General Dostum in the North and Ismail Khan in the West supportand fund female education. The real rate of progress in this area, however, probably will depend onthe pace of economic revival and modernization.", "Women's organizations and other observers regard the outcome of the Loya Jirga as mixed. On the one hand, women actively participated and their often eloquent speeches received a respectfulhearing. A woman even ran for president-coming in a distant second in a three cornered race. Onthe other hand, a conservative Islamic reaction against the participation of women in thecabinet-including a negative opinion from Karzai's appointee as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,an Islamic conservative-caused the President not to re-appoint a woman, Dr. Sima Samar, as theMinister of Women's Affairs.

The first is the reported inability of U.S. representatives in Kabul to provide reliableexpectations regarding the deliveries of various forms of assistance. One source of delay in thedelivery of U.S. support to the Transitional Administration is that funding is scattered over at leastsix different departments and agencies, all of which have their own bureaucratic procedures. Thesebottlenecks have been a persistent problem in a number of situations, including U.S. assistance toBosnia. (41) It may be possible to bring more orderand cohesion to this process without altering basiclines of department and agency authority and responsibility, which have evolved over a long periodof time and would be difficult to change.

From the point of view of Afghan politics, an even more important issue may be a significant level oftension between the objectives of U.S. military operations against Taliban and Al Qaeda remnantsand the goal of bolstering the power of the Kabul administration vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis regional warlords. Bynearly all accounts, U.S. military forces made brilliant use of local Afghan militias and otherirregular forces, thereby advancing the date for the replacement of the Taliban government by theInterim Administration, as well as saving many lives-American, allied, and Afghan. Unfortunately,U.S. military strategy, including on-going operations, inadvertently has tended to bolster the powerof some warlords who are resisting the imposition of Kabul's authority, and also increased thepossibility that any renewal of internal conflict will be more intense and deadly. A start was madein resolving this contradiction by the recent \"graduation\" of the first contingent of a new,multi-ethnic national army, but as noted above, this will long remain a negligible force whencompared to those of the regional warlords - even those in Kabul itself.", "The mistaken air attacks on four villages in Uruzgan Province in the early hours of July 2, 2002, have generated a number of calls for a reconsideration of U.S. strategy, especially the heavy use ofair power based on intelligence information provided by local Afghan militias and warlords. Severalserious mistaken attacks on civilians, including reported Karzai supporters and villages friendly tothe government, have been blamed at least in part on bad intelligence supplied by local allies of U.S.and other western military forces. Some suspect that several of these incidents may be the result ofdeliberate actions by Afghan warlords and militia leaders to exact revenge on rivals. ", "Clearly the U.S. and its western allies cannot operate without intelligence provided by local Afghan forces, but the use of extremely lethal ordnance makes any error highly costly in human life. Some analysts and even Afghan victims of U.S. air attacks have suggested that too much relianceis being put on stand-off air attacks and not enough on using ground troops to reconnoiter or engage suspected targets and verify them before initiating devastating air attacks. Because of theseincidents, some observers warn that the policies of the United States, and to a lesser extent itswestern European allies, are resting on shifting sands. ", "Response to Calls for Expanded International Peacekeeping. Especially because U.S. forces are already engaged as de factoarbiters and peacekeepers, often at risk to the forces themselves, a number of Members of Congresshave called on the Bush Administration to reconsider its opposition to increasing the numbers anddispersion of international peacekeepers, possibly including U.S. forces. (42) The Defense Departmenthas argued that the presence of international peacekeeping forces could complicate the coordinationof their ongoing military operations, and that other countries are not eager to fill this role. Criticsrespond that gaining additional allied participation in peacekeeping requires U.S. leadership andparticipation. (43)", "International aid agencies and aid workers are almost universal in declaring that they cannot function without the security provided by international peacekeepers. Also, aid agencies note thatinternational peacekeepers have been a \"draw\" factor in attracting hundreds of thousands of refugeesback to their homes, but thus far mainly in the neighborhood of Kabul. International relief officialsargue that much more rapid progress could be made in returning both external and internal refugeesto their homes if the size of the peacekeeping force could be enlarged and deployed to otherpopulation centers.", "Possible Benefits of a More Transparent U.S. Military Role on theGround. Bush Administration officials say that the military phase of the war is allbut over, but that U.S. troops will remain for a long time in order to keep Al Qaeda and the Talibanoff balance and prevent them from regaining the initiative. Under these circumstances, one potentialbenefit of making the current U.S. role more transparent would be to defuse Afghan suspicions thatthe United States is seeking to convert the ongoing hunt for Taliban and Al Qaeda remnants into anindefinite military occupation. Afghanistan has a history of reacting harshly to the presence offoreign military forces and interference in Afghan politics. Every local conflict that U.S. forces maydefuse has the potential for creating enemies. This is an inevitable consequence of peacekeeping,but since many ordinary Afghans welcome an international presence and the security it provides,operating under U.N. or other international auspices may provoke less of a backlash. Given manyindications from American officials that substantial U.S. forces will remain in Afghanistan for a longtime to come, Congress may wish to consider further the nature and modalities of the U.S. militaryrole, including the relationship of U.S. forces to ISFA.
