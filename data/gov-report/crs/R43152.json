Its use along with horizontal drilling has been responsible for an increase in estimated U.S. oil and natural gas reserves. Hydraulic fracturing and related oil and gas production activities have been controversial because of their potential effects on public health and the environment. Several environmental statutes have implications for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing by the federal government and states.", "An amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) passed as a part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) clarified that the Underground Injection Control (UIC) requirements found in the SDWA do not apply to hydraulic fracturing, although the exclusion does not extend to the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations. The underground injection of wastewater generated during oil and gas production (including hydraulic fracturing) does require a UIC permit under the SDWA, as do injections for enhanced oil and gas recovery operations. Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), parties seeking to discharge produced water may have to apply for a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Under the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued new rules covering emissions of volatile organic compounds from hydraulic fracturing operations.", "Provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) exempt drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy from regulation as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. However, these wastes are subject to other federal laws (such as the SDWA and the CWA), as well as to state requirements. Facility owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties could potentially face liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and the costs of federal public health studies, if hydraulic fracturing results in the release of hazardous substances at or under the surface in a manner that may endanger public health or the environment.", "The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of proposed federal actions before proceeding with them. An agency would be obligated to consider the impacts of an action that involves hydraulic fracturing if that action takes place on federal lands or when there is otherwise a sufficient federal nexus to hydraulic fracturing.", "Under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), owners or operators of facilities where certain hazardous hydraulic fracturing chemicals are present above certain thresholds may have to comply with emergency planning requirements; emergency release notification obligations; and hazardous chemical storage reporting requirements. In August 2011, environmental groups petitioned EPA to promulgate rules under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration or production.", "While the federal government's oversight of hydraulic fracturing generally is limited to protection of the environment and public health pursuant to the aforementioned statutes, it does have some authority to regulate oil and natural gas exploration and production on federal lands. Whether this authority extends to particular regulations governing hydraulic fracturing is currently in dispute. The Bureau of Land Management published a rule on hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands in March 2015; however, the rule was struck down by a U.S. District Court in June 2016. The matter is currently on appeal.", "At the state level, hydraulic fracturing tort litigation has raised questions about causation; whether hydraulic fracturing is an abnormally dangerous activity; and whether hydraulic fracturing may constitute a subsurface trespass to land. Also, several municipalities have attempted to ban hydraulic fracturing through zoning restrictions and other local laws, creating potential conflicts with oil and gas industry regulation at the state level."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to recover oil and natural gas from underground low permeability rock formations.

Part C of the SDWA establishes the national regulatory program for the protection of underground sources of drinking water, including the oversight and limitation of underground injections that could affect aquifers, through the establishment of underground injection control regulations. Section 1421 of the SDWA directs the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations for state underground injection control (UIC) programs, and mandates that the EPA regulations \"contain minimum requirements for programs to prevent underground injection that endangers drinking water sources.\" Section 1421(b)(2) specifies that EPA", "may not prescribe requirements for state UIC programs which interfere with or impede\u2014(A) the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations, or (B) any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas, unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection . ", "As noted, Section 1421 of the SDWA states that UIC regulations must \"contain minimum requirements for effective programs to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources.\" Known as the \"endangerment standard,\" this statutory standard is a major driving force in EPA regulation of underground injection. This endangerment language focuses on protecting groundwater that is used or may be used to supply public water systems. This focus parallels the general scope of the statute, which addresses the quality of water provided by public water systems and does not address private, residential wells. The endangerment language has raised questions as to whether EPA regulations can reach underground injection activities to protect groundwater that is not used by public water systems.", "The SDWA directs EPA to protect against endangerment of an \"underground source of drinking water\" (USDW). The regulations define a USDW to mean an aquifer or part of an aquifer that either:", "supplies a public water system; or contains a sufficient quantity of groundwater to supply a public water system; and currently supplies drinking water for human consumption; or contains fewer than 10,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L) total dissolved solids; and is not an \"exempted aquifer.\"", "To implement the UIC program as mandated by the provisions of the SDWA described above, EPA has established six classes of underground injection wells based on categories of materials that are injected into the ground by each class. In addition to the similarity of fluids injected in each class of wells, each class shares similar construction, injection depth, design, and operating techniques. The wells within a class are required to meet a set of appropriate performance criteria for protecting undergro und sources of drinking water. Class II wells feature the injection of brines and other fluids associated with oil and gas production, and hydrocarbons for storage. The wells inject fluids beneath the lowermost USDW. If hydraulic fracturing were to be regulated under the SDWA, it is likely that most hydraulic fracturing operations would be characterized as Class II wells.", "Under the SDWA, states may take on primary responsibility for administration and enforcement. Section 1422 of the SDWA authorizes EPA to delegate primary enforcement authority for UIC programs to the states, provided that the state program meets EPA requirements promulgated under Section 1421 and prohibits any underground injection that is not authorized by a state permit or rule. If a state's UIC program plan is not approved, or the state has chosen not to assume program responsibility, then EPA must implement the UIC program in that state. Alternatively, Section 1425 authorizes EPA to approve the portion of a state's UIC program that relates to \"any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas\" if the state program meets certain requirements of Section 1421 and represents an effective program to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources. Under this provision, states may demonstrate to EPA that their existing programs for oil and gas injection wells are effective in preventing endangerment of underground sources of drinking water. This provides states with an alternative to meeting the specific requirements contained in EPA regulations promulgated under Section 1421.

However, in the last 15 years a number of developments called into question the extent to which hydraulic fracturing would be considered an \"underground injection\" to be regulated under the SDWA. One trigger for this debate was a challenge to the Alabama UIC program brought by the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation (LEAF)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The LEAF Challenge to the Alabama UIC Program and EPA's Interpretation of the SDWA", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, LEAF petitioned EPA to initiate proceedings to have the agency withdraw its approval of the Alabama UIC program because the program did not regulate hydraulic fracturing operations in the state associated with production of methane gas from coalbed formations. The State of Alabama had previously been authorized by EPA to administer a UIC program pursuant to the terms of the SDWA. EPA denied the LEAF petition in 1995 based on a finding that hydraulic fracturing did not fall within the definition of \"underground injection\" as the term was used in the SDWA and the EPA regulations promulgated under that act. According to EPA, that term applied only to wells whose \"principal function\" was the placement of fluids underground. LEAF challenged EPA's denial of its petition in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, arguing that EPA's interpretation of the terms in question was inconsistent with the language of the SDWA.", "The court rejected EPA's claim that the language of the SDWA allowed it to regulate only those wells whose \"principal function\" was the injection of fluids into the ground. EPA based this claim on what it perceived as \"ambiguity\" in the SDWA regarding the definition of \"underground injection\" as well as a perceived congressional intent to exclude wells with primarily non-injection functions. The court held that there was no ambiguity in the SDWA's definition of \"underground injection\" as \"the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well injection,\" noting that the words have a clear meaning and that:", "The process of hydraulic fracturing obviously falls within this definition, as it involves the subsurface emplacement of fluids by forcing them into cracks in the ground through a well. Nothing in the statutory definition suggests that EPA has the authority to exclude from the reach of the regulations an activity (i.e. hydraulic fracturing) which unquestionably falls within the plain meaning of the definition, on the basis that the well that is used to achieve that activity is also used\u2014even primarily used\u2014for another activity (i.e. methane gas production) that does not constitute underground injection. ", "The court therefore remanded the decision to EPA for reconsideration of LEAF's petition for withdrawal of Alabama's UIC program approval.", "Following the LEAF I decision, in 1999 Alabama submitted a revised UIC program to EPA. Alabama sought approval for the revised UIC program under Section 1425 of the SDWA rather than Section 1422(b). As mentioned above, Section 1425 differs from Section 1422(b) in that approval under Section 1425 is based on a showing by the state that the program meets the generic requirements found in Section 1421(b)(1)(A)-(D) of the SDWA and that the program \"represents an effective program (including adequate recordkeeping and reporting) to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources.\" In contrast, approval of a state program under Section 1422(b) requires a showing that the state's program satisfies the requirements of the UIC regulations promulgated by EPA.", "EPA approved Alabama's revised UIC program in 2000, and LEAF appealed EPA's decision to approve to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. In its challenge, LEAF made three arguments. First, LEAF claimed that EPA should not have approved state regulation of hydraulic fracturing under Section 1425 of the SDWA because it does not \"relate to ... underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,\" one of the requirements for approval under Section 1425. The court rejected this argument, finding that the phrase \"relates to\" was broad and ambiguous enough to include regulation of hydraulic fracturing as being related to secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas.", "Second, LEAF challenged the Alabama program's regulation of hydraulic fracturing as \"Class II-like\" wells not subject to the same regulatory requirements as Class II wells. The court agreed with LEAF on this point, noting that in its decision in LEAF I , it had held that methane gas production wells used for hydraulic fracturing are \"wells\" within the meaning of the statute. As a result, the court found that wells used for hydraulic fracturing must fall under one of the five classes set forth in the EPA regulations at 40 C.F.R. Section 144.6. Specifically, the court found that the injection of hydraulic fracturing fluids for recovery of coalbed methane \"fit squarely within the definition of Class II wells,\" and as a result the court remanded the matter to EPA for a determination of whether Alabama's updated UIC program complied with the requirements for Class II wells.", "Finally, LEAF alleged that even if Alabama's revised UIC program was eligible for approval under Section 1425 of the SDWA, EPA's decision to approve it was \"arbitrary and capricious\" and therefore a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The court rejected this argument."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Energy Policy Act of 2005: A Legislative Exemption for Hydraulic Fracturing", "paragraphs": ["The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in LEAF I highlighted a debate over whether the SDWA, as it read at the time, required EPA to regulate hydraulic fracturing.

It was not clear to states or the regulated community how EPA would address the EPAct 2005 amendment, and for several years EPA took no official position regarding the regulation of hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel under the SDWA.", "In February 2014, EPA issued final diesel permitting guidance, which states that \"under the 2005 amendments to the SDWA, a UIC Class II permit must be obtained prior to conducting the underground injection of diesel fuels for hydraulic fracturing.\" As described earlier in this report, injections subject to UIC Class II requirements must comply with a number of regulatory requirements. These include permitting requirements, and testing and monitoring obligations with respect to the well. The guidance is intended for EPA permit writers and is relevant where EPA directly implements the UIC Class II program. EPA notes that \"[t]o the extent that states may choose to follow some aspects of EPA guidance in implementing their own programs, it may also be relevant in areas where EPA is not the permitting authority.\"", "There had been considerable debate regarding how EPA would define \"diesel fuels\" in the final guidance. The draft guidance recommends using six Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) for determining whether diesel fuels are used in hydraulic fracturing operations. These six CASRNs collectively include various types of diesel fuels, home heating oils, kerosene, crude oil, and a range of other petroleum compounds. Also at issue was whether the final guidance would specify a de minimis amount of diesel fuel content for hydraulic fracturing fluids; the draft guidance did not do so. The final document covers five of the six proposed CASRNs (no longer including crude oil), and does not establish a de minimis concentration of \"diesel\" in fracturing fluid that would be exempt from permitting requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Clean Water Act", "paragraphs": ["Hydraulic fracturing is a water-intensive practice. After a well is hydraulically fractured, a substantial portion of the injected fluid returns to the surface as \"flowback.\" This flowback typically contains proppant (sand) and chemical residues from the frac fluid, as well as salts, metals, and potentially significant amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) that may be present in the water produced from the geologic formations. Additionally, oil and gas wells generally continue to produce formation water throughout their production lives. Flowback water and production brine that are not reused will require proper disposal, either through underground injection or treatment and surface discharge.", "Often this flowback is injected into wells for disposal. However, if underground injection is not feasible or not employed for other reasons, drilling companies may opt to transfer the wastewater to publicly owned treatment works (POTW) that discharge into navigable waters in compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA). Section 301(a) of the CWA prohibits \"the discharge of any pollutant\" into \"navigable waters\" except as permitted pursuant to other sections of the CWA. Under Section 304(m), EPA sets national standards for discharges of industrial wastewater based on best available technologies that are economically achievable. States incorporate these limits into discharge permits. Current effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) and standards for the Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category prohibit direct discharges of onshore oil and gas wastewater into surface waters. However, current ELGs do not include standards for \"indirect discharges\" of these wastewaters to POTWs.", "On June 28, 2016, EPA promulgated final regulations establishing a \"zero discharge\" pretreatment standard to prohibit discharges to POTWs of wastewater resulting from unconventional oil and gas production.

However, other federal environmental statutes do not contain similar reservations of jurisdiction, and EPA has sought to regulate certain environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing pursuant to these statutes. One such avenue is regulation of emissions associated with the hydraulic fracturing process via the Clean Air Act (CAA). On August 16, 2012, EPA issued new regulations covering, among other things, emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from onshore natural gas hydraulic fracturing operations.", "The impetus for the new regulations was a legal challenge filed by environmental organizations. In 2009, WildEarth Guardians and the San Juan Citizens Alliance filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that EPA had failed to review and revise its New Source Performance Standards (NSPSs) for oil and gas operations every eight years as required by Section 111(b)(1)(B) of the CAA. Specifically, the environmental groups alleged that EPA had failed to update existing standards and adopt new standards for emissions from oil and natural gas production as well as natural gas transmission and storage.", "The challenge and subsequent settlement triggered a new rulemaking by EPA in which it not only updated existing standards for certain natural gas processing plants, but also established new standards for emissions from certain types of natural gas operations not covered at all in the existing standards. Among the new standards were requirements applicable to new onshore natural gas hydraulic fracturing operations as well as refracturing operations.", "The new regulations direct the industry to adopt a process known as \"green completions\" or \"reduced emissions completions\" for hydraulically fractured gas wells. (Hydraulically fractured oil wells are exempt from the 2012 NSPS requirements.) In a \"green completion,\" the natural gas that would otherwise be vented or flared during the completion process is captured and cleaned for reuse in another process that does not involve direct release into the atmosphere. In order to allow the industry time to make the needed changes, the rulemaking established two phases for compliance. During Phase 1, which lasted from the effective date of the rulemaking (October 15, 2012) until January 1, 2015, industry had to reduce VOC emissions at new hydraulic fracturing sites either by using a \"completion combustion device\" in a technique commonly referred to as \"flaring,\" or by employing the green completion process. As of January 1, 2015, all hydraulically fractured wells had to employ a green completion. These requirements apply both to new hydraulic fracturing operations and to refracturing of existing wells. The regulations also establish reporting requirements for owners and operators of hydraulically fractured and refractured wells prior to the start of well completion.", "There are some exceptions in these regulations for certain types of wells. Exploratory or \"wildcat\" drilling operations and \"delineation wells\" used to determine the borders of a reservoir, and low-pressure wells do not need to employ green completions. The 2012 NSPS requires operators of these types of wells to use completion combustion devices unless hazardous or prohibited under state or local law or regulations.", "On June 3, 2016, EPA promulgated several CAA rules affecting the oil and natural gas production industry, including amendments to the NSPS standards for the oil and natural gas source category to establish new emissions standards for methane (a short-lived greenhouse gas) and VOCs. ", "Briefly, the rules do the following: ", "1. Build on the 2012 NSPS \"to set first-ever controls for methane emissions and extend controls for VOC emissions beyond the existing requirements to include new or modified hydraulically fractured oil wells, pneumatic pumps, compressor stations, and leak detection and repair at well sites, gathering and boosting stations, and processing plants.\" The final rule also includes the issuance for public comment of an Information Collection Request (ICR) that would require companies to provide extensive information that is instrumental for developing comprehensive regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. EPA notes the new NSPS does not add requirements for operations covered by the 2012 rule but it expands coverage to include other sources. 2. Revise permitting requirements applicable to stationary sources in the oil and natural gas sector. The rule establishes in regulation a specific meaning of the term \"adjacent\" for this sector, which was previously defined in guidance documents. 3. Limit emissions from oil and gas production in Indian country.", "Further, EPA has issued rules or guidelines to strengthen the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to require reporting in all segments of the industry (promulgated on October 22, 2015) and extend VOC reduction requirements to existing oil and gas sources in ozone nonattainment areas and states in the Ozone Transport Region (released on August 18, 2015)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Resource Conservation and Recovery Act62", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state authorities to regulate wastes are established under the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA).

The exemption was motivated in part by a concern about the economic impact that comprehensive regulation of E&P wastes under Subtitle C would have on the oil and gas industry. The Bentsen amendment required EPA to conduct a study of E&P waste and submit its findings to Congress. If EPA determined that E&P wastes warranted regulation under Subtitle C, the agency was required to submit proposed regulations to both houses of Congress. Those regulations\u00a0could \"take effect only when authorized by Act of Congress.\"", "In its 1987 report to Congress, EPA found, in part, that existing state and federal regulations were generally adequate to regulate E&P wastes, although there were regulatory gaps in certain states. EPA further found that regulating E&P wastes under RCRA Subtitle C would have a substantial impact on the U.S. economy and would be unnecessary and impracticable. In its 1988 regulatory determination, EPA determined that the management of E&P wastes under Subtitle C was not warranted, but that the agency would pursue the following three-pronged approach to addressing adverse effects of the waste: improve existing federal regulatory programs under RCRA Subtitle D and augment the Safe Drinking Water Act and/or Clean Water Act requirements; work with states to improve their waste management programs; and work with Congress on any additional legislation that might be needed.

That is, unused fracturing fluids may be subject to Subtitle C requirements if the fluid exhibits characteristics that make a waste \"hazardous\" (e.g., exceed regulatory levels for toxicity).

The government will likely argue that its broad authority to regulate activities on federal lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, including the power to \"take any action necessary to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands,\" provides sufficient basis for the promulgation of the BLM Final Rule. The government also will likely cite its authority under Section 226(g) of the Mineral Leasing Act to \"regulate all surface-disturbing activities conducted pursuant to any lease issued under this chapter.\" The Tenth Circuit's decision on this matter will set an important precedent with respect to the federal government's ability to regulate hydraulic fracturing and potentially other environmental concerns related to oil and natural gas exploration and production on federal lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM Venting and Flaring Rule", "paragraphs": ["On February 8, 2016, the BLM proposed a rule to update standards to reduce venting and flaring from oil and gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian leases. The proposal would clarify when produced gas lost through venting, flaring, or leaks is subject to royalties and would replace provisions governing venting, flaring, and royalty-free use of gas issued in 1980. The proposed rule would limit natural gas venting to specified circumstances and also limit the rate of routine flaring of natural gas associated with oil well development. BLM expects to issue a final venting and flaring rule in late 2016.

This section discusses some of this legislation.", "The Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act of 2015 (FRAC Act) has been introduced in the House ( H.R. 1482 ) and the Senate ( S. 785 ). The bills would amend the SDWA to (1) require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process, and (2) repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption established in EPAct 2005, and amend the term \"underground injection\" to include the injection of fluids used in hydraulic fracturing operations, thus authorizing EPA to regulate this process under the SDWA. Additionally, S. 785 would authorize states to seek primary enforcement authority for hydraulic fracturing operations, regardless of whether the state had obtained primacy for other types of UIC wells, including Class II wells.", "The Safe Hydration is An American Right in Energy Development Act of 2015 ( H.R. 1515 ) also would amend the SDWA to create a new prohibition on fracking unless the party conducting the fracking operations agrees to comply with new testing and data reporting requirements.", "Legislation also has been introduced to require baseline and follow-up testing of potable groundwater in the vicinity of hydraulic fracturing operations. H.R. 1515 , the Safe Hydration is an American Right in Energy Development Act of 2015, would amend the SDWA to prohibit hydraulic fracturing unless the person proposing to conduct the fracturing operations agreed to testing and reporting requirements regarding underground sources of drinking water. H.R. 1515 would require testing prior to, during, and after hydraulic fracturing operations. Testing would be required for any substance EPA determines would indicate damage associated with hydraulic fracturing operations. The bill also would require EPA to post on its website all test results, searchable by zip code.", "H.R. 1647 and S. 15 , the Protecting States' Rights to Promote American Energy Security Act, would amend the Mineral Leasing Act to prohibit the Department of the Interior from enforcing any federal regulation, guidance, or permit requirement regarding hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on or under any land in any state that has regulations, guidance, or permit requirements for hydraulic fracturing. Although this language is broadly applicable to any federal regulation, guidance, and permit requirements \"regarding hydraulic fracturing,\" the prohibition on enforcement applies only to the Department of the Interior, and therefore would presumably impact only hydraulic fracturing operations on lands managed by the depart ment. The bill also would require the Department of the Interior to defer to state regulations, permitting, and guidance for all activities related to hydraulic fracturing relating to oil, gas, or geothermal production activities on federal land regardless of whether those rules were duplicative, more or less restrictive, or did not meet federal guidelines. The House version of the bill also would direct the Comptroller General to conduct a study \"examining the economic benefits of domestic shale oil and gas production resulting from the process of hydraulic fracturing.\" Other legislation has also been introduced in the 114 th Congress to limit the authority of the Department of the Interior to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Environmental statutes enforced by EPA contain several key exemptions for hydraulic fracturing and related oil and gas production activities. For example, an amendment to the SDWA passed as a part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 clarified that the underground injection control requirements found in the SDWA do not apply to hydraulic fracturing, although the exclusion does not extend to the use of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations. In addition, drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. Under EPCRA, facilities used by the oil and gas extraction industry are generally not included in the industry codes required to report under the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI).", "Environmental groups have filed petitions seeking regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities under various environmental laws enforced by EPA. In September 2010, an environmental advocacy group filed a petition seeking to have EPA regulate drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas, or geothermal energy as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. In August 2011, environmental advocacy organizations petitioned EPA to promulgate rules under Section 4 and Section 8 of TSCA for chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration or production. In October 2012, several environmental advocacy organizations asked EPA to require the oil and gas extraction industry to report the toxic chemicals it releases under the TRI program. ", "Regulation of hydraulic fracturing by local governments has raised questions about state preemption of municipal land use and zoning powers. Courts in a few states have ruled that local governments may regulate where drilling occurs but not how it occurs. In addition, owners of property located near oil and gas operations have brought common law state tort claims against operators, including claims for negligence, strict liability, nuisance, and trespass to land. Although this litigation is still in its early stages, it appears that courts have already faced questions about causation; whether hydraulic fracturing is an abnormally dangerous activity; and whether hydraulic fracturing may constitute a subsurface trespass to land. A recent federal district court decision invalidated BLM's adoption of safety and disclosure requirements for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands, although an appeal of that decision is pending."], "subsections": []}]}}
