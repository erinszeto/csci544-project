The country served as a base for U.S. operations designed to counter Soviet influence in Central America during the 1980s, and it continues to host a U.S. military presence and cooperate on antidrug efforts today. Trade and investment linkages are also long-standing and have grown stronger since the implementation of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) in 2006. In recent years, instability in Honduras\u2014including a 2009 coup and significant outflows of migrants and asylum-seekers since 2014\u2014has led U.S. policymakers to focus greater attention on conditions in the country and their implications for the United States.", "Domestic Situation", "President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of the conservative National Party was inaugurated to a second four-year term in January 2018.

Over the past five years, Honduras has made some progress in reducing violence and putting public finances on a more sustainable path. Anti-corruption efforts have also made some headway, largely as a result of cooperation between the Honduran public prosecutor's office and the Organization of American States-backed Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras.", "Nevertheless, considerable challenges remain. Honduras continues to be one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with more than 67% of Hondurans living below the poverty line. It also remains one of the most violent countries in the world and continues to suffer from persistent human rights abuses and widespread impunity. Moreover, the country's tentative progress in combating corruption has generated a fierce backlash, calling into question the sustainability of those efforts.", "U.S. Policy", "In recent years, U.S. policy in Honduras has been guided by the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, a whole-of-government effort designed to promote economic prosperity, strengthen governance, and improve security in Honduras and the rest of the region. Congress has appropriated more than $2.6 billion for the strategy since FY2016, at least $431 million of which has been allocated to Honduras. Continued U.S. engagement in the region is uncertain, however, as the Trump Administration announced in March 2019 that it intends to end foreign assistance programs in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala due to the continued northward flow of migrants and asylum-seekers to the United States.", "The 116th Congress could play an important role in shaping U.S. policy toward Honduras and the broader region.

Congress will also consider FY2020 foreign aid appropriations. H.R. 2839 would appropriate $540.9 million for the Central America strategy, including at least $75 million for Honduras. That would be $96 million more than the Administration requested for Central America and about $9 million more than the Administration requested for Honduras. Other bills Congress may consider would tie U.S. security assistance to human rights conditions in Honduras (H.R. 1945), tie U.S. assistance to the number of unaccompanied Honduran children that arrive at the U.S. border (H.R. 2049), and expand in-country refugee processing in Honduras (H.R. 2347)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Honduras, a Central American nation of 9.1 million people, faces significant domestic challenges.

In the aftermath of the crisis, the Obama Administration determined that it was \"in the national security interests of the United States\" to work with Central American governments to improve security, strengthen governance, and promote economic prosperity in the region. Accordingly, the Obama Administration launched a new, whole-of-government U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and requested significant increases in foreign assistance to support its implementation.", "The Trump Administration initially maintained the Central America strategy while seeking to scale back the amount of foreign assistance provided to Honduras and its neighbors.

The country's current constitution\u2014its 16 th since declaring independence from Spain in 1821\u2014was adopted as Honduras transitioned back to civilian rule. It establishes a representative democracy with a separation of powers among an executive branch led by the president, a legislative branch consisting of a 128-seat unicameral national congress, and a judicial branch headed by the supreme court. In practice, however, the legislative process tends to be executive-driven and the judiciary is often subject to intimidation, corruption, and politicization.", "Honduras's traditional two-party political system, dominated by the Liberal ( Partido Liberal , PL) and National ( Partido Nacional , PN) Parties, has fractured over the past decade. Both traditional parties are considered to be ideologically center-right, and political competition between them has generally been focused more on using the public sector for patronage than on implementing programmatic agendas. The leadership of both parties supported a 2009 coup, in which the military, backed by the supreme court and congress, detained then-President Manuel Zelaya and flew him into forced exile. Zelaya had been elected as a moderate member of the PL but alienated many within the political and economic elite by governing in a populist manner and calling for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. Many rank-and-file members of the PL abandoned the party in the aftermath of the coup and joined Zelaya upon his return from exile to launch a new left-of-center Liberty and Re-foundation ( Libertad y Refundaci\u00f3n , LIBRE) party. ", "The post-coup split among traditional supporters of the PL has benefitted the PN, which now has the largest political base in Honduras and has controlled the presidency and congress since 2010. Many analysts maintain that the PN has gradually eroded checks and balances to consolidate its influence over other government institutions and entrench itself in power. For example, in 2012, the PN-controlled congress, led by Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, replaced four supreme court justices who had struck down a pair of high-profile government initiatives. Although the Honduran minister of justice and human rights asserted that the move was illegal and violated the independence of the judiciary, it was never overturned. The justices who were installed in 2012 issued a ruling in 2015 that struck down the constitution's explicit ban on presidential reelection, allowing Hern\u00e1ndez, who had been elected president in 2013, to seek a second term. The PN has also manipulated appointments to other nominally independent institutions, such as the country's electoral oversight body. Given that Honduras continues to hold multiparty elections but falls short of democratic standards in several areas, Freedom House classifies the country as \"partly free,\" and the Varieties of Democracy Project classifies the country as an \"electoral autocracy.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hern\u00e1ndez Administration", "paragraphs": ["President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of the PN was inaugurated to a second four-year term in January 2018.

The 2017 election was also plagued by an \"abundance of irregularities and deficiencies\" that led some international observers to question whether the official results, which gave Hern\u00e1ndez a narrow 42.9%-41.4% victory over Salvador Nasralla of the LIBRE-led \"Opposition Alliance against the Dictatorship,\" accurately reflected the will of the Honduran people. Both major opposition parties contested the results, and many Hondurans took to the streets to protest the alleged election fraud. At least 23 Hondurans were killed in post-election violence, at least 16 of whom were shot by Honduran security forces.

Individuals affiliated with the top three presidential candidates reportedly arrived at 169 areas of consensus related to human rights, electoral reforms, constitutional reforms, and the rule of law, but they were unable to conclude formal political agreements on most of those issues. Nevertheless, in January 2019, the Honduran congress approved a package of constitutional changes to partially reform the electoral process. The changes will restructure the national registry office, dissolve the country's existing electoral authority, and create two new institutions\u2014a national electoral council to organize and supervise electoral processes and an electoral justice court to settle electoral disputes. Although many analysts have recommended that Honduras depoliticize its electoral institutions, each of the agencies will consist of three primary officials, effectively allowing the PN, PL, and LIBRE to divide the positions among themselves as the PN and the PL have done historically.", "Over the past year and a half, Hern\u00e1ndez has largely maintained the business-friendly economic policies and hardline approach to security policy that he implemented during his first term (see \" Economic and Social Conditions \" and \" Security Conditions \" below). His PN, which holds 61 of the 128 seats in congress, has been able to control the legislative agenda with the ad-hoc support of several small parties. Most Hondurans are dissatisfied with status quo, however, as 86% of those surveyed in May 2019 asserted that the country is moving in the wrong direction. Unemployment is considered the top problem in the country, cited by 30% of those surveyed, followed by corruption (19%), poor health care (15%), insecurity (11%), drugs (9%), and the cost of living (8%).

Honduran civil society had carried out a series of mass demonstrations demanding the establishment of an international anti-corruption organization after Honduran authorities discovered that at least $300 million was embezzled from the Honduran social security institute during the PN administration of President Porfirio Lobo (2010-2014) and some of the stolen funds were used to fund Hern\u00e1ndez's 2013 election campaign. Hern\u00e1ndez was reluctant to create an independent organization with far-reaching authorities like the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which had helped bring down the Guatemalan president in 2015. Facing significant domestic and international pressure, however, he negotiated a more limited arrangement with the OAS. According to the agreement, signed in January 2016, the MACCIH is intended to support, strengthen, and collaborate with Honduran institutions to prevent, investigate, and punish acts of corruption. ", "The MACCIH initially focused on strengthening Honduras's anti-corruption legal framework. It secured congressional approval for new laws to create anti-corruption courts with nationwide jurisdiction and to regulate the financing of political campaigns. The Honduran congress repeatedly delayed and weakened the MACCIH's proposed reforms, however, hindering the mission's anti-corruption efforts. For example, prior to enactment of the law to establish anti-corruption courts with nationwide jurisdiction, the Honduran congress modified the measure by stripping the new judges of the authority to order asset forfeitures, stipulating that the new judges can hear only cases involving three or more people, and removing certain crimes\u2014including the embezzlement of public funds\u2014from the jurisdiction of the new courts. Other measures the MACCIH has proposed, such as an \"effective collaboration\" bill to encourage members of criminal networks to cooperate with officials in exchange for reduced sentences, have stalled in congress. Such plea-bargaining laws have proven crucial to anti-corruption investigations in other countries, such as the ongoing \"Car Wash\" ( Lava Jato ) probe in Brazil.", "MACCIH officials are also working alongside Honduras's Special Prosecution Unit to Fight Corruption-related Impunity ( Unidad Fiscal Especial Contra la Impunidad de la Corrupci\u00f3n , UFECIC) to jointly investigate and prosecute high-level corruption cases. To date, these integrated teams have presented 12 cases, uncovering corruption networks involved in activities ranging from using social assistance funds for personal expenses to awarding government contracts to narcotics traffickers in exchange for campaign contributions. Nearly 120 people are facing prosecution, including more than 70 cabinet ministers, legislators, and other government officials. However, the cases have been slow to move through the Honduran justice system: The first oral trial\u2014involving former First Lady Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo (2010-2014)\u2014began in March 2019.", "Honduran political and economic elites threatened by this tentative progress have sought to obstruct the MACCIH's efforts. In January 2018, for example, the Honduran congress passed a law that effectively blocked an investigation into legislators' mismanagement of public funds. Although the constitutional chamber of the supreme court overturned the law, the Honduran congress has continued to push forward similar measures. A new criminal code, which is to go into effect in November 2019, will reportedly reduce criminal penalties for narcotics trafficking, embezzlement, fraud, illicit enrichment, and abuse of authority, potentially allowing some corrupt officials to avoid serving any time in prison. Some analysts have also questioned the impartiality of judges presiding over the MACCIH-backed cases, several of whom have issued decisions in favor of those accused of corruption.", "The MACCIH's four-year mandate is scheduled to expire in January 2020. More than 61% of Hondurans would like the MACCIH to remain in Honduras, but the Hern\u00e1ndez Administration has expressed little interest in renewing the agreement. The U.S. government, which has provided crucial diplomatic and financial support for the MACCIH over the past three and a half years, has called for an extension of the mission's mandate. Many analysts assert that Honduran public prosecutors would struggle to continue their anti-corruption efforts without the MACCIH or another source of international assistance and political support."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic and Social Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The Honduran economy is one of the least developed in Latin America. Historically, the country's economic performance closely tracked the prices of agricultural commodities, such as bananas and coffee. While agriculture remains important, accounting for 14% of gross domestic product (GDP) and nearly a third of total employment, the Honduran economy has diversified since the late 1980s. Successive Honduran administrations privatized state-owned enterprises, lowered taxes and tariffs, and offered incentives to attract foreign investment, spurring growth in the maquila (offshore assembly for reexport) sector\u2014particularly in the apparel, garment, and textile industries. Those policy changes also fostered the development of nontraditional agricultural exports, such as seafood and palm oil.", "President Hern\u00e1ndez's top economic policy priority upon taking office in 2014 was to put the government's finances on a more sustainable path. The nonfinancial public sector deficit had grown to 7.5% of GDP in 2013 as a result of weak tax collection, increased expenditures, and losses at state-owned enterprises. As the Honduran government struggled to obtain financing for its obligations, public employees and contractors occasionally went unpaid and basic government services were interrupted. In 2014, Hern\u00e1ndez negotiated a three-year agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), under which the Honduran government agreed to reduce the deficit to 2% of GDP by 2017 and carry out structural reforms related to the electricity and telecommunications sectors, pension funds, public-private partnerships, and tax administration in exchange for access to $189 million in financing. The Hern\u00e1ndez Administration ultimately reduced the deficit to less than 1% of GDP in 2017 and adhered to most of its other commitments. In May 2019, the IMF and the Honduran government reached a staff-level agreement on a new two-year economic program that will give Honduras access to $311 million of financing.", "Hern\u00e1ndez has also sought to make Honduras more attractive to foreign investment. He contracted a global consulting firm to develop the five-year \"Honduras 20/20\" plan, which seeks to attract $13 billion of investment and generate 600,000 jobs in four priority sectors: tourism, textiles, intermediate manufacturing, and business services. To achieve the plan's objectives, the Honduran government has adopted a new business-friendly tax code, increased investments in infrastructure, and entered into a customs union with Guatemala and El Salvador. The Hern\u00e1ndez Administration is also moving forward with a controversial plan to establish \"Employment and Economic Development Zones\"\u2014specially designated areas where foreign investors are granted administrative autonomy to enact their own laws, set up their own judicial systems, and carry out other duties usually reserved for governments. Nevertheless, annual foreign direct investment inflows to Honduras fell from $1.4 billion in 2014 to $1.2 billion in 2018.", "The Honduran economy has expanded by an average of 3.9% annually over the past five years, but it is not generating sufficient employment to absorb the country's growing labor supply. In 2017, for example, the Honduran labor force increased by nearly 110,000 people, but only 8,500 jobs were created in the formal sector. The vast majority of new workers were left to work in the unregulated informal sector, without job protections or benefits, or seek opportunity elsewhere. Since nearly 40% of Hondurans are under the age of 19, the country's prime age working population is projected to continue growing for the next two decades. Without stronger job creation, Honduras may miss a key window of opportunity to boost economic growth. In 2018, nearly 20% of Hondurans were unemployed or underemployed, and another 49% of Hondurans worked full time for less than the minimum wage.", "Honduras's recent economic growth has also proven insufficient to reduce the country's high poverty rate. Some economic analysts argue that the Hern\u00e1ndez Administration's fiscal austerity policies have exacerbated the situation by increasing the government's dependence on regressive, indirect taxes while limiting public investment and social welfare expenditures. More than 67% of Hondurans live below the national poverty line. Conditions are particularly difficult in rural Honduras, where nearly 63% of the population lives in extreme poverty\u2014unable to satisfy their basic nutritional needs. In recent years, many rural communities have struggled to contend with a coffee fungus outbreak and a series of droughts that have destroyed crops and reduced agricultural production and employment. Households have reportedly been forced to engage in extreme coping strategies, such as taking on debt, selling off land, and migrating.", "Honduras's medium-term economic performance is expected to mirror the U.S. business cycle, as the United States remains Honduras's top export market and primary source of investment, tourism, and remittances. To boost the country's long-term growth potential, analysts maintain that Honduras will have to improve education and infrastructure and address entrenched social ills, such as widespread crime and corruption and high levels of poverty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Security Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Honduras struggles with high levels of crime and violence. A number of interrelated factors appear to contribute to the poor security situation. Widespread poverty, fragmented families, and a lack of education and employment opportunities leave many Honduran youth susceptible to recruitment by gangs such as the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 . These organizations engage in drug dealing and extortion, among other criminal activities, and appear to be responsible for a substantial portion of homicides and much of the crime that affects citizens on a day-to-day basis.", "Honduras also serves as a significant drug-trafficking corridor as a result of its location between cocaine-producing countries in South America and the major consumer market in the United States. Heavily armed and well-financed transnational criminal organizations have sought to secure control of Honduran territory by battling one another and local affiliates and seeking to intimidate and infiltrate Honduran institutions. Many of these groups have close ties to political and economic elites who rely upon illicit finances to fund their election campaigns and maintain or increase the market share of their businesses. In November 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Antonio \"Tony\" Hern\u00e1ndez\u2014a former member of congress and President Hern\u00e1ndez's brother, for allegedly engaging in large-scale drug trafficking (see \" Counternarcotics \" below).

They have also struggled with systemic corruption, with some sectors working on behalf of criminal organizations or private interests.", "President Hern\u00e1ndez campaigned on a hard-line security platform, repeatedly pledging to do whatever it takes to reduce crime and violence in Honduras. Upon taking office in 2014, he immediately ordered the security forces into the streets to conduct intensive patrols of high-crime neighborhoods. Among the units involved in the ongoing operation are two hybrid forces that Hern\u00e1ndez helped to establish while he was serving as the president of the Honduran congress: the military police force ( Polic\u00eda Militar de Orden P\u00fablico , PMOP), which is under the control of the ministry of defense, and a military-trained police unit known as the \"Tigers\" ( Tropa de Inteligencia y Grupos de Respuesta Especial de Seguri dad , TIGRES ). The PMOP has been implicated in numerous human rights abuses, including 13 of the 16 killings documented by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the aftermath of the 2017 election. Human rights advocates have repeatedly called on the Hern\u00e1ndez Administration to withdraw the military from domestic law enforcement activities.", "Hern\u00e1ndez has also taken some steps to strengthen security and justice-sector institutions. He created a special police reform commission in April 2016 after press reports indicated that high-ranking police commanders had conspired with drug traffickers to assassinate two top Honduran antidrug officials in 2009 and 2011 and the head of the anti-money-laundering unit of the public prosecutor's office in 2013; other officials in the Honduran national police and security ministry reportedly covered up internal investigations of the crimes. Although previous attempts to reform the police force produced few results, the special commission dismissed more than 5,600 personnel, including half of the highest-ranked officers. It also proposed and won congressional approval for measures to restructure the national police force, increase police salaries, and implement new training and evaluation protocols. Public perceptions of the national police have yet to improve substantially, however, as fewer than 34% of Hondurans expressed confidence in the force in 2018.", "Honduras's investigative and prosecutorial capacity has improved in recent years, although impunity remains widespread. In 2015, the Honduran national police launched a new investigative division and the public prosecutor's office established a new criminal investigative agency. Both institutions have set up forensic laboratories and have begun to conduct more scientific investigations. The budget of the public prosecutor's office grew by more than 94% in nominal terms from 2014 to 2018, allowing Attorney General \u00d3scar Chinchilla to hire additional detectives, prosecutors, and other specialized personnel. Nevertheless, the public prosecutor's office accounted for less than 1.5% of the Honduran central government's expenditures in 2018 and remains overburdened. ", "These policies appear to have contributed to considerable improvements in security conditions over the past five years. Although the homicide rate remains high by global standards, it peaked at 86.5 murders per 100,000 residents in 2011 and fell to 41.3 murders per 100,000 residents in 2018 (see Figure 2 , below). Common crime also appears to have declined, with the percentage of Hondurans reporting they had been the victim of a crime in the past year falling from 20.5% in 2014 to 12.8% in 2018.
