Other observers disagree. The issue is potentiallysignificant because implementing the Administration's vision could affect the composition of U.S.defense spending, and because the Administration may invoke the theme of transformation to helpjustify or seek rapid congressional consideration of legislative proposals, including proposals thatcould affect Congress' role in conducting oversight of defense programs. The Iraq war mayinfluence debate on whether active-duty U.S. military forces are sufficiently large to carry out currentU.S. military strategy, and on whether greater emphasis should be placed on forces that are lessdependent on access to in-theater bases.", "One of the most significant defense-program debates going into the Iraq war - and potentially one of those most significantly influenced by the war - concerns the future size and composition ofthe active-duty Army. Both supporters and opponents of maintaining at least 10 active-duty Armydivisions may find support in the Iraq war for their positions, as may both supporters and opponentsof the current Army plan to shift toward a mix of fewer heavy armored units and a larger number oflighter and more mobile units.", "The Iraq war validated the effectiveness of combat-aircraft armed with precision-guided weapons, and may influence discussions about current plans for investing in specific aircraft andmunitions programs. The Iraq war may reinforce support generated by the war in Afghanistan forincreased investment in U.S. special operations forces. It may also highlight questions concerningreserve combat divisions and the potential consequences of extended callups of large numbers ofreserve forces.", "The war appears to have demonstrated the value of network-centric operations and timely battlefield intelligence, and the potential value of psychological operations. It appears to haveconfirmed the importance of preparing for urban combat. The war offered a limited real-world testof the Patriot missile defense system.

Even so, certain cautionary notesassociated with \"lessons-learned\" reports apply to this report. These include the following:", "Information is imperfect; early lessons are subject to change. Public information about the Iraq war is currently incomplete, and will likely remain so for some time. Although certain aspects of the war, such as the operations of U.S. Army and Marine Corps groundforces moving from Kuwait to Baghdad, received extensive press coverage, many details of theseoperations are not known. Other aspects of the war, such as coalition air operations, were reportedin less detail. And some aspects of the war, such as the activities of special operations forces, havereceived very little press coverage. Knowledge about the war at this point is thus fragmentary andunbalanced. Historically, moreover, early information that is publicly available about a war oftenproves to be inaccurate. Attempts to identify lessons should be tempered by an appreciation for gapsand imperfections in the available information. As information becomes more complete andaccurate with time, early lessons may need to be modified or dropped.", "Each war is unique; avoid \"overlearning\" the lessons of this war. Particularly for U.S. military forces, which fight conflicts in different parts of the world againstvarious adversaries, each war is characterized by a unique combination of variables such asgeographic setting, pre-conflict warning and preparation time, U.S. and enemy war aims, the size andcomposition of enemy military forces, the quality of enemy military training and leadership, theamount and kind of military assistance that the United States or the enemy receives during the warfrom other governments or groups, the enemy government's degree of popular support among itsown population, and the presence or absence of factional divisions within the enemy country'spopulation due to ethnic differences or other factors. Given how at least some of these factorsusually change for the United States from one war to the next, it has long been a staple of U.S.lessons-learned reports to note that lessons from one conflict may not necessarily apply to the next,might need to be applied with caution, or might contradict lessons of previous conflicts. Some ofthe lessons of the Iraq war, for example, may differ from lessons of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistanin 2001-2002 or the U.S. military operation in Kosovo in 1999. In short, the lessons of the Iraq warshould not be \"overlearned\" because the Iraq war in some ways might not serve as an accuratetemplate for future conflicts.", "Non-U.S. observers derive lessons as well, possibly devaluing U.S.-perceived lessons. The United States is not the only country that derives lessons from U.S. militaryoperations; observers in other countries do so as well. Non-U.S. observers keenly observe the U.S.way of war and draw conclusions about its strengths and weaknesses. These conclusions, if correct,can be applied by potential U.S. adversaries to improve their ability to contest U.S. forces in a futureconflict. Serbia, for example, observed the 1991 Persian Gulf war and drew lessons from it on howto counter the effects of U.S. air power. These lessons were applied with some success by Serbianforces in Kosovo in 1999. In short, lessons that U.S. observers reach about a given U.S. militaryoperation can be devalued by lessons that potential adversaries draw from that same operation. Thisis another reason to avoid \"overlearning\" the lessons of a given U.S. militaryoperation.", "Numerous persons or organizations may offer what they contend are the lessons of the Iraq war. In evaluating purported lessons offered by various sources, one factor to consider is whether thosesources have a potential financial, institutional, or ideological stake in the issue. Persons ororganizations identifying the lessons of a war can be influenced, perhaps strongly, by such a stake. Indeed, some persons or organizations may deliberately identify and publicize purported lessons withthe aim of influencing policy decisions on defense programs in a way that promotes their owninterests.

In the weeks leading up to the Iraq war, many observers anticipated that the conflict would serve as a test of theadministration's vision for defense transformation - its concept for overhauling the U.S. military toexploit new technologies and counter 21st-Century security threats. (4) Following the war, many ofthese observers concluded that the war validated this vision, or at least major parts of it, and alsostrengthened Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's authority to implement this vision over theobjections of persons or organizations opposed to parts of it. Some observers speculated that the warmay encourage the administration to increase the scope of its planned defense transformation orimplement it more quickly. (5)", "Potential Significance for Congress. These conclusions and speculations, if correct - and not all observers agree with them (6) - are potentially ofgreat significance to Congress, for at least two reasons:", "Implementing the Administration's vision for defense transformation could substantially affect the composition of U.S. defense spending, shifting defense funding towarddefense programs that are judged to be transformational and away from defense programs that arejudged to be non-transformational or \"legacy.\" Such shifts could significantly affect revenues andemployment levels at companies associated with the affected programs.", "The Administration may be encouraged to invoke the theme of transformation to help justify or seek rapid congressional consideration of legislative proposals affecting DoD thatmay or may not be transformational, depending on one's definition of transformation, includingproposals which could, if implemented, affect Congress' role in conducting oversight of U.S. defenseactivities. A potential case in point is the \"Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act,\" a205-page legislative proposal that the administration submitted to Congress on April 10, 2003 that would,among other things, permit DoD to establish its own policies for hiring, firing, and compensatingits civil service employees; change the terms in office for certain senior generals and admirals; giveDoD increased authority to transfer funds between DoD budget accounts; and eliminate many DoDreporting requirements that were instituted to assist Congress in conducting oversight of DoDactivities. (7)", "The Administration's Transformation Vision. The administration identified defense transformation as a major goal for DoD soon after taking officeand has since worked to define its transformation vision. In general, that vision calls for shiftingU.S. military planning away from a reliance on massed forces, sheer firepower, military servicesoperating in isolation from one another, and attrition-style warfare, (8) and toward a greater relianceon speed and agility, stealth, precision application of firepower by widely distributed forces,information technology, joint (i.e., integrated multi-service) operations, and effects-based warfare. (9) Some transformation advocates characterize these changes as shifting from an Industrial Ageapproach to war to an Information Age approach. Transforming the military along these lines, theadministration and its supporters argue, will permit the United States to apply military power morerapidly and flexibly in distant parts of the world, outpace enemy decisionmaking on the battlefield,more effectively counter so-called asymmetric military threats, (10) and generally achieve U.S. militarycombat goals with fewer forces, more quickly, and at lower cost. The Administration'stransformation vision also includes proposals for changing DoD's business practices, particularlywith an eye toward streamlining those practices so as to accelerate the fielding of new weapons andgenerate savings that can be used to invest in them.", "Transformational vs. Legacy Programs. Within the discussion on defense transformation, there has been significant debate over which programsqualify as transformational and which do not. Advocates of various defense programs have arguedthat their programs should be viewed as transformational, or at least not as legacy - a label that insome eyes has become synonymous with obsolescence and suitability for reduction or termination.", "Defense program areas that have frequently been identified as closely associated with the administration's transformation vision include the following:", "precision-guided air-delivered weapons,", "lighter and more mobile Army ground forces,", "special operations forces,", "unmanned vehicles,", "smaller and faster Navy surface ships,", "space systems and missile defense,", "forces for countering terrorists and weapons of mass destruction,and", "C4ISR systems that link U.S. and coalition military units into highly integratednetworks possessing superior battlespace awareness. (11)", "Defense program areas that have been identified by various observers, correctly or not, as non-transformational or legacy include the following:", "unguided weapons,", "heavy armored forces for the Army,", "manned tactical aircraft,", "large, slower-moving Navy surface ships, and", "weapons and associated C4ISR systems that operate in an isolated, stand-alonemanner rather than as part of a network.", "The Pre-War Debate. Prior to the Iraq war, the Administration had identified transformational programs as a high defense investment priority. Insubmitting its proposed FY2004 defense budget to Congress in February 2003, the Administrationstated that the request was the first to fully reflect its transformation vision and included more than$24 billion in acquisition funding for transformational programs.", "Some transformation advocates outside the administration argue that the administration, though rhetorically supportive of transformation, has continued to place too much emphasis on legacyprograms and not enough on transformational programs. They argue, for example, that theadministration's defense budget plans devote too much funding to manned tactical aircraft programsand not enough funding to programs for upgrading or replacing the Air Force's long-range bombers(which can deliver large numbers of precision-guided weapons) or for acquiring unmanned vehicles.", "In the weeks leading up to the Iraq war, some observers speculated that the conflict would test important elements of the Administration's transformation vision, including its increased relianceon precision-guided air-delivered weapons, special operations forces, unmanned vehicles, and jointoperations; the use of advanced C4ISR systems for networked operations and improved battlespaceawareness; reduced reliance on massed ground forces; and a war plan reflecting an effects-basedapproach more than traditional attrition-style warfare. Pre-war speculation that the conflict wouldtest the Administration's transformation theories was strengthened by reports that Secretary ofDefense Rumsfeld had played a strong role in shaping the war plan to make it more in keeping withthe Administration's transformation vision, particularly in terms of reducing the planned number ofconventional ground forces to be used in the invasion.", "Debate Following the Iraq War. Those who support the idea that the Iraq war validated the Administration's transformation vision, or at leastimportant elements of it, could argue one or more of the following:", "The U.S.-led war effort, which produced a quick victory with low casualties, featured a significant and successful use of precision-guided air-delivered weapons, specialoperations forces, unmanned vehicles, joint operations, and advanced C4ISR systems. It alsoemployed a strategy that avoided attrition-style warfare where possible and focused more on effects-based operationsdirected against the key leadership and command-and-control targets and the mostpolitically and militarily significant elements of the enemy's fielded militaryforces.", "The number of conventional ground forces making up the invasion force wasnot only fairly small compared to the 1991 Persian Gulf war, but even smaller than theadministration had planned, due to Turkey's decision not to permit the Army's 4th Infantry Divisionto use Turkish territory to invade Iraq from the north and the administration's decision to begin thewar before this division was redeployed to Kuwait.", "The speed and precision of the U.S.-led war effort significantly reduced Iraq'sability to mount a coordinated response, leading to scattered and largely ineffective Iraqi defensiveefforts and to many instances of Iraqi military units in the field that were hopelessly uninformedabout the location and movements of U.S. forces.", "Lighter and more air-mobile Army forces, which the Army is currentlydeveloping as part of the Administration's transformation plan, would have been useful, followingTurkey's decision, for quickly establishing a more significant U.S. ground presence in northernIraq.", "Those taking a more skeptical view on whether the war validated the Administration's transformation vision could argue one or more of the following:", "The U.S. military force employed in the war was largely a product of investment decisions made prior to the Bush administration. Although the force incorporated someelements of the administration's transformation plan, it represented only a partial or embryonicversion of the administration's vision for a transformed force. A more fully transformed force wouldhave featured, for example, more (and more capable) unmanned vehicles, a more completelynetworked C4ISR environment, and the use of lighter, more mobile Army forces that are now indevelopment. The war thus did not provide a pure test of a force fully transformed along the linesof the administration's vision.", "Iraq's military was significantly inept in mounting a defense of the country. (12) In light of Iraqi military ineptness, it is not clear that the war amounted to a serious test of theAdministration's transformation plan. A more traditional U.S.-led war effort, or an effort reflectinga transformation plan significantly different from the Administration's, might also havesucceeded.", "The number of conventional ground forces making up the invasion force wasgreater, according to some press reports, than some transformation advocates had proposed duringthe early stages of planning for the Iraq war. And the larger force that was used came close to beinginsufficient: If Iraqi forces had mounted a more effective effort to cut the extended and thinlydefended supply lines linking U.S. ground forces to supply areas further south, the invasion mighthave experienced a significant setback. In this sense, the relatively small ground invasion force mayhave introduced greater risk into the war plan than anticipated.", "Although heavy armored ground forces are not closely associated with theAdministration's transformation plan and have been characterized as legacy forces, the warunderscored the value of heavy armored ground forces. Heavy armored units were successful bothin breaking through Iraqi defenses in the south and in urban combat operations in Baghdad and othercities. They were largely invulnerable to Iraqi rocket-propelled grenades and other light arms and,in drawing fire from such weapons, proved valuable in uncovering the locations of hidden Iraqifighters, who could then be killed. More lightly armored ground forces like those being developedby the Army as part of the Administration's transformation plan would have been more vulnerableto fire from the kinds of weapons used by Iraqi defenders.", "Even if Iraqi military operations had been better planned and executed, the warcould not provide a major test of certain elements of the Administration's transformation plan. Forexample, although Iraq laid mines in the Persian Gulf and may have attempted to fire antiship cruisemissiles at coalition naval forces, Iraq's military capabilities and geographic options for counteringenemy naval forces were very limited. The war therefore could not pose a significant test of theAdministration's programs for transforming U.S. naval forces so as to make them effective againstsignificant enemy maritime anti-access/area-denial forces.", "A potential intermediate view would combine arguments from both sides of the debate. This view, while noting the success of the war effort and its significant use of force elements associatedwith the Administration's plan, would also acknowledge that the U.S. force used in the warrepresented only a partial fulfillment of the administration's transformation plan, that Iraqi militaryineptness was a significant factor, that the war may offer mixed evidence concerning theAdministration's plan for transforming Army forces, and that the war did not significantly test otherelements of the Administration's transformation plans.", "It should also be noted that observers who take a skeptical view on whether the war validated the Administration's transformation vision are not necessarily opposed to that vision. They maysupport the vision but conclude that the war did not happen to offer a clear validation of it.", "An additional potential implication concerns asymmetric military threats. By demonstrating to the world the formidable capabilities of conventional U.S. military forces, the Iraq war mayencourage other countries to place increased emphasis on developing asymmetric means ofcountering the United States, including terrorism, nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons,cyberwarfare against U.S. military and civilian computer systems, and anti-access/area-denialweapons (such as theater-range ballistic missiles) that are intended to prevent U.S. forces fromgaining a foothold in an overseas operating area. In this sense, the success of the U.S.-led war effort,it might be argued, may strengthen the need for U.S. defense transformation to focus on developingcapabilities for countering such asymmetric threats.

Prior to the Iraq war, those who were concerned about whether U.S. forces were sufficiently sized to carry out this strategy pointedto the high operational tempo that certain parts of the military have maintained in recent years, thelarge number of reserve forces that have been activated since the terrorist attacks of September 11,2001 (and the extended length of certain reserve-unit tours of duty since that time), the interestamong certain Army officers for increasing the Army's active-duty end strength so as to bettersupport ongoing commitments in various locations, gaps in forward deployments of Navy ships tocertain overseas regions, and the relationship of the total number of active air wings, divisions, andships to the potential requirements of fighting two regional wars in overlapping time frames.", "Some observers expressed concern that going to war in Iraq would stretch certain active-duty U.S. forces too thinly. They argued that a war with Iraq could reduce forces available for pursuingthe global war on terrorism or leave the United States with insufficient forces to deter or respond topotential aggression by North Korea. Forces that were cited as at risk of being in short supply in theevent of a war with Iraq included special operations forces, certain kinds of aircraft (cargo planes,tankers, jamming aircraft, surveillance aircraft, and battle-management aircraft), and specializedinfantry vehicles, combat-support troops, and support gear for the Army. (16) These concerns continuedas the Iraq war began. (17)", "Force Commitments During the War. Fighting the Iraq war while also performing other duties - including war-on-terrorism operations inAfghanistan and elsewhere, regional-deterrence operations, and homeland-defense operations -resulted in the following commitments of active-duty U.S. forces:", "Army: A large fraction of the Army's 10 active-duty divisions and additional independent combat units were deployed or stationed outside the United States.

Two of the Marine Corps' three Maritime Prepositioning Ship (MPS)squadrons were committed to the Iraq war. On April 2, 2003, General Michael Hagee, theCommandant of the Marine Corps reportedly stated: \"So, what we have done is we have provided,in my opinion, sufficient combat power to do what needs to be done in Iraq....

U.S. strategy is to have forces sufficient for winning two major regional conflictsthat occur in overlapping time frames, but not necessarily for winning two such conflicts that occursimultaneously. The distinction, though important, is often overlooked in popular descriptions ofU.S. strategy.", "The requirement for winning two conflicts that occur in overlapping time frames refers in part to an assumption that the second conflict will start some number of weeks after the first, and thatcertain U.S. forces that are needed primarily or most urgently in the early stages of a regional conflict- such as certain airlift and sealift forces, some kinds of aircraft, cruise-missile-armed Navy ships,and perhaps Marine amphibious forces - can therefore be rotated from the first conflict to thesecond. Such forces are sized closer to the requirements for fighting one conflict rather than two. If this assumption proves incorrect - if the second conflict begins before such forces can be rotatedfrom the first conflict to the second - the U.S. ability to prosecute the second conflict successfullyor at acceptable cost could be reduced.

The Iraq war, like the war in Afghanistan in 2001-2002, appears to have underscored how, in the post-ColdWar era, U.S. access to foreign bases and territory in time of war can be uncertain and, whenprovided, can come with restrictions from host nations on how the bases and territory can be used. This is potentially significant, because some military analysts have argued that U.S. defenseprograms must take uncertain access to foreign bases into account in planning U.S. military forces.", "War in Afghanistan. In the war in Afghanistan, few air bases in countries close to Afghanistan were made available to support U.S. militaryoperations, and bases in Pakistan that were made available had to be used in a low-profile manner,with a limited U.S. presence and a preference for conducting operations at night rather than duringthe day. As a result of these limitations, sea-based forces operating in the Northern Arabian Sea -carrier-based Navy and Marine Corps aircraft, Marine forces on Navy amphibious ships, and specialoperations forces deploying from a Navy carrier - played a significant role in U.S. militaryoperations in Afghanistan, particularly in the earlier stages of the conflict.", "Iraq War. In the case of the Iraq war, protracted negotiations with Turkey ended with a decision by the Turkish government to deny U.S. groundforces and aircraft the use of bases and territory in Turkey. Turkey's decision forced significantalterations to the U.S. war plan: The plan to have the Army's 4th Infantry Division invade northernIraq from Turkey, and thereby confront Iraqi leaders with significant ground invasions from both thenorth and south, had to be abandoned.

They can alsonote that, following the 1991 Persian Gulf war, many observers argued that Iraq had erred byallowing the U.S.-led coalition to build up forces in the Persian Gulf for six months withoutchallenge, and that U.S. adversaries in the future would not repeat this mistake. In the Iraq war, theycould argue, this expectation proved inaccurate, as Iraq once again allowed U.S. and British forcesseveral months to build up forces in the Persian Gulf.

The Army's main fighting forces for most of the war thus totaled less than3 full divisions.

Once the invasion was underway, U.S. and British ground forces achieved further tactical surprisethrough their high speed of advance, which involved bypassing some Iraqi towns and military units,and their use of unexpected routes. The flexible battle plan and rapid maneuvers used by U.S.ground forces kept Iraqi forces off-balance.

The Iraq war, they could argue, is consistentwith the planned path of U.S. defense transformation, which envisages the United States fightingfuture conflicts with less reliance on massive ground forces like those assembled for the 1991Persian Gulf war.", "Those who support the idea of maintaining at least 10 active-duty Army divisions could argue, following the war, that the original U.S. war plan called for using an additional division (the 4thInfantry Division) throughout the war, that Army supply lines were stretched to the breaking pointand thinly defended as a result of the rapid advance to Baghdad, that the number of U.S. groundforces needed for the invasion was reduced by the contribution of an additional division by acoalition partner (Britain), which is something the United States cannot count on happening in futureconflicts, that about 148,000 Army National Guard and Army Reserve members were activated tohelp fulfill Army commitments during the war, and that the commitment of Army forces for the Iraqwar exacerbated an ongoing situation of high worldwide operational tempo for both active andreserve Army units.

From their perspective, in the days followingthe end of major fighting in the war, Stryker vehicles would have been useful in Iraqi cities forhelping to reestablish civil order. The effectiveness of the M1 tank in combat operations in Baghdad,they could argue, resulted in part from Baghdad's broad avenues and sizeable public plazas and otheropen areas, which gave the M1s room to maneuver and long lines of sight. Future urban combatsituations, they are likely to maintain, may take place in cities and towns with narrower roads andshorter lines of sight, which could make M1s less effective and potentially more vulnerable to enemyattack.", "Opponents of the Army's plan to shift the mix of its forces could argue that the Iraq war, by demonstrating the continued value of heavy armor in modern combat, suggests that the United Statesshould think twice about reducing the number of Army armored units, particularly given therequirement for being able to fight two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames. They couldalso argue that Stryker vehicles would have been vulnerable to some of the weapons that Iraqi forcesused ineffectively against M1 tanks and M2 Bradley fighting vehicles, and that the war thusdemonstrated the inadvisability of shifting the Army toward more lightly armored combat units. Inparticular, they might argue that the Army should be cautious in its planning for the FCS to usesituational awareness as compensation for less armor protection. They may also argue that, althoughheavily armored units are more difficult to transport, the United States was able to deploy sufficientnumbers of them to start the war in a reasonable amount of time, and that given the potentialvulnerability to enemy fire of lightly armored vehicles, the need to improve the Army's rapid-response capabilityshould be met not by lightening Army forces, but by investing in improved airliftand sealift capabilities, such as wing-in-ground aircraft (44) and very high-speed sealift ships (seesections on air mobility and sealift)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combat Aircraft and Precision-Guided Munitions (45)", "paragraphs": ["Program Issues Going Into the War.

In bothconflicts, relatively small numbers of bombers dropped large numbers of precision-guided bombs and traditionalunguided bombs, destroying many enemy ground targets, (69) and wereable to loiter over the battlefield for extended periods of time, which made them readily availablefor attacking so-called time-sensitive targets - targets that emerge suddenly and remain susceptibleto attack for only short periods of time. For example, the B-1 bomber that carried out the April 7,2003 bombing attack on a building in Baghdad where Saddam Hussein and his close associates were thought to be located had been loitering above Iraq waiting for just such an emerging target, anddropped its bombs just 12 minutes after being given the coordinates.", "The performance of long-range bombers in the Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan may influence a long-simmering the debate on the balance of funding for bomber programs vs. tacticalaircraft.

(73) Supporters of current DoD plans argued that the force-structure and modernization needs of thebomber force are properly reflected in DoD planning and budgeting.", "Bomber supporters could argue that the Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan demonstrated that the value of bombers in combat operations has been significantly enhanced by the advent ofprecision-guided weapons. They could also argue that the two conflicts underscored the value ofbombers for reducing the need for in-theater bases and for maintaining aircraft with precision-guidedweapons over the battlefield for long periods of time. In light of the enhanced role of bombers, theycould argue, DoD should place greater emphasis on bomber programs in its plans and budgets.", "Supporters of DoD's current plans for modernization of the bomber force could argue the Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan show that the United States has enough, or more than enough, long-range bombersfor fighting regional conflicts, particularly given how precision-guided weapons havemultiplied the number of targets that each bomber can attack during a single sortie. They could alsoargue that the good reviews given to bomber operations in both of these wars shows that theseaircraft are receiving sufficient amounts of modernization funding and that there is no urgent needto develop and procure a next-generation bomber. Rather than devoting funding to maintaining alarger bomber force or developing a new bomber design now, they could argue, the successful useof bombers in Iraq and Afghanistan shows that funding should instead be used to maintain thereadiness of the currently planned bomber force and increase its effectiveness by funding additionalimprovements to precision-guided weapons and associated targeting systems.", "Tactical Fighter Aircraft in General. (74) Prior to the Iraqwar, proponents of DoD's three main tactical aircraft modernization programs - the F/A-22 Raptor,the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter - have argued that proceeding with allthree programs as currently planned represents the best way to guarantee continued U.S. airdominance in future conflicts. They have argued that the successful operations of current U.S.aircraft in recent military operations does not imply that they would achieve similar success in futureconflicts. Air-defense technology, they have argued, is developing and proliferating rapidly, makingtomorrow's adversaries potentially more capable than yesterday's. Stealthy, agile tactical aircraftwith advanced avionics, they have argued, will be required in the future for successful operationsagainst adversaries armed with highly-capable air-defense systems such as the Russian-built long-range SA-10 andSA-12 surface-to-air missile systems. The F/A-22, F/A-18E/F, and JSF, they havealso argued, will field flexible technologies that will permit these aircraft to take on new capabilities,if needed, for responding to changes in the international security environment. For example, theyhave argued, if cruise-missile defense becomes a much more prominent mission for tactical aircraft,these new aircraft will be well suited to incorporate this mission.", "Critics of DoD's tactical aircraft modernization program have argued that DoD simply cannot afford to proceed with all three tactical aircraft programs as now planned, at least not withoutrequiring significant cutbacks in other critical DoD programs. They have argued that the tremendoussuccess in recent U.S. military operations of current U.S. aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16 fighterdemonstrate that the margin of U.S. superiority in air operations is so significant that it is likely tolast for some number of years. (75) They have alsoargued that with the growing importance to U.S.air operations of precision-guided weapons, associated surveillance and targeting systems, andtechnologies for networked air operations, investing in new tactical aircraft designs is now lesscritical for insuring future success in U.S. air operations than investing in these other air-relatedtechnologies. In optimizing investments in future air power capability, they have argued, DoDshould move away from its traditional \"platform-centric\"focus on developing new aircraft designs,and toward a \"system-of-systems\" approach that more fully recognizes the importance of thesesupporting technologies in contributing to total U.S. air power capability.", "F/A-22 Program. (76) As the most capable, mostexpensive, and most air-to-air oriented aircraft in DoD's tactical aircraft modernization plan, theF/A-22 has often been at the center of the debate over the merits of DoD's tactical aircraftmodernization plan. Following the Iraq war, critics of the F/A-22 program could argue that thedegree of U.S. air dominance in the Iraq war and other recent conflicts demonstrates that the F/A-22program has become the \"Seawolf of the sky\" - i.e., a program, like the Navy's Seawolf submarineprogram, that was initiated in the 1980s with the goal of producing an expensive, high-capabilityplatform for addressing a projected Soviet military threat that never materialized. (77) Successful U.S.air operations in the Iraq war and previous conflicts, they could argue, demonstrate that today'stactical combat aircraft are more than sufficiently effective, and that upgrades to these aircraft cantherefore maintain DoD's air power dominance until less- expensive manned aircraft such as the JSFor unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) are fielded. As a result, they could argue, the F/A-22program can either be terminated or procurement of the aircraft can be reduced from the currentlyplanned total of about 276 to a smaller \"silver bullet\" force of no more than 100 aircraft.", "Supporters of procuring 276 or more F/A-22s could argue that the air-to-air capabilities of Iraq, like those of Afghanistan and enemy Serbian forces operating in Kosovo, were known to be virtuallynonexistent, and that none of these wars consequently do anything to invalidate the projected futurethreat for which the F/A-22 will be needed - an enemy equipped with modern, highly capablefighters and surface-to-air missile systems. In addition, F/A-22 supporters could argue, the F-22 wasrecently redesignated the F/A-22 to reflect the fact that it is no longer a pure air-superiority fighter,but a rather strike fighter that can also perform valuable air-to-ground strike missions like thoseconducted in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kosovo. (78)", "F/A-18E/F and F-35 (JSF) Programs. (79) Someobservers, including Admiral Vernon Clark, the Chief of Naval Operations, argue that the Iraq war,like the war in Afghanistan, has underscored the need for the Navy to replace its shorter-ranged F/A-18C/D strikefighters with longer-ranged F/A-18E/F strike fighters and F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. In both Afghanistan and Iraq, Clark and others have argued, Navy F/A-18C/Ds performing long-range, long-durationmissions (including missions in which aircraft orbit over target areas whilewaiting for targets of opportunity to emerge) required multiple in-flight refuelings per sortie. F/A-18E/Fs or F-35s,he and others argue, can perform such missions with fewer in-flight refuelings ornone at all, reducing the Navy's need for aerial refueling, which was in short supply in the Iraq war. During the Iraq war, the number of strike sorties flown from carriers was reduced in some instancesdue to insufficient in-flight refueling assets. Replacing F/A-18C/Ds with F/A-18E/Fs and F-35s,they now argue, will reduce the chances of such problems occurring in future operations.", "V-22 Tilt-Rotor Aircraft. (80) Current DoD plans callfor procuring a total of 458 V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, mostly for use by Marine Corps forces asreplacement for aged Marine Corps transport helicopters. Supporters of the V-22, which hasexperienced considerable controversy over the years due in part to fatal crashes during testing, arguethat the V-22 offers numerous operational advantages over helicopters, including a higher cruisingspeed for transporting Marine personnel and equipment from ship to operating area.", "Supporters of the V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft could argue that in both the Iraq war and the war in Afghanistan, Marine forces conducted ground combat operations 350 or more miles from shore, andperhaps 450 or more miles away from their Navy amphibious ships at sea. These are much longeroperating distances than Marine forces have traditionally experienced. V-22 supporters could arguethat the Marines' deep-inland operations in Iraq and Afghanistan could be repeated in futureconflicts, which would underscore the value of replacing the Marine Corp's aged helicopters withfaster-flying V-22s. V-22 supporters could also argue that difficulties experienced in the Iraq warwith maintaining the readiness of the aged heavy-lift helicopters underscores the need to proceedwith V-22 procurement.", "Other observers could argue that although the V-22 can be of value in replacing aged heavy-lift helicopters and in supporting deep-inland Marine Corps operations, the Iraq war, like the war inAfghanistan, does nothing to alter the need for the strict testing program for the V-22 DoDestablished in the wake of fatal V-22 crashes. They could argue that although there may be a need,even an urgent need, for the V-22, this V-22 program's past development difficulties resulted in partfrom efforts to rush its development. If the V-22 is to serve as an effective replacement for today'shelicopters, they could argue, the V-22 testing program must continue to proceed as planned.", "Helicopters. The Iraq war is the third consecutive major U.S. military operation, following the operation in Kosovo in 1999 and the war in Afghanistanin 2001-2002, where helicopter performance was mixed. In Kosovo, the Army was criticized for notbeing able to quickly deploy and use Task Force Hawk, a group of 24 AH-64 Apache attackhelicopters. Critics emphasized that the task force had grown into a 5,000-soldier force that required500 C-17 sorties to deploy, and that the Army had kept its helicopter operations separate from thedaily air tasking order (ATO) - the document issued each day by the air operations center thatcoordinated the operations of most U.S. aircraft. Keeping Army helicopters out of the ATO, criticsargued, made Army helicopter operations in Kosovo less integrated with the operations of other U.S.forces and thereby reduced helicopter effectiveness. (81)", "In Afghanistan, critics noted a similar lack of coordination between Army helicopter operations and the operations of other U.S. forces, especially during a combat operation in March 2002 calledOperation Anaconda. (82) In addition, the highelevation of the Afghanistan theater of operations madesome helicopter operations difficult, and U.S. special operations forces experienced a shortfall inMH-47 heavy-lift helicopters, leading some observers to argue more strenuously in favor of the V-22Osprey as one potential solution to both of these problems.", "In the Iraq war, helicopters encountered problems with survivability and maintainability. With regard to survivability, an attack on a Republican Guard division by 34 AH-64 helicopters from theArmy's 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment has been described as a near disaster: Every helicopter washit by ground fire, one helicopter was lost, and 27 of the 33 that returned to base were too damagedto fly again without repair. (83) Some observerssuggest that, reminiscent of problems with Armyhelicopter operations in Kosovo and Afghanistan, an Army failure to coordinate the Apache attackwith supporting Air Force and Navy aircraft operations may have played a significant role in the pooroutcome of this attack. (84) By using different tacticsand by more closely integrating their efforts withfixed-wing attack aircraft and Army artillery, AH-64s from the 101st Air Assault Division conducteda raid on the city of Karbala four days later with much less damage. (85)", "One traditional role for Army attack helicopters is conducting close air support - i.e., attacking enemy forces that are directly in contact with, or near contact with, friendly forces. Early in the Iraqwar, attack helicopter pilots complained that they were being sidelined - that U.S. war planners wererelying more on fixed-wing aircraft (many armed with precision-guided weapons) than on helicoptersfor performing close air support missions. (86) Thisperceived preference for fixed-wing aircraft, ifaccurate, may have been due in part to concerns regarding helicopter survivability following resultsof the attack by the 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment.", "With regard to helicopter maintainability, keeping helicopters flying in the harsh desert conditions of Iraq appears to have been a challenge. Early reports indicate that many differenthelicopters, but perhaps especially Marine Corps heavy-lift CH-53Es, were frequently grounded dueto sand-induced engine problems. While some maintenance difficulties may always be expected forforces operating in the field in time of war, some observers argue that little improvement inhelicopter maintainability has been made since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and that the desertconditions in which these helicopters must operate are well known. (87)", "In light of the mixed results with helicopter operations in Iraq and other recent operations, there is speculation that DoD may consider the option of placing less emphasis on helicopters in its plansand budgets. The helicopter program that might most be affected by this is the Army's RAH-66Comanche helicopter program. The Comanche is a stealthy, armed reconnaissance helicopter thatthe Army has been developing for about 20 years, during which time it has been a frequent topic ofdebate. In late 2002, DoD restructured the program, reducing the Army's planned procurement ofthe helicopter by about half, from about 1,200 to about 600, and including in the program a neweffort to develop companion UAVs for each helicopter. These companion UAVs could be used toimprove situational awareness for the crews flying the Comanches, or to attack targets on the groundthat might threaten Comanches. (88)", "Supporters of reducing the planned procurement of Comanche programs further, or of terminating the program entirely, could argue that the Iraq war demonstrated that attack helicopterscan be significantly vulnerable to ground fire in modern combat operations, and that missionspreviously performed by helicopters can now be performed by higher-flying fixed-wing aircraftarmed with precision-guided munitions.", "Supporters of the Comanche program could argue that the problems with helicopter survivability in the Iraq war reflected incorrect tactics (including lack of coordination with Air Forceand Navy fixed-wing aircraft) rather than inherent problems with helicopters, and that adjustingtactics produced better results. They could also argue that the Comanche helicopter, with its stealthfeatures and support from companion UAVs, will be much more survivable on the modern battlefieldthan today's attack helicopters. Helicopters, they could argue, will retain their effectiveness relativeto fixed-wing aircraft in responding with agility to enemy maneuvers on the battlefield - somethingthat Iraqi forces did little of in the Iraq war, but which enemy forces on future conflicts could dosignificantly. (89)", "Some observers argue that difficulties with helicopter maintenance in the Iraq war were due in part to the advanced age of the helicopters in question. The Marine Corps' heavy-lift helicopters(i.e., its CH-53s and CH-46s) are generally quite old, in part because acquisition of the V-22 Ospreytilt-rotor aircraft, which is to replace these helicopters, has been slowed. Following the Iraq war, onepotential issue concerns what contingency plans DoD has in place for modernizing or replacingexisting heavy-lift helicopters if the V-22 program is delayed further or cancelled.", "Combat-Support Aircraft. (90) The Iraq war highlightedthe effectiveness of specialized combat-support aircraft such as the U-2 surveillance plane and theE-8 Joint Surveillance, Targeting and Reconnaissance System (JSTARS) aircraft. The JSTARS'ground-surveillance radar proved particularly useful, in one instance detecting and tracking Iraqiarmored vehicles that were attempting to use a sandstorm to evade detection by U.S. forces. Specialized combat-support aircraft like the U-2, the E-8, and the Navy/Marine Corps EA-6B radar-jammingaircraft, however, are examples of so-called high-demand, low-density (HD/LD) assets -assets that are in great demand, but which exist in limited numbers. In the wake of the Iraq war,supporters of combat-support aircraft programs could argue that funding for modernization andprocurement of such aircraft should be increased.", "Unmanned Air Vehicles. (91) The value of UAVs washighlighted by the war in Afghanistan, and following that war, unmanned vehicles became a moreprominent element in DoD's defense transformation plans. Some observers expect that thesuccessful use of more than 10 kinds of UAVs in the Iraq war will reinforce support generated bythe war in Afghanistan for expanding and accelerating DoD's UAV programs. (92) UAV programs thatmight be affected include the Global Hawk and Predator long-range UAV programs, severalprograms for developing and procuring smaller and shorter-ranged UAVs for all the services, andthe joint Air Force-Navy program to develop a high-capability unmanned combat air vehicle(UCAV).", "Air-Delivered Precision-Guided Munitions. During the war in Afghanistan, some observers expressed concern for inventory levels of certain precision-guidedmunitions, particularly the relatively new GPS-guided Joint Direct Attack Munition(JDAM).

As a result, U.S. militaryplanners expressed less concern about the size of the inventory at the start of the Iraq war, and afterit was completed. (94) DoD plans to procure largenumbers of JDAMs and other precision-guidedweapons in coming years, and the success of these weapons in the Iraq war may reinforce supportfor funding these plans.", "The JDAM currently exists in 2,000-pound and 1,000-pound versions. A 500-pound version, now in development, was not available at the time of the Iraq war; some pilots reportedly believe itwould have been useful, particularly for attacking certain targets while limiting damage to nearbynon-targeted structures. The Iraq war may thus reinforce support for proceeding with developmentand procurement of the 500-pound version of the weapon.", "An even smaller GPS-guided weapon, the 250-pound Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), is now being developed. Large numbers of SDBs could be carried by strike aircraft, permitting aircraft toattack even more aim points in a single sortie than is now possible. Following the Iraq war,supporters of this weapon could argue that it might prove particularly useful for supporting groundforces in urban combat operations - a mission for fixed-wing aircraft that was elevated inprominence by the Iraq war, and one where concern for avoiding damage to civilians and civilianinfrastructure can be paramount.", "Prior to the start of the Iraq war, it was well known that the Iraqi regime had built an elaborate network of bunkers, command centers, living quarters and tunnels deep under Baghdad. Theeffectiveness of U.S. attempts to destroy such targets with \"bunker-busting\" weapons is not yetknown. Post-war analysis of these attacks, when complete, may influence views on whether toproceed with development of improved bunker-busting weapons.", "Tomahawk Cruise Missile.

The most capable version of the Tomahawk in the inventory is called the Block III. Most of the Tomahawks used in the Iraq war were likely Block IIIs. Procurement of new Block IIIsended in FY1999. Procurement of the next version of the Tomahawk, called the Block IV or theTactical Tomahawk (TacTom for short), began in FY2002. Thirty-two Block IVs were procured inFY2002, and another 167 were procured in FY2003.

Given the large number ofTomahawks used in the Iraq war, and the currently low remaining inventory of Tomahawks, someobservers have proposed increasing the planned number of Block IVs to be procured in FY2004 andsubsequent years, so as to replenish the Tomahawk inventory sooner. To support this plan, they haveproposed increasing the capacity of the Tomahawk production line from 38 missiles per month (456missiles per year) to 50 missiles per month (600 per year) or 75 missiles per month (900 missiles peryear).

If some of the subordinatebattalions of the divisions and brigades are considered useful during less extensive mobilizations,as their recent activations indicate, then should some or all of the smaller component units of thedivisions and brigades be maintained while the expensive and officer-heavy brigade and divisionheadquarters are eliminated?

Several scholarlystudies have looked at the link between the mobilization for the 1991 Persian Gulf war and reserveretention. (110) These studies found that themobilization had no significant impact on reserve retentionrates. This is consistent with studies of active-component personnel, which indicate that, providedthey are well managed and not excessive, deployments do not have a negative impact on retention- and can even enhance retention by providing participants with a sense of accomplishment.

Some observers are concerned that,although reserve recruiting and retention has held up in recent years, the post-9/11 mobilization ofreservists might begin have a negative impact on recruiting and retention, especially if it continuesfor an extended period of time.

NCW, which is a key element of U.S. plans for defense transformation, refers to using networkingtechnology - computers, data links, and networking software - to link U.S. military personnel,ground vehicles, aircraft, and ships into a series of highly integrated local- and wide-area networkscapable of sharing critical tactical information on a rapid and continuous basis.", "Implementing NCW is expected to significantly improve the capability of U.S. military forces by giving them vastly improved battlespace awareness (i.e., real-time knowledge of the location andidentify of friendly and enemy forces), an ability to more quickly pass information about enemytargets from surveillance systems to forces with the right weapons for attacking them (i.e., shorteningthe \"sensor-to-shooter\" cycle), an ability to quickly make and execute decisions on the battlefield,and an ability to use widely distributed forces to mass fires on enemy targets. NCW is also expectedto improve pre-conflict planning, including intelligence preparation of the battlefield. Under NCW,the network elements can become as important to combat capabilities, if not more important, thanthe platforms (e.g., tanks, aircraft, and ships) that they link. Some observers suggest that underNCW, the network itself becomes a weapon. (113)", "C4ISR Programs for NCW. The concept of network-centric warfare emerged in the late 1990s, and U.S. military forces are now in the earlystages of developing and acquiring systems for forming various local- and wide-area networks. Numerous C4ISR (114) programs are consideredimportant to achieving NCW. (115)", "NCW in the Iraq War. Many observers believe the effectiveness of U.S. forces in the Iraq war was likely due in significant part to the early stagesof NCW that were implemented in time for the war. A principal case in point concerns U.S. airoperations, which featured rapid transmission of information from sensors to shooters, particularlyfor attacking time-sensitive targets. NCW might have figured even more strongly in the Iraq war hadthe Army's 4th Infantry Division - the division with the highest degree of NCW implementation -played a more significant role in the war. (116)", "Potential Program Implications. The success of U.S. forces in the Iraq war may serve to reinforce interest in implementing NCW more fullythroughout the services. This is potentially significant, because investing in NCW might result inreduced investments in traditional military platforms: C4ISR programs for achieving NCW requirefunding that might otherwise go to traditional military platforms, and the improved forceeffectiveness generated by NCW may permit military tasks in the future to be performed by U.S.military forces consisting of fewer numbers of platforms. Should C4ISR programs for NCW beaccelerated or expanded? If so, which other DoD programs should be reduced to serve as the \"billpayers?\"", "Advocates of NCW could argue that DoD plans and budgets should be adjusted to place greater emphasis on C4ISR programs and less emphasis on procurement of traditional combat platforms,because funding invested in C4ISR programs will result in a greater increase in overall combatcapability, dollar per dollar, than funding invested in traditional military platforms. Supporters ofinvesting in combat platforms, while acknowledging the importance of NCW and C4ISR programs,could argue that creating a network requires platforms just as much as it requires systems to linkthem, that today's platforms are aging and growing increasingly expensive to operate, and that next-generationplatforms will be designed to take better advantage of networking technology than today'splatforms, ensuring that U.S. forces gain maximum benefit from the implementation of NCW. ", "A key current constraint on achieving NCW concerns communications bandwidth capacity (i.e., simultaneous data transmission capacity), especially for non-line-of-sight systems. Networkingsystems require large amounts of bandwidth, and U.S. operations during the Iraq war placed strainson current bandwidth capacity. (117) Althoughsteps can be taken to reduce the amount of bandwidthrequired by individual C4ISR systems, wider implementation of NCW will likely require DoD tosubstantially increase bandwidth capacity. One DoD effort to improve bandwidth capacity involvesinvesting in satellites that transmit data using lasers rather than radio waves.", "Another NCW issue concerns the potential vulnerability of NCW-related C4ISR systems to potential enemy cyberwarfare attacks. As implementation of NCW grows, the dependence of U.S.forces on NCW-related C4ISR systems could also grow. Observers concerned about this growingdependency could argue that although Iraq may not have been well prepared for conductingcyberwarfare attacks against U.S. C4ISR systems, other future potential adversaries might be. Theycould note that DoD computers are now being attacked on a regular and even daily basis bycomputer operators in foreign countries, in some cases in large-scale organized operations thatsuggest possible support by foreign governments. What steps is DoD taking to ensure that NCW-related C4ISRsystems will remain secure against cyberwarfare attack? What is DoD's plan forensuring the security of these systems while keeping them affordable and user-friendly?

Onthe one hand, modern weapons are very lethal, and frequently delivered over great distances.

This can increase the risk offratricide because the complex battlefield no longer is made up of clearly drawn battle linescomposed of fronts and flanks and rear echelons. On the other hand, today's military has far bettercommunication, navigation, targeting, and identification systems, which should reduce the mis-communications thatoften lead to friendly fire incidents.

Though mass surrenders did not occur on the scale they did in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, some larger-scaledesertions did occur. Some Iraqi units that did surrender followed the distributed leaflet instructionsfor procedure. Iraqi oilfield workers indicated that leaflets were also instrumental in their decisionsto not carry out sabotage orders. The role of these activities in the lack of Iraqi chemical-biological(CB) weapons use remains an open question, particularly since no CB weapons have been found todate.

Two noted that the part of the effort intended to encourage senior Iraqi military and civilian leaders to surrenderfailed to produce any significant defections, and attributed this failure to overly optimistic pre-warU.S. assessments concerning the potential for encouraging such defections through telephone ande-mail messages and cash inducements.

On the whole, the experience with the U.S. psychological operations effort in the Iraq war suggests that suchoperations can be a relatively cost-effective means of positively affecting combat operations, but thatthe success of such operations can be affected by numerous factors. From the standpoint ofplanning, one potential conclusion is that psychological operations can provide an advantage for U.S.forces, but that uncertainties about the extent of that advantage might make it somewhat risky forU.S. military planners in future conflicts to count on psychological operations as a reliable substitutefor a certain amount of conventional U.S. combat power."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chemical-Biological Warfare (159)", "paragraphs": ["Pre-War Concerns About Use of CB Weapons.

They predicted that the long flight distances from theUnited States and its forward bases in Europe to the Persian Gulf, the difficulty in gaining access toair bases in countries neighboring Iraq, and the ongoing U.S. military operations in Afghanistan andthe Horn of Africa would combine to create real challenges to U.S. air mobility.", "Air Mobility In The Iraq War. Air mobility operations, as expected, played a significant role in the Iraq war. (161) Although information on airmobility efforts in the Iraq war is still preliminary, early reports suggest that airlift operations werelargely satisfactory, and that the Air Force's new C-17 airlift aircraft performed well. Early reportsalso suggest, however, that aerial refueling operations were less than satisfactory in some respects. While many pilots involved in the Iraq war praised aerial refueling efforts in print and electronicinterviews, they also reportedly complained that refueling shortages were a significant impedimentto operations, especially at the war's beginning. (162)", "Aerial refueling (and airlift) operations in the Iraq theater of operations were complicated by limits on foreign basing and overflight rights, (163) the simultaneous conduct of air and ground combatoperations in the Iraq war (which increased the number and types of air combat missions that hadto be supported), and possibly the rapid northward advance of U.S. ground forces through Iraq(which prompted combat aircraft supporting those forces to fly further into Iraq).", "To improve aerial refueling coverage, Air Force tanker aircraft reportedly operated more aggressively than in past conflicts, flying closer to hostile territory than in previous conflicts suchas the 1991 Persian Gulf war. While this improved tanker support for some U.S. combat aircraft,it may have reduced it for others. Navy aircraft flying from carriers in the Persian Gulf reportedlycould not reach Air Force tanker aircraft operating deep inside Iraqi airspace. (164) In addition, it wasreported that sorties of Navy aircraft flying into Iraq from two carriers in the Eastern Mediterraneanwere reduced due to limits on aerial refueling capability. (165)", "Requirements For Air Mobility Aircraft. The experience with air mobility operations in the Iraq war will likely inform congressional debate ona number of general issues relating to requirements for air mobility aircraft, including the following:", "How much total airlift and aerial refueling capability does the United States need to support current and future U.S. military operations?", "What number of airlift and aerial refueling aircraft, with what mix ofcharacteristics (e.g., range, payload, offload speed, number and type of fuel dispensers), will bestmeet this requirement?", "How will requirements for airlift aircraft change as a result of planned changesin U.S. Army forces, particularly efforts to make Army forces lighter and moremobile?", "How will requirements for airlift and aerial refueling aircraft change as a resultof potential changes in the future mix of combat aircraft (long-range bombers, fighters, andunmanned air vehicles) to be supported?

In light of the Iraq war, the war in Afghanistan, and theglobal war on terrorism in general, how valid is this requirement today? Do the underlyingassumptions and analyses behind this figure still hold? Will increased attention on fighting terrorismabroad lead to more numerous deployments? What kinds of forces will need to be deployed tocombat terrorism and how might they differ from the force packages anticipated by defense plannerspre-September 11th? Will increased attention to homeland security lead to decreased overseasdeployments? ", "With regard to the changing mix of combat aircraft to be supported, fighter aircraft tend to be more airlift- and aerial refueling-intensive than either long-range bombers or unmanned air vehicles(UAVs). Some observers argue that airlift and aerial refueling requirements, which can be expensiveto meet, can be lowered by reducing planned DoD investments in fighters and increasing fundingfor long-range bombers and UAVs.", "Potential Program Implications. The Iraq war may have implications for specific air mobility program issues, including the following.", "C-17 Procurement. The Air Force in FY2003 completed a multi-year procurement of 120 C-17 airlift aircraft and began a follow-on multi-yearprocurement of 60 additional C-17s, bringing the total planned C-17 procurement to 180 aircraft. The general in charge of the U.S. Transportation Command said in 2002 that he wanted a total of222 C-17s to meet airlift demands. (168)", "In addition to citing these DoD studies, supporters of increasing C-17 procurement beyond 180 planes could argue, following the Iraq war, that the war validated the continued importance of airliftcapability for supporting U.S. military operations, that it showed the effectiveness of the C-17 as anairlift aircraft (particularly in transporting larger cargo loads over long distances to airfields withshorter runways), and that it demonstrated how limits on foreign basing and overflight rights can leadto increased demands for airlift. They could also argue that the planned transformation of the Armytoward lighter and more mobile forces could lead to an increased demand in the future for usingairlift aircraft (rather than ships) for rapidly transporting Army forces to distant conflicts, and fortransporting them directly to the combat theater, rather than to a forward staging area.", "Opponents of increasing C-17 procurement beyond 180 planes could argue that the general success of the airlift effort in the Iraq war shows that the United States in the future will notnecessarily need more than 180 C-17s. They could argue that the Iraq war and the war inAfghanistan suggest that the United States in the future will fight wars with fewer ground forces thanin the past, and that this, combined with the Army's planned shift toward lighter forces, could leadto a reduction in airlift requirements. They could also argue that airlift requirements in the futuremight be reduced as less airlift-intensive UAVs begin to replace manned fighters and DoD makesgreater use of high-speed sealift ships. Future airlift requirements, they could argue, can be partlymet by modernizing the C-5 fleet and by pursuing new types of airlift aircraft approaches, such ashigh-tech airships and wing-in-ground aircraft (see discussion below on future airlift technologies).", "C-5 modernization and engine replacement. Following the Iraq war, debate will continue on the number of C-5s to modernize and re-engine. Most observers agree that in the near term, some mix of C-17s and C-5s are required to meet DoD's54.5-million-ton-mile-per-day airlift requirement. But how many C-5s should be modernized andre-engined?", "Those who support modernizing and re-engining a majority of the C-5 fleet could argue that the Iraq war showed that the United States needs all the airlift volume that it can muster. The easiestway to maintain and build upon our current airlift volume, they could argue, is to keep in service asmany C-5s as possible. The C-5's maximum payload of 281,000 lbs is 76% greater than the C-17'smaximum payload of 160,000 lbs. Thus, it takes almost two new C-17s to replace the lost payloadvolume of every C-5 that is retired. The C-5, supporters could also argue, can carry many pieces ofmilitary equipment too bulky or too irregularly shaped for any other aircraft. They can point out thatalthough the C-17 is capable of carrying much outsize and oversize cargo, only the C-5 can carryitems such as the Mark V special operations boat or the 53-foot mobile medical hospital. (169) Inaddition, C-5 supporters could argue, modernizing and re-engining all the C-5's will substantiallyincrease the C-5 fleet's readiness rate, ensuring that the maximum amount of airlift payload volumeis available at any given time.", "Those who support modernizing and re-engining fewer C-5s argue that the Iraq war showed that overall airlift volume is important, but being able to move large payloads directly to short or austereairfields in the combat theater is more important. Airfields near Iraq were limited in the recent war,and the C-17 was the only long-distance airlift aircraft that could use the full range of airfieldsavailable in the Iraq theater of operations. Fewer C-5s, they could argue, should be modernized sothat funds are available to procure more C-17s, ensuring that the future U.S. airlift fleet will be betterable to move payloads directly from the United States to the theater of combat, and not just from theUnited States to a forward airbase located in, for example, Europe. They could also argue that theoutsize cargo that can be carried only by the C-5 is of secondary importance, and that the C-17 cancarry all important outsize military equipment. What cannot be carried by C-17s, they could argue,can be delivered by ship. While the C-5's readiness rate can be improved through modernization,they could argue, it will still be lower than the C-17's readiness rate. If readiness rates of airliftaircraft are a concern, they could argue, fielding fewer C-5s and more C-17s will result in a higheroverall readiness rate for the total airlift fleet.", "Lease of Boeing 767s For Use as Tankers. DoD and Congress in recent years have considered how to address the issue of the aging of the Air Force'sfleet of KC-135 tankers. Options considered have included extending the service lives of the KC-135s, procuringnew tanker aircraft, and leasing Boeing 767 airliners for use by the Air Force astankers.", "The last of these options - the leasing arrangement - was authorized by Congress as part of its action on the FY2003 defense budget. DoD has since considered how to implement thisarrangement. In general, supporters of the arrangement argue that it is a cost-effective way toquickly improve the Air Force's tanker capabilities, particularly at a time when the Air Force isstruggling to finance the acquisition of several other kinds of aircraft. Opponents argue that theleasing arrangement will violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the full funding provision that normallygoverns procurement of DoD weapons and equipment, (170) and that in the long-run it will prove moreexpensive, and less cost effective, than the option of procuring new aircraft.", "Following the Iraq war, supporters of the leasing arrangement could argue that the shortage of aerial refueling assets in the war demonstrates a need for quickly improving U.S. capabilities in thisarea, particularly if U.S. forces need to fight two regional conflicts in overlapping time frames (anofficial DoD requirement for sizing U.S. military forces). They could argue that extending theservice lives of the KC-135s would provide only a short-term fix, and that procuring new tankerswould provide little near-term relief to the situation and require procurement funding for severalyears at levels that the Air Force cannot afford.", "Supporters could also argue that the Iraq war exacerbated a situation of reduced civilian air travel that began with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 - a situation that has substantiallyreduced orders from commercial airline operators for new large commercial aircraft. This situation,they can argue, has significantly damaged the financial health of Boeing, the only U.S. maker oflarge commercial aircraft. The leasing arrangement, supporters could argue, will help shore up thefinancial health of Boeing, a major defense contractor involved in numerous defense programsimportant to DoD's future.", "Opponents of the leasing arrangement could argue that the Iraq war does nothing to resolve the most important question facing the proposal - whether the Boeing 767 the best platform to replacethe KC-135s. Several aircraft characteristics, they could argue, must be weighed in determining themost appropriate airframe for use as a tanker, including range, payload, fuel throughput, and typeof fuel dispenser. Typically, a formal study called an Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) is conductedto determine the best airframe. Such an analysis can be particularly important if the aircraft to beacquired is a joint asset. Lease opponents could argue that, the Iraq war notwithstanding, no AOAhas been conducted to determine that the 767 is the optimal platform. Considering the importanceof aerial refueling and the long time that air mobility aircraft tend to remain in the active inventory,lease opponents could argue that the Iraq war does not obviate the need to conduct a rigorous, jointAOA before deciding how to replace today's air refuelers.", "Opponents of the leasing arrangement could argue that providing indirect government financial assistance to a particular defense contractor like Boeing is questionable public policy, and that theneed for providing such assistance Boeing's case is not clear, because while September 11, 2001 andthe Iraq war may have reduced Boeing's civilian commercial aircraft business, they also may haveincreased Boeing's military business due to the resulting increase in U.S. defense spending. Opponents could also argue that even if providing financial assistance is appropriate and necessaryin this case, the leasing arrangement may not be the most cost-effective way to provide it.", "Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), established in 1951, is an arrangement under which commercial and charterairline operators agree to provide aircraft and crews to DoD in time of war to augment military airliftcapabilities. In return for making their aircraft available, these operators are allowed to bid duringpeacetime on DoD contracts for transporting military personnel and cargo - business that is worthbillions of dollars. For the Iraq War, DoD mobilized 47 CRAF aircraft. This is only the second timethat the CRAF was mobilized; the first was in 1990-1991 to support the 1991 Persian Gulf war. ", "While CRAF is a voluntary program and provides steady business to U.S. carriers during peacetime, some observers have expressed concern that financially troubled U.S. commercial airlinesmight no longer be able to afford continued participation in the CRAF program as currentlystructured. These observers have suggested that new deals might need to be struck between DoDand airlines to ensure the continued participation of airline operators in the CRAF program.", "Supporters of making such new deals could argue that the use of CRAF aircraft in the Iraq war demonstrates DoD's continuing need for the program, that larger numbers of CRAF aircraft mightbe needed in future times of emergency, particularly for fighting two regional conflicts inoverlapping time frames, that the participation of commercial airline operators is critical to theprogram's success, and that all necessary steps, including new deals between DoD and thecommercial airliners, should therefore be taken to ensure that the program remains healthy.", "Supporters of staying with the current CRAF arrangement could argue that although commercial airlines are financially troubled and the Iraq war demonstrated the usefulness of theCRAF program, the U.S. government has already taken steps to shore up airline finances, the airlinesthemselves are now restructuring their operations to further improve their financial health, and thateven if some U.S. commercial airlines continue to experience weak finances, the actual number ofCRAF aircraft used in the Iraq war - a military operation of significant size - suggests that sufficientnumbers of civilian aircraft to meet U.S. needs for such a conflict can be secured for the CRAF fromthe more financially healthy commercial operators.", "Future Airlift Technologies.
