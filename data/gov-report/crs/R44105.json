Managed care differs from the traditional FFS arrangement in how states pay providers for their services. Under FFS, states pay providers directly for the services they deliver to Medicaid enrollees, with the state assuming the financial risk for health care spending. Beginning in the early 1990s, states began turning more and more to managed care to deliver benefits to enrollees. In FY2011, 49.8% of Medicaid enrollees were enrolled in comprehensive risk-based managed care. Because of the high percentage of Medicaid enrollees receiving benefits through comprehensive risk-based managed care (delivered primarily through managed care organizations [MCOs]), the proposed rule is likely to impact millions of Medicaid enrollees. As of September 2014, 39 states had contracted with MCOs to deliver care to their Medicaid enrollees. Enrollment has increased over time as states have sought out managed care because it can make costs more predictable through capitation and may improve care for beneficiaries, for example, through better care coordination.", "Risk-based managed care can include a comprehensive set of benefits or a more limited set of benefits. Under comprehensive risk-based managed care, states contract with MCOs to deliver a comprehensive set of services. The state pays the MCO a fixed amount for each enrollee, called a capitation payment , and the MCO pays the providers. The MCO assumes the financial risk for spending. Federal regulations provide guidance to states on delivering care through MCOs, including requirements and standards for contracts and for setting capitation rates. ", "Under a more limited risk-based arrangement, states contract with limited-benefit health plans called Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans (PIHPs) and Prepaid Ambulatory Health Plans (PAHPs). These plans typically deliver a limited benefit package, sometimes limited to a single benefit such as dental coverage, in return for a capitated payment from the state Medicaid program.", "In the past, managed care generally has been used to provide coverage to healthier populations, but more and more states are using it for people who need LTSS. Managed LTSS (MLTSS) refers to the delivery of LTSS benefits through managed care. MLTSS can be provided through MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs that receive a capitated payment from the state Medicaid program. In response to the significant growth in the number of states with MLTSS programs over the past decade, CMS released guidance in May 2013 for states to use in setting up an MLTSS program. The proposed rule would codify that guidance. It addresses MLTSS with LTSS-specific changes and also includes MLTSS in changes more broadly applicable to all managed care programs.

In establishing guidance regarding alignment with other programs, CMS took into account the significant changes that have occurred since Medicaid managed care regulations were last published in 2002, including the passage of the ACA and significant enrollment growth in Medicare Advantage, the \"managed care component of the Medicare program.\" CMS considered the standards and market reforms established under the ACA in developing the proposed rule. The ACA established health insurance exchanges and qualified health plans (QHPs) to provide health care coverage to millions of Americans. QHPs are the only health plans that can be offered on the exchanges, and they are the only plans for which the premium tax credits and reduced cost sharing established under the ACA are available to enrollees. CMS sees greater alignment between Medicaid MCOs and QHPs as providing an easier transition for enrollees who may experience changes in income, causing them to move between the two sources of coverage. ", "Along with these new health plans, the ACA established new standards and market reforms for the private health insurance market, such as standards for coverage of preventive services and essential health benefits as well as minimum medical loss ratios (MLRs) for health insurance.

As a result, the proposed rule would revise the definition of marketing to exclude communications from a QHP to a Medicaid beneficiary, even if the issuer of the QHP also is providing Medicaid managed care. Further, the proposed rule would clarify that Medicaid marketing rules do not prohibit a carrier that offers both a QHP and an MCO from marketing these products and that unsolicited emails or text messages from MCOs, PIHPs, or PAHPs for marketing purposes are prohibited.

CMS notes that beneficiaries in a Medicare Advantage plan and enrollees in the private market have 60 days to request an appeal. Currently, states have the option to choose a time frame between 20 days and 90 days for an enrollee to file an appeal.

The minimum MLR refers to the amount of premium revenue that a health plan spends on the delivery of care or on improvements to the quality of care as opposed to administrative costs or profits. The ACA established minimum MLRs for the private health insurance market and Medicare Advantage. Under the proposed rule, states have flexibility in how they set their MLRs and incorporate them into their contracts with MCOs. For example, states can set MLRs higher than 85%. States also are not required to collect a remittance from the MCO if it falls below the minimum threshold, but CMS encourages states to include contract provisions that will \"drive MCO, PIHP and PAHP performance in accordance with the MLR standard.\" In addition, CMS encourages states to take into account whether the MCO, PIHP, or PAHP has met the minimum 85% threshold in the past, when setting future capitation rates. CMS chose 85% as the \"appropriate minimum threshold\" because it believes that consistency across Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and the private market will lead to administrative efficiency for state Medicaid programs and health insurance issuers, and a minimum threshold of 85% is the standard for Medicare Advantage and for large employers in the private market. This new standard would be incorporated into all state contracts with MCOs starting on or after January 1, 2017.
