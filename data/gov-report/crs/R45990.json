Social Security, or Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OAS DI), is intended to operate primarily as a pay-as-you-go system, where program revenues cover program costs. The OASDI program's revenues and costs are largely determined by economic and demographic factors. The Social Security program is experiencing rising costs and relatively stable income, a trend that is projected to continue for several decades. Although economic and program-specific factors affect the balance between program revenues and costs, research has shown demographic factors to be one of the leading contributors to the increasing imbalance between costs and revenues.", "The U.S. population has been experiencing a shift in age structure toward older ages and an increase in the median age, termed demographic aging . Two demographic effects have contributed to this aging over time: decreasing fertility and increasing longevity. While aging reflects a society's shared advances in medical, social, and economic matters, it strains the very social insurance systems that provide social support to the aging population. The post-World War II baby boom generation's effect on OASDI highlights this point. Baby boomers, the relatively large cohort resulting from higher fertility rates from 1946 through 1964, have started to exit the paid labor force and collect Social Security benefits. They are being replaced in the workforce by relatively smaller cohorts resulting from lower fertility rates in subsequent generations. Program costs are also rising as an increasing number of retirees collects benefits for longer time periods. According to the Board of Trustees of the OASDI Trust Funds, costs are expected to rise throughout the 75-year projection period, 2019-2093.", "The Social Security population's changing age distribution is creating a situation in which fewer workers in covered employment are supporting a growing number of people collecting benefits. This relationship is temporarily sustainable, as the OASDI program can draw upon the $2.89 trillion in asset reserves held in the trust funds to augment annual program revenues and fulfill all scheduled benefit payments. However, the OASDI program's ability to pay 100% of scheduled benefits becomes unsustainable when these asset reserves are depleted.", "The Board of Trustees, which oversees the OASDI Trust Funds, projects the funds' assets to be depleted in 2035 due in part to the cumulative strain placed upon the system by an older age distribution. After this, the OASDI program would operate as a strict pay-as-you-go system that can only pay out in benefits what it receives in revenue. Under current laws and projections, the trustees estimate sufficient revenues to be able to pay about 80% of scheduled benefits after asset reserves are depleted. The Social Security program's ability to cover 100% of scheduled benefits depends upon a combination of increased revenues and decreased benefits.", "One set of policy options to address the funding shortfall includes increasing the full retirement age (the age at which a beneficiary is entitled to full benefits) or the earliest eligibility age (the age at which a beneficiary is first entitled to benefits). This set of policy options uses a demographic solution for a largely demographic issue: the projected imbalance between program costs and income.", "Measures that include increasing the retirement ages are estimated to improve the program's long-range financial status but not to prevent trust funds depletion by themselves. Although these adjustments help to reduce rising costs, those costs would still be projected to exceed revenues. This suggests that efforts to avoid depleting the OASDI Trust Funds throughout the trustees' projection period would also be improved by including a revenue-increasing mechanism. In addition, increases in life expectancy are not shared equally within the population; disparities exist when life expectancies are analyzed by sex, race, and income levels. A policy measure that increases Social Security eligibility ages may disproportionally help some beneficiaries and disadvantage others."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security program, or Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), pays monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families and to the family members of deceased workers.

The year 2020 marks the first since 1982 in which the OASDI program's total cost is projected to be greater than its total income. Because of annual cash surpluses amassed in the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund in the period spanning 1983 through 2019, the OASDI program is able to meet its benefit obligations by drawing on these assets to supplement annual revenues. The Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds estimates that drawing down the trust funds can augment OASDI program revenues and allow it to pay full benefits until 2035. Should the trust funds be depleted in 2035, as the trustees project, the OASDI program would have tax revenues sufficient to pay about 80% of scheduled benefits.", "The OASDI program, and its financing, are affected by economic, program-specific, and demographic factors. Economic factors include issues such as productivity, price inflation, unemployment, and gross domestic product; program-specific factors include issues such as covered and taxable earnings, revenues from taxation of benefits, and average benefits indexed to growth in average national wages. Demographic factors include fertility, mortality, and immigration. This report focuses on two demographic factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically fertility and mortality\u00e2\u0080\u0094and how they interact to affect the program's ability to pay full scheduled benefits. The trustees' 2019 Annual Report states the following:", "Projected OASDI cost increases more rapidly than projected non-interest income through 2040 primarily because the retirement of the baby-boom generation will increase the number of beneficiaries much faster than the number of covered workers increases, as subsequent lower-birth-rate generations replace the baby-boom generation at working ages. From 2040 to 2051, the cost rate (the ratio of program cost to taxable payroll) generally declines because the aging baby-boom generation is gradually replaced at retirement ages by subsequent lower-birth-rate generations. Thereafter, increases in life expectancy cause OASDI cost to increase generally relative to non-interest income, but more slowly than between 2010 and 2040.", "A remaining demographic factor\u00e2\u0080\u0094immigration\u00e2\u0080\u0094is not examined in this report because the Board of Trustees analysis shows that combined changes in fertility and mortality are the leading causes of financial pressure on the OASDI program. ", "The Social Security population, both covered workers paying into the system and those collecting benefits, is experiencing shifts in age distribution. Decreased fertility rates for generations after the baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) are contributing to an overall older population. In addition, increases in average life expectancy are also contributing to the aging of the U.S. population. The combination of decreasing fertility and longer life expectancies results in higher costs, as presented in Figure 1 , which shows OASDI costs increasing as a percentage of taxable payroll. As costs remain above income, the trust funds' assets are used to fulfill scheduled monthly benefit payments. The Board of Trustees projects this process will continue into 2034, after which the trust funds' assets are exhausted and reserves no longer exist. ", "The OASDI program can pay scheduled benefits while operating with a cash flow deficit (i.e., costs exceed revenues) during periods of positive trust funds balances because assets held in the trust funds can be redeemed to augment continuing income. However, this process cannot last indefinitely. As shown in Figure 1 , a cash flow deficit is projected to persist throughout the 75-year projection period (2019-2093).

In other words, the percentage of the Social Security population at the older end of the age distribution is increasing. This point is underscored by considering three broad age subgroups: (1) those aged 65 and older ; (2) those aged 20 through 64 ; and (3) those under age 20 . Analyzing the population using these broad age groups highlights the concentration of those likely to be retired or close to retirement (i.e., aged 65 and older), those in ages commonly seen as prime working years (i.e., aged 20 through 64), and those generally considered not yet in the paid workforce (i.e., under age 20).

It also shows the trustees' projections for growth in the population, and its subgroups, for the ensuing 70-year period of 2015 through 2085. From 1945 through 2015, the Social Security population more than doubled. ", "Table 1 shows that, although the population grew by 120% over this period, growth in major age groups varied. On a percentage-change basis, the largest growth was observed in the 65 and over age group. From 1945 through 2015, this age group grew by 338%, indicating that the number of people in the United States aged 65 and older more than tripled. This demographic trend underscores the degree to which the United States is growing older; in 1945, those 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total population, whereas in 2015, those 65 and older accounted for about 15% of the total population. ", "This trend has implications for the Social Security program's ability to meet all of its projected scheduled benefits as the younger and slower-growing age groups of working age (i.e., those aged 20 to 64) are paying into the system while the older and faster-growing age groups (i.e., those aged 65 and older) are likely to be collecting benefits. The right-hand column in Table 1 shows that the trustees projected future years will continue to see growth in the 65 and older age group outpace that of the overall population. By 2085, the 65 and older age group is projected to make up about 22% of the total population. As this trend persists, which it is projected to do under the trustees' intermediate assumptions, it will cause OASDI program costs to rise more rapidly than revenues, thereby degrading the program's ability to pay full scheduled benefits. ", " Table 1 also shows how the working-age population is projected to be a smaller percentage of the overall population. This is an essential consequence of an aging population. That is, as the percentage of those aged 65 and older is increasing, the percentages in the other age group (i.e., working ages between 20 and 64) are decreasing. This point is reinforced by examining dependency ratios."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Dependency Ratios", "paragraphs": ["The changes in the Social Security population's composition can also be expressed as dependency ratios. Dependency ratios indicate a dependent population's burden on the working-age population. Table 1 shows that in 1945, about 59% of the total population was working age, between the ages of 20 and 64. The next-largest age group was the under 20 age group, which accounted for about 33% of the population. In 1945, the United States could be described as youth dependent because the working-age population was supporting the next-larger, under 20 population. The same could be said for the United States in 2015, when the 20 to 64 age group was about 59% of the total population and those in the under 20 age group accounted for 26% of the total population ( Table 1 ). That is, from 1945 to 2015, the United States became less youth dependent. Over this time period, the percentage of the total population aged 65 and older increased from 7% to 15%, indicating that the United States was becoming more aged dependent . The United States is projected to age from a youth-dependent population to an aged-dependent population, where the working-age population will be supporting the next-larger, 65 and older population. The transition to a more aged-dependent population is important for Social Security purposes because the program's ability to continue to pay beneficiaries relies on taxes paid by current workers. As discussed, the dependency ratios have changed over time and are projected to continue to change. Figure 2 presents a more detailed look at the dependency ratios and shows how they have changed in a historical context and how they are projected to change throughout the trustees' 75-year projection period.

From 1945 to 1965, the youth population increased relative to the working-age population, resulting in an increasing youth dependency ratio. As the baby boom generation attained working ages (the oldest of the baby boom generation turned 20 in 1966), the working-age population increased relative to the youth population and this ratio began to decrease. By 1985, when all of the baby boom generation had reached working age (the youngest of the baby boom generation turned 20 in 1984), this ratio had decreased to 51%, a level comparable to that observed prior to the baby boomers (i.e., in 1945 the youth dependency ratio was 56%)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aged Dependency", "paragraphs": [" Figure 2 also shows the aged dependency ratio.

For instance, in 1945 the aged dependency ratio was 12%, suggesting that for every 100 working-age people there were 12 people collecting benefits. The increase in this ratio highlights the aging of the population. As shown, this ratio increased from 12% in 1945 to 25% in 2015. That is, the number of people collecting benefits versus the number of people still working doubled over this period. Throughout the trustees' 75-year projection period, this ratio will continue to increase under the intermediate projections, due in large part to the baby boomers' continued retirement from the work force, relative to the numbers in the working-age population. The trustees project the aged dependency ratio to exceed 35% by 2025 and 40% by 2065.

The total dependency ratio remained relatively stable from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s as the baby boomers remained in working ages. The oldest baby boomers reached full retirement age in 2012, making it the first year that a baby boomer could retire with full benefits. Thus, as the baby boom generation began to exit the paid labor force in the 2010s, the ratio can be seen to rise slightly. The ratio is projected to increase as more of that generation enters retirement age. ", "Owing to the sustained decrease in total fertility rates since the 1970s, the aged dependency and total dependency ratios are projected to increase even after the last baby boomers have reached full retirement age in 2031. The demographic trends that created the baby boomers led to an imbalance between the number of people who have or will retire (i.e., present and potential beneficiaries) and the number of people in working ages (i.e., present and potential covered workers). Specifically, as the baby boom generation ages, those aged 65 and older will make up a larger portion of the total population. The transition from a youth-dependent population to an aged-dependent population means the number of beneficiaries will increase faster than the number of covered workers.

The total fertility rate (TFR) is the average number of children that would be born to a woman throughout her lifetime if she were to experience, at each age of her life, the birth rate observed in that year. In 1920, the TFR was 3.26 children per woman. By 1940, the TFR was comparatively lower, at a rate of 2.23 children per woman; this was the lowest TFR that had been observed to date. This decrease was reversed within the decade when a period of high fertility created the baby boom generation, those born between 1946 and 1964 ( Appendix A ). This period of high fertility is shown in Figure 3 and is marked on either side by periods of low fertility. In fact, fertility rates after 1964 (i.e., immediately following the baby boomers) decreased to the lowest levels recorded in the United States. Much of what makes the baby boom generation so impactful is that the cohort was both preceded and followed by low fertility rates. Figure 3 shows the historical fertility rates as measured by the National Center for Health Statistics (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and the trustees, as well as the trustees' projected fertility rates under their intermediate assumptions.", "The U.S. TFR reached a minimum of 1.77 children per woman in 1975.

This perhaps explains why a decrease in fertility coincided with the 2008-2009 financial crisis, before which the fertility rate was increasing. Additional research reinforces economic and financial uncertainty's effect on fertility and birth rates. Studies have shown that those who worried more frequently about future job prospects were more likely to have doubts about having children and expected to have them later in life. Research has also suggested that a mother's postponement of childbearing increases her children's socioeconomic opportunities. ", "Costs associated with raising children may have effects as well. From 1960 to 2015, the average cost of raising a single child from birth to age 17 for a middle-income, married couple increased 16% in real terms. Over this period, the portions of costs attributable to housing, food, transportation, and clothing have decreased. However, costs associated with healthcare doubled as a percentage of total cost and costs associated with child care and education increased from 2% of total costs to 16%. To the degree parents contribute to the costs of higher education, the increasing trend in child care costs may be understated. ", "The decision to have children later in life is reflected in historical data. Specifically, the decline in fertility among women has not been shared uniformly across age groups. In fact, since the mid-1970s fertility among women aged 30-34 and 34-39 has been increasing ( Figure B-1 ).

In 1900, the leading cause of death in the United States was infectious diseases, such as influenza or tuberculosis (see Appendix C ). From 1900 to 1940, the decline in infectious disease as a major cause of death was largely attributed to nutritional improvements and public health measures; the subsequent development of medical treatments further reduced infectious disease as a leading cause of death.

Social Security is designed as a social insurance program that protects workers and their families against a loss in earnings due to old age, disability, and death. Understanding the large financial burden that childbearing requires, some proposals argue for Social Security benefits to be extended to cover childcare in times of birth or adoption. While not specifically intended to increase fertility, these proposals recognize the hardships that accompany childbearing and aim to reduce financial pressures around that decision.

To compute the PIA, the formula first indexes a worker's lifetime covered earnings to reflect changes in national wage levels, as measured by the Social Security Administration's average wage index (AWI). The indexing process ensures a worker's or family member's benefit will reflect increases in average wage growth observed over the worker's earning history. After indexing, the highest 35 years of earnings are summed, and the total is divided by 420 (the number of months in 35 years) to determine a worker's average indexed monthly earnings (AIME). Brackets of a worker's AIME are replaced at different rates, the sum of which is the PIA. ", "Exiting the paid workforce to have children can impact a worker's future Social Security benefit. For instance, if a worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings, years of zero earnings are entered in the calculation. That is, if a worker forgoes covered earnings to have children, the worker's earnings record will reflect no income for that time. Recognizing the benefit formula's adverse effect for years of no earnings due to childcare, some proposals would reduce the number of computation years used in the benefit formula. Such a proposal would allow one parent per household to claim dropout years for years in which that parent had no earnings and provided care for a child under 6 years of age. For example, the benefit formula for a parent with no earnings for two years due to childcare would use the highest 33 years of earnings in the calculation. ", "Childcare credits are another option that would incorporate childcare into the Social Security benefit formula. Proponents of this method argue that childcare is essentially unpaid work and seek to ensure parents with young children are credited for their caregiving. Under such a proposal, wage credits would be set at one-half the average wage index for that year (e.g., one-half of the AWI for 2018 is $25,947). Parents earning less than the childcare credit level would have their earnings records increased to that level. Parents earning more than the childcare credit level would not receive any credit. ", "The effects of policy changes that may result in increased fertility are uncertain. As shown in Figure 3 , the projected fertility rate is expected to be stable around 2 children per woman. Under current law and the trustees' intermediate assumptions, each increase of 0.1 in the fertility rate decreases the projected funding shortfall by about 7.6%. This suggests a 65% increase in childbearing (i.e., to approximately 3.3 children per woman) would be needed, absent other changes, to avoid trust fund depletion.

For instance, a policy measure that increases the full retirement age (FRA) would be categorized as a provision that reduces benefits, as beneficiaries would then collect benefits for a shorter duration of time or accept a higher actuarial reduction in their monthly benefits by claiming at the age they originally intended. ", "Previous Congresses have addressed increasing the FRA. Facing a funding shortfall, Congress gradually raised the FRA, from age 65 to age 67, as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ). Increasing the earliest eligibility age (EEA), a benefit-reducing mechanism, was one of many measures included in this legislation that sought to address previous solvency issues. The Social Security Amendments of 1983 also enacted measures that increased revenues, including provisions that increased the payroll tax and made a portion of Social Security benefits themselves subject to taxation. ", " Table 2 shows the gradual increase in the FRA depending on year of birth.", "The Social Security program is once again facing projected long-range funding shortfalls. Similar to 1983, a common proposal is to increase the EEA or to further increase the FRA. On one hand, some argue that the average increases in life expectancies indicate that people work until older ages, and thus collect benefits at an older age. On the other hand, those opposed to raising the FRA argue that increases in average life expectancies are not shared equally among covered workers.", "The SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCACT) publishes estimates for policy provisions that affect claiming ages and are routinely included in legislative proposals. These policy options include provisions that would affect the FRA and provisions that would affect both the FRA and the EEA. Each provision's efficacy can be assessed by its effect on the projected solvency date and its reduction in the long-range actuarial balance , shown for each option in its respective table. For illustrative purposes, a provision that would gradually increase the full retirement age to 68 is estimated to improve the long-range actuarial balance by 16% (compared to current law) and extend solvency to 2035, one year later than under current law.", "OCACT projects none of the numerous policy provisions raising eligibility ages to result in trust funds solvency throughout the projection period or to completely eliminate the long-range funding shortfall. A 2015 CBO report found similar results in its analysis of four policy measures: (1) an increase in the FRA of one year; (2) an increase in the FRA of three years; (3) an increase in the FRA by one month per birth year; and (4) an increase in the FRA and EEA by one month per birth year. CBO's findings largely mirror OCACT's in showing that an increase in either one or both of the FRA and EEA reduces Social Security program costs. However, a policy measure adjusting only the age at which benefits could be claimed would not be sufficient to offset the funding shortfall. This outcome suggests that policy measures only addressing demographic changes via eligibility ages are limited in their ability to resolve the effects of rising OASDI program costs. ", "Research suggests that raising the FRA or EEA would negatively affect certain segments of the population. Although average life expectancy in the United States is increasing, the increases are not equally shared among the population. For instance, women have a longer life expectancy than men and whites have a longer life expectancy than blacks. Life expectancy is also stratified by income level. Numerous studies show that life expectancy is positively related to income and that the gap itself\u00e2\u0080\u0094the difference in life expectancies between high earners and low earners\u00e2\u0080\u0094is also increasing. Social Security benefits are based on the overall population's average life expectancies, suggesting that groups with longer average life expectancies (e.g., higher-income individuals) will collect more lifetime benefits than groups with shorter average life expectancies (e.g., lower-income individuals). Any provision to increase claiming ages may very well exacerbate this difference in lifetime benefits.", "A method of increasing the FRA could be to index the FRA for changes in life expectancies. One possible approach would be to index the FRA to maintain a constant ratio of expected retirement years (i.e., life expectancy at FRA) to potential work years (i.e., FRA less 20 years). Another policy option would be to simply adjust the FRA so as to hold the number of expected retirement years constant based on projected life expectancies. As discussed above, life expectancies across different segments of the population can differ by factors such as gender, race, and income. In pursuing options involving indexing the FRA, policymakers would need to address differences in projected life expectancies. ", "Policy options that would index the FRA can be categorized as cost-reduction measures, because they would decrease total benefits as a means to account for longer life expectancies. Although both options discussed above would reduce the projected funding shortfall, neither would eliminate it completely. Similar to options that may address fertility or a straightforward increase in the FRA, the projected effects of indexing the FRA for changes in life expectancies alone would not eliminate the projected funding shortfall.

One such option would be to increase the number of years used in the benefit formula. For instance, under current law, the benefit formula uses a worker's highest 35 years of earnings to compute the primary insurance amount (PIA). Including more years of earnings in the benefit formula (e.g., 40 years) would likely include years of low earnings from the start of a worker's earning history or years of no earnings. Under such a policy, a worker could choose to work for more years (i.e., to replace years of low earnings with years of high earnings) or take advantage of delayed retirement credits to attain a PIA that would have been earned had the benefit formula not changed. That is, to maintain the benefit scheduled under current law a person would need to work longer, delay claiming, or a combination of both.", "Under current law, workers can receive their full PIA once they reach FRA. However, a worker can elect to delay payment of benefits and, in doing so, collect delayed retirement credits. For those born in 1960 and later, a credit is worth 8% of a worker's PIA for each year of delayed claiming. For instance, a worker born in 1960 who reaches FRA at 67 is entitled to 100% of his or her PIA. That same worker could collect 124% of his or her PIA if claiming is delayed three years (at age 70). Any reduction in the benefit formula that would result in a decrease of benefits would then require some use of delayed claiming so as to collect the same PIA as under current law.", "A provision that would incentivize workers to delay claiming, perhaps through an increase in the number of computation years, could have a negative earnings impact on some workers. For instance, such a provision would favor those earning at high levels later in their careers (so as to replace years of low earnings with years of higher earnings). In addition to possibly favoring higher earners, such a provision could adversely affect certain types of labor. That is, such a policy proposal would essentially favor those who could still work. Workers with careers in more arduous work who were unable to continue working beyond the current FRA would receive a lower PIA under such a proposal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["On average, increases in life expectancy have allowed current Social Security beneficiaries to collect benefits for a longer period of time. However, the increase in life expectancies, when paired with low fertility rates, will negatively impact the program's long-range financial position and weaken its ability to pay all scheduled benefits as projected under current law.

As the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of beneficiaries relative to people in covered employment will grow. As this ratio rises, Social Security costs rise as well. The rising ratio of beneficiaries to covered workers can exist so long as trust funds assets remain to supplement the program's annual tax revenues. Rising costs are projected to deplete trust funds reserves in 2035. After such time, Social Security program revenues will no longer be sufficient to pay full benefits. Under current law, the Social Security program's sustainability, and its ability to pay full benefits, is largely a demographic issue. Policy measures aimed at addressing the changing demographics, specifically those increasing retirement ages to reflect increasing life expectancy, improve the program's solvency and long-range financial status. Such policy measures are estimated to reduce program costs. However, the reduction in benefits implied by such measures would not be evenly distributed across all segments of the population. In addition, increasing eligibility ages (i.e., reducing costs) alone is not projected to restore solvency throughout the projection period. Given the magnitude of the OASDI program's projected long-range funding shortfall, policy measures that include both a revenue-increasing and a benefit-reducing mechanism to restore solvency increase the likelihood that full benefits will be maintained.", "Appendix A.
