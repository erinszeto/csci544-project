To resolve differences between House and Senate versions of legislation, Congress might appoint a conference committee to negotiate a compromise that is then reported to each chamber for consideration. Alternatively, Congress might use the process of amendment exchange. In this process, each chamber acts on the legislation in turn, shuttling the measure back and forth, sometimes proposing alternatives in the form of amendments, until both chambers have agreed to the same text.", "The difference between a conference committee and an amendment exchange is not necessarily in the way a policy compromise is reached but in the formal parliamentary steps taken after the principal negotiators have agreed to a compromise. After each chamber has passed its version of the legislation\u2014or in some cases even before that stage\u2014Senators, Representatives, and staff from the relevant committees of jurisdiction engage in policy discussions in an effort to craft compromise legislation that can pass both chambers. These informal meetings and conversations are sometimes referred to colloquially as \"pre-conference,\" although they need not be followed by the convening of a formal conference committee. The phrase is applied generally to final-stage efforts to prepare legislation for passage in both the House and the Senate.", "The decision to use the amendment exchange route has procedural implications. Amendments between the houses are not subject to the same procedures as conference reports. For example, some of the limitations on the content of conference committee reports do not apply to amendment exchange. Furthermore, amendment exchange provides alternative opportunities to structure decisions, because the policy compromise can be voted on as separate amendments between the houses instead of as a single legislative package. In addition, in the Senate, House amendments are privileged, and therefore their consideration typically begins immediately after the majority leader asks the Presiding Officer to lay them before the Senate. In contrast, to begin consideration of a bill or resolution, the majority leader must either obtain unanimous consent or make a motion to proceed to the measure, which is debatable in most circumstances. Furthermore, in the House, consideration of Senate amendments is unlikely to include an opportunity for a Member of the minority party to offer a motion to recommit, an opportunity that is generally assured on initial consideration of a bill or joint resolution.", "In an amendment exchange, the formal actions the chambers generally take on amendments from the other chamber are (1) to concur, (2) to concur with an amendment, or (3) to disagree. There is a limit to the number of times each house can propose amendment(s) and send the measure back to the other house, but in both chambers the limitation can be waived. In the contemporary House, Senate amendments are typically disposed of through a special rule reported by the Committee on Rules, a motion to suspend the rules, or by unanimous consent. In the Senate, consideration of House amendments has the potential to become procedurally complex, particularly when the Senate must dispose of multiple House amendments. Because House amendments, unlike conference reports, are subject to amendment, the Senate majority leader might offer a motion to dispose of the House amendment and then \"fill the tree\" to temporarily prevent any Senator from proposing an alternative method of acting on the House amendment."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress relies on two formal means of resolving differences on House and Senate versions of legislation: conference committees and amendments between the houses. Conference committees can be created by the House and Senate after each chamber has disagreed to the position of the other. The House and Senate presiding officers then each appoint conferees, largely drawn from the committees with jurisdiction over the bill, to represent the chamber in conference committee negotiations. Conference committees develop and present compromise legislation, in the form of a conference report, for approval in each chamber. Historically, conference committees have been used to resolve differences on major bills, where policy issues are complex and differences between the chambers are likely to be greater. The process of exchanging amendments between the houses is more often used when differences between the chambers are comparatively small, although sometimes the chambers use it to resolve their differences on major legislation as well. In recent Congresses, the use of conference committees to resolve differences has decreased. ", "Regardless of the formal parliamentary mechanism chosen, in the contemporary Congress the chambers generally arrive at a resolution of the substantive differences between House and Senate versions of a measure through informal, bicameral discussions that might resemble conference committee negotiations even though neither house has officially appointed conferees to consult over a bill. Once the interested legislators have negotiated an acceptable compromise through these discussions, the compromise can then be embodied in an amendment between the houses or, if conferees have been formally appointed, in a conference report. The difference between amendments between the houses and a conference committee is not necessarily in the way a policy compromise is reached but in the formal parliamentary steps taken after the principal negotiators have agreed to a compromise. ", "The purpose of this report is to explain the procedural options for resolving differences through amendments between the houses, and to discuss the procedural effects of resolving differences through this process as an alternative to a conference committee. Throughout the report, the phrase \"amendment exchange\" is sometimes used as an alternative to the longer but formal name of \"amendments between the houses.\" The report is arranged to identify legislative options at each stage of the amendment exchange process, first for the Senate and then for the House. For each chamber, key procedural differences between amendments between the houses and conference committee are also discussed and then listed in Table 1 (Senate) and Table 2 (House). The answers to frequently asked questions are highlighted throughout the report in separate, shaded text boxes. The final section of the report describes a particularly complicated case of amendment exchange from the 110 th Congress to illustrate a variety of actions the chambers might take.

The same legislative vehicle means the same numbered bill or resolution; lawmaking measures that originate in the Senate carry the designation S. (bill) or S.J.Res. (joint resolution); measures that originate in the House are designated H.R. (bill) or H.J.Res. (joint resolution). Only one legislative vehicle, with either a Senate or House designation, is sent to the President. After one chamber passes a bill, it sends it to the other chamber. The receiving chamber then typically refers the measure to committee in the same way that measures introduced in that chamber are referred. ", "There is no requirement that one chamber act on a measure approved by the other chamber, and in each Congress many measures are approved only by the originating chamber. In order for a measure to become law, however, the House and Senate must pass the same vehicle with the same text. If one chamber passes a bill and the other chamber agrees to it without amendment, then the legislative process is complete, and the bill is sent to the President. This is extremely common; more than three-quarters of all legislation that became law in recent Congresses passed the second-acting chamber without amendment. Many of these measures that pass this way are salient to relatively few Members of Congress, such as bills naming post offices or other federal buildings. When major legislation is passed without amendment by the second-acting chamber, it usually reflects extensive negotiations between the chambers prior to the passage of the bill in either chamber. In other words, interested Members from the relevant committees and their staff consult beforehand to ensure that the bill that passes the first-acting chamber will be acceptable, without change, to the second-acting chamber.", "Most major legislation is not passed by the second-acting chamber without amendment, however. In addition, on major policy topics, it is common for both the House and Senate to initiate legislation, such that there is often both a Senate bill (S.___) and a House bill (H.R.___) introduced on a topic. The requirement that the House and Senate act on the same bill with the identical text means that in this situation the House and Senate must (1) select a single measure\u2014either the House or Senate bill\u2014on which they will both act; and (2) agree on the same legislative language. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Select a Measure", "paragraphs": ["The selection of the measure, or identifying which bill Congress will send to the President, does not restrict either chamber from acting on its preferred legislative language. More specifically, whether the chambers select an \"H.R./H.J. Res.\" or an \"S./S.J. Res.\" as the vehicle on which to resolve differences will not necessarily affect what policy proposals a chamber considers on the floor. Both the House and Senate can amend the legislation sent by the other chamber, and they can amend it in its entirety. ", "The selection of a measure that both chambers will act on is usually straightforward. The bill that passes a chamber first and is sent to the other chamber is normally the bill that is selected as the vehicle and is eventually presented to the President. The Constitution requires, however, that all revenue provisions originate in the House. The House interprets this to include all appropriations measures as well, and the Senate generally defers to the House on this issue because it does not affect the Senate's ability to propose changes to the legislation. For this reason, measures raising revenues or providing for appropriations that are sent to the President will carry a House bill number (H.R. or H.J. Res.). ", "As mentioned above, most of the time, neither chamber finds it advantageous to wait for the other to act before beginning its own work on a major policy initiative. Typically, the committees of jurisdiction from both chambers will consider legislation regardless of what action is taking place on similar topics in the other chamber. At some point, however, the chambers must select one bill to be the vehicle that is sent to the President. The selection of the vehicle is either done at the start of floor consideration or at the very end. It can only be done at the beginning if one of the chambers has already passed a bill on the subject, in which case the other chamber might choose to take up that bill on the floor instead of legislation crafted by its own committee. Usually, in this situation, a full-text substitute amendment, representing the work of the committee of jurisdiction, is presented at the outset of consideration and is effectively treated as the text for further amendment by the chamber. Alternatively, a chamber can take up a bill reported from its own committee. At the conclusion of floor consideration of its own bill, the chamber can take up the companion bill passed by the other chamber, strike all of the text after the enacting clause, and insert the text of the bill it originated. Either way, the chambers have fulfilled the first requirement: selecting the same bill on which to act. The second step, agreeing to the same legislative language, is generally more challenging."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agree on Same Legislative Language", "paragraphs": ["If one chamber considers a bill from the other chamber and amends it before passing it, the House and Senate have acted on the same measure, but they have not agreed to the same text. The chambers can resolve their differences over the text either (1) through an amendment exchange, when the chambers shuttle the bill and amendments back and forth between them proposing alternatives in hopes that both houses will eventually agree on the same language; or (2) through a conference committee, a panel of Members from each chamber that meets to resolve the differences between the bill and the amendment(s) proposed by the second-acting chamber. Occasionally, Congress uses both methods to resolve differences on a measure if it first attempts to resolve differences through amendment exchange and then resorts to conference. Although this report discusses some conference committee procedures for comparison purposes, its main subject is the formal parliamentary steps and options associated with an exchange of amendments between the chambers.", "In both chambers, the procedures applicable to consideration of amendments from the other body change when the chamber reaches what is known as \"the stage of disagreement.\" A chamber enters the stage of disagreement by formally agreeing to a motion or a unanimous consent request that it disagrees to the position of the other chamber, or that it insists on its own position.

The Senate will generally hold House amendments at the desk for action by the full Senate, rather than refer them to committee.

", "The ability to take up a matter without debate can potentially make a difference in the Senate, because the Senate then needs to end debate only on the main question (or questions). To bring debate on a question to a close, the Senate may need to invoke cloture, and the process for doing so can be time-consuming. Most cloture motions are not voted on until two days of session after being filed. If cloture is successfully invoked by a vote of three-fifths of the Senate duly chosen and sworn (60 Senators if there is no more than one vacancy), then consideration of the question can continue for up to an additional 30 hours. If there is opposition to calling up a bill, the Senate might need to go through this cloture process twice: once on the motion to proceed to the bill, and a second time on the bill itself. If the same legislative proposal is called up as a House amendment, then those in favor of moving forward on the matter can do so more quickly because cloture would need to be invoked, if at all, only on the question of disposing of the House amendment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Motions in the Senate to Dispose of House Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Once the House amendment(s) are before the Senate, several motions are in order.

It is used essentially to reverse the position a chamber took previously on an amendment, and to bring the chambers closer to agreement. The Senate could, for example: ", "recede from its disagreement to a House amendment and concur with the House amendment (and, in this way, reverse its previous stance against the House amendment and instead agree to it); recede from its disagreement to a House amendment and concur with the House amendment with an amendment (and, in this way, continue the amendment exchange by proposing a new alternative); or recede from its own amendment. After receding from its own amendment to a House amendment, the Senate has the option of concurring in the House amendment with a different amendment(s) in order to continue the amendment exchange.

Any amendment that proposes a full-text alternative for a bill is formally called an \"amendment in the nature of a substitute\" or a \"complete substitute.\" If the first amendment between the houses is a full-text substitute, further amendments between the chambers also tend to propose replacing the last-proposed text in its entirety, although this is not required. ", "If the Senate receives one amendment from the House, then the Senate can agree to one motion to dispose of it. In some instances, the House amendment to a Senate bill is the result of extended negotiations between the chambers. In this situation, the majority leader is likely to propose that the Senate agree to the House amendment without changes, and he will do this by making a motion to concur . He is proposing that the Senate agree to the House text because that text is the negotiated compromise. ", "If the House amendment is not the result of bicameral negotiations, and instead is best viewed as the House version of the legislation, then the majority leader might make a motion to disagree . In the contemporary Congress, when the Senate formally disagrees to a House complete substitute amendment it almost always immediately requests that a conference committee be created to negotiate the differences. If a conference is not desired, then the majority leader is more likely to propose simply that the House amendment be laid on the table . This motion is not debatable; once made, the Senate votes on it immediately. Unlike the other options, including arranging for a conference, it will not be necessary to secure the support of three-fifths of the Senate at any point to take this action. Tabling a House amendment has the effect of returning the papers to the House, just as agreeing to the motion to disagree would. In fact, when the Senate tables a House amendment, what is transmitted to the House is a message that the Senate has disagreed to the House amendment. The leader might choose to move to table the House amendment, instead of moving that the Senate disagree to the House amendment, because the motion to table would be voted on immediately, while the motion to disagree could require a cloture process.", "Finally, the majority leader might make a motion that the Senate concur in the House amendment with a further amendment . That further amendment might be the result of bicameral negotiations. In other words, sometimes when the Senate agrees to a substitute amendment to a House amendment, the Senate substitute amendment is the bicameral compromise. (The Senate could also agree to a motion to concur in the House amendment with several distinct Senate amendments to the text, instead of a full-text substitute amendment. The Senate has not chosen this option in recent Congresses.)

The reading is usually waived by unanimous consent and under certain circumstances may be waived by motion. ", "The option of agreeing to a motion to concur with an amendment is not always available in the Senate, because there is a limit to the number of times the chambers can propose amendments as they shuttle the bill back and forth. Under House and Senate precedents, the amendment of the chamber that acts second on the bill is the text that is subject to amendment in two degrees. Thus, if the Senate passes a bill, and the House amends it, there can be one further Senate amendment and then one further House amendment to that. Another way to think of this is that there can be a total of four versions: (1) the original bill, (2) the first amendment of the other chamber, (3) the amendment of the chamber that originated the bill, and (4) the second amendment of the other chamber.", "This limitation on the number of rounds of amendment exchange can be waived in the Senate by unanimous consent, and it does not apply if the House has already extended the number of rounds past the four allowed under chamber precedents. Thus, if the Senate receives a House amendment in the second degree (for example, a House amendment to a Senate amendment to a House amendment to a Senate-passed bill), then a motion to concur in the House amendment with an amendment would be in order only by unanimous consent. But if the Senate receives a House amendment that is already in the third degree (for example, House amendment to a Senate amendment to a House amendment to a Senate amendment to a House-passed bill) or greater, then unanimous consent is not necessary in the Senate to propose an amendment to the latest House amendment.

The amendment is considered to be an amendment in the second degree to the amendment proposed in the original motion to concur. This second-degree amendment is not a \"round\" in the amendment exchange; it is a Senate floor amendment proposed to a Senate amendment to a House amendment. The Senate might agree to several floor amendments to the Senate amendment to the House amendment. When floor consideration is complete, however, the Senate will vote on the motion to concur with an amendment as it may have been amended.

Instead, the Senate can agree to one motion to dispose of several House amendments\u2014as long as the Senate is agreeing to dispose of them all in the same way.

If he wished to propose that the Senate concur in one amendment and disagree to the other, however, then it would be necessary to make two separate, debatable motions.

The House, after all, concurred in the Senate bill with amendments. The Senate could, in this situation, consider a further amendment to the House amendment to Title 1 or to Title 3, but it could not entertain motions concerning Title 2. The prohibition against amending text both chambers have agreed to can complicate changing long titles of bills in the Senate; if the House and Senate both passed a bill and agreed to the same long title, it would take unanimous consent in the Senate to agree to a House amendment to the title."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "\"Filling the Tree\" on a Motion to Dispose of House Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Very often, particularly in situations when the procedures have the potential to become complicated, the Senate considers House amendments under the terms of a unanimous consent agreement.

A motion can be understood to have precedence over another if (1) it may be offered while the other is pending and (2) it is disposed of first. The available motions, in order of precedence, are to concur with an amendment, to concur, and to disagree.

It does not, therefore, bring the Senate any closer to final disposition of the House amendments. If, however, the majority leader can build a coalition of at least 60 Senators (assuming no more than one vacancy in the Senate) in order to invoke cloture, then he can fill the tree to block other Senators from proposing other ways of disposing of House amendments, including perhaps the opportunity to propose Senate amendments to the House amendments prior to Senate disposition of the House amendments.

Furthermore, if the majority leader offers all the available motions to dispose of a House amendment, files cloture, and then makes a motion to proceed to something else, another Senator could not, at that time, make a motion to refer because the Senate had moved on to another matter.

For example, implicit in the rules of both chambers is the requirement that conferees resolve the differences committed to them by reaching agreements within what is known as \"the scope of the differences\" between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Rulings and practices of the Senate allow matter in a conference report to be considered as within the scope of the differences as long as it is reasonably related to the matter sent to conference in either the House or Senate versions of the legislation. Senate Rule XXVIII restricting the content of a bicameral compromise does not apply to amendments between the houses. Furthermore, in the 110 th Congress, the Senate changed the manner of disposing of points of order raised under this long-standing rule, effectively providing an opportunity for Senators to vote on whether to waive the rule and permit the inclusion of provisions not sufficiently related to the matter committed to conference. The opportunity for a separate vote in relation to matter potentially outside of scope does not exist when considering a House amendment, because the scope requirement does not apply.", "Bicameral meetings and conversations among Senators, Representatives, and staff from the relevant committees of jurisdiction can be substantively similar regardless of whether the resulting compromise is embodied in an amendment between the houses or a conference report. Only in cases in which a conference committee is appointed, however, will there be any formal meeting of the conference. The House has interpreted its rules to require at least one public meeting. In practice, most bicameral negotiations take place informally, and the conference committee may hold no more than one formal public meeting where Senators and Representatives typically make statements and perhaps discuss any major items in disagreement. In contrast, discussions that can result in a compromise presented as an amendment between the houses are never required to be public; in fact, unlike conference committees, the negotiators are never formally identified.", "The documentation required at the conclusion of negotiations is another distinction between the two methods of resolving differences. Under Senate rules, every conference report must be accompanied by a joint explanatory statement, often called the managers' statement, which explains the position of each chamber and the recommendations of the conference committee on the issues in disagreement (Senate Rule XXVIII, paragraph 7). The requirement to produce this document does not apply in an amendment exchange, although sometimes committees prepare text similar to a managers' statement and submit it for printing in the Congressional Record . A majority of Senate conferees and a majority of House conferees must sign both the conference report and the joint explanatory statement. No such requirement applies to a compromise considered as an amendment between the houses.", "Senate rules further require that a conference report, but not a House amendment, be made available to Members and the general public on a congressional, Library of Congress, or Government Publishing Office website 48 hours before the vote on the report (Senate Rule XXVIII, paragraph 10). This availability requirement can be waived by three-fifths of Senators duly chosen and sworn (60 Senators if there is no more than one vacancy). It can also be waived by joint agreement of the majority and minority leader in the case of a significant disruption to Senate facilities or the availability of the Internet. Senate Rule XXVIII, paragraph 1, also requires that a conference report must be \"available on each Senator's desk\" before the Senate may consider it, a requirement that is usually met by the printing of the conference report in the Congressional Record and its distribution. If the report is not yet printed in the Congressional Record , then a copy of the report itself is placed on Senators' desks.", "Some requirements under the rules can apply to amendment exchange procedures but not to conference reports. Under a standing order of the Senate, conference reports are not required to be read if they are available in the Senate. The text of a House amendment is also not read under Senate precedents. If a Senator proposes the chamber concur in the House amendment with an amendment, however, then that further amendment is required to be read. The reading might be waived by unanimous consent. In addition, a new standing order of the Senate making in order a nondebatable motion to waive the reading of an amendment available in the Congressional Record that was submitted at least 72 hours before the motion was made presumably applies to amendments between the houses. The motion to waive the reading, created by a standing order approved in the 112 th Congress ( S.Res. 29 ), has not been offered with respect to a Senate amendment to a House bill or amendment.", "The final key procedural distinction is that amendment exchange is more likely to involve consideration of multiple questions. In the contemporary Congress, conference committee reports nearly always report in full agreement. The Senate therefore only takes a single action: approval or disapproval of the conference report. In contrast, if the House sends multiple amendments to the Senate, it will not necessarily be possible for the Senate to take a single action to resolve differences with the House. ", "It bears emphasizing that these procedural differences are not the only factors that influence the decision on how to resolve differences between the chambers. Other differences between the two methods abound, and strategic decisions about how to resolve matters with the House take into account timing, the nature of policy disagreements, and the roles of likely negotiators, among many other factors.

In the case study described in the last section of this report, the House agreed to three separate amendments to a Senate complete substitute amendment to H.R. 3221 : one amendment concerned matters within the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee; one amendment concerned matters within the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee; and the final amendment was a bipartisan proposal to preempt state housing foreclosure laws. In the case of H.R. 3221 , different committees had worked on different amendments to the Senate amendment. In the 114 th Congress, the House agreed to two separate amendments to a Senate amendment to H.R. 2029 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. One amendment was the text of the consolidated appropriations act. A second amendment, \"Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015,\" which was in the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee, extended and modified a number of tax credits.", "In another example from the 110 th Congress, the House agreed to two separate amendments to a Senate amendment to H.R. 2206 , an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The first amendment provided funding for various government agencies and programs. The second amendment included funding requested by the President for the Department of Defense, as well as State and Foreign Operations appropriations and funds for the Gulf Coast recovery. The second amendment was generally described as funding for the Iraq War, and it included provisions setting benchmarks for the Iraqi government that were different from the benchmarks that had been passed in an earlier version of the legislation that the President vetoed. The House agreed to the first amendment by a vote of 348-73, and to the second amendment by 280-142. Considering two amendments to the Senate-approved complete substitute allowed these issues to be voted on separately, allowing the leadership in the House to build separate majorities for the two amendments.", "In all three of the above identified cases, the special rule provided for a limited time for debate of the motion to concur with several amendments and precluded all other motions\u2014but provided that the votes be taken separately on each House amendment. More specifically, each special rule provided for one motion to concur with amendments, and then the question of adopting that motion was divided among each of the amendments. In one instance, the special rule provided that if the House agreed to both amendments, then they would be engrossed as a single amendment for transmission to the Senate. Engrossment is the process, undertaken by the House clerks, of preparing a final certified version of a matter that has been approved by the chamber. The effect of this provision of the rule was that the Senate received, for its consideration, not two House amendments, but one. This allowed the Senate to take a single action, instead of considering separate motions to dispose of separate House amendments. ", "In the 111 th Congress (2009-2010), pursuant to special rules, the House held separate votes on portions of a single amendment between the houses using a different procedure. The special rules provided that the question of agreeing to concur with an amendment (to a Senate bill or amendment) be divided. For example, the House could vote first on agreeing to concur with one portion of the text of a House amendment, and then could vote on agreeing to concur with a second portion of the text of a House amendment. Such rules allow separate votes on different issues but result in a single amendment being transmitted to the Senate. In the 111 th Congress, the special rules that provided for such division votes also provided that, if any division of the amendment was not agreed to, then the Senate amendment would not be disposed of. In other words, the bill would not be returned to the Senate unless the House agreed to all portions of the proposed House changes to the Senate text.

A motion to suspend the rules requires a two-thirds vote for adoption, so it is a procedural option generally used only when a large majority of the House favors the proposed action. Under this procedure, the House casts just one vote to suspend the rules and agree to one of the motions for disposing of the Senate amendment. For example, the House can consider one motion to suspend the rules and agree to a Senate amendment.", "Motions to suspend the rules are debated for no more than 40 minutes. No point of order can be made because the motion is proposing to suspend any rule that would interfere with its approval. Once the motion to suspend the rules is made, no further motion to dispose of the Senate amendment(s) is in order. A motion to commit or recommit is also not in order. The motion to suspend the rules is privileged under House rules only on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, although special rules occasionally provide for consideration of motions to suspend the rules on other days of the week. ", "Usually when the House uses the suspension process to dispose of Senate amendments, it suspends the rules and concurs in an amendment of the Senate. The House could agree to suspend the rules and concur in a Senate amendment with an amendment. If that motion were made, the House amendment would be read in full by the clerk after the suspension motion was agreed to. For that reason, if the suspension process were used for this purpose, the House might be more likely to agree to a motion to suspend the rules and agree to a resolution that states that, upon adoption of the resolution, the Senate amendment be agreed to with the amendment printed in the text of the resolution.

Alternatively, the floor manager might make one unanimous consent request to take the bill from the Speaker's table and concur in the Senate amendments. The request is not debatable, and a vote is not necessary. On occasion, the House enters into a unanimous consent agreement that sets a total time for debate of the motion to concur, and typically provides that the time be equally divided and controlled.

As discussed at length above, if the House acts on a Senate amendment, instead of acting on a bill or joint resolution that has not yet passed the House, then (1) the motion to recommit is less likely to be in order, and (2) there will not necessarily be a single vote in relation to the Senate amendment, because the House proposal might be considered as separate amendments to the Senate amendment. ", "Under the standing rules of the House, amendment exchange is different in many respects from conference committee procedures. In the contemporary Congress, however, conference committee reports are almost always considered under a special rule that waives all points of order that could be raised against the report or against its consideration. As a result, in practice, the consideration of a conference report and the consideration of amendments between the houses can be quite similar. For example, under the standing rules, bicameral compromises reported by a conference committee are required to remain within the scope of the differences between the House and Senate; amendments between the houses are not subject to these scope requirements. However, if agreed to by a majority of the House, the special rule for the consideration of a conference report would likely protect the conference report from a point of order. Furthermore, while conference reports (but not Senate amendments) are required to be available under House Rule XXII, clause 8, for three days prior to their consideration, in practice the special rule can waive this availability requirement. Special rules can also modify the manner in which amendments between the houses are considered. For example, under the standing rules conference reports cannot be amended, and Senate amendments can be amended; in practice, however, the special rule for the consideration of a Senate amendment would likely prevent amendments from being offered from the floor. ", "Nevertheless, procedural distinctions do remain between conference committee procedures and amendments between the houses. Perhaps most significantly, the process for arranging a formal conference committee in the House includes an opportunity for a Member of the minority party to offer a motion to instruct conferees. Such motions typically direct the House conferees to take a position on a particular issue in disagreement between the chambers. The motion to instruct is not binding on the conferees; in other words, even if the conferees report contrary to the instructions, the report will not be subject to a point of order. Despite this limitation, motions to instruct are sometimes viewed as an opportunity for a Member of the minority party to present a view on a policy issue of his or her choosing. If the chambers resolve their differences through amendment exchange, instead of conference committee, then there is no opportunity to offer a motion to instruct conferees. ", "Furthermore, under clause 12 of House Rule XXII, conference committee meetings are required to be open to the public, and the House has interpreted this rule to require that at least one public meeting of the conference committee be held after conferees are formally appointed. The same clause states that the chair of the House delegation \"should endeavor to ensure\" that all Members of the conference committee be given notice of all meetings and that all provisions in disagreement between the chambers will be open to discussion. The rule also guarantees managers access to a complete copy of the conference agreement at a unitary time and place for the collection of signatures. Although these requirements can be waived by special rule, generally conference committees do hold at least one public meeting and abide by these guidelines. No such requirements apply to negotiation meetings that result in a compromise embodied in an amendment between the houses.", "The appointment of a formal conference committee can facilitate a structured division of labor in negotiations. The Speaker can appoint conferees for a limited purpose\u2014for example, only for consideration of a single title of the bill in conference. These appointments are more likely when the matters in conference fall under the jurisdiction of multiple standing committees, and the Speaker appoints Representatives from the various committees to negotiate over matters within their respective jurisdictions. A conference committee might choose to form structured subconferences to consider the matters under its jurisdiction, although generally negotiations among conferees are less structured. In any case, the House requires that, for every portion of the conference report that a distinct group of conferees is appointed to consider, a majority of the Representatives in that group (and a majority of Senators in that group) sign the report. Under this requirement, the House counts the signatures of limited-purpose conferees only for those matters within their respectively assigned authorities. In this way, the specific appointments and signature requirement can give some guidance to negotiators about the portion of the compromise under their responsibility. Because bicameral negotiations in an amendment exchange situation are by definition informal, and no signatures are collected, similar opportunities to enforce structure on the negotiations do not exist.", "The documentation required at the conclusion of negotiations is another distinction between the two methods of resolving differences. Under House rules, every conference report must be accompanied by a joint explanatory statement, often called the managers' statement, which explains the position of each chamber and the recommendations of the conference committee on the issues in disagreement (House Rule XXII, clause 7). The requirement to produce this document does not apply in an amendment exchange, although on some occasions committees have prepared text similar to a managers' statement and submitted it for printing in the Congressional Record . The special rule for the consideration of the Senate amendment can include language stating that the chair of the committee shall insert into the Congressional Record \"such material as he may deem explanatory of the motion.\" ", "Even taking into account the usual use of special rules to set the terms for consideration of the compromise, floor consideration of a conference report might differ procedurally from floor consideration of a Senate amendment. Clause 9 of House Rule XXI requires the public disclosure of any \"congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff benefits\" included in a conference report. This rule, like other House rules, can be waived by a special rule; however, if a special rule waives House Rule XXI, clause 9, then a Representative can make a point of order against the special rule itself . The point of order is disposed of by a debatable question of consideration; this means that if any Member makes a point of order against a special rule on the grounds that it waives the earmark disclosure requirement, the presiding officer will submit to the House the question \"Will the House now consider the conference report?\" The question is then debated for up to 20 minutes, equally divided. In contrast, clause 9 of Rule XXI does not apply to amendments between the houses. ", "An additional difference in the consideration of a conference report, as opposed to amendments between the houses, is that there may be an opportunity for a Member of the minority party to offer a motion to recommit a conference report. When the House is the first chamber to consider a conference report, a motion to recommit the conference report with or without instructions is in order.

The majority leader offered the following:", "A motion to concur in the House amendment; A motion to concur in the House amendment with a first-degree amendment (No. 5103), which proposed adding a sentence: \"The provisions of this act shall become effective 2 days after enactment\"; and A second-degree amendment (No. 5104) to amendment No. 5103, which proposed to strike \"2\" and insert \"1.\"", "After \"filling the tree,\" the majority leader filed cloture on the motion to concur. The leader also asked unanimous consent that no motions to refer be in order when the House message was before the Senate. A Senator \"reserved the right to object\" in order to express his desire to offer a further amendment. The m ajority leader withdrew his unanimous consent request and instead made a motion to proceed to another matter. A motion to refer is not in order when a different question is before the Senate.", "Two days of session later, on July 25, the Senate voted to invoke cloture on the motion to concur by a vote of 80-13. The next day the Senate voted to concur in the House amendment, and under the terms of a unanimous consent agreement, the motion to concur with an amendment was withdrawn (and the second-degree amendment to that therefore fell). The Senate concurring in the House amendment was the final congressional action necessary to clear the measure to be sent to the President."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
