The President's FY2011 request proposed a reduction of nearly $17 million for ICS, to be achieved by changing the protocols at two of these fully operational ICS ports (Honduras and Southampton) and at the port of Busan from the ICS protocols (100% integrated scanning of cargo) to CSI protocols (integrated scanning only of high risk containers; see below). The Administration proposed to continue following the ICS program at Port Qasim in Pakistan and in Salalah, Oman.", "The President's FY2011 budget also proposed a $58 million reduction to the CSI program. CSI is a program under which CBP stations CBP officers in foreign ports to target high-risk containers for inspection before they are loaded on U.S.-bound ships. CSI was operational in 58 ports for FY2010, and screened over 80 percent of the volume of maritime containers destined for the U.S. According to the FY2011 Congressional Budget Justifications , the proposed $58 million reduction in CSI funding will be achieved by changing CSI's operational posture from one in which CBP Officers are on the ground in foreign ports, to a remote posture whereby the targeting and selection of high risk containers are done at the National Targeting Center-Cargo (NTC-C). For FY2011 CBP plans to phase out physical operations at 54 of the 58 existing CSI ports. ", "These reductions were the subject of congressional scrutiny.

DHS Appropriations in Context", "Federal-Wide Homeland Security Funding", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts. The Office of Management and Budget, as originally directed by the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act, has published an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism. Beginning with the June 24, 2002, edition of this report, homeland security was included as a part of the analysis. In subsequent years, this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, as distinctions (and account lines) between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. This means that while Table B -1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons, they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis, as outlined above.", "With regard to DHS funding, it is important to note that DHS funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts. In fact, while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within DHS, the DHS homeland security request for FY2011 accounts for approximately 51% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense comprises the next highest proportion at 26% of all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services at 6%, the Department of Justice at 6% and the Department of Energy at 3% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. These five agencies collectively account for nearly 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is also important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The legacy agencies that became a part of DHS also conduct activities that are not homeland security related. Therefore, while the FY2011 request included total homeland security budget authority of $37.1 billion for DHS, the requested total budget authority for DHS was $52.6 billion. Moreover, the amounts shown in Table B -1 will not be consistent with total amounts shown elsewhere in the report. This same inconsistency between homeland security budget authority and requested total budget authority is true of the other agencies listed in the table. "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
