In 2000, the United States launched the world's first national nanotechnology program. From FY2001 through FY2015, the federal government invested approximately $20.9 billion in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology through the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI). President Obama has requested $1.5 billion in NNI funding for FY2016. U.S. companies and state governments have invested billions more.

Since then, the United States has emerged as a global leader in nanotechnology. However, the competition for global leadership is intensifying as foreign investments in nanoscale science, engineering, and technology increase. Other nations have followed the U.S. lead and established their own national nanotechnology programs, each with varying degrees of investment, foci, and support for industrial applications and commercialization.

In addition, several federal agencies\u2014such as the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security\u2014see the potential for nanotechnology to help address mission requirements. Historically, the federal government has played a central role in funding these types of R&D activities.", "Though federal nanoscale science, engineering, and technology R&D had been underway for over a decade, the NNI was first initiated as a Presidential technology initiative in 2000. The original participating agencies were the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Commerce's (DOC) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health (NIH). In 2013, 27 agencies participate in the NNI, including 16 that have received appropriations to conduct and/or fund nanotechnology R&D. Since its first year of funding in FY2001, the NNI's annual appropriations grew four-fold to a peak of $1.9 billion in FY2010. Since then, however, federal nanotechnology funding has declined, falling to an estimated $1.5 billion in FY2015. President Obama has requested $1.5 billion in NNI funding for FY2016.", "In 2003, Congress provided a statutory foundation for some of the activities of the NNI through the 21 st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-153 ). The act established a National Nanotechnology Program (NNP) and provided authorizations for a subset of the NNI agencies, namely the NSF, DOE, NASA, NIST, and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The act, however, did not address the participation of several agencies that fund nanotechnology R&D under the NNI, including DOD, NIH, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Nevertheless, coordination of nanotechnology R&D activities across all NNI funding agencies continues under the National Science and Technology Council's (NSTC's) Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET) Subcommittee. According to the NSET Subcommittee's 2004 NNI Strategic Plan, \"For continuity and to capture this broader participation, the coordinated federal activities as a whole will continue to be referred to as the National Nanotechnology Initiative.\" Accordingly, the functions and activities established under the act are incorporated into the executive branch's implementation of the NNI.", "The thrust of the NNI has primarily been the development of fundamental scientific knowledge through basic research. Investments at mission agencies, such as DOD, have supported nanotechnology applications development for which they are a primary customer. Other investments have supported infrastructural technologies. For example, NIST has contributed to developing tools and standards that enable measurement and control of matter at the nanoscale, thereby supporting the conduct of R&D and the ability to manufacture nanoscale materials and products. As understanding of nanotechnology has matured, the NNI has worked with a variety of industry organizations to facilitate the movement of research results from the laboratory bench to the marketplace in fields as disparate as semiconductors, energy, concrete, and forest products.", "The NNI agencies also have sought to address research needs and regulatory issues related to environmental, health, and safety, as well as issues such as public understanding and workforce education and training.

Critics of the NNI hold a variety of competing views, asserting that government is not doing enough, is doing too much, or is moving too quickly.", "Some in industry have criticized the NNI for being overly focused on basic research and not being aggressive enough in moving NNI-funded R&D out of government and university laboratories and into industry. Others in industry have criticized the federal government for not providing mechanisms to help advance nanotechnology R&D to the point where it becomes economically viable for venture capitalists, corporations, and other investors to create products and bring them to market. Some refer to this gap as the \"valley of death.\" Still others in industry have criticized the NNI for not adequately supporting the development of metrology, standards, equipment, and processes necessary to manufacture nanotechnology materials, products, and systems at a commercial scale.", "Conversely, some supporters of industry-driven market investments contend that extensive government support for nanotechnology may supplant the judgment of the marketplace by picking \"winners and losers\" in technological development. For example, the size and directions of the NNI investments may encourage industry to follow the government's lead rather than independently selecting R&D directions itself or, alternatively, may result in the promotion of a less effective technology path over a more effective one. Others assert that federal government funding of scientific research is often wasteful, driven by political considerations and not scientific merit.", "Some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are critical of nanotechnology for its potential adverse impacts on human health and safety and on the environment. They assert that the government is pushing ahead too quickly in developing nanotechnology and encouraging its commercialization and use without adequately investing in research focused on understanding and mitigating negative EHS implications. They argue that the very characteristics that make nanotechnology promising also present significant potential risks to human health and safety and the environment. Some of these critics argue for application of the \"precautionary principle,\" which holds that regulatory action may be required to control potentially hazardous substances even before a causal link has been established by scientific evidence. At least one NGO has called for a moratorium on nanotechnology R&D and new commercial products incorporating synthetic nanoparticles. In 2014, the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health, and Food Safety voted to adopt a draft report that \"proposed a moratorium on the use of nanomaterials in food, based on the precautionary principle.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Nanotechnology Initiative", "paragraphs": ["The National Nanotechnology Initiative is an interagency program that coordinates federal nanoscale science, engineering, and technology R&D activities and related efforts among participating agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Vision and Goals", "paragraphs": ["The National Science and Technology Council has stated the following vision for the\u00a0NNI:", "The vision of the NNI is a future in which the ability to understand and control matter at the nanoscale leads to a revolution in technology and industry that benefits society.

Among the NRC recommendations: ", "The NSET Subcommittee should regularly assess working groups, re-defining or eliminating ones that are no longer useful and forming new working groups as needed. The NRC recommended the NSET Subcommittee consider establishing working groups on facility oversight and coordination and on education and workforce development. Each NSET Subcommittee working group should address specific goals, develop annual plans for outputs and shorter-term outcomes, and highlight ties to the NNI signature initiatives. The NSET Subcommittee should inform and obtain input from the NSTC Committee on Technology with respect to NNI objectives and plans at least once a year. The NNI website should be redesigned to provide portals and guidance customized to meet the needs of a variety of NNI stakeholder communities, including companies, user facilities, users, educators, and the media. Each signature initiative team should develop a strategic plan that includes specific goals with quantifiable technical targets where possible, milestones, expected outputs and short-term outcomes, and that identifies the roles and responsibilities of agencies, the NSET Subcommittee, and the NNCO. The NSET Subcommittee should incentivize groups in nanotechnology-enabled industries to participate in developing technical roadmaps and in partnering to address long-term research needs through agency efforts such as the NIST Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortium program (AmTech).", "In its 2013 draft report, the NRC (like PCAST in its Third Assessment , see below) also expressed concerns about the adequacy of authority of NSET Subcommittee representatives within their agencies and their ability to influence budget decision making. The NRC does acknowledge that \"there may be a tradeoff between authority in the agencies and the ability to devote time and effort to the many NNI coordinating activities.\"", "In its Fourth Assessment , PCAST lauded the NNI's \"significant progress\" in addressing several issues identified in the Third Assessment , but expressed concern about the lack of progress in others, notably \"significant and persistent hurdles to an optimal structure and management of the initiative.\" In particular, PCAST noted that despite the publication in 2011 of the National Nanotechnology Initiative Strategic Plan,", "individual agency contributions lack the cohesion of an overarching framework, and there is no clear connection between the goals and objectives of the NNI strategic plan with those of individual agencies.", "While recognizing that some agencies do not have dedicated nanotechnology programs, but rather decentralized nanotechnology activities across multiple organizational units, PCAST recommended the development of implementation plans by each agency\u2014in consultation with external stakeholders\u2014that discuss the alignment of agency activities with the objectives of the NNI strategic plan.

In 2011, NNCO funding was $2.9 million; if funding had been set at 0.3%, the NNCO would have received $5.5 million in FY2011.", "To expand and strengthen the role of the NNCO in the NNI, PCAST also recommended appointing the NNCO director as a co-chair of the NSET Subcommittee and allowing non-federal experts to serve as NNCO director.", "PCAST further recommended creating a standing PCAST Nanotechnology Steering Committee of experts from industry, academia, and civil society to provide more frequent and in-depth guidance. This recommendation raises the question of whether the role envisioned for the NNAP, as authorized by the 21 st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, is appropriately being served by PCAST or whether it might be better served by the establishment of a separate, dedicated entity. In its first assessment of the NNI, the NRC recommended that", "the federal government [should] establish an independent advisory panel with specific operational expertise in nanoscale science and engineering; management of research centers, facilities, and partnerships; and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate cutting-edge research on and effective and responsible development of nanotechnology.", "Coming after President Bush's designation of PCAST to serve as the legislatively mandated NNAP, this recommendation may suggest the need for a separate, NNI-only focused entity to serve as the NNAP. Critics of the use of PCAST to serve as the NNAP maintain that the scope and depth of expertise needed to provide effective guidance on the NNI requires an independent panel of people with nanotechnology-specific and interdisciplinary expertise and an undivided focus. Supporters of using PCAST for this function assert that a single advisory panel provides an integrated perspective, reduces unnecessary cost and management burdens, and allows for expertise to be added to the panel or accessed through non-member technical advisory groups.", "In its Third Assessment , PCAST praised the NNI for having \"distinguished itself during its first decade as a successful cooperative venture,\" and further described the initiative as well-organized and well-managed. Nevertheless, in both its Third Assessment and Fourth Assessment , PCAST offered a number of recommendations for improving NNI program management. In its Third Assessment , PCAST stated that \"the NNCO should broaden its impact and efficacy and improve its ability to coordinate and develop NNI programs and policies.\" In this regard, PCAST recommended that OSTP undertake the following actions:", "Require each agency in the NNI to have senior representatives with decision-making authority participate in coordination activities of the NNI. Strengthen the NNCO to enhance its ability to act as the coordinating entity for the NNI. Dedicate 0.3% of NNI funding to the NNCO to ensure the appropriate staffing and budget to effectively develop, monitor and assess NNI programs.", "In its 2013 budget supplement, the NSET Subcommittee characterized these program management recommendations as actions \"unlikely or not needed.\" With respect to requiring the participation of senior agency representatives with decision-making authority, the NSET Subcommittee replied that member agencies make their own decisions with regard to representation. The NSET Subcommittee also responded to PCAST's recommendation that the NNCO's coordination function be strengthened and better funded. First, the NSET Subcommittee reasserted that it is the NSET Subcommittee, not the NNCO, that serves as the coordinating entity for the NNI, and that the NNCO serves to provide administrative support to the NSET Subcommittee.
