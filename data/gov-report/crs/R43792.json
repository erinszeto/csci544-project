Under the provisions of the FLSA, an individual is generally covered by the higher of the state or federal minimum wage.", "As of 2019, minimum wage rates are above the federal rate of $7.25 per hour in 29 states and the District of Columbia, ranging from $0.25 to $6.75 above the federal rate. Another 14 states have minimum wage rates equal to the federal rate. The remaining 7 states have minimum wage rates below the federal rate or do not have a state minimum wage requirement. In the states with no minimum wage requirements or wages lower than the federal minimum wage, only individuals who are not covered by the FLSA are subject to those lower rates.", "In any given year, the exact number of states with a minimum wage rate above the federal rate may vary, depending on the interaction between the federal rate and the mechanisms in place to adjust the state minimum wage. Adjusting minimum wage rates is typically done in one of two ways: (1) legislatively scheduled rate increases that may include one or several increments; (2) a measure of inflation to index the value of the minimum wage to the general change in prices.", "Of the 29 states and the District of Columbia with minimum wage rates above the federal rate, 9 currently have no scheduled increases beyond 2019, 3 states have legislatively scheduled rate increases after 2019, and 17 states and the District of Columbia have scheduled increases through a combination of planned increases and current- or future-year indexation of state minimum wage rates to a measure of inflation.", "Because the federal and state minimum wage rates change at various times and in various increments, the share of the labor force for which the federal rate is the binding wage floor has changed over time. Since 1981, there have been three series of increases in the federal minimum wage rate\u20141990-1991, 1996-1997, and 2007-2009. During that same period, there have been numerous changes in state minimum wage policies.

In this section, states are counted by the primary method of adjustment.

However, Alaska state law requires that the state minimum wage must be at least $1.00 per hour higher than the federal rate. So it is possible that a federal wage increase could trigger an increase in the Alaska minimum wage, but the main mechanism is indexation to inflation. Although Connecticut does not currently include scheduled rate increases in the minimum wage, Connecticut state law requires that the state rate must exceed the federal minimum wage rate by 0.5% if the federal rate becomes greater than or equal to the state rate. The District of Columbia's minimum wage rate is the higher of the level required by the District of Columbia statute or the federal rate plus $1.00. Starting in 2021, the District of Columbia minimum wage will be indexed to inflation and the reference to the federal rate will no longer be in effect.

Specifically, Figure 3 plots the percentage of the civilian labor force residing in states in which the federal wage serves as the floor. If no state had a minimum wage above the federal rate, then the federal minimum wage would be the floor for states in which 100% of the labor force resides. Similarly, if every state had a minimum wage above the current rate of $7.25, then the federal rate would not be binding for the labor force. Instead the interaction of federal and state rates has led to the federal minimum wage playing a fluctuating, but generally decreasing, role in establishing a wage floor for the civilian labor force, particularly during periods in which the federal rate is not increased.", "Examining the specific time periods around changes in the federal minimum wage (see Figure 1 for the history of federal minimum wage rate changes), data in Figure 3 show a general trend toward a lower share of the labor force being covered by the federal minimum wage only. Federal rate increases in 2007 through 2009 mitigated this reduction, as did earlier changes in the federal rate.", "In the period from 1983 through 1989, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $3.35 per hour. Prior to the federal increases in 1990 and 1991, the number of states with higher minimum wages rose from 3 in 1984 to 16 in 1989 and the share of the U.S. civilian labor force in states for which the federal rate was the floor fell from 98% to 70%. Following a two-step federal increase in 1990 and 1991 from $3.35 to $4.25 per hour, the number of states with higher minimum wages fell to 8 in 1992, which meant that the federal rate was the floor for states comprising 92% of the civilian labor force. The next federal minimum wage increase occurred in two steps in 1996 and 1997, increasing from $4.25 to $5.15 per hour. Prior to that increase, in 1995, there were 10 states, representing 10% of the civilian labor force, with minimum wages above the federal rate. After the second increase in 1997, the number of states with higher minimum wages dropped to 8, but the share of the labor force in states for which the federal rate served as a floor decreased to 82%. The federal minimum wage did not increase after 1997 until 2007. During much of that period the number of states with higher minimum wages stayed somewhat steady, increasing from 8 (comprising 18% of the civilian labor force) in 1998 to 12 (comprising 21% of the civilian labor force) in 2003. However, by 2006, 22 states representing 50% of the civilian labor force had minimum wage rates above the federal rate. This increase was due in part to a few populous states, such as Florida, Michigan, and New York, adopting minimum wage rates above the federal rate in this period. Following the three-step increase in the federal minimum wage from $5.15 to the current $7.25 (2007-2009), 15 states, comprising 33% of the civilian labor force, had rates above the federal minimum wage in 2010.

As discussed previously, for those states with current or scheduled minimum wages above the federal rate, three main mechanisms are in place to adjust future rates: (1) scheduled increases, (2) indexation to inflation, or (3) reference to the federal rate plus an add-on (i.e., a state minimum wage is a percentage or dollar amount above the federal rate). For the 21 states with minimum wage rates equal to or below the federal rate, however, there are no mechanisms in place to move rates above the federal rate. Thus, the main difference within this group of states is the relationship of the state rate, if any, to the federal rate.", "For those 21 states with minimum wages equal to or below the federal rate, the state rate may be set in four ways:", "No state minimum wage provisions: In five states\u2014Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee\u2014there are no provisions for state minimum wage rates. In practice, this means that most workers in these states are covered by the FLSA minimum wage provisions since coverage is generally broad. State minimum wage provisions with no reference to the FLSA: Five states have state minimum wage rates but do not reference the FLSA. Two of these states\u2014Georgia and Wyoming\u2014have state rates below $7.25, while three of these states\u2014Kansas, North Dakota, and Wisconsin\u2014have rates equal to $7.25. However, because there is no reference to the FLSA rate or other provision for adjustment in any of these states, the state rate does not change unless the state policy is changed. State minimum wage equals the FLSA rate: Six states\u2014Idaho, Indiana, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, and Virginia\u2014set the state rate equal to the FLSA rate. Thus, when the FLSA rate changes, the state rates in these six states change to equal the FLSA rate. State minimum wage equals FLSA rate if FLSA is greater: In four states\u2014Iowa, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania\u2014the state rate is specified separately but includes a provision to equal the FLSA rate if the latter is above the state specified rate.
