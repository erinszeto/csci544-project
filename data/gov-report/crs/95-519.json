Much of this legislation takes the form of extensive findings detailing the background, situation, and exploits concerned.

In these instances, since there is no original record to \"correct,\" the BCMR is not necessarily involved in the consideration process. Without an original recommendation, factual data supporting the award, and compelling reasons for it to be awarded at a later date, it is very unlikely that the MoH will be awarded.

This presentation followed a review of the award by the Army into citation records to determine whether or not African Americans were treated fairly.", "Perhaps one of the more contentious Medal of Honor awards involved the case of the Civil War civilian contract surgeon Mary Edwards Walker. She was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Andrew Johnson on November 11, 1865, for \"services rendered during the war.\" She was a flamboyant and controversial character, and it has been argued that the award was made to placate her for being terminated by the Army. As with certain other medal recipients of her day, no specific act of heroism was cited for receiving it. Under the review panel's considerations, Dr. Walker's award was stricken because she was not a member of the Armed Forces and because her services did not involve \"actual conflict with an enemy, by gallantry or intrepidity, at the risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty.\"", "At the behest of distant relatives, some Members of Congress and then-President Carter contacted DOD on the matter. The Army Board for Corrections of Military Records ruled (with one dissent) that the decision to rescind the award was \"unjust.\" Although the board noted that if it had not been for her sex, she would have been given a commission and her actions would have been those of a soldier, no specific act of gallantry or heroism was noted. In 1977, her medal was restored. The restoration remains highly contentious.", "On September 12, 1980, then-President Carter awarded Anthony Casamento, a Marine Corps veteran of combat against the Japanese on Guadalcanal during World War II, the Medal of Honor. Lacking sufficient witnesses to attest to certain deeds, military officials argued that Casamento should be awarded only the Navy Cross. The President overruled the Pentagon (including the Secretary of Defense) and awarded the MoH. Critics contend that President Carter's action was timed for political effect, as the President awarded the medal just prior to an election-year appearance before the National Italian-American Foundation.", "Following the example of the reinstatement of the award to Dr. Walker, relatives of William F. \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody sought reinstatement of his medal, in part on the grounds that since Dr. Walker's was reinstated, there existed a precedent for awarding the medal to civilians who served with the military. Cody was originally awarded the Medal of Honor on May 22, 1872, for his gallantry while serving as an Army scout on April 26, 1872, at the Platte River, Nebraska. At the request of a U.S. Senator serving as the counsel for a relative, the Board for Correction of Military Records recommended reinstatement of \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody's medal, citing in part the award of Dr. Walker. In June 1989, the U.S. Army Board of Correction of Military Records restored the award, and on July 8, 1989, two Senators announced the restoration of Cody's medal. Four others also had their medals reinstated by the board in June 1989: Amos Chapman [scout], William Dixon [scout], James B. Doshier [post guide], and William H. Woodall [scout].", "Throughout the years, many efforts to award or reinstate the Medal of Honor have proven time-consuming and difficult. For example, advocates for Navy Seaman Doris (a.k.a. Dorie or Dorrie) Miller have sought for years to have his award upgraded to the Medal of Honor. During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, while serving aboard the USS West Virginia as a mess attendant (one of the few jobs available to African Americans in the Navy at the beginning of World War II), Seaman Miller moved his mortally wounded captain to safety. He then proceeded to man a machine gun, successfully returning fire on the attacking Japanese. His heroics were initially ignored. After strong civil rights protests, he was given a letter of commendation. The letter of commendation was upgraded to the Navy Cross. A destroyer escort was later named in his honor. Legislative and other efforts to upgrade the Navy Cross to the Medal of Honor have proven unsuccessful. Noting that, at the time, no African Americans received the Medal of Honor during WWII, critics cite racism as a main reason for refusing Seaman Miller this honor.", "The reluctance to upgrade awards to the Medal of Honor or to award it outright is generally based on efforts to award the medal to those truly deserving, to maintain the integrity of the award itself and the awards process in general, and to avoid \"opening the floodgates\" to retroactive requests for this and other awards and decorations. This reluctance has led many to feel that the system of awarding medals is overly restrictive and that certain individuals are denied earned medals.", "It is noteworthy that two MoH awards have gone \"unclaimed.\" A posthumous medal awarded to Navy Chief Peter Tomich in 1942 for heroism at Pearl Harbor was never claimed since there were no known relatives, and according to the Navy Museum curator, Edward M. Furgol, the 20 th century produced at least one other unclaimed MoH from 1904.", "In the FY1996 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress enacted language that could significantly affect potential recipients. First, Congress waived the time limitation on any award or decoration for acts of valor during the Vietnam era for actions in the Southeast Asia theater of operations. Under this language, the Secretary concerned is instructed to review requests for consideration of awards/decorations, and to submit the following to the House National Security Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee:", "a summary of the request consideration, the findings resulting from the review, and the final action taken on the request for consideration.", "Second, Congress waived the laws and regulations for awarding any decoration (including the Medal of Honor) for those so deserving who were serving in intelligence activities during the period January 1, 1940-December 31, 1990. The Secretary of each military department was instructed to review each request for the award of a decoration during a one-year period commencing February 10, 1996. This was later extended to February 9, 1998. The Secretary was further instructed to file a report with the House National Security Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee with respect to each request. The report was to contain", "a summary of the request consideration, the findings resulting from the review, the final action taken on the request for consideration, and administrative or legislative recommendations to improve award procedures with respect to military intelligence personnel.", "These actions were taken in consideration of the fact that the records regarding intelligence activities are sealed for many years. Protecting this information for intelligence reasons means that those involved in intelligence activities are often ineligible to receive the Medal of Honor. In other words, should a person serving in intelligence perform an act of heroism worthy of the MoH, it is unlikely that the information could be publicly acknowledged. If the information is ever declassified, it is usually years after the fact. This delay could well mean that the individual who performed the act of heroism would be ineligible for the medal because of time limits on making recommendations.", "Third, Congress waived the time requirements and other restrictions and then asked the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy to review the records relating to the award of the Distinguished Service Cross and Navy Cross, respectively, awarded to Asian Americans or Native American Pacific Islanders who served during World War II. The purpose of this review was to determine whether such awards should be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. The reasoning for this review was based on claims of discrimination towards Americans of Asian-Pacific descent during the war. (For example, many Americans of Japanese descent were relocated to internment camps during the war.) On October 12, 1998, the Army Center of Military History reported that Army historians had completed a two-year search for Asian-Pacific American recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). The names of 104 Army recipients (including the late Senator Daniel K. Inouye) were forwarded to a board of senior officers for review. This board considered whether any of the forwarded recipients met the criteria for an upgrade to MoH. The list of those 22 Asian-Pacific Americans considered worthy of upgrading was then submitted to the President for final consideration. However, the Navy determined that its sole Asian-Pacific American DSC recipient did not merit upgrading. Proponents of the review/upgrade viewed this process as an overdue recognition of the heroics of these individuals long delayed by racism. Critics contend that the process was an act of \"race-based political correctness\" that diminished the value of the medal.", "Finally, Congress included a section entitled, \"Procedure for Consideration of Military Decorations Not Previously Submitted in Timely Fashion.\" Under this section:", "(a) Upon request of a Member of Congress, the Secretary concerned shall review a proposal for the award or presentation of a decoration (or the upgrading of a decoration), either for an individual or a unit, that is not otherwise authorized to be presented or awarded due to limitations established by law or policy for timely submission of a recommendation for such award or presentation. Based on such review, the Secretary shall make a determination as to the merits of approving the award or presentation of the decoration and other determinations necessary to comply with subsection (b).", "(b) Upon making a determination under subsection (a) as to the merits of approving the award or presentation of the decoration, the Secretary concerned shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the House of Representatives and to the requesting member of Congress notice in writing of one of the following:", "(1)The award or presentation of the decoration does not warrant approval on the merits.", "(2)The award or presentation of the decoration warrants approval and a waiver by law of time restrictions prescribed by law are recommended.", "(3)The award or presentation of the decoration warrants approval on the merits and has been approved as an exception to policy.", "(4)The award or presentation of the decoration warrants approval on the merits, but a waiver of the time restrictions prescribed in law is not recommended.", "A notice under paragraph (1) and (4) shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the decision of the Secretary.", "Under this language, Members of Congress are able to directly request the Secretary to consider awarding military decorations. Although this allows Members to better serve their constituents as well as fulfill their constitutional duties in providing oversight, critics contend that it may unduly politicize the awards process.", "In April 1996, despite restrictions on discussing awarding the Medal of Honor prematurely, the White House announced that it planned to award the medal to seven African American soldiers who fought in World War II. Although a number of Members of Congress had been working in favor of awarding certain of these individuals' medals, the White House announced that these awards would be forthcoming.

Following the congressionally mandated waiver of the time limits in November 1997, a review of Ingram's record resulted in the awarding of the medal.", "In a symbolic gesture, then-President Reagan awarded the medal to the Vietnam veteran interred at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington Cemetery in 1984. On May 14, 1998, the remains of the Vietnam veteran were exhumed. Advances in forensic identification using DNA testing allowed the military to positively identify the remains as those of Air Force 1 st Lieutenant Michael Blassie, an A-37 pilot who was killed in the battle of An Loc, Vietnam, on May 11, 1972. His remains were returned to his family in Missouri. Family members sought to retain the medal awarded in 1984 by then-President Reagan. The request to retain the medal was denied. \"[I]n a letter to the family, Undersecretary of Defense Rudy de Leon said the Pentagon had decided that the medal had been a symbolic award to all servicemembers who lost their lives in the conflict and not to any individual servicemember.\"", "The efforts of historians searching for cases justifying the presentation of the award to African American servicemembers in the World Wars, and the legislation allowing Congress to waive time restraints for such cases, unearthed a controversy regarding Theodore Roosevelt. ", "Under the time waiver Congress enacted in 1996, Representative Paul McHale introduced legislation requesting the President to award the MoH to then-Army Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for his actions on July 1, 1898, in the attack of San Juan Heights, Cuba, during the Spanish-American War. Representative McHale argued that the Medal was not awarded because of resentment generated as a result of Roosevelt's criticism of the War Department. Although it has been reported that the Army opposed presenting the MoH to Roosevelt, then-President Clinton signed the bill ( H.R. 2263 ) into law as P.L. 105-371 .
