The study summarized its findings as follows:", "What are the airlift requirements?", "The requirements for single or two concurrent MCO demands were based on those used in the Mobility Capabilities Study (MCS) from 2005. For the non-MCO demands, however, this study was able to take advantage of early versions of the more current Steady State Security Posture scenarios in order to derive demands outside the major theaters of war. Together, these constituted the requirements assumed for airlift.", "Does the currently programmed fleet meet the requirements?", "We found that the POR fleet is adequate in meeting the benchmark requirements identified in the MCS for moderate acceptable risk. Three different computer models used in this study produced somewhat different results for deliveries. The most pessimistic results matched MCS benchmark results, and with the other models, lower force levels than programmed also met the MCS benchmark level.", "What programmatic alternatives might also be considered and how well do they meet these requirements? What are the life-cycle costs of these alternatives?", "The study considered 36 alternative mixes and sizes and compared them both in cost and effectiveness with the POR. Figure ES-1 illustrates the relative capabilities of several alternative fleets that differ only in numbers or types of strategic lift aircraft (i.e., numbers and types of C-5s and C-17s). Results are shown relative to the capabilities that met the MCS moderate risk delivery demands for cargo. Similar analyses were performed for alternative fleets that differ in the numbers and types of intratheater airlift aircraft.", "The study identified several relatively inexpensive ways of generating higher capability from existing forces, without procuring additional strategic airlifters beyond those already programmed. These include the following: use C-5s at Emergency Wartime Planning levels (adds 2-4 percent, depending on whether the extra weight carried is fuel or cargo); transport with CRAF whatever oversize cargo that CRAF can carry, in addition to bulk cargo on pallets, in order to free up organic airlifters for the larger and heavier cargo (adds 10 percent); use host nation airlifters to the maximum extent possible (4 or 5 percent); and make use of tankers not involved in tanking missions to carry cargo in theater (adds about 4 percent). Use of these capabilities could also allow for a smaller strategic fleet that still meets MCS benchmark delivery requirements. Thus, our analyses using the MCR moderate risk benchmark suggest that an upper bound on the number of required strategic airlifters is 316, indicated by the two yellow boxes in Figure ES-1.", "A small amount of additional capability could be achieved if all C-5s are converted through Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program (RERP) to C-5Ms. This alternative is at comparable life-cycle cost to that of the POR; near-term acquisition costs are almost repaid over time in later years by reduced operating and support (O&S) costs.", "Traditionally, airlift and other force requirements are set by wartime demands (i.e., MCOs), not steady-state peacetime demands. Airlift is heavily used in both. If the appropriate acquisition planning scenarios are not MCOs but are high tempo non-MCO operations such as in Iraq and Afghanistan today, we find that some C-5As could be retired to save O&S costs with no loss in capability for those missions. This is illustrated in Figure ES-2. Moreover, a more cost-effective fleet than the POR is one that, in addition to having fewer C-5As, uses the smaller C-27Js instead of the larger C-130Js. These observations are driven by the need for numerous, geographically separated, but small loads during non-MCO operations, as currently anticipated in DoD planning scenarios.", "Our assessment of the C-17 line shutdown and restart is that continued production, even at low rates, is expensive relative to restart costs. Moreover, under the scenarios and other assumptions considered in this study, additional C-17s were not needed to meet the MCS moderate-acceptable-risk delivery rates used as a benchmark by the analyses conducted here. We also found that retiring C-5As to release funds to buy and operate more C-17s is not cost-effective.", "How do the alternatives differ in service life?", "We projected aircraft service lifetimes based on planned flying hour and flying severity conditions. Excursions to the planned operating conditions were also examined. Our findings are that all airlifters except the C-130E have structural lifetimes that are beyond 2030. Virtually all the C-5s and C-17s have lifetimes beyond 2040. The C-130E is near its structural life limit and extensions to that life are not cost-effective by our analyses.", "How well do CRAF aircraft contribute to wartime deliveries? At what specific organic fleet inventory would it impede the ability of CRAF participants to remain a viable augmentation option?", "We included CRAF in the simulated airlift deliveries and find them to be useful for passenger and cargo delivery, especially in MCOs if CRAF aircraft are allowed to carry some oversize cargo. Nonetheless, fewer than half of the CRAF aircraft available for Stage III (during two MCOs) are actually used, so current incentives provide more than enough CRAF for wartime demands. We also note that restructuring airline fleets should not significantly influence CRAF availability but may reduce numbers of charter passenger aircraft. A larger organic military fleet of airlift aircraft does not challenge passenger CRAF viability but could influence cargo CRAF because the organic fleet would be expected to shoulder a larger amount of the cargo movement required in peacetime. However, the cargo CRAF participates in a strong economic sector, does not strongly depend on CRAF in contrast to other commercial revenues, and is not likely to be significantly hurt by likely changes in DoD force levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mobility Capabilities and Requirements Study 2016 (MCRS-16)", "paragraphs": ["The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the U.S. Transportation Command are currently examining future requirements for airlift capability in a study called Mobility Capability and Requirements Study 2016 (MCRS-16), which is expected to be completed by the end of 2009.

These costs will only grow if we receive additional C-17s and/or delay the ability for the Department to retire excess aircraft.", "Initial indications from Mobility Capability Requirements Study 2016 show the strategic balance will not fundamentally change. This leads me to believe: 1) the Department does not need additional C-17s to meet strategic needs; 2) the Department needs to begin shedding excess strategic airlift inventory by retiring a portion of the C-5A fleet now. The Department requests your support and authority to allow the proper management of the strategic airlift fleet to meet the Nation's requirements.", "Thank you for your strong interest and continued support of the Department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "November 2009 GAO Report", "paragraphs": ["GAO reported in November 2009 that:", "Additional funds provided by Congress for C-17 procurement more than offset the strategic airlift gaps associated with reduced C-5 modernization plans. However, there is a potential future gap in tactical airlift capabilities for transporting medium weight Army equipment that cannot fit on C-130 aircraft. The C-17 fleet, in its dual role of providing both strategic and tactical airlift, currently provides this capability and is anticipated to continue to do so for many years. The JFTL [Joint Future Theater Lift aircraft] is envisioned to eventually replace the C-130H and perform this and other roles, but will not be available for 15 years or more under the current acquisition strategy. While the various mobility studies acknowledge the C-17s' significant dual role, they did not comprehensively evaluate an expanded future use of the C-17 for the transport of medium weight equipment and how this could affect the force structure, the C-17s' service life, and when to shut down the C-17 production line. For example, the studies do not quantify current and anticipated future use of the C-17 for tactical airlift. This is because DOD officials do not consider the C-17 to be a suitable substitute for the JFTL....", "A potential future capability gap exists in the deployment and redeployment of Army medium weight weapon systems within a theater of combat. The C-17 is the only aircraft currently capable of transporting heavier equipment, such as combat configured armored Strykers and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, within a theater of operations as these are too large and bulky for C-130s to carry. However, the C-17 cannot transport this equipment into austere, short, or unimproved landing areas. DOD's long-term plan is to use the JFTL, the planned C-130H replacement, to transport these vehicles in theater, including to such access-challenged locations. However, it will not be available for at least 15 years as currently planned. While the various mobility studies acknowledge the C-17 can perform both strategic and tactical airlift missions, none of the three recently completed or ongoing studies comprehensively considered the C-17 in the tactical force structure, even though about 20 percent of the tactical sorties flown by the C-17 fleet in fiscal year 2007 were for missions where loads were too large for C-130s. As such, DOD has not evaluated the impact the increasing tactical heavy lift mission will have on future tactical airlift requirements, the C-17's service life, its availability to perform strategic airlift and other tactical airlift missions, and the impact it could have on C-17 production shutdown plans.", "DOD officials do not believe that the C-17 is a suitable substitute for the JFTL mission. A DOD official stated that preliminary results of the Mobility Capabilities and Requirements Study 2016 show that in the worst case planning scenario there would be enough C-17s to perform its primary role as a strategic airlifter, as well as some tactical missions through 2016. This is because the study analysis shows the peak demand for the C-17 and the C-130 occurs at different times and the C-17 is aging as planned. However, officials indicated that none of the current mobility studies analyzed the need for the C-17 to perform additional tactical heavy lift missions for the 8-year period between 2016 and 2024, when the JFTL is expected to be fielded. Furthermore, because we were not granted access to the preliminary study information, we could not ascertain the extent to which the C-17's heavy lift mission had been considered in DOD's analysis through 2016. C-17 production is scheduled to end in March 2011. As we previously reported a well-reasoned, near-term decision on the final C-17 fleet size could help DOD avoid substantial future costs from ending production prematurely and later restarting production. For example, the Air Force has estimated that restoring the production line could cost $2 billion. Costs and challenges associated with such a course include hiring and training a workforce of nearly 3,100 people, reinstalling and restoring production tooling, and identifying suppliers and qualifying their parts and processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "November 2008 GAO Report", "paragraphs": ["GAO reported in November 2008 that:", "We previously reported on shortcomings in the Institute for Defense Analysis' study plan that could make it difficult for decision makers to know how much strategic airlift is needed. For example, the study plan did not provide details on assumptions and the measures of effectiveness, or metrics, the command officials would be using in their evaluation. Measures of effectiveness are considered to be especially important when evaluating alternatives, such as comparing the results of two analyses that measure different airlift force mixes. We recommended in April 2008 that DOD take action to ensure that the final study plan included sufficient details to address all the elements specified in the law and needed to inform decision makers on airlift issues. DOD concurred with our recommendation.", "We also identified shortcomings in DOD's 2005 mobility capabilities study approach that, if not addressed, could be repeated again in the current study. Unlike prior studies, the 2005 study did not recommend a specific airlift requirement expressed in million ton-miles per day\u2014a common metric integral to prior capability studies that defines and quantifies airlift requirements as a basis for computing the size and optimal mix of airlift forces. Instead, DOD officials stated that it expressed its airlift requirement in terms of specific numbers and types of aircraft needed to meet the national defense strategy to take into account real-world operating parameters that may cause aircraft payloads to vary significantly from standard planning factors. Later, in response to congressional direction, DOD translated the requirements into a million ton-mile requirement. We also found the study did not identify the operational impact of increased or decreased strategic airlift on achieving warfighting objectives that would be associated with different mixes of C-5 and C-17 aircraft. As a result, we could not determine how the study concluded that the mix of C-5s and C-17s at that time was adequate for meeting mobility requirements and for supporting strategic airlift portfolio investment decisions. In 2006, we recommended that DOD include mobility metrics, along with warfighting metrics to determine air superiority, when completing future mobility capabilities studies. DOD concurred with this recommendation.", "Although DOD concurred with the recommendation, a Transportation Command official stated that a decision has not yet been made on what specific metrics will be used to determine the number and mix of strategic airlifters in the current mobility capabilities study. At the time of this writing, the study plan had not been finalized and it is unclear whether a million ton-miles metric will be used, though it is being considered. DOD often uses the million ton-mile metric as an easy way to compare the capacity of different fleet mixes. For example, according to a DOD official, since C-130s, C-130Js, C-17s, C-5As, C-5Bs, and C-5Ms all have different capabilities when it comes to payload and range, it is difficult to compare different mixes of them without using this metric.", "The report also stated:", "The C-5 and C-17 provide complementary capabilities. However, DOD continues to struggle with identifying the specific quantities and determining the optimal mix of aircraft needed. Clarity is needed before committing additional billions of dollars to C-5 modernization programs, establishing C-5 retirement schedules, and/or acquiring additional C-17 aircraft. Careful planning is also important to avoid the costs of shutting down the C-17 line prematurely and later deciding to restart the production. The new mobility studies, if done correctly, could bring clarity to strategic airlift capabilities needed to support the future force and changed threats, as well as inform future tactical airlift requirements because of the C-17's dual role. Important metrics left out of the 2005 capabilities study\u2014such as specific ton-mile mobility requirements and relative reliability rates\u2014are considered critical factors in quantifying and analyzing cost-effective force mixes. DOD concurred with our prior recommendation to use mobility metrics to inform future mobility capabilities studies. However, at this writing, it is unclear whether DOD will use a million ton-mile metric in its current analysis to determine the cost-effective mix of aircraft and guide important investment decisions related to the expenditure of billions of dollars. Until comprehensive requirements\u2014supported by appropriate, quantifiable metrics\u2014and the full costs for alternate courses of action are identified, DOD decision making on the future size and mix of strategic airlift is hampered, thus increasing the risk of incurring unnecessary costs and establishing a less than optimal mix of strategic and tactical airlift forces."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cost-Effectiveness of C-5 Modernization Compared to C-17 Procurement", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "November 2008 GAO Report", "paragraphs": ["GAO reported in November 2008 that:", "if the cost for C-5 modernization continues to increase, Air Force officials may have to reconsider the mix within its airlift portfolio or request additional funding. Additional investments in C-17 aircraft may become more attractive. Currently, a new C-17 would cost about $276 million compared to $132 million to fully modernize a C-5. Each new C-17 potentially adds 100 percent of its cargo capacity toward meeting the total airlift requirement. Because the C-5s are already part of the operational force, each aircraft's current capacity is already counted toward the total requirement. Consequently, according to DOD data, the C-5 modernization programs only provide a marginal increase of 14 percent in capability over nonmodernized aircraft. Using DOD's million ton-mile per day planning factors, we, working in collaboration with DOD, calculated that DOD would need to fully modernize 7 C-5s to attain the equivalent capability achieved from acquiring 1 additional C-17 and the costs would be over 3 times more (see table 3).", "The analysis does not include the life-cycle costs of adding more C-17s to DOD's airlift portfolio. However, previous DOD analysis indicated that the life-cycle costs would be approximately the same if DOD replaced 30 C-5s with 30 C-17s.", "The Air Force has not fully identified the funding needed to modernize the C-5 aircraft, and costs are likely to increase. The current cost estimate is $9.1 billion to AMP the entire fleet of 111 aircraft and RERP 52 aircraft. However, we believe this is understated. The current budget does not fully fund the revised RERP program and the CAIG's [the DOD Cost Analysis Improvement Group's] cost estimate does not adequately address risk and uncertainty. Further, the cost estimate does not include the costs for a new modernization upgrade program slated to begin in fiscal year 2010 that would fix AMP deficiencies and add new capabilities. Alternatively, some future modification costs may be avoided should the Air Force justify retirement of some older C-5s.", "The current budget does not sufficiently fund the revised RERP program. According to the CAIG's analysis, the C-5 RERP is underfunded by about $294 million across the Future Years Defense Plan for fiscal years 2009- 2013. Approximately $250 million less is needed in fiscal years 2009 through 2011, and $544 million more is needed in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. According to program officials, the Air Force is committed to fully funding the CAIG RERP cost estimate in the fiscal year 2010 President's budget yet to be submitted. However, program officials could not identify sources for the additional funding needed in fiscal years 2012 and 2013....", "While our review of the CAIG's cost-estimating methodology found it generally well documented, comprehensive, and accurate, we found some weaknesses that impair the credibility and overall reliability of the C-5 cost estimate. Specifically, the CAIG did not take risk or uncertainty into account for some major cost drivers, in particular the propulsion system and labor. Because cost estimates predict future program costs, uncertainty is always associated with them. For example, there is always a chance that the actual cost will differ from the estimate because of a lack of knowledge about the future as well as errors resulting from historical data inconsistencies, assumptions, cost-estimating equations, and factors that are typically used to develop an estimate. Quantifying that risk and uncertainty is considered to be a cost estimating best practice because it captures the cumulative effect of risks and recognizes the potential for error.", "In a memo documenting its independent cost estimate, the CAIG stated that the biggest risk to the cost estimate was the purchase agreement between Lockheed Martin and General Electric for the propulsion system that is conditioned on specific annual procurement quantities. The CAIG had estimated that the Air Force could save 18 percent by meeting the quantity and schedule identified in the revised RERP. However, CAIG officials stated that if the budget is not sufficient to meet these agreed-to quantities, then anticipated price breaks would not occur, resulting in increased costs of the C-5 RERP to the government. Despite this significant risk, the CAIG did not perform a risk/uncertainty analysis to determine the extent to which costs would increase should the buy quantity be cut. CAIG officials stated that they believe propulsion system procurement risk has been mitigated because they have identified the quantities necessary to meet the conditions of the purchase agreement and the Air Force plans to fully fund to this estimate. Despite these assurances, however, we have found that DOD often changes procurement quantities and there is a risk that quantities for the C-5 RERP program may change. For example, DOD's Selected Acquisition Report summary shows that of the 56 programs currently in production, 38 (or 68 percent), have experienced a quantity change since their production decisions.", "In addition, the CAIG did not quantify or address uncertainty with its $2.1 billion labor cost estimate associated with the installation of the RERP on C-5 production aircraft. The RERP program experienced a 29-month break in production between the last system development and demonstration unit and the first production unit. As such, the CAIG had to estimate inefficiencies due to loss of learning and how it would affect the costs of future production. The CAIG's assumptions differed from those used by the Air Force and Lockheed Martin, which caused the CAIG estimate to be about $200 million more than Lockheed Martin's estimate and about $400 million less than the Air Force's labor estimate. As a result of the weaknesses discussed above, the Air Force's basis for making strategic airlift portfolio investment decisions is impaired, and the RERP program is at increased risk of experiencing cost overruns.", "Additional modernization efforts not yet budgeted will add to future C-5 costs. Air Force officials stated that a new C-5 upgrade program is slated to begin in fiscal year 2010. The initial funding requirement is $65 million\u2014$40 million in research, development, test, and evaluation funds and $25 million in procurement funds\u2014to migrate all C-5s toward a standard software configuration, based on changes made in the AMP and RERP programs. Requirements previous waived on the AMP may also be addressed in the initial block of this program. Additional funding will be requested in 2012 and beyond to provide additional capabilities. According to a program official, the total requirements and funding needs for this modernization program have not been finalized. However, at this time it is not expected to be as costly as the C-5 AMP or RERP.", "The eventual costs for modernizing C-5 aircraft hinge upon the decisions DOD officials make about the number and mix of strategic airlifters DOD needs in the future. If additional C-5 capability is needed, more C-5 aircraft may need to receive the RERP modification and costs will increase.

This platform has been responsible for the airlift of more cargo and personnel than any other platform. In recognition of the platforms contributions to the Nation's security, the Committee provides an additional $674,100,000 for the procurement of three C\u201317 aircraft. The Committee recognizes that this is well below the minimum sustaining rate required for the production line. In an effort to avoid the extremely high costs associated with small production lots, the Committee's intent is that these aircraft be absorbed into the fiscal year 2009 production run that was funded from the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, to create a full production run funded over a two year period. The Committee intends that the pricing for these aircraft be consistent with the 2009 aircraft, using methods such as a fixed price option to the fiscal year 2009 production contract. (Page 191)", "The report also states:", "UNDEFINITIZED CONTRACT ACTIONS", "The Committee has become aware of the excessive use of undefinitized contract actions (UCA's) by the Air Force. Based on information obtained by the Committee, it is apparent that the Air Force has not provided the proper oversight of contracting activities within various programs. Specifically, the C\u201317 aircraft program has billions of dollars in undefinitized contracts. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) very clearly stipulate in subpart 217.74 that UCA's are to be used as the exception not as the rule for urgent needs. It is common practice for the C\u201317 program to place all of its funding on a UCA and then immediately obligate up to 50 percent of the not-to-exceed price at the award which is a disincentive to definitize the contract. Further, the DFAR requires that the contract must be definitized within 180 days after the issuance of initial undefinitized action unless it is extended by another 180 days after the contractor submits a qualifying proposal. The C\u201317 program has numerous contracts well in excess of these timelines with proposal times for fiscal year 2007 funds ranging from 373 to 975 days and on average 688 days to definitize. This use of UCA's places the taxpayer at a severe disadvantage when negotiating contracts since the contractor has little incentive to control costs while performing work under a UCA.", "Even more concerning to the Committee, is that this excessive use of UCA's is not just isolated to procurement and modernization programs but has migrated to operation and maintenance programs. Based on information supplied by the Air Force, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Contracting memorandum dated 28 November 2001 authorized the waiver of the limitations in the DFAR for definitization schedule and obligations for UCAs that support overseas operations. With this memorandum as justification, the Air Force has placed the fiscal year 2009 C\u201317 depot funding on a UCA which is still not definitized in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year even though the Air Force has obligated 89.7 percent of the $1,118,679,167 not-to-exceed price. This rationale for the use of a undefinitized contracts for routine activities is abusive. The Committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to address this situation within 30 days of enactment of this Act to include the cancellation of the November 2001 memorandum. The Committee further directs the Air Force to provide a detailed report to the congressional defense committees of all undefinitized UCA's in excess of $50,000,000 within 30 days of enactment of this Act. The report shall include the date the UCA was initiated, the not-to-exceed price, the amount obligated on the UCA, and the planned date for definitization.", "While the Committee understands the need at times for programs to use this type of contracting mechanism, it appears that the Air Force has grossly abused it with respect to volume, value, and time to definitize. The Committee insists that the Air Force finalize all existing undefinitized contract actions in an expedited manner and to minimize the use of UCA's the future. To encourage a sense of urgency, the Committee has included a new proviso in the Aircraft Procurement, Air Force appropriating paragraph which specifies that for C\u201317 procurement and modernization efforts funded with Aircraft Procurement, Air Force the obligation of fiscal year 2010 procurement funds is prohibited until the existing UCA's are definitized. The Committee further directs the Undersecretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) to review contracting procedures within the Air Force and provide a report to the congressional defense committees within 90 days of enactment of this Act detailing a strategy to reduce current and minimize future undefinitized contracts in the Air Force.

The C\u201317 is the workhorse of the theater, flying fifty percent of all sorties for the United States Transportation Command over the last 24 months. These missions range from airdrops for troops in forward locations to aeromedical evacuation of servicemembers from theater back to the United States. While the aircraft is designed to fly 1,000 hours per year over 30 years, over the last ten years the C\u201317 fleet has averaged 1,250 hours per aircraft with some aircraft flying in excess of 2,400 hours in a single year. This heavy usage is reducing the expected service life of the aircraft. The aircraft included in the recommendation will alleviate some of these issues by introducing new aircraft into the inventory.", "Further, the Committee is concerned that a decision on the continuation of the C\u201317 program was announced prior to the completion of the Mobility Capability and Requirements Study (MCRS), which will address the needs of the Department of Defense in 2016. Since the last MCRS in 2005, several changes have occurred that would change previous requirements to include the growth of ground forces, the increased size and use of Special Operations Forces, additional use of the C\u201317 in an intra-theater role, and the stand up of a new combatant command\u2014United States Africa Command.
