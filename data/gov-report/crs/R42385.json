Should the President determine and report in writing to Congress or if Congress determines through enactment of a joint resolution pursuant to Section 3(c)(3)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act that a \"substantial violation\" by a foreign country of an applicable agreement governing an arms sale has occurred, then that country becomes ineligible for further U.S. military sales under the AECA.

Concerns centered on whether or not Israel had used U.S.-supplied anti-personnel cluster bombs against civilian targets during its military operations in Lebanon and the siege of Beirut. The pertinent segment of that 1952 agreement between Israel and the United States reads as follows:", "The Government of Israel assures the United States Government that such equipment, materials, or services as may be acquired from the United States ... are required for and will be used solely to maintain its internal security, its legitimate self-defense, or to permit it to participate in the defense of the area of which it is a part, or in United Nations collective security arrangements and measures, and that it will not undertake any act of aggression against any other state.", "It should be noted that none of the critical terms such as \"internal security,\" \"legitimate self-defense,\" or \"act of aggression\" are defined within this 1952 U.S.-Israeli agreement. The House Foreign Affairs Committee held hearings on this issue in July and August 1982. On July 19, 1982, the Reagan Administration announced that it would prohibit new exports of cluster bombs to Israel. This prohibition was lifted by the Reagan Administration in November 1988.", "In light of the Israeli attack on the Iraqi nuclear reactor on June 7, 1981, Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Jr., reported to Congress on June 10, 1981, that the Israeli use of American-supplied military equipment in this raid \"may\" have constituted a substantial violation of the applicable 1952 U.S.-Israeli agreement.

As the result of this decision, the subsequent delivery of 10 F-16 and 2 F-15 aircraft to Israel was also suspended. However, on August 17, 1981, the Reagan Administration lifted its suspension on deliveries to Israel and all of the planes were transferred.", "On two other occasions\u2014April 5, 1978, and August 7, 1979\u2014the Carter Administration chose to find that the Israelis \"may\" have violated their 1952 agreement with the United States through the use of American-origin military equipment in operations conducted in Lebanon.

The Reagan Administration subsequently stated that the Israeli raid was \"understandable as an expression of self-defense,\" although the bombing itself \"cannot be condoned.\" On July 14, 1976, following the Israeli rescue mission at Entebbe, Uganda in early July 1976, the Department of State declared that Israel's use of U.S.-supplied military equipment during that operation was in accordance with the 1952 U.S.-Israeli agreement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indonesia and East Timor", "paragraphs": ["Following the military intervention of Indonesia in East Timor on December 7, 1975, the Ford Administration initiated a \"policy review\" in connection with the U.S. military assistance program with Indonesia.

However, military equipment already in the pipeline continued to be delivered to the Indonesians. The \"policy review\" was completed in late May 1976.

The President independently suspended the issuance of new Foreign Military Sales credits and guarantees and major new cash sales for Turkey from late July until October 17, 1974. The President did permit routine cash sales of spare parts and components for items already purchased by Turkey during this same period. The Congress imposed an embargo on military sales, credits, assistance, and deliveries to Turkey with the enactment of H.J.Res. 1167 (the Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY1975, P.L. 93-448 ).

Yet it also gave the President the option of temporarily waiving the embargo's effect until February 5, 1975. President Ford used this waiver to suspend the embargo from December 30, 1974, until February 5, 1975, at which time the Turkish embargo was restored. On October 6, 1975, President Ford signed into law P.L. 94-104 , which partially lifted the arms embargo on Turkey. Successive statutes modified military aid and sales levels for Turkey while a partial embargo remained in effect.
