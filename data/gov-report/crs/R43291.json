These activities include transport, tourism, financial services, use of intellectual property, telecommunications and information services, government services, maintenance, and other professional services from accounting to legal services. Compared to goods, the types and volume of services that can be traded are limited by factors such as the requirement for direct buyer-provider contact, and other unique characteristics such as the reusability of services (e.g., professional consulting) for which traditional value measures do not account. In addition to services as independent exports, manufactured and agricultural products incorporate and depend on services, such as research and development or shipping of intermediate or final goods. As services account for 82% of U.S. private sector jobs, U.S. trade in services, both services as exports and as inputs to other exported products, can have a broad impact across the U.S. economy.", "Rapid advances in information technology and the related growth of global value chains have expanded both the level and the range of services tradable across national borders. As a result, services have become a priority in U.S. trade policy, and a significant part of U.S. trade flows and of global trade in general, accounting for $752.4 billion in U.S. exports. As the United States is the world's largest exporter and importer of services (15% and 10% of the global total in 2016), the Administration's discussions on potential and existing trade agreements that include services are significant.", "A number of economists argue that \"behind the border\" barriers imposed by foreign governments prevent U.S. trade in services from expanding to its full potential. The United States continues to negotiate trade agreements to lower these barriers. It was a leading force in concluding the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994, and in past U.S. free trade agreements, all of which contain significant provisions on market access and rules for liberalizing trade in services. Trade agreements involving trade in services currently under discussion include the following.", "Renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. Review of the U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS).

Potential new and updated bilateral free trade agreements with other partners.", "In each case, participants have difficult issues to address and the outlook for progress is uncertain. For each agreement, Congress may consider legislation to implement agreements potentially concluded in the future.", "Congress and U.S. trade negotiators face additional issues, including how to balance the need for effective regulations of services with the objective of opening markets for U.S. exports and trade in services; ensuring adequate and accurate data to measure trade in services to inform trade policy; and determining whether further international cooperation efforts are needed to improve the regulatory environment for services trade beyond initial market access.

The term \"services\" refers to an expanding range of economic activities, such as audiovisual, construction, computer and related services, express delivery, telecommunications, e-commerce, financial, professional (such as accounting and legal services), retail and wholesaling, transportation, and tourism. Services not only function as end-use products but also facilitate the rest of the economy. For example, transportation services move intermediate products along global supply chains and final products to consumers; telecommunications services open e-commerce channels; and financial services provide credit for the manufacture and consumption of goods or the production of crops. ", "Services account for a majority of the U.S. economy\u201478% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and 82% of U.S. private sector full-time employment. Services have also become a significant component of U.S. international trade, accounting for $752.4 billion of U.S. exports in 2016. As such, it is an increasingly important component of U.S. trade policy and of global trade in general. ", "Rapid advances in information technology and the related growth of global value chains are making an expanding range of services tradable across national borders. However, certain characteristics have limited the types and volume of services that can be traded; for example, a hair stylist must be physically near a client. Other service providers are no longer required to be in the same location as the customer, such as a graphic designer who can send a product (e.g., an electronic file of a design) to a client across the globe. A number of economists have argued that foreign government barriers prevent U.S. trade in services from expanding to its full potential. Under the Trump Administration, the United States may continue to engage in trade negotiations on multilateral, plurilateral, bilateral, and regional agreements with one goal being to lower these barriers.

In fulfilling its responsibilities for regulation of commerce and oversight of U.S. trade policymaking and implementation, Congress monitors trade negotiations and the implementation of trade agreements. Congress establishes trade negotiating objectives and priorities, including through trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation and consultations with the Administration. More directly, Congress must pass legislation to implement a trade agreement requiring changes to U.S. law before it can enter into force in the United States.

The second set of data measures services sold by an affiliate , that is, the services a local affiliate of a foreign company sells to a consumer of the local economy (Mode 3).", "For cross-border trade, in 2016, services accounted for 34.1% of the $2,208 billion total in U.S. exports (of goods and services) and 18.6% of the $2,713 billion in total U.S. imports. Figure 2 shows that the United States has continually realized surpluses in services trade, which have partially offset large trade deficits in goods trade in the U.S. current account. ", "Many services require direct contact between the supplier and consumer and, therefore, service providers often need to establish a presence in the country of the consumer through foreign direct investment (FDI). For example, providers of legal, accounting, and construction services usually prefer a direct presence because they need access to expert knowledge of the laws and regulations of the country in which they are doing business. They also require proximity to clients. Companies establish a commercial presence abroad (Mode 3) through a foreign affiliate. It is unclear how advances in information and communications technology will affect trade in services as virtual delivery via the Internet expands the range of services offered and also drives increased demand.", "In 2015 (the latest year for which published data are available), U.S. firms sold $1,463.5 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, and foreign firms sold $952.5 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. The data for cross-border trade and for sales by majority-owned affiliates are not directly compatible due to differences in coverage and classification. Nevertheless, the data presented in Table 1 indicate that, in terms of magnitude, a large proportion of sales of services occurs through the commercial presence of companies in foreign markets rather than cross-border trade. ", "Conventional trade data are not measured on a value-added basis and do not attribute any portion of the traded value of manufactured and agricultural products to services inputs, such as research and development, design, transportation costs, and finance. Instead, traditional data measure exports and imports of goods based on the value of the final product (e.g., medical device or t-shirt). ", "Measuring trade flows based on value-added rather than final cost, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the WTO estimated that in 2009, close to 50% of the value of U.S. exports of manufactured goods was attributable to services inputs. This finding suggests a larger role for services in international trade than is reflected in conventional trade data; it also suggests trade in services is likely to grow in importance with the growth of global value chains. An economist at Standard Chartered also argues that there are discrepancies in trade statistics, showing that by traditional measures services are 20% of global exports but, by his estimates of value-added, services account for 45%.

GVCs provide industries access to wider markets and have the potential to increase productivity and efficiency, lower costs, and create new offerings for companies and consumers. U.S. firms are expanding global value chains using advances in information technology to bring goods and services to market. Today, more than half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods traveling within supply chains, while over 75% of the world's services imports are intermediate services. Intermediate services embedded within a value chain include not only transportation and distribution to move goods along, but also research and development, design and engineering, as well as business services such as legal, accounting, or financial services. The independent value of these services (as opposed to the value of the final product) can be captured in trade in value added statistics (see earlier discussion). As manufacturing and agriculture grow more complex and technologically advanced, their consumption of value-added services also grows.", "Global value chains have expanded and redefined the role that services play in international trade and are one reason for growth in services trade. Furthermore, GVCs may also serve as a motivator for countries involved at any point along a global value chain to seek more open markets for moving intermediate goods and service imports and exports. According to one study, a domestically manufactured good in many countries contains over 20% of foreign value added, and over 50% in some countries and industries. Similarly, imported goods often contain a significant amount of domestic content. For example, a French wine imported into the United States may be transported by a U.S. express delivery service and use a label designed and printed by a U.S. marketing firm, while a gadget assembled domestically and exported by a U.S. firm may not only have components from abroad but also may rely on foreign research and engineering skills. With U.S. firms supplying many of the world's services, these findings imply that more U.S. services are traded internationally and many more service industry jobs in the United States are linked to international trade than traditional trade statistics indicate.", "The WTO's \"Made in the World\" initiative finds that the increased use of GVCs has led industries to demand greater trade liberalization and lower protectionism as these firms depend on other links in the value chain, both domestic and foreign. The disaggregation of value chains into smaller pieces, or modules, opens up domestic and international business opportunities to specialized firms or small or mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) who can focus on one piece. As such, the strategic and potential economic impact of both trade barriers and efforts to liberalize trade in services may be greater than many people realize. By expanding through GVCs, U.S. industries could obtain greater and efficient access to markets, less expensive labor, and lower production costs, as well as talents and specializations from across the world.", "However, using global supply chains entails potential costs and risks. Managing a complex supply chain across countries and/or time zones can be difficult and create additional costs. Some analysts point out that the benefits of increasingly interconnected supply chains may be offset by potential costs associated with overreliance on foreign or dispersed suppliers, or increased exposure or vulnerability to intellectual property rights theft or external shocks from abroad, such as an environmental disaster (e.g., earthquake) or market disturbances (e.g., financial crash or truck driver strike). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers to Trade in Services", "paragraphs": ["Liberalizing trade in services can be more complex than for goods, as the impediments are often \"behind the border\" barriers (occurring within the importing country) whereas those faced by goods suppliers, including tariffs and quotas, are frequently at the border.", "The GATS identifies specific \"market access\" barriers and limits restrictions on the following: the number of foreign service suppliers, the total value of service transactions or assets, the number of transactions or value of output, the type of legal entity or joint venture through which services may be supplied, and the share of foreign capital in terms of maximum percentage limit on foreign shareholding or total value of foreign direct investment. ", "In many cases the impediments are government regulations or rules that appear legitimate but may intentionally or unintentionally discriminate against foreign providers and impede trade. ", "The right of governments to regulate service industries is widely recognized as prudent and necessary to protect consumers from harmful or unqualified providers. For example, doctors and other medical personnel must be licensed by government-appointed boards; lawyers, financial services providers, and many other professional service providers must be also certified in some manner. In addition, governments apply minimum capital requirements on banks to ensure their solvency. Each government can determine what it deems to be a prudent level of regulation. However, one concern in international trade is whether these regulations are applied to foreign service providers in a discriminatory and unnecessarily trade restrictive manner that limits market access. Because services transactions more often require direct contact between the consumer and provider than is the case with goods trade, many of the \"trade barriers\" that foreign companies face pertain to the establishment of a commercial presence in the consumers' country in the form of direct investment (Mode 3) or to the temporary movement of providers and consumers across borders (Modes 2 and 4)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Economic Effects of Barriers to Services Trade", "paragraphs": ["The most significant barriers to trade in services are not readily quantifiable, and measuring their effects has challenges and limitations. To help inform trade policy, economists have constructed methods to estimate the effects, but these studies are sensitive to the assumptions made and may not necessarily reflect the entire range of factors influencing trade flows. Another consideration is that, as restrictions to trade are eliminated, cross-border trade via modes 1, 2, and 4 could grow at the expense of mode 3 if local presence is no longer a requirement to provide services in a particular country. However, removal of restrictions on foreign investment could offset any potential decline over the long term.", "Most economists argue that by reducing barriers to trade in services, economies can more efficiently allocate resources, increasing general economic welfare. Opponents of liberalization in trade in services argue that a country would be forced to relinquish some regulatory control.", "Economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) published the results of one analysis of the impact of barriers on services trade. They first determined that U.S. trade in \"business services\"\u2014a category that includes such activities as information, financial, scientific, and management services\u2014is lower than one might expect given U.S. comparative advantage in those services. To come to this conclusion, the PIIE economists first determined that many business services are tradable, that is, capable of being sold from one region to another because many of them are \"traded\" between regions within the United States. Based on these assumptions, they compared the trade profiles of manufacturing firms and those of service firms and concluded that while about 27% of U.S. manufacturing firms export, only 5% of U.S. firms providing business services engage in exporting, even though the United States has a comparative advantage in business services. The PIIE study concludes that foreign government trade barriers are a major factor in the relatively low participation of U.S. service providers in trade. It also calculated the export/total sales ratios of manufacturing firms compared to business services firms, with the former being 0.20 and the latter 0.04. The study argues that if the ratio of business services could be raised to 0.1 or half of the manufacturers' ratio, it would increase total U.S. goods and services exports by 15%. Given that four-fifths of the U.S. private sector workforce is in services, a change in the ratio of exporting service businesses could have a significant impact. If more businesses engaged in exporting services, U.S. imports of services may also increase. ", "Nontariff barriers for services specifically related to digital trade and data flows establish restrictions that may impact what a firm offers in a market or how it operates. For example, data transfer regulations that restrict cross-border data flows (\"forced\" localization barriers to trade), such as requiring locally based servers, may limit the type of financial transactions and services that a firm can sell in a given country (see text box below). Similarly, country-specific data regulations may create a disincentive for U.S. firms to invest in certain markets if a firm is hindered in its ability to export its own data from a foreign affiliate to a U.S.-based headquarters in order to aggregate and analyze information from across its global operations. The proponents of data localization seek to ensure privacy of citizens, security, and domestic control. Others point out that maintaining data within a country does not necessarily guarantee security or protect a country from exposure to foreign attacks. Opponents of localization restrictions on digital trade also point to lost efficiencies and increased costs of not allowing a free flow of information across borders. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, based on 2014 estimates, decreasing barriers to cross-border data flows would increase GDP in the United States by 0.1% to 0.3%. ", "One OECD study analyzed the relationship between services trade restrictions, cross-border trade in services, and trade in downstream manufactured goods. The study finds that more restrictive countries not only import less in services but also export less, suggesting that restrictions also hurt the competitiveness of domestic industry. The negative effect of trade restrictions holds true across the various service sectors the researchers investigated. Financial services saw the greatest impact when restrictions changed; limitations on financial services were mostly in the form of market entry restrictions such as equity limits. Another OECD study finds that SMEs benefit relatively more compared to larger multinational firms from the reduction in market access barriers.", "According to the OECD Service Trade Restrictiveness Index (STRI), the United States has a relatively open and competitive business environment in comparison to the 40 countries included in the study, as foreign providers have access and are allowed to compete equally in most sectors in the United States. The United States scored as the most open country for sound recording, motion pictures, and distribution services, reflecting the highly competitive U.S. industry in these sectors. On the other hand, the study identifies air transport, maritime transport, and courier services as the U.S. business sectors with the most restrictions impacting foreign firms seeking to do business in the country. As an example, the STRI shows that the United States is much more open than Brazil for trade in motion pictures but that both are relatively restrictive for international insurance trade (see Figure 6 ). The STRI can also show the impact of a country's reform efforts. For example, reforms by Indonesia in 2016 reduced its trade restrictiveness in particular sectors, including sound recording and air transport, compared to 2014."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Trade Agreements", "paragraphs": ["The United States has worked with trading partners to develop and implement rules on several fronts to reduce barriers and facilitate trade in services without infringing on the sovereign rights of governments to regulate services for prudential, sound regulatory and national security reasons. The broadest and most challenging in terms of the number of countries involved are the multilateral rules contained in the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) that entered into force in 1995 and are administered by the 164-member World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States has also sought to go beyond the GATS (WTO-plus) under more comprehensive rules in the free trade agreements (FTAs) it has in force and, according to press reports, in current renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

Overall U.S. negotiating objectives, as defined in legislation (see \" U.S. Trade Negotiating Objectives \"), in each of these fora are to establish a more open, rules-based trade regime that is flexible enough to increase the flow of services and to take into account the expansion of types of services, but clear enough not to impede the ability of governments to regulate the sectors.

While the Tokyo Round concluded in 1979 without a services agreement, the industrialized countries, led by the United States, continued to press for its inclusion in later negotiations. Developing countries, whose service sectors are less advanced than those of the industrialized countries, were reluctant to have services included. Eventually services were included as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations launched in 1986. At the end of the round in 1994, countries agreed to a new set of rules for services, the GATS, and a new multilateral body, the WTO, to administer the GATS, the GATT, and the other agreements reached on financial services and telecommunications.

They apply only to those services and modes of delivery listed in each member's schedule of commitments. Thus, unless a member country has specifically committed to open its market to service suppliers in a particular service that is provided via one or more of the four modes of delivery, the national treatment and market access obligations do not apply. This is often referred to as the positive list approach to trade commitments. Each member country's schedule of commitments is contained in an annex to the GATS. The schedules of market access commitments are, in essence, the core of the GATS.", "Parts IV-VI (Articles XIX-XXIX) are technical elements of the agreement. Among other things, they require that, no later than 2000, the GATS members start new negotiations (which they did) to expand coverage of the agreement and that conflicts between members involving implementation of the GATS are to be handled in the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The GATS also includes eight annexes, including one on MFN exemptions. Another annex provides a \"prudential carve out,\" that is, a recognition that governments take \"prudent\" actions to protect investors or otherwise maintain the integrity of the national financial system. These prudent actions are allowed, even if they conflict with obligations under the GATS.", "Not all of the issues in services were resolved when the Uruguay Round negotiations ended in 1994.

However, because no agreement was reached, the services negotiations were folded\u2014along with agriculture and nonagriculture negotiations\u2014into the agenda of the Doha Development Agenda (Doha Round) round that launched in December 2001. ", "U.S. priorities in the services negotiations included the following: ", "removing unnecessary restrictions on foreign providers establishing a commercial presence; improving the quality of commitments from what was established originally in the GATS; regulatory transparency so that foreign services providers are better informed about host country regulations that may affect them; and expanding market access in financial services, telecommunication services, express delivery, energy services, environmental services, distribution services, education and training services, professional services, computer and related services, and audiovisual and advertising services. ", "In general, the Doha Round negotiations were characterized by persistent differences among developed and developing countries on major issues in tariffs and nontariff barriers for goods, services, and agriculture. For example, developing countries (including emerging economic powerhouses such as China, Brazil, and India) sought the reduction of agriculture tariffs and subsidies among developed countries, nonreciprocal market access for manufacturing sectors, and protection for their services industries. In contrast, the United States, the EU, and other developed countries sought reciprocal trade liberalization, especially commercially meaningful access to advanced developing countries' industrial and services sectors, and some measure of protection for their agricultural sectors. The developed countries also sought to incorporate new issues that impact services, such as digital trade (data flows, cybertheft, and trade secrets) and global value chains. ", "The complexity of the services agenda and the number of players involved may have contributed to the lack of progress in the Doha Round negotiations. The term \"services\" includes a broad range of economic activities, many with few characteristics in common except that they are not goods. Exporters face different trade barriers across service sectors, making the formulation of trade rules a significant challenge. For example, licensing regulations are especially important to professional service providers, such as lawyers and medical professionals, while data transfer regulations are important to financial services providers. Furthermore, services negotiations include many participants from trade ministers to representatives of finance ministries and regulatory agencies, many of whom do not consider trade liberalization a primary part of their mission. Negotiators often found it difficult to formulate mechanisms that distinguish between government regulations that are purely protectionist and those that have legitimate purposes.

The negative list implies that a newly created or domestically provided service is automatically covered under the FTA, unless it is specifically listed as an exception in an annex to the agreement.

For example, a U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian-owned insurance company would be covered by the U.S.-South Korea FTA. The FTAs do allow one party to deny benefits to a provider located in the territory of another party, if that provider is owned or controlled by a person from a nonparty country and does not conduct substantial business in the territory of the other party, or if the party denying the benefits does not otherwise conduct normal economic relations with the nonparty country.

For example, regulatory heterogeneity can limit the access of professional service providers (e.g., architects, doctors, etc.) whose licenses or certifications may not be recognized in foreign markets.
