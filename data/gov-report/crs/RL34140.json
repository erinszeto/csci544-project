Circular A-76 is a policy and a process first initiated in 1966 that was designed to determine whether federal employees or private sector contractors are best to perform activities deemed commercial. A series of articles that first appeared in the Washington Post chronicled the dilapidated conditions and the substandard medical treatment afforded to returning veterans. Media reports surrounding the competition have suggested that one possible contributing factor to the Walter Reed controversy was the decision to privatize base support services.", "What caused the problems at Walter Reed? To what extent were the problems related to the A-76 competition? Did it go badly because A-76 is an inherently flawed policy, or was it a convergence of events? Should Congress draw any conclusions from the outcome of the Walter Reed competition for future competitions on military medical facilities? While it may be hard to draw conclusions of cause and effect, there may be lessons learned applicable to future competitions.", "Some have suggested that constrained Army resources, due to a convergence of events, may have caused and/or contributed to the problems in the competition and led to the attrition of skilled base support services staff. Other factors that may have affected the process were the entry of the United States into combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, a 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommendation for the consolidation of Army and Navy military medical services into a single tertiary hospital at the campus of the Bethesda Naval Hospital (effectively closing the Walter Reed campus), a surge in the number of outpatient medical care visits for veterans returning from the war, and the Army's push to achieve the Bush Administration's competitive sourcing goals.", "P.L. 110-181, the FY2008 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), includes several provisions that affect A-76 competitions. H.R. 5658, the House-passed version of the FY2009 NDAA, contains several new provisions which could impact the conduct of future competitions, including Section 321, which would limit the conduct of A-76 competitions to 540 days (about 18 months); Section 322, which would require the analysis and development of a single government-wide definition for the term \"inherently governmental function;\" and Section 325, which would temporarily suspend DOD A-76 competitions and prevent the conversion of civilian functions to performance by contractors.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC) was the subject of a controversy that called attention to several issues, including the policy and process governing the conduct of OMB Circular A-76 competitions, the state of the military health care system, and a planned Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) action. A series of articles that first appeared in the Washington Post chronicled the dilapidated conditions and substandard outpatient treatment given to some returning veterans. The articles were written by two Washington Post reporters who conducted a four-month investigation on the campus reportedly without the knowledge or permission of Army officials. Since their investigation, WRAMC was the subject of several investigations and congressional hearings. The investigations have focused primarily on the military health care system, yet another important element of this situation is the outcome of the U.S. Army's decision to conduct a public-private competition (or competition) for base support services under Circular A-76. Some media reports had suggested that one of the factors that may have caused or contributed to the substandard conditions, existing at some of the facilities at Walter Reed, was the push to privatize base support services.", "Competitive sourcing through managed competitions was a major initiative of the first-term Bush Administration's Presidential Management Agenda, and one of five government-wide initiatives to improve the management and performance of the federal government. In 2003, the Bush Administration revised the Circular as a recommendation of the Commercial Activities Panel. Army Vice Chief of Staff General Richard Cody testified that the Army accepted full responsibility for the substandard conditions and that being on the BRAC list did not give WRAMC priority for repairs or building replacement. Several Members of Congress introduced legislation to either cancel the WRAMC A-76 competition or prohibit the appropriation of funds for the conduct of future studies at military medical facilities. As a result of the issues raised at WRAMC, both private and public sectors have identified flaws in this competition specifically, as well as in the policies governing A-76.", "This report will examine the issues surrounding the WRAMC public-private competition conducted under OMB Circular A-76 and discuss some options that Congress may want to consider in its oversight role. The WRAMC competition raised questions that are likely to shape competitions for years to come; lessons learned may help Congress to determine whether A-76 cost-comparison studies are the most appropriate way to achieve costs savings and efficiencies in the activities of the federal government. Several legislative provisions in H.R. 4986 , the proposed FY2008 NDAA, would impact the conduct of future competitions.", "The Army has since announced its plan to cancel all its competitions at its medical facilities for 2007 and 2008. Prior to this decision, future competitions were already planned for various Army facilities, including Fort Detrick (Maryland), and the range of activities would have included base operations support, pharmacy, radiology, pathology and ambulance services, at Fort Detrick and other locations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is OMB Circular A-76?", "paragraphs": ["The OMB Circular A-76, first issued in 1966, defines federal policy for determining whether recurring commercial activities should be performed by the private sector or federal employees. In addition to the Circular, a companion piece of legislation called the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998 requires Federal agencies, on an annual basis, to prepare and submit inventories of their commercial activities performed by Federal employees to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "The Circular requires federal executive agencies to prepare annually lists of activities that are considered both commercial and inherently governmental. In general, commercial activities are subject to competition, while inherently governmental activities are not. The determination of how activities are classified ultimately depends on several factors. The Circular describes what makes activities inherently governmental.", "An inherently governmental activity is an activity that is so intimately related to the public interest as to mandate performance by government personnel. These activities require the exercise of substantial discretion in applying government authority and/or in making decisions for the government. Inherently governmental activities normally fall into two categories: the exercise of sovereign government authority or the establishment of procedures and processes related to the oversight of monetary transactions or entitlements. An inherently governmental activity involves: (1) binding the United States to take or not to take some action by contract, policy, regulation, authorization, order, or otherwise; (2) determining, protecting, and advancing economic, political, territorial, property, or other interests by military or diplomatic action, civil or criminal judicial proceedings, contract management, or otherwise; (3) significantly affecting the life, liberty, or property of private persons; or (4) exerting ultimate control over the acquisition, use, or disposition of United States property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), including establishing policies or procedures for the collection, control, or disbursement of appropriated and other federal funds.", "The Circular was revised in 2003 at the recommendation of a Commercial Activities Panel (CAP). CAP also recommended abolishing OMB Circular A-76 and replacing it with an \"integrated competition process\" based on a combining of elements of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and the A-76 Circular.", "In general, many federal employees and labor organizations believe that the A-76 process is unfairly slanted in favor of the private sector, while private sector contractors generally believe that government employees have an unfair advantage in A-76 competitions. For example, among some A-76 observers, the attrition of skilled personnel may be viewed differently. The National Treasury Employees' Union (NTEU) President Colleen Kelley blamed the exodus of key personnel at WRAMC to conditions which were \"a not-at-all surprising result of the federal contracting process that drives experienced federal employees from their jobs and seeks to replace them with unaccountable private contractors.\" However, another observer, President of the Professional Services Council (PSC) Stan Soloway stated that Walter Reed's deterioration reflected on WRAMC's poor management capability, and not the work of the contractor. The issues at WRAMC, he said, \"are resources and facility capability, long-standing problems that may have caused federal employees to leave in the first place.\" He points out that the contractor at WRAMC cannot be held accountable because it did not begin contract work until February 4, 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major New Developments", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 5658 , the House-passed version of the FY2009 National Defense Authorization bill, has a provision (Section 2721) that would halt the closure of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center and discontinue the construction at the National Naval Medical Center and Fort Belvoir, VA of replacement facilities (beyond the construction necessary to complete the foundations of the replacement facilities) until the Secretary of Defense certifies to the congressional defense committees that each of the conditions imposed has been satisfied, and a period of seven days has expired following the date on which the certification is received by the committees. Another provision in the bill (Section 325) would temporarily suspend the conduct of future DOD public-private competitions (regarding the conversion of functions performed by DOD civilians to performance by contractors) from the date of the enactment of the bill until September 30, 2011.", "S. 3001 , the Senate-proposed version of the FY2009 National Defense Authorization bill, has a provision (Section 1101) that requires DOD to develop a strategic human capital plan designed to improve the civilian acquisition workforce.

The bill contains several provisions that affect the conduct of future public-private competitions as described here.", "Section 322 requires that retirement costs be compared and that any potential retirement and health insurance benefits offered by potential contractors be comparable to current benefits. Section 323 amends 10 U.S.C. 2461 by not requiring DOD to automatically conduct a public-private competition under OMB Circular A-76, or any other provision of law, at the end of a performance period. Section 324 provides for the insourcing of certain new and contracted out functions, including Section 2463 which requires the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to prescribe guidelines and procedures to ensure that federal employees are considered to perform work currently performed by contractors; the provision also requires that special consideration be granted to certain activities, including those activities associated with the performance of inherently governmental functions. Section 325 limits the influence of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) over DOD's conduct of public-private competitions or direct conversions. Section 326 amends the definition of who is an \"interested party\" and grants bid protest rights to those employee representatives who are designated as the agent for the majority of affected employees. Section 3557 grants certain authority to the Comptroller General to expedite actions in protests of public-private competitions under Circular A-76, and grants other rights to interested parties. Section 327 amends the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act by requiring that a public-private competition be conducted (for executive agency functions performed by 10 or more agency civilian employees) before any activities may be converted to performance by contractors, with certain conditions.

The team is usually made up of managers and bargaining unit employees who have knowledge of the tasks to be performed. For that reason, and to insure that there is fairness in the competition, the rules call for a \"firewall\" that would prohibit all communication between members of the MEO and members serving on the Performance Work Statement (PWS) team.", "The MEO is comprised of a group of federal employees, and management's bid to perform the work. It represents a streamlined reorganization of personnel, fewer people doing the work. If the MEO wins a competition, it takes over the work of the existing government function. The MEO does not exist unless it wins the competition. When the MEO wins a competition, a letter of obligation implements the decision; when a contractor wins a competition, a contract is awarded.", "The A-76 policy establishes a minimum cost differential, meaning that no activities can be converted to or from performance by in-house federal employees to the private sector unless there is a minimal cost differential of $10 million or 10%. This means that in order to win the competition, the MEO is required to show a savings of at least $10 million or 10% over the private sector contractor's costs.

Progress on each initiative is charted using a red-yellow-green stoplight indicator called a \"scorecard\" with green as the highest score and red as the lowest score. OMB has implemented a progress management scorecard to communicate the PMA status of federal agencies. In 2003, the Bush Administration revised the OMB Circular to direct federal agencies to evaluate whether more jobs could be considered for competition.", "Reportedly, as of July 2006 the Army was coded \"red\" on the PMA. By the end of FY2009, the Army's goal is to study 77,873 positions for competition under A-76.

These forces were: the unexpected casualty load of the Iraq War; the \"contracting out requirements\" imposed by the A 76 program, which is administered by OMB, and dragged on for over five crucial years; and the decision to close Walter Reed pursuant to BRAC action. An action that was ratified by the Congress.", "The difficulties at Walter Reed were also acknowledged by President George W. Bush when he stated \"The problems at Walter Reed were caused by bureaucratic and administrative failures. The system failed you, and it failed our troops. And we're going to fix it.\" This A-76 competition may serve as an object lesson in what can happen when a federal agency fails to manage numerous conflicting and competing goals and objectives. Some have also surmised as to whether the culture of the Army caused and/or contributed to a failure to take appropriate action. Others have questioned whether the desire to reach the Bush Administration's competitive sourcing goals overrode other considerations. In light of these observations, there are at least three policy questions that Congress may want to consider, in the exercise of its oversight role over the conduct of future A-76 studies.", "Are the decisions made during the course of the WRAMC competition likely to shape future public-private competitions? Do problems uncovered during the WRAMC competition reveal problems inherent in the Circular A-76 policy itself? Are there fresh approaches, new options, or alternatives that Congress may want to consider as it evaluates the efficacy of the A-76 policy?"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In many ways, the WRAMC competition was unique and had characteristics unlike other A-76 studies. For example, the competition began under the second term of the Clinton Administration, ended under the second term of the Bush Administration, took over six years to complete, and was one of the longest DOD A-76 studies ever conducted. Three WRAMC base commanders (dual-hatted as hospital commanders) presided over Walter Reed during the course of the competition. The OMB Circular A-76 published before 2003 governed the conduct of the competition. The United States entered combat operations in Iraq in 2003. After 2003 a significantly higher number of injured troops were treated at WRAMC, a military base with aging and reportedly substandard facilities.", "Another contributing factor may have been the announcement of the base realignment. During the course of the competition, the 2005 Defense Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission voted unanimously to realign Walter Reed, agreeing with DOD that the facility be combined with the Naval Medical Center (NNMC) in Bethesda, Maryland. DOD planned to combine personnel and services of the two hospitals into a new facility called the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), a joint medical center that will provide care to members of all military services. The effect of this realignment action would be the closing of what is known as the Walter Reed campus.", "Perhaps another factor was the competition outcome. First, the Army ruled that the federal employees (known as the Most Efficient Organization, or MEO) had won the competition in a contest between the MEO and IAP Worldwide Services, a private sector contractor. Then protests were filed with GAO, while appeals were filed with the Army Audit Agency (AAA). Finally, the Army reversed its earlier decision and announced that IAP would be awarded the $120 million, five-year contract.", "DOD announced the IAP contract award on November 9, 2006. According to press reports, IAP, based in Cape Canaveral, had delivered ice to the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina and helped to maintain Afghanistan's air traffic control system. In 2006, reportedly the firm had $393 million in military contracts. IAP had worked at Walter Reed since 2003, providing housekeepers, computer analysts, and clerks under a Department of the Treasury contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Events in the WRAMC A-76 Competition", "paragraphs": ["In June 2000, the Army announced the competition for base operations support positions, including positions in information technology, clerical support, hospital services, and maintenance. In September 2000, the Army awarded a contract to Grant Thornton LLP, a private contractor, to assist the federal employees in developing a bid proposal. In August 2001, the Army provided Grant Thornton with the Performance Work Statement (PWS). In March 2003, the United States entered combat operations in Iraq.", "Between May and June 2003, the Army issued requests for bids from private sector contractors, and selected Johnson Controls World Services as the contractor to compete against the federal employees. During May 2003, OMB revised the A-76 Circular. Johnson Controls and the federal employees submitted proposals. The solicitation period closed in September 2003. During October 2003, DOD requested permission from OMB to use the pre-2003 Circular rules. In November 2003, OMB gave DOD the authority to extend the competition until September 30, 2004, which the DOD Competitive Sourcing Official gave as the projected completion date. By April 2004, the Army Audit Agency (AAA) independently reviewed and certified the MEO's bid proposal. In July 2004, the Army revised the solicitation, amended it for the 16 th time (resulting in about 1,500 changes) and revised the Performance Work Statement. By September 2004, bid proposals were received from the MEO and the contractor.

The private sector contractor's evaluated proposed price was $132,019,150, meaning that the government MEO won by a difference of $7,539,269.", "The competition was challenged by protests filed with GAO and appeals filed with the AAA. In March 2005, IAP Worldwide Services, Inc. acquired Johnson Controls and became the company of record. On May 13, 2005, the 2005 BRAC Commission announced its recommendation to realign Walter Reed. During June 2005, the AAA withdrew its certification of the MEO. In June 2005 the Army notified Congress that IAP will be awarded the contract. In August 2005, the AAA announced they could not reconstruct the basis to certify the MEO's bid proposal, and would request approval to cancel the A-76 competition. The Army denied their request.", "In January 2006, the AAA reversed its earlier decision, and declared IAP the winner. The revised government MEO evaluated proposal price for the competition was $140,490,286. IAP's revised evaluated proposal price was $133,028,548. This result meant that IAP would win the competition by $7,461,737. While in the first award decision, the government MEO's bid was $7 million less than that of IAP Worldwide Services, significant changes in the solicitation resulted in a recalculation of the bids by all parties. As a result, IAP's bid came in at $7 million lower than the MEO's bid.", "As a result, IAP was awarded a five-year, costs-plus contract valued at over $120 million. Immediately, Alan King, acting in what he believed to be his capacity as the Agency Tender Official (ATO) filed a protest with GAO on behalf of the MEO. Mr. King asked the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) to represent the MEO because it lacked both expertise and money. AFGE agreed to do so, but was unsuccessful. GAO dismissed Mr. King's protest.", "From June through August 2006, Congress took up legislation to block the implementation of IAP's contract award. The transition to IAP, originally projected for November 2006, was predicated by a series of events that were mandated by law. The Army had to give Congress at least 45 days notice of the pending reduction-in-force (RIF), and give WRAMC employees at least 60 days notice of a pending RIF.

They include (1) Lieutenant General Kevin Kiley, formerly the Army's Surgeon General, and the former head of MEDCOM and WRAMC Commander from 2002-2004; reportedly, he was relieved of command largely due to the publicity surrounding the conditions at Walter Reed; and (2) Major General George Weightman, the WRAMC Base Commander from August 2006 until relieved of command in March 2007.

In September 2006 Colonel Garabaldi wrote a three-page memorandum, through Major General Weightman, to Colonel Daryl Spencer, MEDCOM Assistant Chief of Staff for Resource Management, and requested approval and funding to fix the problems at Walter Reed. In this memorandum, Colonel Garabaldi stated:", "Since the Army initiated the A-76 competition in 2000, the current workload in the hospital and garrison missions has grown significantly in the past six years due to our need to care for an support Wounded Warriors from Operating Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and other outcomes of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). As a result, the Army performed the competition with dated workload data and expectations created before the GWOT began in 2001. Now in 2006, we need more personnel than the competition had anticipated.... As a direct result of the A-76 competition, its associated proposed RIF (reduction-in-force), and eventual Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) of WRAMC's Main Post, we face the critical issues of retaining skilled clinical personnel for the hospital and diverse professionals for the Garrison, while confronted with increased difficulties in hiring.... Due to the uncertainty associated with this issue, WRAMC continues to lose other highly qualified personnel.", "WRAMC established its garrison command in 2002 when the Army established the Installation Management Agency (IMA). Consequently the A-76 competition data in 2000 did not include other areas of the garrison command necessary to run a full service BASOPS (base operations support) organization. These include the Directorate Of Logistics (DOL) and Plans Analysis and Integration Office (PAIO); therefore, the final contractor submission did not include positions for them. Furthermore, MEDCOM did not approve any full-time equivalents for the Garrison DOL or PAIO functions anywhere in the Continuing Garrison Organization (CGO). Without favorable consideration of these requests, WRAMC Base Operations and patient care services are at risk of mission failure.", "Colonel Garabaldi's memorandum illustrated the challenges he faced in trying to manage the day-to-day operations at Walter Reed, while at the same time managing both the numerous responsibilities created by the BRAC decision and the surge in outpatient medical care treatments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competition Took over Six Years", "paragraphs": ["This competition took longer than most A-76 studies.

The DoD Competitive Sourcing Official is responsible for ensuring use of the previous Circular is limited to timely completion or cancellation of any initiative....\" However, the Army continued the WRAMC A-76 privatization review past September 30, 2004. Under the current Circular, DoD could not unilaterally change the terms of the waiver from OMB. While it could have asked OMB for an extension, it appears that DoD never submitted such a request. The WRAMC privatization review should have been cancelled when the deadline in the waiver had expired but the Army had failed to complete the WRAMC privatization review in a \"timely\" fashion.", "The excessive length of the WRAMC privatization review appears to be in violation of both DoD's own rules, which limit A-76 privatization reviews for multi-function activities to 48 months, and, more importantly, the Defense Appropriations Bill, which limits A-76 studies for multi-function activities to 30 months. As you might imagine, the Congress takes very seriously any violations of the Anti-Deficiency Act. The apparent failures of the Army to abide by the terms of the OMB waiver, its own rules, and the law, in conducting the WRAMC privatization review long past the established deadlines, are not mere technicalities. Deadlines for the completion of A-76 privatization reviews are established for a very good reason: such exercises generate significant costs and can undermine productivity. The longer A-76 privatization reviews continue, the higher their costs; and the higher their costs, the less likely that those A-76 privatization reviews will generate any actual savings.", "We appreciate that the Army understands very well the highly unusual circumstances surrounding the WRAMC A-76 privatization review as well as the strong arguments for its cancellation. After all, after the sixteenth solicitation to the solicitation was issued, one which included more than 1,500 changes, many of them involving significant increases in workload, the in-house bid was decertified.

Now, when a system, a medical center, is doing as well as that distinguished facility was in peacetime, and without the stress of a war-time engagement, you can miss some of that. But once you get the numbers that were forced into Walter Reed\u2014Jack Marsh mentioned 640; at the height, there were some 800 in the medical hold among outpatients\u2014then the cracks begin to show, the difficulties begin to come clear. For example, if you go to that number of outpatients in the whole facility, and the case worker staff stays at the same or even drops, well, then, cases are going to be unattended to, in terms of getting servicemembers to appointments and the like.", "JIM LEHRER: And why was the number of caseworkers not increased?", "TOGO WEST: Walter Reed had been placed on the black list. It had been through A-76.", "JIM LEHRER: What is that?", "TOGO WEST: The A-76 procedure is a procedure by which a facility evaluates whether it should take governmental assignments and convert them into private contractor assignments. It almost freezes any hiring until that process is completed. It was a long process. Once it was done, Walter Reed was down by as much as 37 percent among its most important caseworker, nursing, and the like functions.", "JIM LEHRER: In other words, the number of people available to do the work was going down while the number of patients was increasing, both of them dramatically, right?", "TOGO WEST: That's right. That's exactly right.", "Certain conclusions may be drawn from this competition. First, six years in the life of an A-76 competition is a long time, and the competition is not conducted in a vacuum. A lot can happen to change the course of events. Given the complexity of issues and the convergence of events, the decision to continue with the Walter Reed competition may have been unwise. The events show how difficult it is to conduct competitions when there are numerous competing interests and priorities. Neither BRAC nor the effect of combat operations were anticipated when the decision was made to conduct the Walter Reed A-76 competition. Either or both events could have been used as rationales for delaying or even cancelling the A-76 competitions.", "Second, federal agencies may be under increasing pressure to meet the numerical quotas of the Bush Administration's Presidential Management Agenda (PMA). According to the Army, the Department was reportedly required to review approximately 77,873 positions for competitive sourcing by the end of FY2009. How much of the decision not to cancel the competition was driven by the Army's desire to meet the PMA goals is unknown. One of the challenges facing federal agencies is how to conduct competitions when there are constrained resources. Given the constrained resources presented by combat operations and BRAC actions, the Army might have made the decision to cancel the competition but still fallen short of the numerical quotas.", "Third, it appears that if the A-76 policy is going to work effectively, it cannot be the used for every federal activity. Some have suggested that the Army's constrained resources was the reason why repairs were not made to the reportedly substandard facilities at WRAMC. Perhaps for some activities A-76 competitions are not appropriate, particularly for activities that affect military health care (including base operations support, maintenance, and repair). Some would argue that trash removal is not an inherently governmental activity; but for a medical setting, regular maintenance and repair of health care facilities may be critical to the morale of the patient. A case could be made that any activity that touches the military patient should be considered inherently governmental, including, for example, trash removal on a military health care facility.
