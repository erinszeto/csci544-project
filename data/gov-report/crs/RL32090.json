"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Impact on the Federal Budget", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) mid-session review of the budget, released in July, estimated that the federal budget deficit would total $455 billion in FY2003 and $475 billionin FY2004, assuming congressional enactment of the Administration program for FY2004. (6) WhiteHouse officials said that the requested additional appropriations of $87 billion for FY2004 wouldpush the deficit to about $525 billion for that year. (7) The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)updated budget baseline projected deficits of $401 billion in FY2003 and $480 billion in FY2004. (8) It is important to note that the CBO baseline for FY2003 included outlays from the April 2003wartime supplemental, and CBO projections for future years assumed growth with inflation inoverall discretionary spending. So, in effect, the CBO estimate of the FY2004 deficit alreadyassumed additional supplemental appropriations for military activities in Iraq and elsewhere roughlyequal to the amount provided in FY2003. (Reconstruction assistance for Iraq and Afghanistan,however, was more than three times as high in the FY2004 request as in FY2003.) (9)", "Administration officials argued that the economy can readily absorb additional federal borrowing entailed by the requested supplemental, particularly since the economy is still recoveringfrom recession. Using OMB economic projections, a deficit of $525 billion in FY2004 would totalequal 4.4% of gross domestic product -- less than the 5%-6% of GDP that the government borrowedin the mid-1980s. Congressional critics argued that funding for domestic programs, though not taxcuts, has been constrained; that borrowing 20%-25% of the overall federal budget is fiscallyirresponsible; and that continuing deficits will endanger the economy in the long term. ", "Others, including some Members of Congress, contended that, given Iraq's future oil revenue potential, reconstruction costs should be financed as loans rather than grants. In this way, they say,future loan repayments would be a source of revenue for the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Earlier Administration Statements about Costs", "paragraphs": ["In the months leading up to the war with Iraq, Administration officials were generally unwilling to provide long-term estimates either of the costs of a war or of subsequent post-war needs, sayingthat no final decision had been made to go to war and that costs could not be projected withsufficient accuracy. What little officials did say, however, became a matter of contention inCongress. In a September 9 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Senator Levin recalled thatformer White House economic advisor Larry Lindsey had said a year earlier that a conflict with Iraqcould cost $100-200 billion. (10) OtherAdministration officials, however, notably then-Budget DirectorMitch Daniels, immediately dismissed Lindsey's figures as ill-founded, and the press widely reportedAdministration estimates that costs would be in the range of $50 billion. (11) That figure provedreasonable for the war itself and for subsequent stability operations for the remainder of FY2003,but did not take account of later post-war costs.", "By March of this year, shortly before the White House submitted its FY2003 supplemental request, some legislators were complaining that the Administration was withholding cost projectionsso as not to weaken support for pending tax cut legislation. At one point, during the tax debate, theSenate approved an amendment to set aside $100 billion of the of the tax cut as a hedge againstunplanned war costs. Before the war began, several independent estimates of war costs and ofpost-war expenses were prepared, including assessments by the Congressional Budget Office, theHouse Budget Committee Democratic Staff, Yale economist William Nordhaus, the Center forStrategic and International Studies, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Several of theseindependent estimates projected considerably higher costs than the Administration was providing,mainly because the independent projections took account of post-war peacekeeping andreconstruction costs and, in some cases, costs of borrowing funds because the war added to thedeficit. For a list of major cost studies, see \"For Additional Reading,\" below.", "Estimates of reconstruction costs became a particular focus of attention in view of the Administration's request for $20 billion for Iraq. In a widely quoted statement last March, whenasked about long-term reconstruction costs in Iraq, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz saidthat ", "the oil revenues of that country could bring between 50 and 100 billion dollars over the course of the next two or three years. Now, there are a lot of claimson that money, but ... we're not dealing with Afghanistan that's a permanent ward of theinternational community. We are dealing with a country that can really finance its ownreconstruction and relatively soon. (12)", "More recently, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld acknowledged that the U.S. government underestimated Iraq reconstruction costs, saying,", "The infrastructure of that country was not terribly damaged by the war at all. It was damaged by 30 years of Saddam Hussein, with a Stalinist-likeeconomy, denying the people of that country the money and the funds and the resources and theinvestments that they could have had.... Now ... did we underestimate something? Yes. I don't thinkpeople really fully understood how devastating that regime was to the infrastructure of the country;how fragile the electric system is, how poorly the water's being managed, and how -- the extent towhich the people are being denied. (13)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Current Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Leaving aside the politically contentious issue of past cost estimates, many questions remain about the accuracy of the most recent military and reconstruction cost projections. On the militaryside, officials have said that they do not believe there will be any need for more U.S. troops in Iraq,first, because the security situation in the country is generally good except in areas, like the \"Sunnitriangle,\" where diehard opposition is concentrated; second, because rapid progress is being madein organizing Iraqi security forces which, the Administration expects, will take up most of theburden; (14) and, third, because of expectedcontributions of forces from other nations. Cost projectionsjustifying the supplemental request assume that current force levels and the current pace ofoperations will be maintained for the next year. Whether that is sufficient, however, depends firstof all on whether the security situation is improving, as Administration officials insist, or gettingworse, as others argue. ", "There have also been some questions about specific elements of the Defense Department's supplemental funding request. In a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee on September24, Senator Harkin questioned whether several requested projects were war-related emergencies thatrequire immediate funding, including $293 million for various military construction projects, $329million for R&D projects, and $345 million for base camp housing. Others have raised the oppositequestion: whether the DOD request understates costs by leaving for the future projects which willlater need funding. One particular issue is that the request includes relatively little money for\"reconstituting\" or -- in the new DOD vernacular \"resetting\" -- Army forces. The Army estimatesthat several billion dollars will be required to refill stocks of prepositioned materiel and repairequipment to pre-war standards, but the request does not finance these measures.", "In addition, as a recent Congressional Budget Office assessment concluded, it is questionable whether the current force level can be maintained without further extending reserve tours and,perhaps, mobilizing even more reserves, either of which might undermine reserve personnelretention. (15) Several Members of Congress haveproposed increasing the size of the Army to easepressures on the force, though CBO cautions that this would take up to five years to implement andwould subsequently cost $9-10 billion per year. ", "On the reconstruction side, officials acknowledge that they originally underestimated significantly the weakness of Iraq's infrastructure and overestimated potential short-term Iraqi oilrevenues. Even now, however, different officials project somewhat different upper estimates oflikely reconstruction costs. Moreover, how much multilateral donors will contribute to cover thecurrent reconstruction financing gap ($50 to 75 billion, minus the $20 billion supplemental andperhaps $5 to $6 billion per year from Iraqi oil revenues beginning in 2005) is highly unclear. Undersecretary of State Larson told the Senate Banking Committee on September 16 that, while theAdministration believed that bilateral donors and international financial institutions should \"makea maximum effort to pay their share,\" he was not in a position to provide a specific figure until betterestimates of reconstruction costs are available. With the Madrid donor conference scheduled forOctober 23-24, U.N. officials estimate that about $2 billion for Iraq will be pledged for 2004. (16) Ontop of this amount, the World Bank plans to recommend to its governing board $1 billion inconcessional and market rate loans to Iraq through June 30, 2005.

Some legislators, however, including somesupporters of Iraqi regime change, have said that the United States should expect to be involved forfive years or more. Recently Lt. Gen. Carlos Sanchez, who commands U.S. and allied forces in Iraq,said \"it's going to be a few years\" before the United States can withdraw from Iraq. (18) How long U.S.forces will stay is the main factor affecting long-term estimates of costs.

The first would have created an Iraq ReconstructionFinance Authority that would use future Iraq oil revenues to secure financing for reconstructionprojects. Senator Dorgan argued that the Iraq Governing Council had sufficient authority to createsuch a facility and to raise money that could reduce the size of proposed U.S. expenditures. SenatorDorgan subsequently reintroduced the amendment for Senate floor debate, at which time the Senatetabled the proposal 57-39. The second Dorgan amendment considered during Committee markupwould have converted the reconstruction package from grants to loans. Opponents of the Dorganamendments maintained that adding to Iraq's already sizable debt obligations would enormouslycomplicate the difficult task of stabilizing the economy. Also tabled during markup (15-14) was aproposal by Senator Harkin that would have reduced reconstruction funds to $10 billion and delayedsubmission of additional requests until the President had reported on contributions made by otherdonors and submitted a detailed reconstruction plan.", "For other matters concerning the global war on terrorism, S. 1689 , as reported, approved the President's request for a $100 million emergency fund for complex foreign crises.

On October 17, over strong White House objections, theSenate adopted (51-47) an amendment ( S.Amdt. 1871 ) by Senators Bayh, Ben Nelson,and others to provide $10 billion as loans. Should international creditors subsequently agree tocancel 90% of Iraq's debt, the President could convert the loans into grants. ", "Other proposals, however, were either defeated or not offered. Earlier in the debate, there was substantial discussion of an amendment introduced by Senator Hutchison and others( S.Amdt. 1798 ) requiring that the Secretary of the Treasury negotiate with the WorldBank and member nations of the Bank to create within World Bank an Iraq Reconstruction TrustFund. Under the terms of the Hutchison amendment, the Fund would be governed by a Board ofTrustees made up of a U.S. official and five others representing the top country contributors to theTrust Fund. The Board would use Trust Fund contributions to extend loans and loan guarantees forprojects advancing economic development in Iraq.

DOD and OMB backup material on the request notes that the number ofArmy combat divisions in Iraq will be reduced, but this will not substantially affectthe total number of personnel deployed in Southwest Asia and nearby areas insupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (inAfghanistan).", "The requested is based, second, on the use of a model for estimating costs of military operations know as the \"Contingency Operations Support Tool\" (COST). The COST model was developed by the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) in thelate 1990s under a contract from the Department of Defense Comptroller followingproblems the Defense Department had in accurately projecting costs of operations inthe mid-1990s. Using inputs of data about the duration of an operation, the numberand original location of units to be deployed, means of transportation both to deployand to sustain forces, and unique expenses, and relying on historical cost factorsbased on earlier operations, the model can provide quite detailed breakdowns ofprojected costs in advance of an operation.", "Although these projections are not technically considered \"budget quality\" data for purposes of making congressional requests, the estimates resulting from themodel appear to be the most reliable available advance projections of costs of anoperation, though actual expenses may differ as operations unfold. One question forCongress may be why the Defense Department is using COST model data now, butdid not choose to provide COST model figures to Congress last spring in advance ofthe war. An answer may be the Defense Department did not feel in a position toprovide an estimate of war costs until a final decision was made to go to war, and thesize and composition of the force remained in flux until very shortly before the warbegan. DOD's new cost estimates appear to be substantially higher, on a per troopbasis, than recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["An ongoing issue between the Administration and Congress -- particularly the appropriations committees -- has been how much flexibility the Defense Departmentneeds to reallocate funds after they are appropriated.

Congress agreed to provide $15.7 billion inthe fund, some of which was subject to additional ceilings on expenditures. In thenew request, the Defense Department asked for $2.0 billion to be appropriated intothe Iraq Freedom Fund, while the rest is requested in regular appropriations accounts. The Iraq Freedom Fund amount is, in effect, a contingency fund, that DOD says itwill use either to support a multinational division or, if allied forces are not available,to deploy two Army National Guard Enhanced Separate Brigades and one MarineExpeditionary Force. (21)", "The Defense Department also requested authority to transfer $5 billion between appropriations accounts provided that \"the Secretary shall notify the Congresspromptly of each transfer made pursuant to this authority.\" According to DOD,\"promptly\" means that the Secretary will inform Congress within five days after suchtransfers. This money, therefore, would not be subject to normal limitations on\"transfers\" -- or, in DOD parlance \"reprogramming\" of funds -- in which transfersabove certain thresholds require advance approval of congressional defensecommittees. In addition, in another proposed general provision, the DefenseDepartment has requested that $500 million of the amounts appropriated be availablefor a contingency construction account for military construction projects that are nototherwise authorized by law.

After that, DOD requested that itbe permitted instead to provide $225 per month in additional Hardship Duty Pay topersonnel serving \"in a combat zone\" in Operation Iraqi Freedom and OperationEnduring Freedom. DOD argues that this would equalize pay between troopsdeployed in combat zones; troops with dependents now receive more because of theFamily Separation Allowance.

The measure also requiresa co-payment of 28% of the value of the plan, on the model of the federalgovernment's FEHBP insurance plan for civilian employees.

The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) under theadministration of Ambassador L. Paul Bremer is responsible for the formulation andimplementation of this effort. ", "The CPA has initiated a process intended to lead to Iraqi self-rule. It has appointed a 25-member Iraqi Governing Council and provided it with specificpowers and duties, including the choosing of a cabinet to serve as ministers under thesupervision of CPA advisors and the responsibility to set in motion formulation ofa national constitution. It has encouraged establishment of councils in villages andcities throughout the country to run local affairs and identify community needs. WithCPA funding and encouragement, institutions of civil and economic society havebeen reconstituted. Schools, including universities, hospitals and health clinics, arefunctioning. The oil-for-food program continues to provide basic foodstuffs. Newpolice and security forces are being trained. Programs to renovate and repair electricpower, water, oil production, roads and bridges, airports, and the seaport have beenlaunched. Jobs programs have been instituted to help stimulate the economy andlessen unemployment. ", "Although much has been accomplished since the U.S. occupation began in April, the occupation authority in the view of many has failed to successfullyreestablish order and security, restore infrastructure, and introduce political andeconomic reform, including Iraqi self-governance, in a timely manner. Theseproblems are interlinked; the successful conduct of much reconstruction work iscontingent on an environment of order and stability, and the lack of visible progressin restoring basic infrastructure and institutions of security opens the door to politicaldiscontent and opposition. The $20.3 billion supplemental request apparently soughtto address those infrastructure and security needs on which other U.S. objectives inIraq hinge.", "Until recently, the Administration had suggested that the cost of reconstruction through the end of 2003 could largely be met by Iraqi and already previouslyappropriated U.S. resources. A national budget for Iraq covering the rest of the year,announced by the CPA on July 7, estimated expenditures of $6.1 billion and thecreation of a Central bank currency reserve of $2.1 billion, for a total budget of $8.2billion. New oil revenue, taxes, and profits from state owned enterprises would makeup $3.9 billion of these costs, according to the CPA's analysis. The remaining deficitof $4.3 billion would be covered by recently frozen and seized assets ($2.5 billion),the Development Fund for Iraq ($1.2 billion), and $3 billion in already appropriatedU.S. assistance. Iraq was projected to have $1.1 billion remaining for reconstructionby end of December 2003. (25)", "The Administration request suggested that a re-assessment of Iraq's immediate reconstruction needs demanded greater outlays of revenue than projected in July. Italso suggested that presumed sources of additional revenue in the coming year -- chiefly, oil export production and international donor contributions -- might not beas large as originally anticipated. In any case, the result was a supplementalreconstruction request nearly 20% larger than the size of the entire national budgetfor Iraq projected on an annualized basis in early July. (26)", "Issues.", "Total Iraq Reconstruction Needs. The supplemental request was intended to meet only the most important, immediate needsin Iraq in the 2004 fiscal year. Up to that point, the cost of Iraq reconstruction wasbased on speculation and educated guesswork. However, as part of the lead-in to aninternational donors conference held in Madrid on October 24, the World Bank andthe U.N. Development Program released a needs assessment they conducted of 14Iraqi economic and social sectors. (27) The resultingBank/UNDP estimates haveestablished targets by which the adequacy of available resources will be judged. TheBank/UNDP assessments put the cost of reconstruction for the 14 sectors at $36billion over four years, a figure that does not include $19.4 billion estimated by theCPA for security, oil, and other critical sectors not covered by the Bankassessments. (28) Total Bank/CPA projectedreconstruction costs through 2007 amountto $55 billion, $17.5 billion in 2004 alone. If Iraqi oil revenues are not sufficient tomeet the projected needs -- which appears likely in the near term by most accounts -- and other international donors do not pledge significant contributions, the UnitedStates may face increased financial demands, if it seeks to meet projected Iraqi needs.", "The new needs assessment points out another possible concern. The Bank/UNDP report suggests that Iraq cannot absorb more than $6 billion ininfrastructure program commitments (excluding oil) in 2004, in view of the unstablesecurity situation and the time it takes to plan and implement contracts. (29) TheAdministration request for infrastructure (excluding oil) was $12.4 billion. Inresponse to this point, OMB has reportedly confirmed that the reconstruction requestis intended to cover 18 months. (30) That theAdministration request in categories suchas electric power and water composes half or more of requirements projected by theWorld Bank assessment over a four-year period, however, suggests that the requestmay meet needs beyond even 18 months. ", "Iraqi Oil Revenues and Financing Reconstruction. Until recently, the Administration hadexpected most costs of reconstruction to be borne by Iraq through receipts from itsoil exports. While the decrepit state of oil production infrastructure and recurrentsabotage to pipelines and facilities have forced experts to downgrade expectationsof potential exports and receipts, any sustained increase in production will assist thereconstruction effort. Current rates of production are nearing 2 million barrels a day,but Iraqis do not expect to reach the prewar level of 2.8 million barrels until spring. After subtracting 0.5 million barrels/day for domestic consumption, a level of 2.3million might generate between $18.5 billion and $23 billion annually, depending onthe price of oil. Production levels of 6 million/day, possible within a decade, wouldrequire significant investment outlays. (31) In thenear term, Administration officialssaid that their budget calculations assume an average production of 2 million barrelsper day over the next 12 months, generating about $12 billion in revenues that willroughly cover government operating expenses, but not the type of urgentreconstruction needs identified in the supplemental request. (32)", "Roughly $503 million has already been allocated from the 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental for repair of oil facilities and restoration of production anddistribution systems. The Administration request for these purposes under theFY2004 supplemental was $2.1 billion. Additional sums for Iraqi security forceswere in part intended to create an Iraqi force to defend against pipeline and other oilfacility sabotage.", "Loans vs. Grants for Reconstruction. Closely related to the issue of Iraqi oil revenues as a means of financingreconstruction projects was the question of whether assistance could be extended ona loan rather than grant basis. Some argued that, given the substantial amount of oilrevenues that Iraq will generate at some point in the future, Baghdad will have themeans to service debt incurred for the purpose of rebuilding its infrastructure. Loans,either extended bilaterally or through some sort of trust fund, possibly managed bythe World Bank, would be repaid at some point, thereby reducing reconstructioncosts to the United States, they said.", "The Administration, which proposed that the entire $20.3 billion supplemental be offered as grants, argued repeatedly during congressional hearings against addingto Iraq's already substantial debt obligations. Witnesses asserted that Iraq owesroughly $200 billion in pre-war debts, reparations, and other claims. G7 leadersagreed informally at the June 2003 summit to suspend through 2004 the requirementfor Iraq to service any existing debt, giving time to construct some sort of multilateraldebt restructuring arrangement. (33) Further, U.N.Security Council Resolution 1483states that Iraqi oil exports or proceeds could not be attached by creditors through2007 unless authorized by the Council.", "Beyond the matter of whether Iraq should incur more debt obligations in the near term is the question over who could legally assume responsibility for newsovereign debt. Although it is possible that the World Bank could manage an Iraqreconstruction trust fund that would receive contributions from international donors,if the Bank were to use these resources for project lending, it would almost certainlyrequire, as it has in the past, that some sort of sovereign Iraq authority assume thedebt obligation. Until such time that legal authority is transferred to Iraqi hands, theCoalition Provisional Authority is the temporary government of Iraq and would bethe one signing for the loans. Most legal scholars take the position that an occupyingpower has no authority to incur new debts on behalf of the displaced sovereign. (34) Some contend, however, that there is an exception in which a new government wouldbe responsible for the debt if it can be shown that the loans were required for thewelfare of the occupied territory and the terms were fair and reasonable. (35)", "Also, while loan reconstruction assistance would likely require smaller appropriations than grant aid, some congressional appropriation would be necessary. Under the 1990 Credit Reform Act, Congress must provide a subsidy appropriationin advance of the U.S. government extending direct loans or loan guarantees. Thesize of the subsidy appropriation is based on several factors, including any subsidyvalue of the loan terms and the likelihood that the loan will be repaid fully and ontime. Given the current state of the Iraqi economy and the high degree of uncertaintyover when the debt service payments could begin, the necessary subsidyappropriation likely would be quite large.", "As discussed in more detail above under \"Congressional Action,\" this issue was closely examined by lawmakers. The Senate adopted (51-47) an amendment bySenators Bayh, Ben Nelson, and others on October 16 converting $10 billion ofreconstruction grants to loans, which could be later restored as grants if foreigncreditors cancel 90% of Iraq's debt. Conferees, however, rejected the Senateproposal on a 13-16 vote.", "Earlier, Senator Dorgan had offered amendments in committee markup and on the Senate floor (tabled in both venues) that would have created an authority to useIraqi oil to secure reconstruction financing and convert U.S. grants to loans. Asimilar amendment by Senator Landrieu was also rejected. Senator Hutchison andothers submitted an amendment that did not come up for floor debate directing $10billion of the total reconstruction supplemental to a Trust Fund, to be establishedwithin the World Bank, out of which loans and loan guarantees would be made. ", "On the House side, Representative Wamp proposed but later withdrew an amendment during Committee markup that would have withheld one-half of Iraqfunds until after the election of a new Iraqi leader, at which time the remainingmoney would be available in the form of a loan. Representative Obey offered anamendment (defeated 25-36) that, among other things, would have transferred about$7 billion of reconstruction funds to a World Bank-administered loan facility. Afurther amendment by Representative Obey regarding a shift of grants to loans wasdefeated in the House 200-226.", "The Supplemental's Impact on Other Donors. Many, including Administration officials, believedthat congressional action on the supplemental could influence the contributions ofinternational donors at the late-October donors' conference. Some argued that a largepledge of U.S. aid prior to the conference might stimulate other donors to contributemore; diminution of the Administration plan, they argued, might have the oppositeeffect. Opponents of making U.S. aid for reconstruction in the form of loans alsocontended that other donors might follow the American lead and offer loans ratherthan grants, adding further to Iraq's debt problems. In addition, the supplementaltargeted sectors -- infrastructure and security -- that other donors would be lesslikely to support themselves. In similar \"nation-building\" exercises elsewhere,donors have tended to funnel contributions to the social sectors, such as educationand health, and grassroots democratization and economic development, all areasrelatively untouched by the supplemental. ", "Perhaps a more important factor in other donor calculations was the extent to which they would have a say in the use of funds. Up to then, donors had beenreluctant to provide assistance because they were wary of being perceived assupporting a unilateral U.S. policy. In response to this concern, donors discussed ata September 6 meeting in Brussels, the concept of creating Iraq reconstruction trustfunds, managed by the U.N. or World Bank, which would accept and distributecontributions. Control over how the money was spent, according to Undersecretaryof State Alan Larson who represented the U.S. at the September 6 meetings, wouldbe handled by some sort of a multilateral management board that might includeofficials from international organizations, major donors, and Iraqis representinginterim ministries. (36) The Madrid donors'conference created two trust funds, onemanaged by the World Bank and the other by UNDP.", "Management of Iraq Reconstruction Funds by U.S. Agencies. Administrative control over Iraq reconstructionfunds became a significant issue during congressional debate on the $2.475 billionappropriation in P.L. 108-11 . At that time, most had expected that transfers forreconstruction and post-conflict aid would be made to USAID, the State Department,and other traditional foreign assistance management agencies. But with plans for theDefense Department to oversee the governing of Iraq immediately after the end ofhostilities, the White House wanted to maintain maximum flexibility over thedistribution of resources so the President could transfer some or all of the funding toDOD. The proposal stimulated immediate controversy with a number of critics,including Members of Congress, arguing that aid programs should remain under thepolicy direction of the State Department and under the authorities of a broad andlongstanding body of foreign aid laws. Although initial House and Senate decisionswould have blocked Administration efforts to place control of reconstruction fundswith the Pentagon, ultimately Congress agreed to allow the White House to allocatethe resources among five agencies, including DOD. Funds for the Iraq Relief andReconstruction Fund appropriated in P.L. 108-11 have been managed by L. PaulBremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), and the U.S. civilianadministrator in Iraq, who reports to the Secretary of Defense.", "The Administration proposed that the entire $20.3 billion be placed in the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, as was the case with the previous supplemental, andto continue Ambassador Bremer and the CPA's role as administrators of the Fundunder DOD guidance. Since submission of the supplemental, however, the WhiteHouse announced the establishment of a new \"Iraq Stabilization Group,\"headed byNational Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice. The Group is intended to help speedup reconstruction efforts by identifying and resolving problems that had in somecases been the source of decision-making disputes in Washington. Some analystsbelieve that the move is also intended to allow the State Department a greater voicein reconstruction policy. At the same time, the State Department staff serving underthe CPA in Iraq is expected to grow from 55 to about 110. Nevertheless,Ambassador Bremer will continue to report to the Secretary of Defense. (37)", "As noted above, the Senate tabled (56-42) an amendment by Senators Leahy and Daschle ( S.Amdt. 1803 ) that would have placed the CPA under thedirect authority and foreign policy guidance of the Secretary of State. The House bill,however, added a provision barring the coordination of defense or reconstructionactivities in Iraq or Afghanistan by a U.S. government officer who is not subject toconfirmation by the Senate. The House Committee wanted to ensure that whoeveris in charge of coordination be available to testify at congressional oversighthearings. This proposal appeared to block the initiative of placing National SecurityCouncil Advisor Rice, who is not subject to confirmation and who does not testifybefore Congress, in charge of coordinating reconstruction. The White House,however, contended that the new Iraq Stabilization Group does not affect control of reconstruction efforts and that the job remains under control of the DefenseDepartment. (38) Conferees, however, decided todelete this House-added provisionfrom the enacted legislation.", "Reconstruction Priorities and Costs. The Administration said that the request included only the most pressing, immediateneeds for Iraq in FY2004. However, the relative importance of certain items detailedin the request -- 're-engineering of postal service business practices' andconstruction of seven residential communities, for example -- was closelyquestioned in Congress. Further, the costs associated with reconstruction requestshave been subject to skepticism, with some congressional staff reportedly suggestingthat the price tag was intentionally inflated so that the Administration would not haveto return to Congress to ask for more funds in 2004. (39)", "As mentioned above in the Congressional Action section, the House bill proposed a $1.655 billion cut in Iraq reconstruction funding, reducing or eliminatingresources for a wide range of activities that the House found to be un-executable, lowpriority, or likely to receive funding from other international donors. The Senateadopted an amendment by Senators Dorgan and Wyden reducing Iraq reconstructionby $1.855 billion. The Senate cuts were identical to those approved by the House,with an additional reduction of $200 million for oil infrastructure rehabilitation. Theconference agreement closely follows the reductions proposed in both House andSenate bills, including the Senate's cut of $200 million for emergency supplies ofrefined oil petroleum products. While the enacted legislation provides $18.649billion for the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund - $1.655 billion less thanrequested - the bill further transfers $210 million from the Fund to assistance forJordan, Liberia, and Sudan.

(40) Key features of the $799million in new appropriations included targeting projects intended to have the mostimmediate impact on the lives of the Afghan population, such as", "$402 million for security, with funding included to train and support police, border patrol, the military and counter-narcotics forces, disarmamentand de-mobilization programs, and courthouse construction inKabul;", "$129 million to reinforce the authority of the government of Afghanistan with budget support for high priority projects, technical experts placedin Afghan ministries, and voter registration and electionsupport;", "$105 million for completion of the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat major highway, a program jointly financed by the United States, Japan, and SaudiArabia; and", "$163 million for social programs and critical infrastructure, including education, health, and local projects.", "An additional $390 million would be made available from reallocated, prior-year funds, but the Administration did not specify how they would be used. The WhiteHouse further asked that the $300 million limit on military drawdowns from DODstocks enacted in the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-327 ) beincreased to $600 million.", " Table 6. Afghanistan Supplemental: Sector Allocation ($ in millions)", "a. House bill and conference agreement included funding for Experts and Policy within the category for Elections and Improved Governance.", "b. Total does not include $61 million provided by the Senate for a USAID interim facility in Kabul, $44 million provided in the House bill for an annex to the U.S.embassy in Kabul, or $56.6 million provided in the conference agreement for USAIDoperating expenses in Afghanistan, a USAID interim facility in Kabul, and theUSAID Inspector General.", "As demonstrated in Table 6, the enacted legislation increased the overall reconstruction funding from new appropriations by $365 million with significantchanges over the Administration's request in allocations for infrastructure(particularly power generation and road construction), governance, and socialservices. Of note, the conference agreement includes an earmark of $60 million fromthe ESF for women's programs, including technical and vocational education,programs for women and girls against sexual abuse and trafficking, shelters forwomen and girls, humanitarian assistance for widows, support of women-led NGOs,and programs for and training on women's rights.", "The conference agreement also amends the authorization levels in the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-327 ) to be consistent with thelevels of funding provided in the FY04 Supplemental and H.R. 2800 .", "Background. Since the beginning of post-conflict aid in late 2001, U.S. assistance has focused on three broad areas:security, governance, and reconstruction.", "Security. Much of the U.S. program for Afghanistan is intended to establish security institutions to bolster the authorityof the central government and prevent the regrouping of the Taliban or Al Qaeda. The pillars of this effort are (1) the presence of an International Security AssistanceForce (ISAF);(2) the establishment and training of an Afghan National Army; (3) thedemobilization of private militias; and (4) the formation of \"ProvincialReconstruction Teams\" (PRTs).", "Despite their defeat, Taliban groups reportedly continue to operate in Afghanistan, mostly in the southeast, targeting U.S. and Afghan forces and creatinga perception of continuing insecurity. Factional in-fighting and increased criminalactivity have also undermined humanitarian operations. In some cases, whereinternational operations have been directly targeted, this has led to the temporarysuspension of U.N. missions or withdrawal of aid agencies from certain areas. ", "In mid-December 2002, the Defense Department said it would work to create secure conditions for aid workers by forming eight \"Provincial ReconstructionTeams\" (PRTs) composed of about 60 U.S. forces plus Defense Department civilaffairs officers, representatives of U.S. aid and other agencies, and allied and someAfghan personnel. The objective of the PRTs is to provide safe havens forinternational aid workers, to help with reconstruction, and to extend the writ of theKabul government throughout Afghanistan. PRTs, each with about 60 U.S. militarypersonnel, have begun operations at Gardez, Bamiyan, Konduz, and Mazar-e-Sharif. The PRT in Mazar-e-Sharif is led by Britain and the one in Bamiyon is led by NewZealand. Reportedly, the United States might be considering increasing the PRTprogram to 16 such enclaves in which Germany and others may take a leadershiprole. Some report the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are helping thesecurity situation in their deployed areas, but other reports dispute their effectiveness.", "Governance and Institution Building. A conference in Bonn in December 2001, held as the Taliban regime was falling inthe U.S.-led war, the pro-U.S. Pashtun leader Hamid Karzai was selected chairmanof the interim administration and the loya jirga, held during June 11 - 19, 2002, selected him to continue to lead Afghanistan until national elections are heldsometime in 2004. ", "The loya jirga adjourned without establishing a new parliament. The scope and powers of such a body might be dependent on the outcome of a \"constitutional loyajirga,\" which is expected to fashion a permanent governing structure in a newconstitution. This assembly was to be held in October 2003, but it has now been putoff until December 2003. However, the draft constitution was made public onNovember 3, 2003. Observers say that preparations for the 2004 elections have alsofallen behind and that the elections might be delayed beyond the planned June 2004time frame, although the United Nations and the Afghan government have begun aprogram to register voters. ", "Concerns remain about the power of regional leaders and their relative independence from central government authority, although Karzai has moved sinceMay 2003 to bolster his authority in Kabul by shuffling or firing some local leaders.In the runup to the planned 2004 Afghan national elections, the United States plansto try to bolster the efficiency and effectiveness of the Kabul government by placingabout 120 U.S. officials as advisers to various Afghan ministries.", "Reconstruction. The international recovery and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan is immense and complicated,involving the Afghan government, numerous U.N. agencies, bilateral donors, manyinternational organizations, and countless non-governmental organizations (NGOs).Intended outcomes of the reconstruction process identified by the internationalcommunity and the Afghan government include political stability and security, accessto basic services, an adequate standard of living for the Afghan people, economicgrowth, and, in the long term, independence from foreign aid.", "According to many observers, successful reconstruction will stopdisillusionment with the new system in Afghanistan and will keep Afghanistan fromagain becoming a haven for terrorists. Programs intended to yield benefits within ashort time frame (four to six months) initiated the transition from the humanitarianrelief phase to programs targeted toward reconstruction. These so-called \"quickimpact\" programs were followed by more long-term programs in education, health,poppy eradication, and other areas. Numerous small-scale and some largelonger-term projects, mostly for road reconstruction, are currently underway. ", " Table 7. U.S. Assistance to Afghanistan ($s - billions)", "Issues.", "Reconstruction Priorities and Progress. According to some observers, Afghans have become frustrated with what theyperceive to be a lack of progress on reconstruction. (41) Many factors may be slowingthe reconstruction effort: lack of security, lack of human and physical capacity toimplement substantial reconstruction, funding shortages, and funding predominatelygoing towards the continuing humanitarian crisis and towards the administrativecosts of the international donor community. Analysts agree that both enhancedsecurity and progress on reconstruction are necessary in order to sustain internationaldonor involvement in Afghan reconstruction, encourage private investment inAfghanistan, and maintain Afghans' hope for improvement in their country and theirown lives. ", "Effective reconstruction assistance, according to USAID, could reduce the war and drug economies and provide incentives for beneficial economic growth, such asgovernment capacity building, employment generation, and agriculturalrehabilitation. Other reconstruction initiatives include road construction, urbanreconstruction, infrastructure repair, energy development, and programs for women,education, health, and the media. The strength and influence of the centralgovernment is viewed as a key factor in the success of the intervention and assistanceon the part of the international community.", "Impact of Efforts to Accelerate Reconstruction. The international community and theAfghan government are now seeking to increase the pace of reconstruction. Ifprogress on security, road construction, and reconstruction efforts are made inadvance of the 2004 elections, it could increase the chances of the success ofmoderates in those elections. Supporters argue that additional funding could alsohave an impact on decisions by the international donor community, possibly resultingin larger contributions. It could also help efforts now being discussed to expand theInternational Security Assistance Force (ISAF), which is currently limited to Kabul.", "Increased funding may also have negative effects. There are concerns that more money could add to the already high levels of corruption. Some experts areconcerned about absorption capacity and whether additional funds can be allocatedquickly and effectively. If progress is not achieved, the increase may be seen aslargely symbolic and ineffective. Others have raised the possibility that the UnitedStates will be perceived as giving too much support to the Karzai government inadvance of the elections next spring.", "Other Donors. So far, the international community has continued to provide significant amounts of aid and resources for thereconstruction effort, although Afghanistan officials have reportedly complainedabout the slow pace at which pledged funds were being paid. Among examples ofother reconstruction efforts by other countries, Italy is providing advice on judicialreform and Germany is helping establish a national police force. The United States,Japan, and Saudi Arabia are financing the building of the Kabul-Kandahar-Herathighway. ", "Some experts consider a long-term commitment will be necessary to ensure a stable, democratic Afghanistan emerges. The outcome of the international donorsconference in January 2002 and of other donor conferences since then indicate awillingness on the part of the international community to assist in the restoration ofAfghanistan. However, in a preliminary needs assessment presented in January 2002by UNDP, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, reconstruction costswere estimated to be more than $15 billion over the next decade. (42) United Nationsand Afghan government officials have since reportedly said $15 billion will beneeded over 5 years. (43) Amounts pledged andcommitted to date fall well below theseestimates. With the estimates on the significant cost of Iraq reconstruction nowemerging, some are concerned that international donors might shift their focus to Iraqreconstruction, and lose interest or run too low on resources to continue to participatein Afghan reconstruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Global War on Terrorism Foreign Policy Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The supplemental proposal also included $201 million for four other foreign policy initiatives labeled by the Administration as \"Other Global War onTerrorism\"programs:", "$50 million for terrorist rewards for information leading to the capture or killing of Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden,", "$11 million for additional diplomaticsecurity,", "$40 million for USAID facilities, operations, and security inIraq and Afghanistan, and", "$100 million for an Emergency Fund for Complex ForeignCrises", "Congress has considered a request to create a foreign policy contingency fund twice this year as part of the regular FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriations and theFY2003 Iraq war supplemental. For many years, Administrations have askedCongress for various types of contingency resources that can be drawn uponimmediately to address unanticipated foreign policy emergencies. Except in the caseof humanitarian situations, however, Congress has been reluctant to support suchrequests, stating that the President has other mechanisms and special authorities fortemporarily \"borrowing\" funds from other aid accounts over which Congress canmaintain closer scrutiny and consult in advance about the purposes of the transfers. Congress deferred the proposal in the FY2003 supplemental ( P.L. 108-11 ), choosinginstead to allocate the resources for specific needs in Iraq and for coalition partners. Thus far, House and Senate-passed FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriation bills( H.R. 2800 ), do not provide money for a Complex Foreign Crises Fund,as requested by the Administration.", "As enacted, the supplemental legislation includes relief aid for Liberia and Sudan in lieu of appropriating money for the more general Emergency Fund forComplex Crises. Congress provided $200 million specifically for Liberia, and $10million for Sudan.", "The supplemental proposal further included two provisions concerning Pakistan. The first would extend through FY2004 an existing waiver on aid restrictions toPakistan. Since September 11, 2001, Congress has authorized temporary waivers offoreign aid restrictions regarding nuclear proliferation and military coups that wouldprohibit Pakistan from receiving U.S. assistance. The current waiver expires onSeptember 30, 2003. The supplemental also requested that up to $200 million inFY2004 economic aid to Pakistan be made available to cover the costs of cancelingdebt owed by Pakistan to the United States. As enacted, the supplemental includesthe aid waiver for Pakistan, plus $200 million in economic aid for Islamabad whichmay be used for debt reduction in lieu direct grant assistance. This will presumablyremove the need for Congress to consider the debt reduction request, and a $200million aid proposal for Pakistan when it concludes deliberation on the regularFY2004 Foreign Operations spending measure. The enacted supplemental furtherprovides $100 million in additional economic aid for Jordan that had not beenrequested.
