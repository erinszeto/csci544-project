With no regular appropriation passed or enacted for FY2007, this must be compared with the combined totals of the subsequent continuing resolutions and emergency supplemental appropriations: $17.9 billion for Title I; $79.6 billion for Title II; and $149 million for Title III. The request represented an increase of $3.2 billion (18.0%) in Title I, $4.4 billion (5.5%) in Title II, and $14 thousand (9.2%) in Title III above the FY2007 enacted appropriations. The overall FY2008 request exceeded the FY2007 appropriations by $7.6 billion, an increase of 7.8%.", "The House passed its version of the FY2008 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, H.R. 2642, on June 15, 2007.

The bill's legislative path is laid out in detail in the \"Enactment of the Regular FY2008 Appropriations\" section of this report.", "While appropriations for Title I activities has increased above FY2007, this is not true across all appropriations accounts. Funds for military family housing in FY2008 are less than those for FY2007, while construction for the active and reserve military components and appropriations for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions exceed 2007-enacted amounts. Much of this addition can be attributed to the recently authorized increase in end-strength of military ground forces and the onset of construction required by the 2005 BRAC round.", "In veterans' non-medical benefits, mandatory spending for disability compensation, pension, and readjustment benefits is increasing due to the aging of the veterans population and the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result of the increase in the number of claims, the average processing time for a disability claim in FY2006 was 177 days. To reduce the pending claims workload and improve the claims processing time, funds were provided in the FY2007 supplemental and in the FY2008 appropriation for hiring and training additional claims processing staff. While mandatory spending has increased by 19.6% between FY2006 and FY2008 (from $37.2 billion to $44.5 billion), mandatory spending has declined as a share of the total VA appropriation (from 52.1% in FY2006 to 50.7% in FY2008).", "In terms of medical care afforded to veterans, similar to the past five years, the Administration has included several cost sharing proposals including increase in pharmacy copayments and enrollment fees for lower priority veterans.

These appropriations are stated within the statutory language of the act itself. Nevertheless, within the budget documentation that the President submits to Congress each year are hundreds of detailed justifications for individual construction projects at specified locations for stated purposes in established funding amounts. The appropriations and authorization committees consider each of these as individual requests and indicate their approval, disapproval, or additions to the project lists in the explanatory statements reported to their respective chambers. While it is generally recognized by legal experts that statutory language, those provisions stated in the body of legislation passed by Congress and enacted by the President, carries the full weight of law, the legal standing of statements contained within what is generally considered supporting language, such as explanatory statements written into reports to the chambers by members of committees, is less clear.", "On January 29, 2008, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13457, titled \"Protecting American Taxpayers From Government Spending on Wasteful Earmarks.\" In that E.O., the President stated, in part, that:", "For appropriations laws and other legislation enacted after the date of this order, executive agencies should not commit, obligate, or expend funds on the basis of earmarks included in any non-statutory source, including requests in reports of committees of the Congress or other congressional documents, or communications from or on behalf of Members of Congress, or any other non-statutory source, except when required by law or when an agency has itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.", "The impact of E.O. 13457 on the current appropriation or implementation practices of either the executive or the legislative branches is unclear. For example, the order states that \"executive agencies should [emphasis added] not commit, obligate, or expend funds ...\" under certain circumstances. In law, \"should\" is interpreted as non-binding guidance to those to whom it is addressed. However, in a subsequent section of the E.O., the President directs that \"the head of each agency shall [emphasis added] take all necessary steps ...\" to implement the policy according to certain criteria that he then lays out. It should be noted that \"shall\" is a much stronger, directive term. The E.O. applies only to appropriations enacted after January 29, 2008, and will therefore not affect any existing or prior-year appropriation.", "The E.O. does not appear to bar the implementation of congressionally directed funding in cases where spending is \"required by law or when an agency has itself determined a project, program, activity, grant, or other transaction to have merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking.\" Examples of such a situation have existed where particular construction projects have been directed in the text of previously enacted authorization acts. The President's order also allows agency heads to \"consider the views of a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress with respect to commitments, obligations, or expenditures to carry out any earmark\" when \"such views are in writing ... .\"", "In addition, the definition of an \"earmark\" written into the E.O. may reduce somewhat the clarity of exactly what spending is to be avoided. That definition states that earmarks are \"purported congressional direction ( whether in statutory text , report language, or other communication) [that] circumvents otherwise applicable merit-based or competitive allocation processes, or specifies the location or recipient\" (emphasis added). While much of the E.O. stresses the necessity of adhering to the letter of the law, this definition could be interpreted as preventing an agency from observing some statutory text.", "More generally, the E.O. may raise a number of other questions regarding future expenditure of appropriated funds. Two examples are suggested below.", "1. There are instances where a construction project is not stated within the statutory text of the law in question, but rather is referenced in the text of another. An example might be a statutory requirement for the Department of Veterans Affairs to construct a number of cemeteries for the use of veterans at specified locations for which appropriations are not provided until a number of years later. Would the E.O. bar the initiation of construction until such a statutory link is found and proven to unambiguously cover each project?", "2. The E.O. grants agency heads the authority to accept congressionally directed funding when a project has \"merit under statutory criteria or other merit-based decisionmaking,\" or when considering \"the views of a House, committee, Member, officer, or staff of the Congress ... when such views are in writing ....\" Do these provisions constitute a broad discretion on the part of agency heads to accept congressional guidance on spending?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2007", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Continuing Resolutions", "paragraphs": ["The 109 th Congress was unable to pass H.R. 5385 , the Military Construction, Military Quality of Life, and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007.
