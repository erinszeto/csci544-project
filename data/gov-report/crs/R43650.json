These standards would be designed to protect chemical facilities that the Secretary determines are either a \"covered chemical facility\" or a \"chemical facility of interest\" from acts of terrorism and other security risks. Later provisions would define a \"chemical facility of interest\" as a facility that holds certain chemicals above a certain quantity as determined by the Secretary and a \"covered chemical facility\" as a chemical facility of interest that the Secretary determines meets certain security risk criteria.

Under the current CFATS regulation, DHS does not require all chemical facilities with greater than screening threshold quantities of chemicals of interest to submit vulnerability assessments and site security plans. Only those facilities identified by DHS as high-risk must submit vulnerability assessments and site security plans. Approximately 36,000 facilities have reported possessing a chemical of interest above a screening threshold quantity, while DHS regulates approximately 4,000 of these facilities as high risk.

The Secretary would be allowed to disapprove a site security plan that fails to satisfy the risk-based performance standards.", "The second provision would allow the Secretary to approve alternative private or governmental security programs that meet the Secretary's requirements. This provision would also explicitly allow a covered chemical facility to meet the site security plan requirement by adopting an alternative security program reviewed and approved by the Secretary. The existing statute permits the Secretary to approve an alternative security program, but does not provide explicit approval for a facility to use such a program to meet the site security plan requirement. The current CFATS regulation allows all regulated entities to meet the site security planning requirement through submission of an alternative security program. Consequently, some analysts may view this language as making the current regulatory approach explicit in statute.", "The third provision would require the Secretary to employ risk assessment policies and procedures developed under the new title when approving or disapproving a site security plan. However, it would prohibit the Secretary from requiring resubmission of site security information from a covered chemical facility that had received approval prior to the enactment of the new title, if the sole reason for resubmission was that enactment.

It differs from the existing statute in that it would expressly allow the Secretary to use non-DHS and nongovernmental inspectors in the inspection process. This subsection would also establish a reporting structure and certain standards and requirements for non-DHS and nongovernmental personnel who conduct such audits or inspections. In addition, it would require the Secretary to prescribe certain standards for training and retraining of auditors and inspectors employed by DHS.", "In 2007, during comment on the CFATS interim final rule, some stakeholders expressed concerns about DHS use of third-party inspectors. As described by DHS, these concerns included:", "potential conflicts of interest among third-party inspectors and members of the regulated community; potential disclosure of facility business and security information; potential inconsistency in training and inspection standards between federal and third-party inspectors; and the need for DHS to establish necessary qualifications, certification, and indemnification for third-party inspectors. ", "Also, some stakeholders asserted that DHS might increase the rate of site security plan approvals through the use of third-party inspectors. The DHS itself raised questions about the appropriateness of DHS use of third-party auditors and if so, what their standards and requirements would be. The express authorization for DHS to use and set standards for non-DHS and nongovernmental inspectors as included in Subsection 2101(d) would likely resolve DHS questions regarding appropriateness of use and establishment of standards.", "The second provision in Subsection 2101(d) addresses noncompliance by a covered chemical facility. Like the existing statute, it would require the Secretary, upon discovering noncompliance, to provide the owner or operator of the facility with written notification, including an explanation of any deficiency; provide opportunity for consultation; and issue an order to comply by a specified date. If noncompliance continues, the Secretary would be allowed to issue an order for the facility to cease operation. Unlike the existing statute, this provision would require that written notification must occur no later than 14 days after a determination of noncompliance; would direct that consultation following a written notification of a facility be with \"the Secretary or the Secretary's designee\"; and would allow the Secretary to issue an order to cease operation only if noncompliance exists \"after the date specified\" in such an order to comply. The existing statute only requires written notification and identification of an opportunity for unspecified consultation. It does not expressly limit the Secretary's ability to issue an order to cease operation. It instead states that such an order may be issued in the case of an owner or operator continuing to be noncompliant.", "The third provision, which has no comparable provision in the existing statute, addresses personnel surety. It would direct the Secretary to establish a personnel surety program that would require submission of information only once, provide participating facilities with feedback about individuals submitted for vetting, and provide redress to individuals who believe the submitted information was inaccurate. It would allow a covered chemical facility to use any federal screening program that periodically vets individuals against the terrorist screening database to satisfy its obligation under a personnel surety performance standard. It would prohibit the Secretary from requiring a covered chemical facility to submit any information about an individual unless the individual is vetted under the DHS personnel surety program (in contrast to another federal screening program) or has been identified by the Secretary as presenting a terrorism security risk. Finally, it would require the DHS Security Screening Coordination Office to expedite the development of a common credential and would require DHS to report annually on progress toward this requirement.", "The use of other federal screening programs to meet a CFATS personnel surety requirement has been an issue of contention. The DHS has issued an information collection request proposing a personnel surety program. The personnel surety proposal issued by DHS would accept credentials that are vetted recurrently against the terrorist screening database and have their validity verified on a continuing basis by electronic or other means. The DHS has stated that it would not accept, in lieu of its own program, other personnel surety programs that vet individuals on a different schedule. This position would appear to conflict with the requirements in Subsection 2101(d).", "The fourth provision of the subsection addresses facility access. It would generally prohibit the Secretary from requiring a facility to submit any information about an individual who has been granted facility access. The DHS may require information submission only if DHS has vetted the individual under its personnel surety program or identified the individual as presenting a terrorism security risk. The DHS, under its proposed personnel surety program information collection request, would require facilities to submit information on personnel with access to the regulated areas of a facility. This submission would generally be regardless of credential possession, unless the facility installs electronic readers able to query an approved credential. Facilities would submit different information for individuals with recurrently vetted credentials than for other individuals. This provision would appear to prohibit a requirement to submit this information to DHS to obtain access to a facility. ", "The fifth provision is not present in the current statutory authority. This provision would require the Secretary to share with the owner or operator of a covered chemical facility such information as the owner or operator needs to comply with Section 2101. The provision may raise questions such as whether the Secretary or the owner or operator determines what information is needed, how such information should be protected, and how such information should be requested and provided. This provision also affirmatively requires the Secretary to share information with owners or operators.
