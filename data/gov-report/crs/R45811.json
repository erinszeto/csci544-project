This section provides an overview of some of these questions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mission Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Although the Department of Defense is funding a number of hypersonic weapons programs, it has not established any programs of record, suggesting that it may not have approved requirements for hypersonic weapons or long-term funding plans. Indeed, as Assistant Director for Hypersonics (USD R&E) Mike White has stated, DOD has not yet made a decision to acquire hypersonic weapons and is instead developing prototypes to \"[identify] the most viable overarching weapon system concepts to choose from and then make a decision based on success and challenges.\" As Congress conducts oversight of U.S. hypersonic weapons programs, it may seek to obtain information about DOD's evaluation of potential mission sets for hypersonic weapons, a cost analysis of alternative means of executing these mission sets, and an assessment of the enabling technologies\u00e2\u0080\u0094such as space-based sensors or autonomous command and control systems\u00e2\u0080\u0094that may be required to employ or defend against hypersonic weapons. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Assistant Director for Hypersonics (USD R&E) Mike White has noted that DOD is prioritizing offensive programs while it determines \"the path forward to get a robust defensive strategy.\" This approach is reflected in DOD's FY2021 request, which allocates $206.8 million for hypersonic defense programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094of a total $3.2 billion request for all hypersonic-related research. Similarly, in FY2020, DOD requested $157.4 million for hypersonic defense programs\u00e2\u0080\u0094of a total $2.6 billion for all hypersonic-related research. ", "Although the Defense Subcommittees of the Appropriations Committees increased FY2020 appropriations for both hypersonic offense and defense above the FY2020 request, they expressed concerns, noting in their joint explanatory statement of H.R. 1158 \"that the rapid growth in hypersonic research has the potential to result in stove-piped, proprietary systems that duplicate capabilities and increase costs.\" To mitigate this concern, they appropriated $100 million for DOD to establish a Joint Hypersonic Transition Office to \"develop and implement an integrated science and technology roadmap for hypersonics\" and \"establish a university consortium for hypersonic research and workforce development\" in support of DOD efforts. Given the lack of defined mission requirements for hypersonic weapons, it may be challenging for Congress to evaluate the balance of funding for hypersonic weapons programs, enabling technologies, supporting test infrastructure, and hypersonic missile defense. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic Stability", "paragraphs": ["Analysts disagree about the strategic implications of hypersonic weapons. Some have identified two factors that could hold significant implications for strategic stability: the weapon's short time-of-flight\u00e2\u0080\u0094which, in turn, compresses the timeline for response\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and its unpredictable flight path\u00e2\u0080\u0094which could generate uncertainty about the weapon's intended target and therefore heighten the risk of miscalculation or unintended escalation in the event of a conflict. This risk could be further compounded in countries that co-locate nuclear and conventional capabilities or facilities . ", "Some analysts argue that unintended escalation could occur as a result of warhead ambiguity, or from the inability to distinguish between a conventionally armed hypersonic weapon and a nuclear-armed one. However, as a United Nations report notes, \"even if a State did know that an HGV launched toward it was conventionally armed, it may still view such a weapon as strategic in nature, regardless of how it was perceived by the State firing the weapon, and decide that a strategic response was warranted.\" Differences in threat perception and escalation ladders could thus result in unintended escalation. Such concerns have previously led Congress to restrict funding for conventional prompt strike programs.", "Other analysts have argued that the strategic implications of hypersonic weapons are minimal. Pavel Podvig, a senior research fellow at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, has noted that the weapons \"don't \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 change much in terms of strategic balance and military capability.\" This, some analysts argue, is because U.S. competitors such as China and Russia already possess the ability to strike the United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles, which, when launched in salvos, could overwhelm U.S. missile defenses. Furthermore, these analysts note that in the case of hypersonic weapons, traditional principles of deterrence hold: \"it is really a stretch to try to imagine any regime in the world that would be so suicidal that it would even think threating to use\u00e2\u0080\u0094not to mention to actually use\u00e2\u0080\u0094hypersonic weapons against the United States ... would end well.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arms Control", "paragraphs": ["Some analysts who believe that hypersonic weapons could present a threat to strategic stability or inspire an arms race have argued that the United States should take measures to mitigate risks or limit the weapons' proliferation. Proposed measures include expanding New START, negotiating new multilateral arms control agreements, and undertaking transparency and confidence-building measures.", "The New START Treaty, a strategic offensive arms treaty between the United States and Russia, does not currently cover weapons that fly on a ballistic trajectory for less than 50% of their flight, as do hypersonic glide vehicles and hypersonic cruise missiles. However, Article V of the treaty states that \"when a Party believes that a new kind of strategic offensive arm is emerging, that Party shall have the right to raise the question of such a strategic offensive arm for consideration in the Bilateral Consultative Commission (BCC).\" Accordingly, some legal experts hold that the United States could raise the issue in the BCC of negotiating to include hypersonic weapons in the New START limits. However, because New START is due to expire in 2021, unless extended through 2026, this solution is likely to be temporary. ", "As an alternative, some analysts have proposed negotiating a new international arms control agreement that would institute a moratorium or ban on hypersonic weapon testing. These analysts argue that a test ban would be a \"highly verifiable\" and \"highly effective\" means of preventing a potential arms race and preserving strategic stability. Other analysts have countered that a test ban would be infeasible, as \"no clear technical distinction can be made between hypersonic missiles and other conventional capabilities that are less prompt, have shorter ranges, and also have the potential to undermine nuclear deterrence.\" These analysts have instead proposed international transparency and confidence-building measures, such as exchanging weapons data; conducting joint technical studies; \"providing advance notices of tests; choosing separate, distinctive launch locations for tests of hypersonic missiles; and placing restraints on sea-based tests.\" "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
