UNTAET's mandate is broad. It is to help East Timor recover from the violence throughhumanitarianaid and reconstruction of facilities that were damaged or destroyed. It is to help East Timor establish a functioninggovernment, which will take over from the United Nations when East Timor formally becomes independent. Independenceis estimated for the end of 2001, but recent statements by U.N. officials suggest that it could be postponed.

U.S. aid is helping to establishajudicial system, train civil servants, assist local radio and television programming, educate voters, and assist thecoffeeindustry (East Timor's main export).

East Timorese militia groups, who committed much of the violencein September 1999, regrouped in West Timor after the establishment of UNTAET. They controlled the campshousingdisplaced East Timorese, preventing many from returning home. In August 2000, militia members murdered U.N.workersin the camps.

Hundreds, perhaps thousands of people were killed. Up to 240,000 East Timorese either fled acrosstheborder into Indonesian West Timor or were located there forcibly by the militia groups. The international responseto theviolence led the U.N. Security Council to authorize the dispatch of a peacekeeping force into East Timor to restoreorderand facilitate the withdrawal of Indonesian forces. Australian-led peacekeepers entered East Timor on September20, 1999. By the end of October, the Indonesian military had pulled out of East Timor.

The chief governing body is a Transitional Cabinet chaired by the SecretaryGeneral's Special Representative and composed of five East Timorese and four international representatives. A36-member National Council, composed entirely of East Timorese, includes representatives from political parties,districts,religious groups, and civil organizations. It currently plays an oversight role and complements the Cabinet inadministeringthe country.

InMarch 2001, UNTAET reopened its office in Kupang and began to assess the prospect of resuming aid programsfor therefugees. Future returns of refugees likely will be influenced by several factors.

Reporting requirements relate to Administration plans for the establishmentof a U.S.\"diplomatic mission\" in East Timor upon independence and plans for security assistance programs for East Timor,especially the provision of excess defense articles and East Timorese participation in the U.S. International MilitaryEducation Training program (IMET). Title X authorizes $25 million for economic and democratic developmentinFY2002.

There appears to be an implied message to the Bush Administration thattheAdministration should not neglect East Timor in the future because of policy priorities aimed at influencing thevolatilesituation in Indonesia. The earmark of $25 million in aid for FY2001 may symbolize this intent, given that the BushAdministration reportedly favored only $10 million. If this is congressional intent, it would continue the patternof the1990s in which Congress restricted U.S. relations with the Indonesian military in order to compel the first BushAdministration and the Clinton Administration to give more priority to Indonesian human rights abuses in EastTimor inoverall U.S. policy toward Indonesia. ", "The ability of U.S. policy to influence Indonesian behavior appears to be limited by several factors. The first is theresistance of the TNI and the failure of the Wahid government to exert authority over the TNI in West Timor. Within theUnited Nations, China and possibly Russia could be expected to oppose any action by the Security Council to createaninternational tribunal to bring Indonesian military leaders to trial for East Timor atrocities. U.S. priorities regardingIndonesia are strained and diffused by the mounting violence and strife throughout the country (separatistinsurgencies,ethnic and religious strife, urban bombings), the possible impeachment of President Wahid, economic deterioration,andlegal and physical dangers facing U.S. companies in Indonesia. U.S. strategy, therefore, gives only limited priorityto theTimor situation amidst these other issues. Indonesia's mounting problems create a dilemma for the United Statesin anyconsideration of expanding Timor-related sanctions against Indonesia, along the lines of Secretary Cohen's warning;foreconomic sanctions could accelerate destabilization of Indonesia which, in the view of many observers, could leadto itsdisintegration."], "subsections": []}]}}
