It was renewed and modified under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA; Title XXXI of P.L. 107-210) on August 6, 2002, extending trade preferences until December 31, 2006. Since that time, Congress has provided several short-term extensions of ATPA. The most recent extension took place on October 12, 2011, when the 112th Congress enacted implementing legislation for the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (P.L. 112-42). As part of the free trade agreement (FTA) implementing legislation, ATPA was renewed for Colombia and Ecuador until July 31, 2013.

The value of duty-free U.S. imports under ATPA accounts for about 0.8% of total U.S. imports, or 0.1% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Over 80% of U.S. imports from ATPA countries enter duty-free under various trade preference programs or through normal trade relations.", "The 113th Congress may consider whether or not to continue renewing ATPA for Ecuador. Policymakers may also consider broader reform of U.S. trade preference programs, including the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). Some Members of Congress maintain that ATPA has been responsible for helping the Andean region progress economically over the 18-year life of the program. Critics of ATPA argue that unilateral trade programs are ineffective and that trade preferences should not be extended to countries that do not support U.S. foreign and trade policies. The Ecuadorian government's announcement that it no longer wanted to receive ATPA preferences may have overshadowed the debate for Congress on whether or not to renew ATPA.

Bush because of Bolivia's failure to meet the eligibility criteria due to its lack of cooperation on counter-narcotics efforts. In 2009, President Barack Obama continued the determination that Bolivia was not meeting the eligibility criteria.

By 2012, this amount had declined to $11.4 billion, or 27% of total import value from the four countries. Of the remaining imports in 2012, 24% entered duty-free under the Colombia and Peru Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Another small share entered duty-free under GSP and the remainder entered under normal trade relations, which applies on a nondiscriminatory basis to almost all U.S. trading partners.

A 2012 U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) study on ATPA states that the overall effect of ATPA-eligible imports on the U.S. economy has been minimal and that this continued to be the case in 2010 and 2011. It also states that the probably future effects of ATPA on U.S. industries and consumers are likely to be minimal because Ecuador is the only remaining ATPA beneficiary.

Imports of cut flowers also increased as a result of ATPA. The USITC study estimated that U.S. imports under ATPA of fresh-cut roses and fresh-cut chrysanthemums provided the most significant impact on U.S. consumers through lower prices. Fresh cut roses provided the largest single gain in consumer surplus (between $8.9 million and $9.2 million), according to the study. The largest potential relative displacement effects on U.S. producers were on U.S. production of fresh cut roses.

Estimating the effects of ATPA on the beneficiary countries is difficult because it is not easy to separate the effects of ATPA from other factors such as domestic law enforcement programs, U.S. drug eradication programs in the region, and other socio-economic variables. According to the USITC study, the impact of the ATPA on coca production in Andean countries has been small and mostly indirect. The ATPA, combined with U.S. economic assistance through alternative development programs, may have contributed to the U.S. counter-narcotics effort. The study states that, in 2010 and 2011, ATPA continued to have a small, indirect effect in support of illicit coca eradication and crop substitution efforts in the Andean region. Although coca cultivation has decreased notably since 2007, ATPA was not a major cause of this and there were likely other factors that contributed to the decline. The study reports that, according to U.S. State Department data, illegal coca cultivation fell substantially in the Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, from an estimated 20-year peak of 232,500 hectares (ha) in 2007 to 187,000 ha in 2010. The study also states that Ecuador effectively eradicated its coca cultivation by 1992, but remains a major transit country for illegal drugs trafficked from Colombia and Peru.", "The ATPA, in combination with other alternative development programs, may have helped support job growth in export sectors such as fresh-cut flowers, asparagus, bananas, and pineapples, which possibly expanded alternatives to workers who may have otherwise engaged in drug-crop production. As stated previously, Ecuador is the only remaining designated beneficiary country under ATPA. According to a U.S. embassy survey in Ecuador, most of the non-oil industries benefiting from ATPA in Ecuador include fresh cut flowers, pouched tuna, frozen vegetables, pineapples, mangoes, and plywood. The survey reports that an absence of ATPA would likely result in an adverse impact on their exports. The impact on exports of plywood and mangoes would probably be less severe because these products are also eligible for duty-free treatment under another U.S. trade preference program called the Generalized System of Preferences. Fresh cut flowers are not eligible for duty-free treatment under GSP.

A likely impact has been a loss of investor confidence and reduced private investment, which affects jobs. However, investment in Bolivia is also affected by other economic factors and by the internal political situation. The policies of current Bolivian President Evo Morales, an indigenous leader elected in December 2005, have restricted foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bolivia and subsequently caused a great deal of uncertainty for foreign investors. For example, President Morales nationalized a number of industries, including hydrocarbons, telecommunications, and electricity. ", "The losses due to the suspension of ATPA trade preferences were likely been concentrated in certain sectors or regions of the country and, therefore, costly to certain communities. Some reports on Bolivia's economy and the effect of the removal of ATPA trade preferences for Bolivia concluded that the main impacts have been a loss of investor confidence and reduced private investment, subsequently affecting jobs. The government of Bolivia estimated that before Bolivia's suspension, ATPA trade preferences created 19,300 jobs, mostly in the clothing sector. One report cited by the USITC study estimates that the suspension of trade preferences for Bolivia resulted in thousands of job losses in the textiles and leather sectors. Another report estimates that employment in the textile sector fell 30% since trade preferences were suspended. ", "A 2008 private sector report by a group of Bolivian business owners called the Confederaci\u00f3n de Empresarios Privados de Bolivia (CEPB) stated that the Bolivian economy was going through a major crisis due to the political situation and a weakening of free trade practices in the country. The report argued that the suspension of ATPA benefits for Bolivia would increase investor uncertainty, increase unemployment, and have a detrimental effect on attempts to reduce the production of drugs in Bolivia. According to the report, the suspension of ATPA duty benefits for Bolivian exports would mostly affect Bolivia's manufacturing industry because such a high percentage (55%) of Bolivia's total exports in this industry were headed to the United States. The report estimated that the removal of duty-free benefits for Bolivian exports to the United States could eliminate 12,000 direct jobs in the textile sector and up to 85,000 other jobs indirectly. The report also stated that the La Paz region in Bolivia would be the most affected region, especially within the El Alto area, which has high levels of poverty. The study argued that any negative effects in this region can add to political instability and pose a high risk for democracy in Bolivia.", "Another report, by the Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne (Unil), estimated the effects of ATPA suspension on Bolivian real incomes. The Unil study stated that most industries affected by the removal of ATPA duty benefits were mostly situated in La Paz and El Alto in Bolivia. It estimated that the effect of ATPA termination on households with employees in the manufacturing industry is sizable, but the proportion of those households to the economy as a whole is very small. The study estimated that the termination of ATPA duty benefits would cause a 0.13% drop in manufacturing employment in Bolivia, in general, and a 2% decline in the textile and apparel sector, the most affected sector according to the authors of the study.

Critics of ATPA argue that unilateral trade programs are ineffective; that the ATPA has forced U.S. producers to compete with lower-cost Andean imports; and that trade preferences should not be extended to countries that do not support U.S. foreign and trade policies.

Any potential job losses would likely be statistically small on a national level; however, they would likely be concentrated in certain regions of the country and could potentially come at a cost to some communities. For example, the flower industry in Ecuador has been one of the key beneficiaries from ATPA preferences. After crude petroleum oil, the leading U.S. import item from Ecuador under ATPA is fresh cut flowers. The value of flower imports from Ecuador in 2012 totaled $166.1 million.", "Ecuador is also a beneficiary of the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. The ATPA offers broader product coverage for Ecuador than the GSP. The government of Ecuador estimates that if ATPA is not renewed, it will negatively impact thousands of workers in various industries. For this reason, Ecuador asked the U.S. government to add certain products to the list of products eligible for GSP preferences. The Embassy of Ecuador and several private entities petitioned the Office of the United States Representative (USTR) to modify the GSP eligible product list to include fresh cut roses and certain vegetables. These petitions are included in USTR's 2012 Annual Product Review for GSP. In June 2013, the Trade Policy Staff Committee deferred the decision on Ecuador's petitions to add additional products to the GSP program. If these products are added to the GSP program and Congress extends GSP, the adverse effects from a termination of ATPA may be mitigated.

A major issue has to do with a long-running, multibillion-dollar lawsuit brought against the U.S. oil company Chevron by Ecuadorian indigenous peoples in which they claim they are the victims of toxic waste. The case goes back to a period between 1964 and 1990 in which Texaco (which has since merged with Chevron) is accused of dumping more than 18 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into Ecuador's waterways and forests. Chevron claims that the environmental damage was caused by Texaco and that the government of Ecuador exempted the oil companies from liability in exchange for a cleanup and payment in the early 1990s. On February 9, 2011, an Ecuadorean judge ordered Chevron to pay $18.2 billion in cleanup costs for environmental damages in the Amazon region. Chevron appealed the ruling in Ecuador. Chevron has long argued that the judgment was based on fraudulent evidence and that the legal system in Ecuador will not provide a fair forum because Ecuador's courts are politically influenced.", "Some observers maintain that the Chevron dispute demonstrates that Ecuador has failed to meet ATPA eligibility criteria pertaining to recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. Chevron Corporation submitted documents to the United States Trade Representative in which it argues that Ecuador is in violation of ATPA eligibility criteria because the government of Ecuador has failed to enforce or recognize arbitral awards under the U.S.-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT). In 2006, Chevron filed a claim with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to look into whether Ecuador breached international law under the Rules of the United Nations (U.N.) Commission on International Trade Law. In March 2010, the U.N. arbitration panel ruled that the Ecuadorian government violated the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with the United States with a series of unnecessary court delays in a long-running dispute between Chevron and the government of Ecuador. On August 31, 2011, the international tribunal in The Hague ruled in Chevron's favor with monetary compensation. On June 6, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld the international arbitration award against Ecuador.", "In a letter submitted to USTR in May 2013, Ambassador Nathalie Cely of Ecuador states that the government of Ecuador \"has been and continues to be in compliance with the mandatory and discretionary eligibility criteria\" of ATPA. The letter urges the United States to extend trade preferences beyond the current expiration date of July 31, 2013. It states that ATPA supports thousands of jobs for farmers, transportation and distribution employees, and vendors and customers in both the United States and Ecuador.
