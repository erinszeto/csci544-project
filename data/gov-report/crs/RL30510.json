During the 1990s, Congress has criticized the Pentagon'slong-term planning for military construction.", "In hearings on the FY2001 military construction request, legislators expressedcontinuing concern over military construction planning and the sufficiency offunding. Rep. Joel Hefley, Chair of the Military Installations and FacilitiesSubcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) argued at a hearingon March 2, 2000, that the FY2001 budget request - like the previous FY1997-00requests - continues the poor planning and downward trend for military constructionbudgets. For the FY1997-2001 military construction requests, the Administrationrequested fewer funds than it had programmed in its budget assumptions in theprevious years' FYDP. This mismatch between plans and funding was cited in thecongressional criticism of the Pentagon's military construction planning. Since theFYDP and the requested amount decreases each year for military construction, Mr.Hefley states that he is finding it difficult to take Pentagon future plans for militaryconstruction seriously. That sentiment was echoed by the Senate AppropriationsMilitary Construction Subcommittee chair - Sen. Conrad Burns - who expresseddismay at the kind of long-term planning seen in the FY2001 military constructionproposal.", "At the March 2nd HASC hearing, Randall Yim, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Installations), outlined a new DOD approach to installation management,in response to the subcommittee's concerns about planning. Yim established anInstallation Policy Board, consisting of the senior service facilities leaders, seniorservice engineers and representatives from financing and program communities. ThisBoard, chaired by Yim, meets monthly to peer review and audit installationrequirements, to develop common standards between services and to provide a forumfor DOD-wide installations issues.", "Yim outlined three analytical tools that the Installation Policy Board is developing for more efficient planning. The first is a facilities strategic plan, soDOD knows what type of facilities are needed in the future. The second is thefacilities sustainment model, which uses auditable data to model and identify thefunds needed to keep facilities in good working order. The final tool is aninstallation readiness reporting system, so that installation readiness can beconsidered as part of operational readiness decisions.", "Reauthorization of the Military Housing Privatization Initiative.

In testimony to the House Armed ServicesCommittee on March 16, 2000, the official in charge of DOD installations - Randall Yim - described the continuing problem of military family housing. Hestated that approximately two-thirds of DOD's nearly 300,000 family housing unitsneed extensive renovation or replacement. Yim also testified that fixing this problemusing only traditional military construction methods would take 30 years and cost asmuch as $16 billion.", "In his testimony, Yim emphasized that privatization of military family housing is just one part of a three part program to fix the DOD housing problem by 2010. Two other important components are increasing housing allowances to eliminateout-of-pocket costs for servicemembers and a strong military construction program. Increasing the housing allowance will reduce demand for on-base housing and atraditional government-funded construction program will continue to help fix on-basehousing. ", "Definition of MHPI Authorities. Recognizing the severity of the family housing problem, Congress passed theMilitary Housing Privatization Initiative in the FY1996 Defense Authorization Act( P.L. 104-106 ). This gave the Pentagon new authorities to obtain private sectorfinancing and expertise for military housing. The authorities are:", "guarantees, both loan and rental;", "conveyance or lease of existing property andfacilities;", "differential lease payments;", "investments, both limited partnerships and stock/bondownership; and", "direct loans.", "The legislation enabled the new authorities to be used individually, or in combination.

In the early days ofusing these authorities (1996-1998), the Department of Defense's HousingRevitalization Support Office (HRSO) coordinated the application of the newauthorities and oversaw all aspects of the process from initial site visits to finalsolicitation. During this phase - said Yim - significant strides were made indeveloping program criteria, financial models, legal documents and budget scoringguidelines. Only two on-base projects reached the solicitation stage, however,largely due to a problems in DOD's centralized management structure.", "In October 1998, the Pentagon changed tactics and devolved the execution of housing privatization projects to the Services. (6) Todate, there have been four projectsawarded and/or completed, twelve projects solicited and fourteen planned, using theMHPI process. (7)", "Evaluation of MHPI. Progress of the privatization initiative has been slow. Representative Gene Taylor, Ranking Memberof the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee of the HASC stated at theMarch 16, 2000 hearing that Congress has been disappointed with the pace ofprivatization implementation. Taylor hoped that DOD will be able to find the rightmix of public and private funding and that the housing privatization concept will liveup to its promise of providing high quality housing for our troops and their families.", "The General Accounting Office (GAO) highlighted some concerns with the privatization initiative when it reviewed DOD's military housing situation in July1998. (8) Initial evaluation of life-cycle costs ofprivatized housing versus traditionalmilitary housing showed a potential savings of only about 10% or less. The proposedlong-term time horizons for some privatization projects of 50 years or more raised concerns that the housing might not be needed that far into future. Also, the GAOargued that Pentagon planning for military housing remains poor. GAO stated thathousing requirements are not integrated with particular facilities and communityneeds, that the plans underutilize the use of local housing and that there is poorcommunication between offices responsible for housing allowances and militaryhousing construction. GAO recommended that comprehensive, better integratedplans could help maximize the privatization initiative while minimizing total housingcosts.", "A March 2000 GAO follow-up study on the privatization initiative (9) reported thatsince no projects under the initiative have been fully implemented, there is little basisto evaluate whether the initiative will ultimately achieve its goals of eliminatinginadequate housing more economically and faster than could be achieved throughtraditional military construction financing. Also, the GAO points out that the DODdoes not have an evaluation plan to assess the initiative.", "The GAO recommended that the DOD create a privatization evaluation plan to be used consistently by all the Services. The plan should include performancemeasures, such as evaluation of each authority, comparison of actual to estimatedcosts of projects, assessment of developer performance, collection of data on the useand satisfaction of housing by service members. DOD agreed with GAO'srecommendations and has begun to create an evaluation plan.", "Privatization Initiative for Utility Infrastructure. Yim testified on March 16th that DOD is pursuingutility privatization through the authority of Section 2871 of Title 10 for cost savingsand recapitalization of aging infrastructure. The DOD would like to privatize 1,700utility systems by 2003, in order have public and private sector experts run andupgrade these systems according to best business practices. ", "This authority requires that the long-term economic benefit of utilityprivatization exceeds the long-term economic and utility services costs. To date, 12systems at 7 installations have been privatized, representing a savings of more than$10 million, according to DOD.", "Through this authority, DOD divests ownership of the utility system (i.e. wires and pipes) where it is economically feasible. In certain locations and markets, energymanagement may be included in a proposal in order to offer the best value to thegovernment.", "To give incentives to DOD installations to privatize utilities, the DOD is asking Congress to amend this utility privatization authority.

In recent years, Congress has added significant amountsto annual Administration military construction budget requests. This has been arecurring pattern in the 1990s. The President proposes what Congress calls aninadequate military construction budget, especially for Guard and Reserve needs. Congress then adds funding for military construction, with some attention to Guardand Reserve projects. For example, Congress added $479 million in FY1996, $850million in FY1997, $800 million in FY1998, and $875 million in FY1999 to themilitary construction accounts. ", "Congressional additions to the military construction budget have been common and controversial throughout the 1990s. Three themes explain the pattern ofrecurring congressional additions. First, some members of the military constructionsubcommittees have believed that military construction has been chronicallyunderfunded. This theme was echoed in hearings on the FY2001 budget and the reports from the House Appropriations Committee and the defense authorizingcommittees on bills for FY1998-2000. Second, often Congress has differentpriorities than the Administration, as reflected in frequent congressional cuts tooverseas construction requests and contributions to the NATO Security InvestmentProgram. Third, other Members of Congress, as Senator Bond commented duringthe floor debate on FY1996 military construction appropriations, believe that thePentagon counts on Congress to add money to Guard and Reserve programs. Inrecent years, Congress has added large amounts for National Guard and Reserveconstruction projects, including a peak amount of $451.1 million in FY2000. (See Table 5 .) ", "Low military construction budgets has led to growing maintenance backlogs, inadequate budgets for installation maintenance, and conflict between congressional& Pentagon military construction priorities. Military construction proponents,including facility advocates in the military services, argue that military facilities havebeen systematically underfunded for many years. For example, GAO reported itsresults of a review of the management of real property assets by the DOD and theservices, at a March 1, 2000 hearing to the House Armed Services Subcommittee onReadiness. The review focused on properties that the services maintain and repairusing operation and maintenance accounts. The GAO pointed out that Congress hasbeen concerned about the DOD's real property maintenance since the 1950s. Recently, the backlog for deferred maintenance has grown from $8.9 billion in 1992to $14.6 billion in 1998. ", "Also, DOD facility managers have not met their goal to allocate 3% of the plant replacement value of DOD facilities for annual construction and maintenance (calledreal property maintenance at the Pentagon). Although this 3% goal is below theaverage for public facilities nationwide, actual DOD funding has typically run at 1to 2% of plant replacement value. For example, the Navy testified on March 1, 2000to the House Armed Services Subcommittee for Readiness that the Navy budgeted 1.8% for real property maintenance. As a result, facility proponents welcome anycongressional additions.", "Finally, congressional military construction subcommittees - authorization as well as appropriations subcommittees - have frequently taken issue withAdministration military construction priorities. In the early 1990s, for example, thecommittees frequently reduced amounts requested for construction overseas - on thegrounds that troop levels abroad should be reduced and that allied burden-sharingcontributions should increase - and reallocated the funds to domestic projects. Inaddition, congressional committees have added unrequested funds for quality of lifeimprovements, such as day care centers and barracks renovation. Congress hasargued that the military services have tended to neglect these areas in favor ofwarfighting investments.", "The Debate Over Added Projects. Since Congress has added significant amounts to military construction budgets overthe last 10 years, congressional debate has centered on how to prioritize worthyadditional projects.", "In 1994, the Senate debate on the military construction appropriations bill focused on the amount of congressional additions to the request despite constraintson overall defense spending. Senator McCain, in particular, objected to the provisionof substantial amounts for projects that the Administration had not requested. Heargued that such projects largely represented \"pork barrel\" spending, and came at theexpense of higher priority defense programs. In Senate floor consideration of themilitary construction bill that year, the managers accepted a McCain amendment thatcalled for criteria to be applied to additional projects. His amendment included aprovision that any added project should be on the military lists of critical yetunbudgeted projects. The McCain amendment was not incorporated into the finalconference version of the bill, however, and the conference agreement provided over$900 million for unrequested construction projects.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 ( P.L. 103-337 ), however, incorporated Senator McCain's criteria as a \"Sense of the Senate\" provision, (10) providing that the unrequested projects should be:", "1. essential to the DOD's national security mission, ", "2. not inconsistent with the Base Realignment and Closure Act,", "3. in the services' Future Years Defense Plan (see above),", "4. executable in the year they are authorized and appropriated, and", "5. offset by reductions in other defense accounts, through advice from theSecretary of Defense.", "Since the 104th Congress, the House military construction authorizing and appropriations committees have also used similar criteria, in collaboration with thePentagon, to add projects to the military construction budget. Each potential projectneeds to pass the following criteria, similar to the McCain criteria: Is the projectessential to the DOD mission, consistent with BRAC plans, in the Future YearsDefense Plan and \"executable\" in the coming fiscal year? If the project can meetthose criteria, the military construction authorizing and appropriations committeesmay add the project. ", "Debate over congressionally-added projects continues. In debate on the FY2000 military construction appropriations conference report, Senator McCaincontinued to discuss projects added by Congress. He noted that Congress addednearly $975 million of extra projects.
