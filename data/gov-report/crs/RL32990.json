The FAO, bycontrast, projects that Africa's share of world production will drop by about a 1% in the period upto 2010.

In West Africa, cocoa farming typically begins with the thinning or partial clearingby hand of primary or mature tropical forest growth, which is used to shelter the cocoa trees. Although some varieties of cacao trees can thrive in sun if sufficient nutrients and water are present,shade also helps to reduce damage by certain types of tree pests and diseases, and helps retainadequate moisture. Such forest areas are also used because they provide a ready-made source ofshade that does not require planting of cover plants, and because forest areas are rich in nutrientsresulting from the decomposition of organic forest detritus. The tropical soils in many areas of WestAfrica where cocoa is grown are thin and easily leached of their nutrients. Mature forest is alsocleared because a widespread local traditional agricultural technique is to open new or long-disusedland to farming, use it until the soil is exhausted, and then leave it in regenerative fallow for lengthyperiods, sometimes many years. Such practices are changing in many areas; the application ofchemical fertilizers and, alternatively, the use of organic growing methods, are becoming morecommon, increasingly allowing more intensive farming to take place. Traditional land use methods,however, remain widespread, and in many areas cocoa farming continues to be undertaken byclearing mature forest areas. ", "Planting of seedlings, which are usually transplanted after propagation and take three to fiveyears to reach productive fertility, also takes place by hand, as does weeding -- which is especiallyintensive in the year or so after forests are cleared for planting -- and the application of fertilizers andpesticides. Harvesting, which is usually on-going during several months of the year, is alsolabor-intensive. Cocoa pods must be cut carefully from the cacao tree branches, known as brooms,so as not to damage the flower \"cushion\" from which the fruit grows. Pods are then usually split andemptied by hand to remove the seeds and pulp for purposes of fermentation and drying, which aretypically undertaken at the farm level.

Sixty-two percent (756) of the salaried child workers expected to be paidpersonally, while 32% (390) reported that their earnings were received by their family members, and6% indicated that payment was made to the intermediary who had brought the child to the work site.

Among other things, these reports of child trafficking gave impetus to theHarkin-Engel Protocol discussed in this report.", "The extent to which West African cocoa producers employ child labor is, in part, a functionof economic factors. (13) The extent of child trafficking is likewise affected by such factors, these include low cocoa prices,low incomes of family farmers, and large numbers of small holder farmers who cannot afford toengage hired labor. Lack of adequate school facilities in cocoa producing areas also plays a role. Cultural factors are involved too. Sociologists point out that not only is there a tradition of childrenparticipating in household and farm work from an early age (the IITA study), but there is a strongtradition in West Africa of child migration both within countries and across borders. Such migratorypatterns make it difficult to monitor and control child trafficking.
