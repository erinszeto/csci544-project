First, FOIA directs agencies to publish substantive and procedural rules, along with certain other important government materials, in the Federal Register. Second, on a proactive basis, agencies must electronically disclose a separate set of information that consists of, among other things, final adjudicative opinions and certain \"frequently requested\" records. And lastly, FOIA requires agencies to disclose all covered records not made available pursuant to the aforementioned affirmative disclosure provisions to individuals, corporations, and others upon request.", "While FOIA's main purpose is to inform the public of the operations of the federal government, the act's drafters also sought to protect certain private and governmental interests from the law's disclosure obligations. FOIA, therefore, contains nine enumerated exemptions from disclosure that permit\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they do not require\u00e2\u0080\u0094agencies to withhold a range of information, including certain classified national security matters, confidential financial information, law enforcement records, and a variety of materials and types of information exempted by other statutes. And FOIA contains three \"exclusions\" that authorize agencies to treat certain law enforcement records as if they do not fall within FOIA's coverage.", "FOIA also authorizes requesters to seek judicial review of an agency's decision to withhold records. Federal district courts may \"enjoin [an] agency from withholding agency records\" and \"order the production of any agency records improperly withheld.\" Judicial decisions\u00e2\u0080\u0094including Supreme Court decisions\u00e2\u0080\u0094have often informed or provided the impetus for congressional amendments to FOIA.", "Although Congress is not subject to FOIA, the act may inform communications between the legislative branch and FOIA-covered entities. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(d), an agency may not \"withhold information from Congress\" on the basis that such information is covered by a FOIA exemption (although the provision does not dictate whether another source of law, such as executive privilege, may shield information from disclosure). The executive branch has interpreted this provision to apply to each house of Congress and congressional committees, but generally not to individual Members, whose requests for information are generally treated as subject to the same FOIA rules as requests from the public. This interpretation is not uniformly shared, with at least one federal appellate court interpreting \u00c2\u00a7 552(d) as applying to individual Members acting in their official capacities. In addition, although Congress is under no obligation to disclose its materials pursuant to FOIA, whether a congressional document possessed by an agency is subject to FOIA depends on whether Congress clearly expressed its intention to retain control over the specific document.", "Lastly, although FOIA is the primary statutory mechanism by which the public may gain access to federal government records and information, other laws\u00e2\u0080\u0094specifically the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Government in the Sunshine Act, and Privacy Act\u00e2\u0080\u0094also set forth rights and limitations on the public's access to government information or activities."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["T he Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) confers on the public a right to access federal agency information. Before FOIA's enactment, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) had required agencies to make certain government information available to the public. But the exceptions to disclosure in the APA's public information section had, in the estimation of FOIA's drafters, \"become the major statutory excuse for withholding Government records from public view.\" The exceptions were broad, authorizing agencies, for example, to withhold information if doing so was \"in the public interest\" or\u00e2\u0080\u0094for \"matters of official record\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094when information was \"held co nfidential for good cause found.\" In addition, the APA's public information section lacked a provision authorizing a person to seek judicial review of an agency's decision to withhold information.", "To rectify the APA's perceived failure to provide the public with adequate access to government information, Congress enacted FOIA in 1966 as an amendment to the APA. In FOIA, Congress sought to establish a statutory scheme that embodied \"a broad philosophy of 'freedom of information'\" and ensured \"the availability of Government information necessary to an informed electorate.\" To effectuate Congress's desire for robust public access to agency information, FOIA establishes a three-part system of disclosure by which agencies must disclose a large swath of records and information. First, FOIA directs agencies to publish \"substantive rules of general applicability,\" procedural rules, and specified other important government materials in the Federal Register. Second, on a proactive basis, agencies must electronically disclose a separate set of agency information including, among other things, final adjudicative opinions and certain \"frequently requested\" records. And third, FOIA's request-driven system of disclosure requires that, \"[e]xcept with respect to the records made available under\" the statute's proactive disclosure provisions, agencies disclose covered records to individuals, corporations, and others upon request. FOIA's tripartite system of disclosure aims to open up a vast array of federal agency information and records to private individuals, researchers, journalists, corporations, and other parties. In addition, disclosure under FOIA may bring information to Congress's attention that may inform its oversight of FOIA-covered agencies. As one court has remarked, \"FOIA is the legislative embodiment of Justice Brandeis's famous adage\" that \"[s]unlight is . . . the best of disinfectants.\"", "While FOIA's main purpose is to inform the public of the operations of the federal government, the act's drafters sought to protect certain private and governmental interests from the new law's disclosure obligations. FOIA thus contains nine exemptions from disclosure that authorize, but do not require, agencies to withhold information or records that are otherwise subject to release or availability under the statute. Most of FOIA's nine enumerated exemptions are designed to protect against fairly general harms that may arise from disclosure, while others concern very specific types of information, and one incorporates numerous exemptions contained in other federal statutes. And along with its nine exemptions, FOIA contains three records \"exclusions\" that cover certain \"especially sensitive law enforcement records.\" If records protected by an exclusion are subject to a FOIA request, an agency may \"treat the records as not subject to the requirements of\" FOIA. ", "Lastly, the statute authorizes requesters to challenge in federal court an agency's decision to withhold requested records. Federal district courts may \"enjoin [an] agency from withholding\u00c2\u00a0agency\u00c2\u00a0records\"\u00c2\u00a0and \"order\u00c2\u00a0the production of any\u00c2\u00a0agency\u00c2\u00a0records\u00c2\u00a0improperly withheld.\" ", "This report provides an overview of FOIA. First, the report examines key terms that dictate the scope of agencies' disclosure obligations under FOIA. The report then provides an overview of FOIA's three disclosure requirements. Following that discussion, the report reviews each of FOIA's nine exemptions and, in a later section, its three records exclusions. After an overview of selected issues concerning judicial review of agency decisions to withhold information under FOIA, this report discusses two topics of potential interest to Congress: FOIA's \"special access\" provision\u00e2\u0080\u0094which provides that FOIA does not authorize agencies \"to withhold information from Congress\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094and the status of congressional records under FOIA. Lastly, this report discusses three other laws that, like FOIA, govern the availability of specific types of government information and constitute significant elements of the federal government's open government and information legal regimes: the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); Government in the Sunshine Act (Sunshine Act); and Privacy Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Terms", "paragraphs": ["FOIA generally requires each federal \"agency\" to make \"agency records\" available to the public and specifically to \"any person\" who requests them. FOIA does not, however, require every federal entity to disclose government information to the public, nor must an agency disclose every piece of information that may be located within a covered entity. And not all persons have a right to receive records under the act. Three key statutory terms inform FOIA's general scope: (1)\u00c2\u00a0\"agency\"; (2) \"agency records\"; and (3) \"any person.\" The meaning of each of these terms determines which entities must comply with FOIA, what materials must be disclosed under the act, and to whom FOIA grants the right to request and receive records. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\"Agency\"", "paragraphs": ["FOIA requires \"agencies\" to disclose a broad array of information to the public. The APA's general definition section in 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 551 defines \"agency\" as \"each authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency.\" FOIA embraces this general definition and provides that, for the act's purposes, the term \"includes any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.\" While this definition includes a large swath of the federal government, it does not encompass the entire federal establishment. For example, FOIA does not apply to Congress, the federal courts, or territorial governments. ", "Although FOIA's definition of \"agency\" includes the Executive Office of the President (EOP), courts have determined that several entities within the EOP are nevertheless not subject to the act. In Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , the Supreme Court held that transcripts of Henry Kissinger's telephone conversations from his time as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs were not subject to disclosure under FOIA. The Court explained that the term \"agency\" as used in FOIA does not apply to \"the President's immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President .\" Courts have determined that several EOP entities are not FOIA \"agencies\" by virtue of their solely advisory or operational functions, including the Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Administration, and National Security Council. On the other hand, courts have held that entities within the EOP that \"wield[] substantial authority independently of the President,\" such as the Office of Management and Budget, are agencies under FOIA. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Agency Records\"", "paragraphs": ["Just as only \"agencies\" are subject to FOIA's disclosure requirements, only \"agency records\" need be disclosed under the act. FOIA, however, does not define \"agency records.\" Without a statutory definition, the Supreme Court, in Department of Justice (DOJ) v. Tax Analysts , held that materials qualify as agency records if an agency (1) created or obtained the materials and (2) was \"in control of the requested materials at the time the FOIA request [was] made.\" An agency comes in control of materials if, per Tax Analysts , \"the materials have come into the agency's possession in the legitimate conduct of its official duties.\" ", "As the two-part test makes clear, a record may be subject to disclosure even when an agency did not create the record, as long as the agency obtained and controlled the record when it was requested. To determine whether an agency exercises \"control\" of a record, the D.C. Circuit developed the \" Burka test,\" which considers", "1. the intent of the document's creator to retain or relinquish control over the records; 2. the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit; 3. the extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the document; and 4. the degree to which the document was integrated into the agency's record system or files.", "That said, an agency's mere ability to obtain materials, if not exercised, does not establish that such materials are agency records. And FOIA does not require an agency to create agency records in response to a FOIA request, only to disclose records it has already received or created and that are already under its control.", "Because FOIA only applies to \"agency records,\" it does not obligate agencies to disclose publicly the \"personal records\" of agency employees. As the Supreme Court in Tax Analysts explained, \"the term 'agency records' is not so broad as to include personal materials in an employee's possession, even though the materials may be physically located at the agency.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) has employed \"a totality of the circumstances test\" to assess whether material constitutes an \"agency record\" subject to FOIA or a \"personal record\" excluded from the statute's coverage. This \"test focuses on a variety of factors surrounding the creation, possession, control, and use of the document by an agency.\" In applying the totality of the circumstances test in Consumer Federation of America v. Department of Agriculture (USDA) , the D.C. Circuit held that electronic calendars of several USDA officials qualified as \"agency records\" under FOIA. The calendars \"were created by agency employees and were located within the [officials'] agency,\" updated and accessed daily, and maintained on the agency's computer system. The court determined, however, that the \"creation, possession, and control\" factors were \"not dispositive in determining whether the calendars [were] 'agency records'\" in the case. Instead, the court held that the officials' use of the calendars was the \"decisive factor.\" Specifically, the court found it significant that the calendars were used to schedule agency operations and were distributed to other agency staff and top officials. But the court determined that the electronic calendar of a separate USDA official was not an agency record subject to disclosure under FOIA because the official only shared the calendar with his secretaries and, therefore, no one else within the agency depended on his calendar to conduct agency business. ", "Although FOIA does not require the disclosure of personal materials, issues may arise when agency personnel use nonofficial electronic accounts to communicate. In Competitive Enterprise Institute v. Office of Science & Technology Policy (OSTP) , the requester sought \"all policy/OSTP-related email[s]\" contained within the private email account of the director of OSTP. A private entity maintained an account that the director used for work-related purposes. OSTP denied the request, asserting that the private entity (the director's former employer) controlled the account and that the agency, therefore, could not search it. The district court dismissed the suit in favor of the agency. However, the D.C. Circuit reversed, explaining that \"records do not lose their agency character just because the official who possesses them takes them out the door or because he is the head of the agency.\" Instead, the court wrote, \"[i]f the agency head controls what would otherwise be an agency record, then it is still an agency record and still must be searched or produced.\" The D.C. Circuit's decision in Competitive Enterprise Institute , therefore, stands for the proposition that agency records are subject to FOIA even if contained in nongovernmental electronic accounts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Any Person\"", "paragraphs": ["Lastly, FOIA directs agencies to disclose nonexempt agency records to \"any person\" upon request. A \"person\" is defined as \"an individual, partnership, corporation, association, or public or private organization other than an agency.\" Courts have therefore held that, along with individuals, organizational entities such as corporations, as well as state and foreign governments, have access rights under FOIA. That said, federal agencies have no right to records under FOIA.", "Access to records under FOIA does not hinge on whether an individual is an American citizen; noncitizens are also entitled to records under the act.

Under that section, \"each agency . . . shall make . . . records promptly available to any person\" after receiving a FOIA request. An agency must respond to a request that satisfies two requirements. First, a request must \"reasonably describe[]\" the records sought. The House committee report underlying the 1974 amendments to FOIA states that a \"'description' of a requested document would be sufficient if it enabled a professional employee of the agency who was familiar with the subject area of the request to locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort.\" Second, a FOIA request must comply with the agency's \"published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed.\" ", "If a requester submits a valid request, an agency must execute an \"adequate\" or \"reasonable\" search. This standard requires that an agency conduct a search that is \"reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.\" The D.C. Circuit has explained that \"[t]he issue is not whether any further documents might conceivably exist but rather whether the government's search for responsive documents was adequate.\" FOIA also states that agencies must \"make reasonable efforts to search for . . . records in electronic form or format,\" unless doing so \"would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system.\" DOJ guidance provides that this latter requirement \"promotes electronic database searches and encourages agencies to expend new efforts in order to comply with the electronic search requirements of particular FOIA requests.\"", "To facilitate its disclosure mandate, FOIA requires agencies to respond within certain timeframes and authorizes administrative review of unfavorable agency decisions. Once it receives a valid FOIA request, an agency has twenty business days to \"determine . . . whether to comply with [the] request\" and \"shall immediately notify the\" requester of its \"determination and the reasons therefor,\" as well as of the requester's right to appeal an \"adverse determination\" within the agency. In \"unusual circumstances\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094as defined by the statute\u00e2\u0080\u0094an agency may extend the twenty-day period by ten additional days.

However, if the agency does not adhere to the response timeframes FOIA imposes on agencies, a requester \"shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies.\" If this occurs, the requester is viewed as having constructively exhausted administrative remedies and may seek review in federal court.

However, FOIA's drafters also desired to protect certain private and governmental interests from the law's broad disclosure mandate. FOIA reflects this desire by exempting a variety of records and information from mandatory disclosure pursuant to nine enumerated exemptions. Information protected by FOIA's exemptions ranges from certain classified national security information to geological information pertaining to wells. Together, the statute's policy of otherwise maximum disclosure and its exemptions seek to strike a \"balance between the right of the public to know and the need of the Government to keep information in confidence to the extent necessary without permitting indiscriminate secrecy.\" ", "FOIA's exemptions are codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(b). Table 1 lists each exemption. All nine exemptions are explained more fully below.", "Despite the scope afforded to agencies to withhold certain records by FOIA's exemptions, the statute is fundamentally a disclosure statute. In that vein, the Supreme Court has directed that FOIA's exemptions should \"be narrowly construed.\" The statute reflects FOIA's presumption in favor of disclosure by explicitly requiring that agencies \"take reasonable steps necessary to segregate and release nonexempt information\" and disclose \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record\" that has been requested \"after deletion of the portions which are exempt.\" More fundamentally, FOIA's exemptions do not impose mandatory withholding obligations on agencies, and pursuant to the 2016 amendments to FOIA, an agency may not withhold government information protected by an exemption unless it \"reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption,\" or if disclosing the information is legally prohibited. Such limitations on the potential breadth of FOIA's exemptions may aid in the implementation of the statute's prodisclosure mandate.", "The Supreme Court has instructed that, due to the \"exclusivity\" of FOIA's exemptions, the act does not authorize an agency to withhold a covered record or information that is not protected by an applicable exemption. And in American Immigration Lawyers Association v. Executive Office for Immigration Review , the D.C. Circuit held that, when disclosing a record under FOIA, an agency may not redact information from that record on the basis that the information is \"non-responsive,\" but instead is limited by FOIA's nine exemptions in the types of information it may redact. The court explained that, although an agency may apply a FOIA exemption to withhold matter from a record, \"once an agency identifies a record it deems responsive to a FOIA request, the statute compels disclosure of the responsive record . . . as a unit.\" Thus, per the court, although \"the focus of the FOIA is information, not documents\" when the agency is deciding whether to exempt matter from a record, \"outside of that context, FOIA calls for disclosure of a responsive record, not disclosure of responsive information within a record.\"", "An agency may be prohibited by another source of law from disclosing material that is exempt under FOIA. For example, under FOIA's Exemption 3, certain statutes that prohibit or place limits on agencies' disclosure of information may serve as bases under FOIA for withholding covered information. An agency's disclosure of information protected by an Exemption 3 withholding statute, therefore, could, depending on the statute's terms, violate that particular statute. As another example, although FOIA's Exemption 4 authorizes an agency to withhold certain confidential \"commercial or financial information\" and trade secrets, the Trade Secrets Act (TSA) imposes criminal penalties for disclosing certain confidential materials if disclosure is not \"authorized by law.\" Thus, while Exemption 4 grants agencies discretion to withhold information covered by both the exemption and the TSA, the TSA would prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of the information. Ultimately, however, if records within FOIA's coverage are not exempt under FOIA or prohibited from being disclosed by another law, an agency must disclose such records upon request. ", "Under certain circumstances, an agency may be held to have waived its ability to apply an exemption to a requested record due to its prior disclosure of information. For example, the D.C. Circuit has \"held . . . that the government cannot rely on an otherwise valid exemption claim to justify withholding information that has been 'officially acknowledged' or is in the 'public domain.'\" Courts often have held that an agency's prior disclosure of information to Congress has not foreclosed application of an exemption in response to a subsequent FOIA request.

FOIA's exclusions, therefore, are designed to allow agencies to better avoid disclosure of the narrow categories of records to which they apply.

The Attorney General's memorandum on the 1986 amendments to FOIA describes FOIA's second exclusion as contemplating \"the situation in which a sophisticated requester could try to ferret out an informant in his organization by forcing a law enforcement agency\" to invoke FOIA's exemption for records relating to a confidential source (Exemption 7(D)), an action that would likely corroborate the requester's suspicion that the individual subject to the request is a confidential informant. The memorandum cites as an example the situation in which a criminal organization that suspects one of its members is a criminal informant either requires that the suspected informant request law enforcement records about himself or herself, or else compels the individual to submit a privacy waiver to allow a member of the organization to make such a request. Exclusion (c)(2) authorizes law enforcement agencies to protect against the disclosure of the identities of their confidential informants in such situations.

In reverse-FOIA suits, courts generally review an agency's decision to disclose information under \u00c2\u00a7 706(2)(A) of the APA, which provides that courts are to \"hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions\" that are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" The burden of proof in a reverse-FOIA action is on the plaintiff. ", "Under Executive Order 12600, an agency is required, in certain circumstances, to provide notice to those who submitted \"records containing confidential commercial information\" if the agency has concluded that the records may need to be disclosed in response to a FOIA request. Agency procedures generally must allow applicable submitters to object to disclosure and provide that the agency, in the event it disagrees with the submitter's objection, supply the submitter with the reasons for its disagreement. The executive order defines \"confidential commercial information\" as information submitted to an agency \"that arguably contain[s] material exempt from release under Exemption 4 . . . because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.\" Notably, the Supreme Court abrogated the \"substantial competitive harm\" test for Exemption 4 in FMI v. Argus Leader Media . In response, DOJ has advised agencies to use the broader definition of \"confidential\" declared in FMI in their predisclosure notification procedures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected Issues of Potential Interest for Congress", "paragraphs": ["While Congress is not subject to FOIA, the act raises questions of particular relevance to the legislative branch. For example, per the act, an agency may not \"withhold information from Congress\" on the basis that such information is exempt under FOIA. There are different views, however, about what \"Congress\" means in this instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094in particular, whether this withholding prohibition applies to requests from individual Members of Congress, or whether the provision is limited to access requests from each house of Congress or congressional committees. In addition, although Congress is under no obligation to disclose its own materials under FOIA, whether a congressional document possessed by an agency is subject to FOIA depends on whether or not Congress clearly expressed its determination to retain control over the document.", "Although this section only discusses the two topics just mentioned, FOIA implicates congressional interests in many other ways. For example, Congress has often expressed its interest in the frequency with which agencies use exemptions to withhold information from requesters, as well as the general backlog of FOIA requests. Further, FOIA evidences Congress's general interest in executive branch transparency, and Congress has amended FOIA several times since its 1965 enactment, often due or in response to judicial interpretations of the act or agencies' administration thereof."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Access to Agency Information: FOIA's \"Special Access\" Provision", "paragraphs": ["FOIA's \"special access\" provision\u00e2\u0080\u0094codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 552(d)\u00e2\u0080\u0094states that FOIA \"is not authority to withhold information from Congress.\" The Senate report underlying the original act explained that this provision is intended to clarify \"that, because [FOIA] only refers to the public's right to know, it cannot . . . be backhandedly construed as authorizing the withholding of information from the Congress, the collective representative of the public.\" While this provision undoubtedly prohibits agencies from withholding information from Congress based on a FOIA exemption, there is some dispute over whether subsection (d) affords individual Members of Congress access to otherwise exempt records under FOIA, or, on the other hand, whether the provision is limited to access requests from the broader arms of Congress (i.e., either house of Congress and congressional committees).", "The Department of Justice has long maintained that the special access provision does not generally apply to records requests from individual Members of Congress, meaning that agencies generally can invoke relevant exemptions to withhold materials in response to individual Member requests. DOJ distinguishes between requests for information from (1) \"a House of Congress as a whole (including through its committee structure)\" and (2) individual Members. In DOJ's view, requests from the former benefit from subsection (d)'s withholding prohibition; however, requests from the latter generally do not, no matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094as DOJ has explained\u00e2\u0080\u0094if the individual Member is \"clearly acting in a completely official capacity\" in making the request. Under DOJ's interpretation, a request by an individual Member in his or her official capacity is only covered by the special access provision if the request is from the chair of a committee or subcommittee or authorized by a committee or subcommittee. That said, individual Members of Congress can submit FOIA requests to the same extent as other persons.", "But DOJ's interpretation of the special access provision has been criticized by some as too narrow. This criticism finds support in language from the D.C. Circuit's decision in Murphy v. Department of the Army , which interpreted the special access provision as applying to individual Members acting in their official capacities . The court held that the Army had not waived Exemption 5 protection for an internal agency memorandum by sharing it with an individual Member of Congress. The court based its holding on an interpretation of the special access provision, concluding that agencies will not waive the exemption in such circumstances \"to the extent that Congress has reserved to itself in section 552([d]) the right to receive information not available to the general public.\" In responding to the requester's argument that the special access provision was limited to Congress as a whole (and not its component parts\u00e2\u0080\u0094including individual Members), the court wrote", "All Members have a constitutionally recognized status entitling them to share in general congressional powers and responsibilities, many of them requiring access to executive information. It would be an inappropriate intrusion into the legislative sphere for the courts to decide without congressional direction that, for example, only the chairman of a committee shall be regarded as the official voice of the Congress for purposes of receiving such information, as distinguished from its ranking minority member, other committee members, or other members of the Congress. Each of them participates in the law-making process; each has a voice and a vote in that process; and each is entitled to request such information from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out the responsibilities of a legislator.", "Instead, the court opined that the special access rule applies when a Member's request is made in his or her official\u00e2\u0080\u0094as opposed to \"purely private or personal\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094capacity. Members of Congress from both major political parties have cited Murphy in support of individual Members' right to access information from the executive branch. ", "DOJ's more narrow interpretation, discussed above, was a reaction to Murphy 's reading of FOIA's application to Members, which it views as being inconsistent with the act's text and legislative history. DOJ has argued, for example, that interpreting \"Congress\" to include individual Members conflicts with Article I, \u00c2\u00a7 1 of the Constitution, which provides that Congress \"consist[s] of a Senate and a House of Representatives,\" but does not mention the individuals who serve in those chambers. DOJ also asserts its position finds support in the 1966 House report for FOIA. In discussing the special access provision, the report states that \"Members of Congress have all of the rights of access guaranteed to ' any person ' by [FOIA], and the Congress has additional rights of access to all Government information which it deems necessary to carry out its functions.\" DOJ has also maintained that the D.C. Circuit's discussion of FOIA's application to individual Members \"was not indispensable to the [ Murphy ] decision\" and therefore does not constitute a binding rule. But while the D.C. Circuit has not had opportunity to revisit Murphy on the question of FOIA's application to agency communications with individual Members, later appellate panel and lower court decisions within the circuit have appeared to treat Murphy 's interpretation as controlling."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Records", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, FOIA requires federal agencies to disclose \"agency records\" after receiving a valid request. But Congress is not an \"agency\" under FOIA. Congress, accordingly, is not obligated to respond to FOIA requests for documents in its possession. But Congress's exemption from FOIA extends beyond requests directed specifically at it. Crucially, the D.C. Circuit has held that a document that an agency obtains from Congress or creates in response to a congressional request qualifies as a congressional record exempt from FOIA if \"Congress manifested a clear intent to control the document.\" ", "Congress is not required to provide \"contemporaneous instructions when forwarding\" documents to agencies to manifest its intent to control a document. In American Civil Liberties Union v. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) , the D.C. Circuit determined that a confidential report authored by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was a congressional record and, therefore, not subject to FOIA. The case concerned the committee's evaluation of a CIA program on detention and interrogation. In 2014, the committee completed a final report based on its review. Although the committee did not publicly release the final report, it distributed copies to the President and other executive branch officials. In 2009, before beginning its review, the committee's chair and vice chair sent a letter to the CIA memorializing an agreement concerning the committee's examination of CIA documents at a secure electronic CIA reading room. The letter provided the following conditions:", "Any documents generated on the network drive referenced in paragraph 5, as well as any other notes, documents, draft and final recommendations, reports or other materials generated by Committee staff or Members, are the property of the Committee and will be kept at the Reading Room solely for secure safekeeping and ease of reference. These documents remain congressional records in their entirety and disposition and control over these records, even after the completion of the Committee's review, lies exclusively with the Committee. As such, these records are not CIA records under [FOIA] or any other law . . . . If the CIA receives any request or demand for access to these records from outside the CIA under [FOIA] or any other authority, the CIA will immediately notify the Committee and will respond to the request or demand based upon the understanding that these are congressional, not CIA, records.", "The D.C. Circuit reasoned that these conditions made \"it plain that the Senate Committee intended to control any and all of its work product, including the [resulting 2014 final report], emanating from its oversight investigation of the CIA.\" The committee's subsequent transmission of the report to executive branch officials, with the instruction to the CIA and other agencies to use the report \"as broadly as appropriate\" both to ensure that the practices the report criticized were never repeated and to help in the development of CIA programs and executive branch guidelines, did not erase \"the Senate Committee's clear intent to maintain control of the\" final report.", "Whether Congress's manifestation of intent to control extends to a particular record depends on the language used in Congress's directive to the agency. In United We Stand America v. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) , the D.C. Circuit held that a letter sent from the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation to the IRS requesting information in connection with a committee investigation did not fully protect the IRS's response. The request stated ", "This document is a Congressional record and is entrusted to the [IRS] for your use only. This document may not be disclosed without the prior approval of the Joint Committee.", "The IRS transmitted documents in response to the committee's request (of which the agency retained a copy). In litigation arising from a FOIA request for the committee's request and the agency's response thereto, the court held that, although the language from the committee's request quoted above\u00e2\u0080\u0094which referred to \"[t]his document\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094conveyed a sufficient manifestation of intent to control the committee's request, that manifestation of intent did not extend to the IRS's response, save for \"those portions of the IRS response that would effectively disclose th[e] [committee's] request.\" As the court explained, \"[if] the Joint Committee intended to keep confidential not just 'this document' but also the IRS response, it could have done so by referring to 'this document and all IRS documents created in response to it.'\" Accordingly, the court of appeals remanded the case to the district court to conclude whether information in the response that would reveal the committee's request could be redacted and to direct the agency to \"release any segregable portions that are not otherwise protected by one of FOIA's nine exemptions.\" ", "The D.C. Circuit has articulated other principles helpful for determining whether Congress has manifested sufficient intent to control a particular record. For example, courts have found that \"post-hoc objections\" to disclosure raised by Congress \"long after the . . . record[s'] creation\" and \"in response to the FOIA litigation\" do not convey sufficient manifestations of intent to control. Nor are proper manifestations of intent contained in expressions that are \"too general and sweeping.\" In Paisley v. CIA , for example, the court acknowledged that letters sent by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to the CIA \"indicate[d] the Committee's desire to prevent release without its approval of any documents generated by the Committee or by an intelligence agency in response to a Committee inquiry.\" However, the court held that the letters did not alone manifest sufficient congressional intent to control the documents at issue because \"there [was] no discussion of any particular documents or of any particular criteria by which to evaluate and limit the breadth of [the Committee's] interdiction.\"", "Whether Congress has sufficiently manifested intent to control a document ultimately depends on the circumstances underlying each case. For example, in United We Stand (discussed above), the D.C. Circuit specifically underscored that the manifestation of intent to control at issue in that case was contained \"in a letter written by the Joint Committee's chief of staff as part of an investigation authorized by the chairman, vice-chairman, and ranking members of the Joint Committee,\" as well as that an IRS document that the committee relied on \"expressly recognize[d] the confidentiality of Joint Committee requests.\" On the other hand, in American Oversight, Inc. v. Department of Health & Human Services , the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia did not explicitly emphasize the level of formality of the congressional manifestation of assent in reaching its decision that the materials at issue were not agency records subject to disclosure under FOIA. Instead, the court relied on its reading of language contained in email messages between staff of the House Committee on Ways and Means and executive branch personnel addressing \"health care reform\" to find that Congress had manifested its intent to retain control over the messages.
