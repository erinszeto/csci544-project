RGGI involves nine states\u2014Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The RGGI cap-and-trade system applies only to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electric power plants with capacities to generate 25 megawatts or more\u2014approximately 168 facilities. The RGGI emissions cap took effect January 1, 2009, based on an agreement signed by RGGI governors in 2005.", "The results of the RGGI program may be instructive to policymakers. Several of RGGI's design elements generated considerable interest during the development and debate of federal proposals to address GHG emissions. In particular, the program's emissions cap has received particular attention. When the original cap took effect in 2009, it did not compel regulated entities to make internal emission reductions or purchase emission credits from other sources. Several factors led to this outcome: RGGI's cap design, an economic downturn, and a substantial shift to less carbon-intensive fuels. For instance, in 2005, RGGI states generated 33% of their electricity from coal and petroleum, sources of energy with relatively high carbon intensity. In 2016, these sources generated 7% of RGGI's electricity.", "To address the disparity between the cap and actual emissions, RGGI states agreed (in 2013) to reduce the existing cap (by 45%) so that the cap level would match actual emissions. The revised cap took effect in January 2014. RGGI's revised cap may have vastly different effects than its predecessor. It is uncertain how this new development may impact electricity use and prices in the RGGI region and, in turn, the perception and support for the program.", "Although actual emissions were ultimately well below the original emissions cap, the cap's existence attached a price to the regulated entities' CO2 emissions. Because the cap level was above actual emissions, the allowance price acted like an emissions fee or carbon tax. Although the cap likely had limited direct impact on the region's power plant emissions, the revenues generated from the emission allowance sales likely had some impact on emission levels in the region.", "Through 2016, RGGI states, as a group, have sold 91% of their emission allowances through quarterly auctions. The auction proceeds\u2014over $2.7 billion to date\u2014have provided a new source of revenue, which has been used to support various policy objectives. RGGI states (as a group) have distributed the vast majority of the emission allowance value to support energy efficiency, renewable energy, other climate-related efforts, or electricity consumer assistance. Several RGGI studies indicate that supporting energy efficiency provides multiple benefits: emission reduction, consumer savings via lower electricity bills, and job creation.", "As a group, the total CO2 emissions from the nine RGGI states account for approximately 7% of U.S. CO2 emissions (and 16% of U.S. gross domestic product). RGGI's aggregate emissions rank in the top 20 among all nations. But from a practical standpoint, the RGGI program's contribution to directly reducing the global accumulation of GHG emissions in the atmosphere is arguably negligible. However, RGGI's activities may stimulate action in other states or at the federal level: Compared to a patchwork of state/regional requirements, industry stakeholders may prefer a singular national policy.

These activities eventually led to a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlined the basic framework of the program. In 2008, the RGGI states issued a model rule of cap-and-trade regulations that participating states could use to establish and implement their programs. ", "RGGI designers expected the initial program to be a foundation for emissions trading and possibly expanded in future years by covering other emission sources/sectors, GHGs, or states. The CO 2 emissions from covered entities in the RGGI states account for approximately 20% of all GHG emissions in the RGGI states. The vast majority of the remaining GHG emissions come from fossil fuel combustion in the industrial, commercial, residential, and transportation sectors.", "Pursuant to RGGI's 2005 MOU, the RGGI states conducted a substantial design review of the program (between 2010 and 2012), which resulted in significant changes to the emissions cap and other cap-related design elements.

Highlights include the following:", "Three-year compliance periods . At the end of a compliance period, covered entities submit one emission allowance for each ton of CO 2 emissions generated. A three-year compliance period should mitigate potential emission allowance price swings brought on by short-term market volatility. Emission allowance banking . RGGI allows covered entities to bank an unlimited number of emission allowances for future use. The opportunity to bank emission allowances instills a substantial amount of flexibility into a trading program, effectively making annual emissions caps flexible over time, and reduces the absolute cost of compliance. Emission allowance auctions . With some variance among the states, particularly in the early years, a substantial percentage (91%) of emission allowances have been distributed through quarterly auctions (discussed below). The auctions include a reserve price, which sets a price floor for emission allowances. Consumer benefit allocation. RGGI states agreed that at least 25% of the emission allowance value would be distributed \"for a consumer benefit or strategic energy purpose.\" Allowance value distributions from RGGI states have far exceeded this minimum requirement (discussed below). Cost containment. In 2014, RGGI states established a \"cost containment reserve\" (CCR), which provides additional allowances to be sold at auction if certain price thresholds are met. Offsets use.

During the emissions cap construction in 2005, RGGI designers set the 2009 emissions cap about 4% above the average emission levels observed between 2000 and 2002. RGGI designers anticipated that power plant CO 2 emissions would gradually increase so that actual levels would approximately match the cap set for 2009\u2014188 million short tons of CO 2 (mtCO 2 ).

This disparity suggests that factors other than temporal economic conditions were the primary influence for the CO 2 emissions decrease.

The figure depicts a substantial decline in carbon-intensive electricity generation, particularly coal, over that time frame. Electricity is generated from a variety of energy sources, which vary significantly by their ratio of CO 2 emissions per unit of energy. For example, a coal-fired power plant emits almost twice as much CO 2 (per unit of energy) as a natural-gas-fired facility. Some energy sources (e.g., hydropower, nuclear, wind, or solar) are generally considered to be zero-emission sources. In 2005, RGGI states generated 33% of their electricity from coal and petroleum, sources of energy with relatively high carbon intensity. In 2016, these sources generated 7% of RGGI's electricity. During that time, sources with relatively lower (or zero) carbon intensities\u2014natural gas, nuclear, and renewables\u2014increased their contributions to RGGI's electricity portfolio.

First, the cap's existence attached a price to the regulated entities' CO 2 emissions. The price was relatively low (as discussed below), because of the abundance of emission allowances. ", "A 2010 analysis of the RGGI program found that the emission allowance price accounted for approximately 3% of the change in the price difference between natural gas and coal in the RGGI region between 2005 and 2009. Another study found that the RGGI program as a whole (i.e., the allowance price, distribution of allowance value, and related complementary effects) was the dominant factor in the emissions decrease. ", "Second, the cap's emission allowances were a new form of currency. The emission allowance value can be used to support various policy objectives, including (as is the case with RGGI) energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. Some would argue that RGGI's greatest impact\u2014particularly under the original emission cap\u2014was to provide a relatively reliable funding source for such efforts. ", "Several RGGI studies indicate that supporting energy efficiency provides multiple benefits: emission reduction, consumer savings via lower electricity bills, and regional job creation. One of these studies argues this allowance value distribution strategy (e.g., use of RGGI auction revenue) \"creates wider benefit than any other use of allowance value.\" As discussed below, such efforts play a role in determining the effectiveness of the program.", "In addition, a 2017 study examined the public health impacts of the first six years of the RGGI program (2009-2014).

RGGI designers based the new cap level on their projection of 2012 emissions. The emission projection turned out to be fairly accurate, as actual 2012 emissions were 92 mtCO 2 .", "The revised cap took effect in January 2014. The emissions cap will decrease each year by 2.5% between 2015 and 2020. RGGI states have not established a cap beyond 2020.", "In addition, RGGI states decided to adjust the new cap further to account for the substantial amount of banked emission allowances held by RGGI entities between 2009 and 2013. In 2014, RGGI designers determined that these banked emissions accounted for 140 mtCO 2 , a considerable amount when compared to the 91 mtCO 2 emission cap of 2014. Thus, the cap adjustments, which are applied each year between 2014 and 2020, are considerable. In some years, the adjustments lower the cap more than 20 mtCO 2 , equating to 28% decrease.

The figure indicates that the revised (and adjusted) emissions cap will likely have a different impact on the RGGI states than the original emissions cap. For example, the more stringent cap led to substantially higher emission allowance prices. As discussed below, however, these prices have declined in recent months.", "As mentioned above, RGGI entities banked a considerable number of emission allowances during the original emissions cap.

In general, RGGI states have answered the \"how\" question by employing auctions to distribute the vast majority of allowances. Perhaps the more important question for policymakers is what to do with the emission allowance value: In the case of RGGI, allowance value predominately means auction revenues.", "Allowance value includes revenues generated through allowance auctions or by giving the allowances away at no charge to either covered or noncovered entities. A covered entity recipient could use the allowances for compliance purposes, sell the allowances in the marketplace (e.g., to other covered entities), or bank the allowances for future use. To realize the value of allowances received, a noncovered entity recipient would need to sell the allowances in the marketplace, either through a broker or directly to a covered entity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Allowance Auctions", "paragraphs": ["As a group, the RGGI states have offered 91% of their budgeted emission allowances at auction between 2008 and 2016. Some of the offered allowances were not sold and were subsequently retired. Other allowances were sold at fixed prices or distributed to various entities to support a variety of objectives.", "RGGI's auctions may be of particular interest to Congress, because this approach was part of several proposed cap-and-trade systems from former Congresses. Each RGGI auction is conducted in one round with a sealed-bid, uniform-price format. Participants may submit multiple, confidential bids for a certain number of allowances at a specific price. The price paid by all bidders is the highest rejected bid (i.e., the second-highest bid). For example, consider a hypothetical auction in which the supply of allowances is 20 units. The highest bidder offers $10 per allowance for 15 allowances. The second-highest bidder offered $9 per allowance for 10 allowances. Under RGGI's auction structure, the highest bidder would receive 15 allowances at $9 per allowance, and the second-highest bidder would receive 5 allowances at $9 per allowance. The price paid by all successful bidders is known as the clearing price\u2014$9 per allowance in this example. ", "In addition, RGGI auctions include a reserve price, below which the seller refuses to part with the item for sale (i.e., emission allowance). The reserve price started at $1.86 in 2008, increasing to $2.15 in 2017. In a large-volume, multi-unit auction that is expected to have substantial participation (i.e., high demand for emission allowances), a reserve price would all but guarantee a revenue stream. A reserve price may address certain logistical concerns, such as bidder collusion, that may be associated with auctions. In addition, a reserve price may provide assurance to parties making emission reductions that the reductions will have a minimal value in the allowance market. ", "The RGGI program has held 35 auctions as of the date of this report. In general, many have viewed the auctions as successful in terms of price discovery, transparency, transaction costs, and other logistical issues. ", "Another typical measure of auction success is revenue generation. After 35 auctions, the cumulative proceeds total over $2.7 billion (including proceeds from New Jersey's allowances and proceeds from the cost containment reserve). ", " Figure 5 illustrates the auctions' results. As the figure indicates, the clearing price equaled the reserve price in auctions conducted between June 2010 and December 2012, reflecting the abundance of emission allowances in the market. Moreover, during this time period, approximately 40% of the allowances offered for sale were not purchased. RGGI states retired the vast majority of these unsold allowances. During this period, the reserve price ($1.86-$1.93 per ton) acted like an emissions fee or carbon tax.", "However, in 2013, the auction results changed dramatically, most likely reflecting upcoming changes in the RGGI program. Following the February 2013 proposal to substantially reduce the emissions cap in 2014, the clearing prices began to exceed the reserve prices ( Figure 5 ). The clearing price in the December 2015 auction reached $7.50, an almost four-fold increase compared to 2012 prices. However, since that time, the auction clearing prices have decreased substantially. In the March 2017 auction, the clearing price dropped to $3.00. Although the prices have dropped dramatically over the past 18 months, all of the allowances offered at auction have sold.", " Figure 5 also indicates the proceeds generated from the cost containment reserve (CCR) allowances.

As mentioned above, RGGI auction revenues have accounted for the vast majority (approximately 91%) of the emission allowance value created by the emissions cap. As the table indicates, RGGI states (in aggregate) allocated auction revenues as follows:", "42% for energy efficiency; 11% for electricity bill assistance; 9% for GHG abatement; 8% for clean and renewable energy; 8% for state budget reduction; 4% for administration; and 1% for RGGI, Inc.", "At the time these estimates were collected, an additional 17% of auction revenue remained to be invested. Some portion of this value will likely be used to support similar objectives. ", "The values in the table also demonstrate that allowance value distribution decisions are subject to change. For example, after initially allotting auction proceeds to energy efficiency efforts, several states (New Jersey and New York) transferred auction proceeds to address state budget deficits. Environmental groups criticized the actions of these states, but the state policymakers argued that the transfers were necessary.", "These developments highlight a cap-and-trade design issue for federal policymakers: How much flexibility (if any) should be built into a strategy to distribute emission allowance value?

Leakage can occur when an emissions reduction program does not include all sources contributing to the environmental problem. Increases in emissions from uncovered sources may reduce emission achievements from covered sources. This is a concern with the RGGI program, because the RGGI regime does not regulate emissions from electricity generated outside the region (e.g., in Pennsylvania) and then used within the region (i.e., \"imported electricity\").", "Emissions leakage could occur if imported electricity replaces RGGI in-state electricity generation, because emissions from in-state electricity are covered under the cap; emissions from imported electricity are not. In such a scenario, the quantity of leakage would depend on the sources of electricity generation involved in the tradeoff. For example, maximum leakage would occur if imported electricity from a coal-fired power plant replaced in-state electricity generated from a zero-emission source. ", "RGGI states have been monitoring electricity generation and CO 2 emission levels from both RGGI and non-RGGI sources since the emissions cap took effect in 2009. In RGGI's most recent monitoring report (August 2016), the authors compared activity between 2012 and 2014 to a pre-RGGI baseline period (2006 through 2008). The report found that electricity generation from all non-RGGI sources increased by about 12%, due largely to a 34% increase in imported electricity. However, the report also found that the CO 2 emission levels from non-RGGI sources decreased by 0.5%. This is likely related to (1) RGGI state increases in electricity generation from hydropower and renewable sources ( Figure 3 ) and (2) increases of imported electricity from hydropower, primarily from Quebec.
