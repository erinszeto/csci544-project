RAND considers these data to be a proxy for the vulnerabilities that a \"private use group\" (e.g., government, defense contractor, exploit developer, or vulnerability researcher) may have. Looking at the stockpile of zero-day vulnerabilities, RAND's findings indicate that about 5.7% of them will have been discovered by an outside entity after a year.

As such, if these findings may be reliably applied to other vulnerabilities, law enforcement or another government entity may be able to retain or exploit a given vulnerability for about 9.5 years before it is patched or publicly disclosed.

For example, Apple offers up to $200,000 for the identification of certain vulnerabilities, and this reward has been identified as one of the highest. Rewards such as these may incentivize some hackers to bring vulnerability knowledge directly to vendors or affected companies rather than to law enforcement. Bug bounty programs are also familiar to the federal government, as some agencies have already piloted them for their own systems. In April 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) launched the \"Hack the Pentagon\" pilot program where \"hackers were provided legal consent to perform specific hacking techniques against [DOD] websites, receiving financial awards for successfully submitting vulnerability reports.\"", "While the federal government may expand its own bug bounty programs, another option that policymakers may consider is financially supporting private sector bug bounty programs through federal grants. There are a number of avenues through which various departments and agencies could provide assistance, and DOJ grants are one such angle. For one, DOJ could provide grants to support bug bounty programs at entities that share information on vulnerabilities with law enforcement. However, the success of such an initiative may be bounded by financial capabilities, as the federal government could have trouble competing with the high bug bounty rewards offered by the private sector.

Even when requested in court, the FBI has declined to reveal the details of the NIT used against the Playpen website, and in at least one case has opted to dismiss charges rather than reveal detailed NIT source code. In addition, the FBI has classified elements of the NIT, which impedes criminal discovery\u2014and thus potential public disclosure\u2014of the specific NIT source code.
