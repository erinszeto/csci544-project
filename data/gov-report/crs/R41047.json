The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that antimicrobial use in the U.S. livestock and poultry sectors is a common practice. Available data suggest that antimicrobials are used in most phases of swine and poultry production and that usage has been increasing. Approximately 25%-30% of small cattle feedlot operations and about 60%-70% of larger feedlots use or are exposed to antimicrobials, most frequently through in-feed additives at feedlot operations.", "In December 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported sales and distribution of all approved uses of all dosage forms (e.g., injectable, oral, medicated feed) of the identified classes of actively marketed drugs in food-producing animals for 2009. These data have been widely cited as indicating that animal agriculture accounts for a large share of total use. Some industry groups, however, claim that FDA's estimate is overstated because, among other things, it includes ionophores, even though they claim that these drugs are not used in human medicine.", "When antimicrobials are used for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, they help treat and prevent disease in exposed animals. When used at low levels in animal diets and feed for subtherapeutic (essentially nonmedical) purposes, antimicrobials help improve animal growth rates and feed efficiency, and also help reduce mortality and morbidity and may improve reproductive performance. Some studies show that higher growth rates from subtherapeutic antimicrobials have positively influenced producer incomes and resulted in higher per-animal net returns. Some studies suggest that large-scale confined animal operations are particularly dependent on the use of antimicrobial drugs in production.", "Growing scientific evidence shows, however, that certain bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to these drugs, and that antimicrobial resistance may be transferred from animals to humans through the consumption or handling of meat that contains resistant bacteria. Public health experts also attribute such resistance to a number of other causes, such as overuse of antimicrobial drugs by medical professionals and their patients. Internationally, the issue of antimicrobial use in animal production and concerns about antimicrobial resistance continue to be actively reviewed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, as well as the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The United States is participating with other member countries in a Codex Alimentarius Commission Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance aimed at helping to develop guidelines to assess human health risks associated with the presence of antimicrobial-resistant agents transmitted through food and feed. WHO first published global principles for the containment of antimicrobial resistance in food-producing animals in 2000.", "In the United States, legislation has been introduced in the last three Congresses seeking the phased elimination of nontherapeutic use in animals of \"critical antimicrobial animal drugs\" such as penicillin, tetracycline, macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin, aminoglycoside, and sulfonamide, or other drugs that are used in humans to treat or prevent disease or infection. In the 112 th Congress, H.R. 965 and S. 1211 (Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2011, PAMTA) seek to restrict the use of certain antimicrobial drugs for subtherapeutic or nontherapeutic purposes in food-producing animals. Some federal agency officials have indicated support for restricting the nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials. Other possible policy options that might limit the use of these drugs for growth promotion include assessing user fees, imposing targeted bans, or limiting new antimicrobials for human use only, among other options.

As reported by FDA, scientific studies demonstrate a relationship between the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals, antibiotic resistance in humans, and adverse health consequences. Studies also demonstrate that antimicrobial resistance among feedborne bacteria may cause prolonged duration of illness, and increased rates of bacteremia, hospitalization, and death. In the United States, FDA regulates these drugs and approves conditions of their use. 2. Residues of antimicrobial drugs remaining in meat tissues, which may exceed allowable standards, tolerance levels, or maximum residue levels. In some cases, even trace amounts of these drugs in meat and poultry products may pose a public health hazard for consumers who are allergic, or for some drugs that have been shown to cause other severe illnesses in some consumers. This problem is different from the problem of antimicrobial resistance in foodborne pathogens that may be transmitted through the meat and poultry products. In the United States, FDA sets tolerances or allowance limits in meat, and USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) samples the products to assure compliance. 3. The use of certain antimicrobial washes and pathogen reduction treatments (PRTs) for treating meat during packing and processing of food products.

Table 5 provides a summary of the policies regarding antimicrobial use in animal feed for selected countries. Since GAO conducted its summary in 2004, other available updated information for some countries became available as follows:", "European Union. The EU prohibits the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in animal production. The EU's effort is part of its overall strategy to address the emergence of bacteria and other microbes resistant to antimicrobials, due to their perceived overexploitation or misuse, by phasing out these drugs for non-medicinal purposes. This action was part of a broader EU regulation on the use of additives in animal nutrition that established rules for the authorization, marketing, and labeling of feed additives. The regulation covers several feed additive categories, including technological, sensory, nutritional, and zootechnical additives, as well as the use of certain anti-parasitic drugs. In June 2001, the EU prohibited all but four antibiotics used for growth promotion; prohibition of the remaining four products went into effect as of January 1, 2006. In 2011, the EU passed a resolution that, among other things, calls on EU member states to \"ensure a better control over the implementation of the ban (2006) on antimicrobials being used as growth promoters,\" and to \"work towards an international ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, and to bring this matter up in its bilateral negotiations with third countries such as the United States.\" New Zealand . New Zealand claims that its \"regulatory control of antimicrobials remains one of the most stringent in the world\" and that its prohibitions are effectively similar to the EU's in the extent to which antibiotic use is regulated. All antibiotics must be registered and approved for use by the New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) and cannot be used unless there is a veterinary prescription (except for those antibiotics not relevant to the resistance problem). Registrations specify the veterinarians' responsibilities to ensure that they prescribe these drugs in a prudent manner, and only approved traders are allowed to sell these drugs to ensure that access to them is effectively limited by the prescription condition. These products may not be promoted or advertised to the public. Further action on New Zealand's restrictions and registration process is proceeding, and more updated information is available at the NZFSA website. South Korea . In 2008, reports indicated that Korea's Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MIFAFF) was tightening restrictions on the use of antibiotics in animal feed. USDA reported that Korea would phase down the number of allowable drugs as a way to reduce their overall use in compound feed that are premixed during production. In July 2010, MIFAFF published its notice banning the \"addition of antibiotics in animal feed ... to strengthen the safety management of domestic livestock products,\" prohibiting the use of \"eight antibiotics (enramycin, tyrosine, virginiamycin, bacitracin methylene disalicylate, bambermycin, tiamulin, apramycin and avilamycin) and one antimicrobial agent (sulfathiazole) in animal feed as feed additives,\" effective in the \"latter half of 2011.\" Korea notified World Trade Organization (WTO) members of its intention in August 2010 since, as stated in its notification, this could affect Korea's trade in \"animal feed.\" These policies followed other legislation enacted in 2007 regarding Korea's requirements for labeling meat products as \"antibiotic free\" or \"organic.\" Other Southeast Asian Countries. Other media reports indicate that similar bans might have been enacted or are being considered in several other Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, Japan, Thailand, Taiwan, and Malaysia.

Total meat exports to the EU range from about 3%-4% of all U.S. beef, pork, and poultry exports annually, suggesting that industry-led quality assurance efforts regarding antimicrobials still allow for U.S. meat exports to some EU markets.

At this time, however, such restrictions have not yet been initiated in these countries.", "Given myriad technical and administrative issues regarding U.S. meat trade, it is difficult to generalize about what future restrictions on these drugs in feed might mean for U.S. meat exports. For example, comments submitted by the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) to the U.S. Trade Representative regarding various international sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical trade barriers highlight the wide-ranging types of issues facing U.S. meat exporters in global markets. Among these are growing consumer concerns in markets such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan about certain U.S. production practices, including the use of antimicrobial drugs in U.S. livestock and poultry animals but also including other practices such as the use of growth promoting hormones, feeding genetically modified organisms to livestock, cloning, animal welfare, and the impact of livestock production on the environment. Other priority trade issues involve problems of market access due to various other types of restrictions, including concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease), biotechnology, antimicrobial washes, other feed additives, drug residues in meat tissue, labeling requirements, animal traceability, the H1N1 influenza virus, and various other food safety issues. Each of these issues is highlighted and outlined as part of USMEF's public comments.", "With respect to South Korea, there is still uncertainty about whether future U.S. meat exports will be affected by its recently enacted restrictions. Korea's restrictions do not prohibit use of all antibiotics (presumably, Korea would still allow for the use of other animal drugs). Also, it is not clear whether meat imports to Korea from other countries that allow for the use of the prohibited animal drugs in production will be affected; other U.S.-Korea trade issues may take precedence over the issue of antimicrobial drug use in feed. As previously noted, Korea's notification to the WTO claimed that its policy change could affect Korea's trade in \"animal feed,\" and did not mention trade in meat products. Media reports differ in terms of the extent of Korea's recent policy changes.

These countries tend to have consumers that place a high value on premium quality, often higher-priced meats, including niche markets such as antibiotic-free meat products. Consumers in these markets also tend to have heightened sensitivities to food safety concerns and other related issues. In such a case, absent changes in the U.S. meat market that would restrict the use of antimicrobial drugs in food animal production, it is possible that the United States could lose its export markets to these countries.

In 2010 Russia, the leading export market for U.S. poultry products (with 18% of exports in 2008), implemented a ban on poultry treated with chlorine rinses.

As noted, current production practices and regulatory regimes in some of these markets make these net-exporting countries already better able to supply antibiotic-free meats to markets demanding such products, irrespective of any future policies or prohibitions that might be enacted. However, some U.S. competitor markets may likely face certain capacity and production constraints, and have limited opportunity to increase production to meet growing global demand. Most export competitors have only a small share of the global meat export market, such as Australia (about 5% of world exports in 2008), Argentina (less than 2%), and New Zealand and Uruguay (each with about 1% of exports).

Under this program, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) certifies the processes and procedures in place for meats produced without the use of growth hormones, which are commonly used in the United States. Any U.S.-exported beef to the EU is accompanied by both a health certificate and a certificate of authenticity issued by USDA.

These programs include:", "American Association of Avian Pathologists (AAAP) . \"Statement on Use of Antibiotic Feed Additives by the Poultry Industry\" (www.aaap.info) and \"Guidelines to Judicious Therapeutic Use of Antimicrobials in Poultry\" ( http://www.avma.org/issues/policy/jtua_poultry.asp ).

At this time, the United States does not have an export verification program specific to these drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possibility of Adverse Production Effects for U.S. Products", "paragraphs": ["It is important to keep in mind the principal reasons why livestock and poultry growers in the United States and elsewhere use low levels of these drugs in animal diets and feed: this practice helps improve animal growth rates and feed efficiency, and also helps reduce mortality and morbidity and improve reproductive performance. Improved growth rates and feed efficiency translate into important cost savings for most growers, which in turn positively influences producer incomes and per-animal net returns. Prohibiting the use of these drugs for growth promotion purposes use would likely carry cost implications for growers, raising overall production costs possibly beyond what growers may be willing to accept and still remain in business. This could potentially lower U.S. meat production and reduce supplies available for export. Alternatively, U.S. prices might increase relative to those of competitors and remove any price advantage U.S. meat exporters might have currently, which could also erode U.S. export market share.", "Furthermore, under a scenario whereby the United States produces and exports antibiotic-free meat, overall traded product volumes would likely be very low compared to current volumes without such restrictions, at least initially (as is the case with hormone-free meat exports to the EU under the NHTC Program). Rather than raise U.S. meat exports, this could, alternatively, initially decrease overall U.S. meat exports and erode overall U.S. export market share in world markets. There is general uncertainty about how the United States would respond to a worldwide ban on the use of these drugs in animal feed for growth promotion, since this would depend largely on the ability of U.S. producers to adapt and transition effectively in response to global or domestic market conditions and consumer demand. In fact, the NHTC Program example might provide a poor model for predicting what might happen in global meat markets under a worldwide ban, since this program addresses U.S.-EU bilateral trade only, which still allows for the United States to ship conventional beef products elsewhere in the world."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Considerations for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Although the potential trade flow outcomes of changes to import policies among key U.S. trading partners and export competitors regarding antimicrobial use cannot be precisely quantified or predicted, what seems clear is that existing and future policy changes in some countries could carry important implications for U.S. meat trade. Overall, policy changes restricting U.S. livestock and poultry trade could result in adverse effects on U.S. poultry and livestock producers and exporters, either with or without similar policy changes restricting use of these drugs.", "A number of bills were introduced in the 111 th Congress aimed at curtailing agricultural uses of medically significant antibiotics, but none was enacted. These included bills introduced in the House and Senate on March 17, 2009, as H.R. 1549 by Representative Slaughter and S. 619 by Senator Reid (for Senator Kennedy). These bills, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2009 (PAMTA), were similar in title and purpose to bills introduced but not enacted in the 110 th Congress ( H.R. 962 , S. 549 ), the 109 th Congress ( H.R. 2562 , S. 742 ), the 108 th Congress ( H.R. 2932 , S. 1460 ), and the 107 th Congress ( H.R. 3804 , S. 2508 ). Top officials of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have weighed in on the debate by expressing support in concept for phasing out nontherapeutic (essentially, nonmedical) uses of antimicrobials in food animal production. For more information, see CRS Report R40739, Antibiotic Use in Agriculture: Background and Legislation .", "Industry groups generally oppose these bills because of concerns about animal welfare and food safety, as well as concerns about possible increases in production costs, among other reasons. Some, including Chairman Peterson of the House Agriculture Committee, also continue to question whether the scientific evidence supports the claim that a reduction in antibiotic use in animal agriculture results in public health benefits. Lawmakers with important poultry and meat industry constituents are likely to monitor import policy changes regarding antimicrobial use among U.S. trading partners and competitors, as well as legislative proposals suggesting similar policy changes in the United States."], "subsections": []}]}}
