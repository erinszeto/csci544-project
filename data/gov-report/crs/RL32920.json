After conducting a review of these courses, GAO might be able to identify any duplication of training and possible options for consolidating or coordinating this training. This option would give the committee additional tools for oversight of these programs. H.R. 1544 (as reported), Section 6, proposes this evaluation.

This consolidation might involve the removal of similar programs provided by G&T and FEMA to ensure there is no redundancy. If Congress did not consider this consolidation adequate to ensure against redundant or uncoordinated DHS training, it could also direct DHS to consolidate all counter-terrorism training under one agency. G&T might be directed to assume the responsibility of administering not only its training, but also the training FEMA provides first responders through EMI and NFA. Some would argue this is a logical choice since G&T is responsible for administering the funding to states and localities that assist them in receiving this training. This option, however, might be seen as impractical due to the specific training EMI provides state and local emergency managers that is specific to natural disasters, and the specific training NFA provides firefighters. FEMA historically has administered training programs for emergency managers and firefighters, whereas G&T has administered law enforcement focused training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CRS Contacts", "paragraphs": ["For further information about federal departments and agencies that provide counter-terrorism training, please contact the following CRS analysts:", "Department of Homeland Security\u00e2\u0080\u0094[author name scrubbed], [phone number scrubbed]; Department of Defense\u00e2\u0080\u0094[author name scrubbed], [phone number scrubbed]; Department of Energy\u00e2\u0080\u0094[author name scrubbed], [phone number scrubbed]; Environmental Protection Agency\u00e2\u0080\u0094Linda Jo Schierow, [phone number scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed], [phone number scrubbed]; Department of Health and Human Services\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sarah Lister, [phone number scrubbed]; Department of Justice\u00e2\u0080\u0094[author name scrubbed], [phone number scrubbed]; and Department of Transportation\u00e2\u0080\u0094Paul Rothberg, [phone number scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
