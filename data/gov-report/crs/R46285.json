The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) receives the next-largest share of all funds in the supplemental: $2.8 billion, accounting for more than a quarter of all funds in Division A. In general, these funds are intended to support core public health functions, including surveillance, laboratory capacity, infection control, and other activities. The funds are also for global disease detection and emergency response, as well as for activities carried out using the Infectious Diseases Rapid Response Reserve Fund (IDRRRF). Remaining HHS funds are appropriated to the Food and Drug Administration ($61 million) and the National Institutes of Health ($836 million).", "In addition to amounts appropriated to HHS, the supplemental provides $20 million in administrative funds for the Disaster Loans Program Account within the Small Business Administration (SBA). The supplemental also includes provisions clarifying that SBA disaster loans and economic injury disaster loans may be made in response to COVID-19. Finally, the supplemental provides nearly $1.3 billion (about 16% of all funds in Division A) to support foreign operations activities across several agencies and funding mechanisms.
