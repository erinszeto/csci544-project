The act expresses the \"sense of Congress\" that U.S. assistance should in particularencourage and enable Pakistan to make progress in eight specific areas, one of which is \"becominga more effective and participatory democracy.\" ", "Congressional attention to Pakistan's domestic political developments is ongoing. In June2005 ( S.Rept. 109-96 ), the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended approval of theAdministration's request for FY2006 aid to Pakistan while expressing concern with \"the slow paceof the democratic development of Pakistan\" and an expectation that the State Department andUSAID \"continue to make democracy and governance programs a priority.\" Weeks later, the Housepassed the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY2006 and FY2007 ( H.R. 2601 ),which includes a provision requiring the President to report to Congress on the extent to which a\"fully functional democracy\" has been restored in Pakistan.

Government institutions, democracy, and rule of law are among these.", "\"Enlightened Moderation\". The concept of\"enlightened moderation,\" as expounded by Musharraf himself, is a direct response to a growingworld perception that Islam is linked to fundamentalism, and thus to extremism, and thus toterrorism. It is a strategy meant to both shun the militancy that is rooted in \"political injustice,denial, and deprivation,\"and to bring \"socioeconomic uplift\"in the Muslim world. Musharraf hascalled upon Muslims to \"adopt a path of moderation and a conciliatory approach to fight the commonbelief that Islam is a religion of militancy in conflict with modernization, democracy andsecularism.\" Pakistan's prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, a close ally of Musharraf and his financeminister since 1999, took office in August 2004 vowing to pursue a policy of \"enlightenedmoderation.\" (13) ManyPakistanis appear to welcome the approach and see religious extremists as the main obstacle. However, one maverick Islamabad politician takes the view that Musharraf's tack was born ofexpediency, not conviction, and only serves to strengthen the perception that neither he nor theUnited States have a genuine interest in Pakistani democracy.

(16) Congressional oversight of U.S.-Pakistan relations in a March2003 hearing included Member expressions of concern about problems with Pakistanidemocratization and the danger of the United States \"giving full recognition to a military takeover\"through continuous waivers of coup-related aid restrictions.

(20) One senior Western observer contends that \"the generals cannotgovern Pakistan, but they will not let anyone else govern it;\" a Pakistani commentator sees theproblem as \"a military that wants to control things without being overtly seen to be doing so.\" (21) Although a civilianParliament has been seated for three years, most of Islamabad's policy making process is opaque; anabsence of transparency may be most noticeable with Pakistan's defense budget, which appears asa single line in the federal budget. Numerous opposition figures have complained that removing thedetails of military spending from public scrutiny is nondemocratic and allows the country'sintelligence services, in particular, to remain unaccountable to the people. (22) ", "Although it is possible to argue that Pakistan is more democratic since October 2002elections, many analysts note that the country's democratic institutions and processes are inflexibleand unaccommodating of dissent, and they see Pakistan's political parties seriously weakened inrecent years, with the military's influence correspondingly more profound. (23) Moreover, numerouscommentators reject the 9/11 Commission's \"best hope\" label for Musharraf himself as myopic andrepetitive of past U.S. reliance on Pakistani military regimes, especially in light of signs thatPakistan's seemingly decreasing political stability is rooted in Musharraf's policies and in hispatronage by the United States. (24) ", "The perceived U.S. need for a stable and reliable regional ally in its ongoing counterterrorismefforts in South Asia have some analysts concluding that Musharraf remains in a position to takefurther domestic political advantage of current geopolitical dynamics. Yet, at a July 2004 hearingof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, there appeared to be consensus among the panel of threeveteran Pakistan watchers about the potential problems inherent in a real or perceived U.S.over-reliance on the individual of Musharraf at the potential cost of more positive development ofPakistan's democratic institutions and civil society. Many commentators believe such developmentis key to the long-term success of stated U.S. policy in the region. Calling Musharraf a \"marginalsatisfier\" who will do only the minimum expected of him, one hearing witness recommended that,\"The United States must alter the impression our support for Pakistan is essentially support forMusharraf.\" (25) Thisconception is echoed by a Pakistani analyst, who contends that all of Musharraf's major policy shiftsafter September 2001 have come through compulsion by external pressure or events and that, whilethe direction of Pakistan's policy change has been appropriate, \"the momentum of change is too slowand awkward and unsure to constitute a critical and irreversible mass.\" (26) Many Pakistani andWestern commentators insist that only by allowing the country's secular political parties fully intothe system can the country realize stable and enduring democracy. (27) ", "In June 2005 statements before a House panel, one senior U.S. scholar warned Congressabout Pakistan's \"dysfunctional social order, its dangerous sectarianism and its distorted politicalsystem,\" saying the country has achieved \"sustainable failure.\" When asked by members of theHouse International Relations Committee about the country's governance system, this expert opinedthat Pakistan's military has sought to \"prevent any of the mainstream parties from emerging as analternative to the military.\" Yet he finds this strategy harmful to the military's own interests, viewingthe army as demonstrably unable to effectively govern a progressively deteriorating Pakistani system. Thus, \"it's in the army's own interest that it retreats from politics [and] allow moderate, centristparties to fill the space.\" He called Sharif's and Bhutto's return from exile a requirement for trulyfree elections in 2007. However, the Musharraf government has indicated that the two former PrimeMinisters would not be allowed to return to Pakistan before the 2007 elections. (28) ", "Numerous American policymakers believe that U.S. interests are for the time being bestserved by the presence of a strong and secure Islamabad leadership. Thus, while early optimismabout Musharraf's potential as a reformer has waned considerably, there are those who still concludethat the existence of an unstable and possibly Islamicized or failed state between Afghanistan andIndia -- a state in possession of nuclear weapons -- is a far less desirable circumstance than thepresent one in which a powerful and secular military institution maintains a reasonable degree oforder in Pakistan. (29) For some, this argument has become less persuasive as the country's law-and-order situationappeared to deteriorate in 2004-2005 and uncertainty about political succession in Islamabad causestrepidation in numerous world capitals. Pakistan's fragile democratic institutions are undercontinuous threat emanating from the authoritarian influences of the country's powerful military andquasi-feudal economic structures.

While considered fully loyal to the army, of Pakistan's 30 highest-ranking officers, Gen.Aziz may have been the only remaining officer with meaningful links to Islamist groups. (105) Both Gen. Yusuf andGen. Aziz retired in October 2004. President Musharraf named two close allies to replace them: Lt. Gen. Ahsan Salim Hayat, the Karachi Corps Commander, is the new Vice-COAS and thesenior-most army officer after Musharraf; ISI chief Lt. Gen. Ehsan ul-Haq, a moderate who oversawthe removal of pro-Taliban officers from Pakistan's intelligence service after September 2001, wasappointed Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff Committee. Gen. Hayat narrowly escapedassassination in a bloody June 2004 attack on his motorcade, an event that appeared to confirm hisstatus as an enemy of Islamic extremists. The newly promoted four-star general is believed to be oneof Musharraf's closest allies in the military and his most likely successor as Army Chief.

There continues to be few signs thatthe government of President Musharraf and its supporters in parliament and the military will moveto relinquish power before scheduled 2007 general elections. A continuing lack of unity amongopposition groups remains a serious constraint on their ability to pressure the Musharraf-ledgovernment. Beyond obvious differences over the role religion should play in Pakistan's governance,the MMA and the ARD find themselves with opposing views on such sensitive issues as proposedamendments to the controversial blasphemy law and Hudood Ordinances (related to women's rights),both of which are criticized as unjust and oppressive by human rights groups, but which areconsidered sacrosanct by the Islamists. Some analysts identify less obvious factors behindopposition disunity, including an active campaign of \"divide-and-rule\" by the military, and previoushints of an accommodation between Musharraf and the ARD have not panned out. There are,however, signs that a below-board accommodation between the Pakistani military and the Islamistparties is disintegrating.

One U.S. scholar suggests that criticism ofPakistan's apparently slow movement toward democracy is arbitrary and ignores the potential costto U.S. policy interests that faster movement might entail. Such cost could include a moreconstrained Pakistani military and political leaders in Islamabad whose greater responsiveness topublic opinion might mean reduced cooperation with the United States. (108) However, and as notedabove, this view is disputed by numerous observers who insist that the strengthening of Pakistan'sdemocratic institutions and civil society is itself a fundamental requirement for the creation of astable and prosperous Pakistani state. (109) ", "Pakistan has come a long way since the 1990s, when \"potential failed state\" was not anunusual label for this important country. During President Musharraf's tenure, Pakistan'smacroeconomic indicators are greatly improved and relations with India have warmed. The country'sinternational standing is at least partially rehabilitated, especially with the government's status as akey member of the international anti-terrorism coalition. Even some of Musharraf's most vocalcritics have acknowledged the concrete benefits of his leadership. (110) Yet, despite thepotentially brightened prospects for future civilian governance in Pakistan, military rule substantivelycontinues, and most analysts foresee little or no power being transferred to the country's civilianpolitical leaders in the near- and middle-term.", "When, in May 2005, Musharraf declared his intention to seek to remain in office beyond2007, many analysts saw him following a nondemocratic path similar to that taken by previousPakistani military rulers. In the same month, a senior Pakistani journalist and editor declared onbehalf of his staff, \"We are tired of pious lectures on democracy and constitutionalism\" from officialswho pursue neither with sincerity. In addition, fewer and fewer independent onlookers findMusharraf's repeated pledges to defeat Pakistani religious extremism as anything more than\"rounding up the usual suspects.\" (111) Pakistan's foreign and defense ministers have issued separateassurances that President Musharraf will contest 2007 elections as a civilian, but Musharraf himselfhas not ruled out remaining in uniform beyond 2007. (112) So long as the military continues to exert preeminent controlover Pakistan's governance -- and Islamist forces continue to succeed in blocking efforts to altercontroversial civil laws and reform religious schools -- there will be doubt cast on Musharraf's claimsto be pursuing a policy of \"enlightened moderation.\"", "Policy Options. U.S. policy options regardingPakistan's governance system and civil society can be seen to fall into four broad categories: statusquo, increased pressure, increased incentives, and adjusting emphases of current aid programs. Some of the policies could be employed in tandem.", "Status quo: At present, the United States provides large-scale assistanceto Pakistan under annual waivers of coup-related sanctions granted by Congress and exercised bythe President. The Bush Administration has not issued strong public criticisms of Pakistan'sapparently halting process of democratization while still encouraging movement towardestablishment of full democracy. No conditions have been placed on U.S. aid to Pakistan. Acontinuation of this policy would seek to prod Pakistan's power brokers in the military to createcircumstances in which fully free and fair national and provincial elections could take place in 2007,at which point the U.S. President might be in a position to determine that Pakistani democracy hadbeen restored and Section 508 aid restrictions could permanently be removed. Continuedmarginalization of Pakistan's moderate opposition parties and controversy over reported irregularitiesin August 2005 municipal polls fuel skepticism that status quo policies areeffective.", "Increased Pressure: The United States has several options that would seekto increase pressure on the Pakistan government so as to spur more full and rapid movement ondemocratization in Pakistan. These include ending or reducing U.S. aid and/or placing conditionson continued U.S. aid, for instance by setting democracy-related benchmarks. Ending or reducingassistance to a Major Non-NATO Ally at a time when Pakistan plays a key role in U.S.-ledanti-terrorism efforts is likely to be counterproductive in the context of broader U.S. interests, somesay, and sanctions in the recent past resulted in greatly reduced U.S. influence in Islamabad and littlesuccess in attaining U.S. objectives. There are those who argue, however, that without conditionalityon U.S. aid, the Pakistani military will have little motivation to fully remove itself from Pakistan'sgovernance.", "Increased Incentives: Another option for U.S. policy would involveoffering additional aid to Pakistan linked to that country's progress with its domestic reform agenda(and perhaps also with its cooperation in counterterrorism and nonproliferation). Such incentivescould be for the benefit of the country generally or for the military in particular (many saw the March2005 decision by President Bush to resume F-16 sales to Pakistan as a \"reward\" for the Musharrafgovernment's cooperation on counterterrorism). For example, the future sale of major U.S. weaponsplatforms to Pakistan could be offered as a \"bonus\" that would follow successful implementation offull democracy in Islamabad or, short of that, for certain substantive actions on the path to that goal(e.g., the return to Pakistan of exiled opposition figures). This form of positive reenforcement couldbe employed in tandem with a policy of negative conditionality noted above.", "Adjusting Emphases of Current Aid Programs: President Bush's2005-2009 aid plan for Pakistan calls for a 50-50 split of funds for economics and funds for militaryfinancing. A policy of continuing current aid allocations while emphasizing economic aid overmilitary aid -- a policy recommended by a Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Societytaskforce (113) -- couldserve to more effectively bolster Pakistan's social and economic development, and could quicken thepace of democratization and education reform there. Skeptics of this approach emphasize thatongoing security threats, especially as related to instability in neighboring Afghanistan, requireensuring that Pakistan's military feels secure and well-equipped.", "Given Pakistan's strategic setting, large Muslim population, experience with religiousextremism, weapons proliferation activities, and historical involvement in regional conflict, the levelof stability and quality of governance there are likely to remain of keen interest to most U.S.policymakers.", "Figure 2.
