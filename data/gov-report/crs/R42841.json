The Corps also has a prominent role in responding to natural disasters, especially floods, in U.S. states and territories. In recent years through supplemental appropriations, Congress also has funded the agency to study and construct projects that reduce flood risks in areas recently affected by some hurricanes and floods. The 115th Congress is considering possible responses to various natural disasters in 2017. H.R. 4667\u2014Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 (as passed by the House)\u2014proposes $12.09 billion for the agency's activities associated with response, repair, and recovery from natural disasters including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.", "Policy Considerations. A common issue for Congress after a flood-related disaster is whether to provide supplemental funds directly to the Corps and, if so, how much and for which Corps activities. During its deliberations on recent supplemental appropriations bills, Congress also has considered whether to maintain requirements for nonfederal cost sharing, what requirements to include regarding reporting to Congress and public transparency associated with supplemental funds, and what type of flood damage-reduction efforts to support (e.g., repair of existing infrastructure, construction of new infrastructure). Supplemental Corps funding debates also may raise broader questions for policymakers. These include, for example, the effectiveness and efficiency of processes such as those for postdisaster supplemental appropriations and Corps annual budget development, especially in regard to identifying and supporting priority investments in reducing the nation's flood risk. Supporters of supplemental appropriations for the construction of Corps flood-risk reduction projects in natural disaster-affected areas view these projects as part of the broader recovery effort and as means to improve flood resilience of the affected areas. Other stakeholders would prefer more attention and funding that supports other programs and measures to reduce the nation's flood risks.", "Supplemental Funds. From 2005 to 2016, Congress appropriated $31.4 billion in supplemental funding to the Corps; these funds amounted to almost half of the agency's annual discretionary appropriations over that same period. Of the $31.4 billion, $27.2 billion (87%) was for responding to flooding and other natural disasters. The majority of this funding related to Hurricane Katrina and other 2005 storms (approximately $16 billion) and to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 ($5.3 billion).", "Supplemental bills most frequently fund two Corps accounts: Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies (FCCE; i.e., flood fighting, repairs to damaged nonfederal flood-control projects) and Operations and Maintenance (O&M; i.e., repairs to existing Corps projects). In some instances, principally since 2005, Congress also has provided supplemental funding for other Corps accounts, such as the Construction account. Of the supplemental funds that Congress provided to the Corps for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, 31% and 66%, respectively, were for construction activities. Of the $12.1 billion that H.R. 4667 would provide, $10.48 billion would be for activities in the agency's Construction account\u2014$55 million for repairs to Corps construction projects damaged by natural disasters, and $10.425 billion for expedited construction of flood control and storm damage reduction projects in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. That is, 86% of the funding for the Corps in H.R. 4667 would be for construction. For comparison, that amount would exceed the agency's $9.1 billion total discretionary spending appropriations for flood-related construction for the decade FY2008 to FY2017.", "Conditions Applicable to Supplemental Funds. In supplemental appropriations bills, Congress has at times maintained, and at other times waived, local cost-sharing requirements for Corps flood-risk reduction construction projects. The standard nonfederal cost shares range from 35% to 50%, depending on the activity. H.R. 4667 would waive the nonfederal cost share for studies and ongoing construction funded through the bill.

Proponents of providing supplemental funding for the Corps argue that these investments are significant for recovery efforts and improve flood resilience of the affected areas. Congress may provide these funds with special considerations (e.g., designated as emergency funding and not requiring budgetary offsets; waiving nonfederal cost-share requirements). Others argue that the annual appropriations process is the more appropriate forum for deciding on significant federal flood-damage reduction investments, contending that postdisaster investments should be subject to the same project-development and cost-sharing requirements as other similar Corps projects and should compete in the agency's annual budget-development process. Other stakeholders would prefer more attention and funding that supports other programs and measures to reduce the nation's flood risks.

Of the $33.2 billion in enacted supplemental appropriations legislation, most of this amount ($31.4 billion) was provided in 12 appropriations laws enacted between 2005 and 2016. Adjusting prior-year appropriations for inflation, Congress provided the Corps with approximately $38 billion (in 2016 dollars) in supplemental appropriations between 1987 and 2016.

The $16 billion received for these storms is more than three times the size of the agency's annual civil works budget. These appropriations were provided in six separate supplemental appropriations bills passed between 2005 and 2009, and most of these funds were designated for rebuilding and in some cases significantly strengthening Corps facilities, principally in Southeast Louisiana. Approximately 94% of the supplemental funds appropriated for Corps hurricane response and recovery went to activities in Louisiana, including $14.5 billion for protective measures in Southeast Louisiana. These funds were used for significant repair and strengthening of 350 miles of levees and floodwalls in New Orleans and new surge-protection barriers, including the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Surge Barrier, which is one of the largest surge barriers in the world. ", "Although the federal government funded 100% of the costs of FCCE and O&M infrastructure in Southeast Louisiana, most of the supplemental funds for construction projects were subject to federal-nonfederal cost-sharing requirements (generally a 65/35 federal/nonfederal split). That is, the state of Louisiana is contributing $1.7 billion, consisting of $0.2 billion for real estate acquisition and $1.5 billion for the state's cash-share contribution, for its share of the $5.0 billion in improvements funded through supplemental appropriations to the Corps Construction account. Under a specially negotiated arrangement, Louisiana's cash contribution initially was provided through federal appropriations and is being repaid over 30 years.", "Hurricane Katrina significantly damaged the Mississippi coast. In contrast to the congressional response to fund hurricane-protection construction through supplemental appropriations for Southeast Louisiana, Congress directed the Corps to develop a plan for how to protect coastal Mississippi. As part of a supplemental appropriations bill for the Corps ( P.L. 109-148 ), Congress directed the Corps to design comprehensive improvements and modifications to Mississippi coastal counties to provide hurricane protection, prevent erosion, preserve fish and wildlife habitat, and achieve other purposes. This effort is known as the Mississippi Coastal Improvements Program (MsCIP). In a 2009 supplemental bill ( P.L. 111-32 ), Congress authorized and funded $439 million in Corps FCCE activities under this program. The agency's final MsCIP plan was submitted to Congress for authorization in January 2010. Congress in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-121 ) authorized an additional $1.07 billion in MsCIP activities based on the final plan. These projects were planned in compliance with the standard 65% federal and 35% nonfederal cost share for this type of Corps construction project.

The act provided $5.35 billion in supplemental appropriations to address damages caused by Hurricane Sandy and to reduce future flood risks in the areas impacted by the storm. Generally, funding under the O&M and FCCE accounts ($821 million and $1.008 billion, respectively) was to \"address the consequences\" of Hurricane Sandy. The majority of funding appropriated to the Construction account ($2.9 billion of $3.4 billion in this account) was set aside to \"reduce future flood risks in ways that will support the long-term sustainability of the coastal ecosystem and communities and reduce the economic costs and risks associated with large-scale flood and storm events ... within the boundaries of the North Atlantic Division of the Corps that were affected by Hurricane Sandy.\"", "Among other things, P.L. 113-2 allowed for the repair of damaged projects to prestorm conditions and for the restoration of some projects to their authorized \"design profiles\" (i.e., their original construction designs). Additionally, Congress made available funding in the Construction account for new construction projects (i.e., projects that were undergoing study or authorized for construction prior to the storm) but made release of this funding dependent on the Corps publishing certain interim reports also required under the legislation.

In some of the early post-Katrina supplemental bills and in the Sandy supplemental appropriations bill, Congress set reporting requirements for Corps appropriations, including regular reports to the Committee on Appropriations. For annual discretionary appropriations, project-level data are available through congressional reports and in recent years through agency work plans that follow shortly after enacted appropriations.", "Additionally, as noted above, Congress conditioned release of some of the Corps construction funding in the Sandy supplemental bill on the Corps completing and releasing information on projects that qualified for these funds.

Congress funded Corps infrastructure investments to improve hurricane storm protection infrastructure for Southeast Louisiana in post-Katrina supplemental bills.

However, Congress did not use supplemental Corps construction funds for such improvement for the 2008 Hurricane Ike-impacted Texas coast, the Midwest areas impacted by the 2011 and 1993 floods, or the 1992 Hurricane Andrew-impacted areas. ", "Proponents of supplemental construction funds for flood-impacted areas argue that these investments are significant to the recovery effort and that flooding events often bring to light flood risks warranting attention. Others argue that the annual appropriations process is the appropriate forum for identifying national priorities for federal flood-infrastructure investments. The Corps has a backlog of authorized flood and storm damage-reduction projects across the country; these authorized projects compete for the less than $1 billion typically provided for flood-damage reduction activities in the annual discretionary budget process. Over the decade from FY2008 to FY2017, discretionary appropriations for Corps flood-related construction activities averaged $907 million annually; total funding for the decade was $9.1 billion. Figure 3 provides data on flood-related construction spending using annual appropriations. A portion of the spending shown is for major rehabilitation activities of existing Corps facilities, such as dam repair. Therefore, the discretionary appropriations spent on new construction over the FY2008-FY2017 decade would be lower than $9.1 billion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonfederal Cost Sharing of Natural Disaster Repair and Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Although many Corps civil works activities are cost shared with nonfederal sponsors, much of the supplemental appropriations for flood fighting and repair of damaged infrastructure and projects have not been subject to significant cost sharing. In addition to these activities, Congress occasionally has provided funding for upgrades and construction of new infrastructure in supplemental appropriations. Congress provided supplemental appropriations for construction activities to improve infrastructure in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina, particularly in Louisiana. These construction activities generally have been cost shared either at the standard nonfederal cost shares shown in Table 2 or consistent with the cost-sharing arrangement for the original Corps project. For supplemental appropriations related to Hurricane Sandy, cost-sharing requirements were waived for ongoing construction projects but not for new construction.", "The appropriate cost share for Corps construction activities has been the subject of debate, with proposals ranging from standard cost shares to requirements for the federal government to handle most or all of a project's costs. Some also have proposed relaxing cost-sharing requirements for specific project types (e.g., cost-sharing waivers for ongoing construction projects, as noted above) and changing what costs should be counted toward the nonfederal share. ", "Various justifications for altering the standard arrangement have been advanced, including the potentially limited ability of many communities impacted by disasters to pay the standard nonfederal share. Assuming some sort of nonfederal cost share is required, another issue is who is responsible for the nonfederal share and the time period over which that share will be repaid. In the case of Louisiana, Congress required that Louisiana create a single state or quasistate entity to act as its nonfederal construction partner for post-Katrina Corps repairs and improvements and allowed the entity 30 years to repay its share of the construction costs (which was covered by the federal government with funds provided in P.L. 109-148 ). ", "The status of other existing cost-sharing requirements, such as those that apply to navigation projects, as they relate to supplemental funding also is common issue. Although certain categories of funding for federal navigation projects normally require cost sharing from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) and the Inland Waterway Trust Fund (IWTF), similar cost-sharing arrangements generally have not been required for supplemental funding for natural disasters. That is, neither of these two trust funds has been responsible for navigation-related natural disaster response and recovery costs funded in supplemental appropriations over the last decade. However, a few supplemental appropriations bills in the late 1990s required cost sharing from the HMTF. H.R. 4667 would require that HMTF funds (rather than the funds derived from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury) be used for the federal costs associated with HMTF-eligible activities; the bill does not mention any similar requirement for the use of IWTF funds.", "For its part, the Corps Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) essentially functions as an insurance program for many nonfederal flood-control and coastal-protection projects and is active in addressing postdisaster repairs and rehabilitation. Approximately 14,000 miles of levees participate in RIP: 2,250 miles of locally constructed and operated levees; 9,650 miles of Corps-constructed, locally operated levees; and 2,100 miles of federally operated levees. For locally constructed projects, 80% of the cost to repair the damage is paid using federal funds and 20% is paid by the levee owner. For federally constructed projects, the repair cost is entirely a federal responsibility (except for the cost of obtaining the sand or other material used in the repair). For damage to be repaired, the Corps must determine that repair has a favorable benefit-cost ratio.
