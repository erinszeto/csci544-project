Additionally, FACA requires that committee meetings be open to the public, unless the material discussed meets certain requirements.

Further, averages do not reflect number of meetings, number of members, and types of operations that drive committee costs. A more accurate measure of costs for special emphasis panels might be the median cost of $1.285 million. Five of the 26 advisory committees reporting as special emphasis panels reported costs within $200,000 of that median value.", "Columns G, H, I, J, K, and L in Table 9 examine the total, average, and median number of members per type of committee and the total, average, and median number of committee meetings held by each type of committee. As mentioned previously, the FACA Database reports costs on the committee level. Consequently, member and meeting-specific cost data are not available. The number of members and the number of meetings likely have a strong link to costs a committee incurs. Congress, therefore, may choose to consider these factors when assessing advisory committee costs. For instance, special emphasis panels rank highest in terms of average cost per committee ($2,766,336) and in terms of median cost per committee ($1,285,711). Special emphasis panels also have the highest average and median number of members per committee (904 members and 390 members, respectively) as well as the highest average and median number of meetings per committee (81 meetings and 26 meetings, respectively). It could be reasonably expected, therefore, that each special emphasis panel would cost more to administer than other types of committees. Grant review advisory committee costs appear to be similar to special emphasis panel costs, demonstrating more members and more meetings per committee\u2014leading to higher overall costs.

Within the FACA Database, therefore, some advisory committees offer detailed information about their subcommittees while others do not. Congress, for example, could consider whether the public should have access to data that identify the membership and costs of advisory body subcommittees. This information could make the operations of FACA committees more transparent. Such reporting requirements, however, might increase the amount of time committees spend reporting such information. Requiring subcommittees to report costs and member data could also cause some confusion over costs because it may be unclear whether data reported by the full committee represent both the full committee and its subcommittees or only the full committee.

Database users are able to enter a member's first or last name into the database search engine and will be brought to an online list that includes every name that matches their request. Despite the usefulness of this feature, concerns exist over the consistency of member name inputs. For example, certain members may serve on multiple committees. According to the FACA Database, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell served on the greatest number of committees in FY2014 (29). Although Burwell's name was easy to identify as a unique member, the name \"John Williams\" is not. In FY2014, \"John Williams\" appears on the membership rosters of 6 committees. It is unclear whether this is the same \"John Williams\" in each case or if there is more than one \"John Williams\" serving as a member of an advisory committee. In another example, a single member could be input in the database under multiple variations or misspellings of their name and title. In that case, database users may not be able to determine that it was the same person serving on all of those committees. The FACA Database, therefore, may not be optimally helpful in allowing the public to determine who from the private sector or from other levels of government is given multiple opportunities to advise policymakers.

Creating a unique identifier could demonstrate a person's service and influence over time without identity confusion. The unique identifier could be used in lieu of a name or other personal detail. In that way, a unique identifier may provide anonymity for peer reviewers who need their identities to be kept secret for fear they may be subject to criticism by peers who disagree with their recommendations. Congress may, however, decide that making such a change to data entry practices could add time and costs to operating and maintaining the FACA Database.

Some academic communities are small enough so most practitioners know one another's work. If a grant applicant was provided access to a meeting in which he learned a colleague voted against his or her grant application, that scholar may seek to harm the future work or reputation of the advisory board member.

In these cases, the federal government may be paying employees of private sector organizations or other levels of government to serve on a federal advisory committee as advocates for nonfederal entities. According to CRS analysis, in FY2015, 10 FACA committees reported providing compensation\u2014in addition to travel and per diem\u2014to a total of 659 members who were designated as representatives. The data show that most representatives who received compensation in addition to travel costs and per diem were affiliated with universities or research institutions. It is unclear why these members were designated as representatives.

Moreover, Congress may choose to consider amending FACA to clarify whether the federal government should pay any nonfederal member of an advisory body\u2014regardless of member designation. Most members receive pay to cover their travel costs as well as a payment for per diem expenses. Congress may decide it is unnecessary to provide compensation to members in addition to travel and per diem. Such an amendment to FACA would have reduced FACA implementation costs in FY2015 by nearly $37.3 million.

For example, a subject matter expert may join a FACA committee to provide his or her honest expert advice on which academic studies are the most qualified to receive a federal grant. The expert may not be able to provide an opinion in a public forum without fear of retaliation or other response. Additionally, meetings may be closed to protect proprietary information that a grant applicant may supply in his or her grant proposal.

It may be argued, therefore, that including committees whose primary function requires closed meetings under FACA may not appropriately fit FACA's aims.", "Grant review committees and special emphasis panels also have, on average, more meetings and more members than federal advisory committees with other functions.
