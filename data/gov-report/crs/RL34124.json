The survey found that of 103 retail food facilities (66 restaurants and 37 food markets), 74% had seafood label misbranding or false and/or misleading advertisement on menus, menu boards, or display cards. Instances of mislabeling also include imported farmed salmon being falsely identified as wild Alaska salmon, frozen seafood being marketed as fresh product, and confusion over seafood being marketed as organic. In response to these reports, FDA began collecting samples from the wholesale distribution chain, prior to the point of final sale, and a limited amount of samples from the point of import.

Problems can arise from substitution at the restaurant level, misrepresentation by the restaurant supplier, or product misidentification anywhere in the harvesting and processing system. It is often difficult to determine who may have been at fault, especially if there is collusion. Intentional fraud, rather than human error, is more likely to have occurred when cheaper species are consistently mislabeled as more valuable species, rather than the other way around. One study, based on an analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences, revealed that 77% of the fish sold in the U.S. marketplace as red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus , belonged to other species of the Lutjanidae family. In these cases, identification of other snapper species as red snapper is illegal. In another case, a seafood wholesaler in Alabama was convicted of selling Asian catfish and Lake Victoria perch as groupers, and farm-raised shrimp as wild-caught shrimp.", "Because large quantities of seafood are imported for U.S. consumption, some portion of the mislabeling problem undoubtedly originates with foreign suppliers. To address this concern FDA has issued an import alert on species substitution to provide guidance to agency field personnel about the manufacturers and/or products at issue. Asian catfish (basa and tra) may illustrate the magnitude of the problem. Although import volumes exceed 50 million pounds annually for these species, they sometimes are identified incorrectly in the domestic marketplace.

FDA recognizes the acceptable market name as the appropriate label for seafood products in interstate commerce. The acceptable market name \"is a name that FDA recognizes as a suitable statement of identity in labeling a species\" and fairly represents the identity to consumers. The use of vernacular names is discouraged because a species may have different vernacular names in different regions and because different species may be called by the same vernacular name. A common or usual name is the \"prevalent and meaningful name by which consumers ordinarily identify the food.\" Often the common name and acceptable market name are the same.

FDA's guidance documents are recommendations, and thus the Seafood List does not establish legally enforceable requirements. In 1993, FDA published an updated and expanded Seafood List to include invertebrate species (mollusks and crustaceans) as well as finfish.

For example, there are 47 different species listed with the market name of grouper, all of which have different common names. In this case, one market name may be used for a number of different grouper species. Use of either the acceptable market name or the common name assures seafood venders that their labeling of seafood will comply with FDA regulations.

On February 20, 2009, FDA reissued its 1991 guidance, warning the seafood industry that the net weight of frozen seafood may not include the weight of glazing and that violations of this kind may be criminally prosecuted as felonies. Recent comments submitted to the presidential task force on combating IUU fishing and seafood fraud by the Southern Shrimp Alliance stated that greater efforts are needed to stop short-weighting of seafood products.", "The seafood industry uses sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) to retain moisture in products so as to prevent freezer burn. When properly used, STPP can be a legitimate means for aiding processing and maintaining product quality. However, STPP can be misused to retain excess moisture in seafood products. For example, Atlantic sea scallops or shrimp may absorb excessive water after prolonged soaking in an STPP-water solution. Such excess water misrepresents the product's total weight and value when seafood prices are charged for the extra water. In addition to paying for excess water, shrimp can be bumped to a higher weight class (lower count per pound), which can increase the price per pound. Seafood treated with STPP or other water-retaining chemicals must be accurately labeled to identify this treatment. However, FDA rescinded moisture-percentage requirements in 2004 and now only requires that additives be listed on labels. NOAA's seafood inspection handbook assumes that scallops with a moisture content of greater than 83% have been treated and should be properly labeled as such.

Because fish are a perishable commodity, the ability to quickly identify products and their location can improve efficiency and decrease waste. Traceability also can improve customer service by providing the capacity to quickly identify and correct problems when they occur.", "Whether similar information should be required for all seafood items and markets remains an open question. Broad adoption of seafood tracing systems would require universal standards and information from across businesses in the supply chain. Although more information could decrease costs associated with seafood fraud and potentially improve efficiency, these gains would need to be weighed against potential costs of developing and maintaining the traceability system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Losses Associated with Seafood Fraud", "paragraphs": ["There are no estimates of total economic losses associated with seafood fraud, but costs to consumers and legitimate seafood business likely are substantial. When seafood products are short-weighted, the losses to the buyer or consumer are in proportion to the difference between the labeled and actual weights. In 2012, U.S. consumers spent $82.6 billion for seafood products, which includes $55.2 billion in expenditures at food service establishments and $26.8 billion in retail sales for home consumption. When paying for excess water or breadcrumbs, consumers may sustain direct losses in proportion to the excess filler used to increase the weight of the product. The National Institute of Standards and Technology speculated that if only 2% of the weight of all seafood is short-weighted, the annual loss to consumers could be as high as $1.6 billion. ", "Consumers may incur losses when purchasing a lower-valued substitute for the price of a higher-valued product. They also may gain less utility from consuming a product of lower quality even when they are unaware of whether substitution has taken place. Consumers may find inferior substitutes to be less desirable and factor this experience into future food purchases. It is not clear whether the amount of fraud and deception in seafood sales and marketing is increasing, but media and nongovernmental organization attention to this issue has raised its profile with the public. These reports may deter consumers from purchasing seafood because of suspicions that they may not be getting the product they expect. Both consumer experiences and reports of seafood fraud may change consumer tastes and preferences for seafood products and decrease demand for seafood.", "For example, a study of Floridians found that 62% of respondents were familiar with media reports of restaurants substituting lower-valued species for grouper. Among respondents who were aware of the reports and order grouper at restaurants, 39% said they were less likely to purchase grouper at restaurants, 21% said they were less likely to purchase grouper for home consumption, 13% said they were less likely to order other types of fish at restaurants, and 9% said they were less likely to purchase other fish for home consumption. Study participants were willing to pay $0.83 to $3.18 more for grouper entrees in restaurants if these products were supplied with an integrity label. ", "The seafood industry also is likely to sustain losses because of the lower consumer perception of its products and a related decrease in demand. A decrease in demand would result in lower prices and losses in revenue to law-abiding businesses. These businesses also compete with those selling fraudulent products for lower prices. Lower-priced substitutes, albeit fraudulent, can put downward pressure on prices for legitimate, high-quality products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["In 1986, the Southeastern Fisheries Association introduced a Seafood Product Quality Code program\u2014one of the first efforts by a fisheries trade association to inform wholesale and retail seafood buyers. The code, a voluntary educational and promotional concept developed by the seafood industry, cataloged the industry's recommended measures for product quality of specific seafood products. Each product, such as raw headless shrimp, is listed with a description of its characteristics, such as production method, product types, product forms, quality attributes, packaging, and labeling. The availability of this information was intended to increase quality and safety awareness and to improve communication between buyers and sellers.

NFI officially launched its Better Seafood Bureau in July 2007. Implementation of this initiative identified three primary concerns:", "transshipment of products to avoid antidumping and countervailing duties; mislabeling of products or species substitution; and mislabeling of weights or counts of products.", "NFI is pursuing its initiative by obtaining commitments from the CEOs of NFI member companies to comply with industry principles of economic integrity and to report suppliers committing economic fraud. As part of its economic integrity initiative, NFI reported that, in the year ending in August 2008, it sent more than 80 letters to FDA documenting specific examples of fraudulent weights.

NFI has maintained that \"FDA needs to fulfill its mandate to fight seafood fraud\" and \"enforce laws that are already on the books.\" It contends that calling for new laws suggests some advocacy groups do not understand the issue. NFI adds that its \"members have been aggressive in rooting out bad actors and pushing regulators to enforce laws designed to stop this type of activity.\" In 2013, NFI and the National Restaurant Association signed an MOU to join forces in the fight against seafood fraud.

Enforcement : Strengthen enforcement tools to combat IUU fishing. Partnership : Create and expand partnerships with U.S. state and local governments, industry, and nongovernmental organizations to identify and eliminate seafood fraud and IUU seafood in U.S. commerce. Traceability : Create a risk-based traceability program to track seafood from harvest to entry into U.S. commerce to prevent entry of illegal product into the supply chain and better inform retailers and consumers.", "The National Ocean Council has been changed with establishing an IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud Committee to coordinate implementation of the task force's recommendations.", "IUU fishing occurs throughout the world, and a significant portion of seafood entering the United States reportedly is obtained from IUU fishing activities. Although IUU fishing may be a significant problem, some have questioned whether IUU fishing and seafood fraud should be addressed as part of the same initiative. Those who harvest seafood illegally may attempt to avoid detection by concealing its origin or mislabeling seafood, but seafood fraud can occur whether seafood products are harvested legally or illegally. Some have recommended that IUU fishing needs to be addressed at the source, before the product enters the market system. In contrast, seafood fraud may occur at different points in the supply chain and needs to be addressed accordingly. Furthermore, some explain that the terms seafood fraud and IUU are being used very broadly and question whether they need to be redefined or categorized to address specific types of illegal activity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Seafood Fraud Report and Agency Coordination", "paragraphs": ["In February 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report on seafood fraud that focused on the federal government's role in addressing this problem.

The reported concluded that the lack of collaboration among Customs and Border Protection, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA), and FDA has resulted in overlapping actions and inefficient use of resources.", "According to GAO, FDA has considered detection of seafood fraud-related violations to be a low priority and has devoted minimal resources to this activity. At the time of GAO's study in 2009, FDA program guidance to field staff stated that \"no resources have been allocated for seafood fraud-related work, and resource expenditures in this area should be kept to a minimum.\" FDA officials stated that, \"the agency does not have the staff or resources to address economic fraud in addition to their food safety responsibilities.\" Since GAO released its report in 2009, FDA has dedicated resources to improving DNA testing for seafood fraud, collecting data related to the occurrence of seafood fraud, and launching an online training module related to seafood fraud. ", "GAO also questioned whether seafood safety requirements of FDA's Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations should include seafood fraud. Under HACCP, domestic processors are required to prepare site- and product-specific plans that analyze potential safety hazards, identify where possible hazards occur during processing, monitor hazard control points, and determine how hazards will be controlled. Importers of seafood produced in other countries also must take steps to verify that the products obtained from foreign processors are in compliance with HACCP rules. When HACCP regulations were developed in 1995, FDA also proposed guidelines for using an HACCP-based approach to control economic fraud under FFDCA. However, measures related to economic fraud were not included in the HACCP regulations that FDA adopted for seafood safety. FDA explained that the food system would need to mature before the agency should address matters other than food safety. GAO recommended FDA propose changes to its HACCP regulations to include requirements for identifying and mitigating economic fraud risks. ", "On October 9, 2009, NOAA and FDA concluded an MOU to improve cooperation and information sharing in the inspection of seafood products and establishments. The arrangement attempts to address the GAO recommendations by strengthening the agencies' partnership and outlines procedures to work together both at headquarters and in the field. The MOU recognizes that FDA may take NOAA inspections into account when establishing inspection priorities. The MOU represents a broad outline of the parties' intent to collaborate in areas of mutual interest, but it did not create binding and enforceable obligations for either agency."], "subsections": []}]}}
