These periods were marked by sharp increases in medical liability insurance premiums, difficulties in finding any medical liability insurance in some areas as insurers withdrew from providing coverage, reports of providers leaving areas or retiring following insurance difficulties, and a variety of public policy measures at both the state and federal levels. The effectiveness of various public policy measures in addressing the issues in the medical malpractice liability market has been a matter of debate, in part because these difficulties have arisen at the intersection of the health care, tort, and insurance systems.", "The overall medical liability insurance market is not currently exhibiting a comparable level of disruption to that in the \"crisis\" periods. Nonetheless, concerns persist regarding the affordability and availability of malpractice insurance in particular regions and for certain physician specialties (e.g., obstetricians). In addition, concern about medical malpractice claims may affect individual provider decisions and the cost of health care.", "In terms of direct costs, medical malpractice insurance adds relatively little to the overall cost of health care. Medical malpractice premiums in 2010 totaled approximately $10.2 billion, whereas overall health expenditures were $2.6 trillion in 2010 according, respectively, to data from insurance rating firm AM Best and the National Health Expenditure Accounts. Indirect costs, particularly increased use of services by providers to protect against future lawsuits (\"defensive medicine\"), have been estimated to be higher than direct costs. CBO estimated that enacting federal tort reforms would reduce health care spending by approximately 0.4%-0.5% (roughly $9 billion-$11 billion) and the federal budget deficit by between $40 billion and $57 billion over a 10-year period.", "The malpractice system also faces issues of equity and access. For example, some observers have criticized the current system's performance with respect to (1) compensating patients who have been harmed by malpractice, (2) deterring substandard medical care, and (3) promoting patient safety. There are differing opinions as to the extent that each of these areas has been affected by the current malpractice system.", "In the 112th Congress, the primary vehicle addressing medical malpractice has been H.R. 5, which focused on medical liability tort reform when introduced but was amended to include language similar to other legislation, specifically H.R. 157, H.R. 1150, H.R. 1943, and H.R. 3586.

This estimate represents the cumulative impact of federal tort reform on lowering medical malpractice insurance premiums and reducing use of health care services. In addition, it takes into account the fact that many states have already implemented tort reforms, and therefore, some proportion of potential cost savings already has been realized.

States have the primary authority to define the process for granting and renewing a medical license and regulating the practice of medicine. Currently, there is some degree of lack of uniformity across states regarding both medical licensure and the regulation of the practice of medicine; less rigorous regulatory standards, as well as variability in the robustness of regulatory standards, may have an adverse effect on patient safety.

The implication is that defensive medicine may result in either an increase in overall consumption of and spending on health care services that may not be medically necessary or a decrease in access to certain services or for certain patients. In addition, however, the provision of unnecessary health care services may also directly harm patients. Multiple studies have found some evidence of the practice of defensive medicine, but even providers acknowledge that it is a difficult concept to measure. Moreover, factors other than defensive medicine, such as physician payment systems (e.g., fee-for-service vs. capitation) and financial incentives, contribute to the over-provision of health services; additionally, the contribution of this and other factors to the overutilization of health care services, for example failure to adhere to evidence-based practices, is likely larger than that of defensive medicine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tort System", "paragraphs": ["The tort system acts as a mechanism through which a person suffering injury due to medical errors is monetarily compensated when he or she establishes that a provider provided substandard health care.

This appears to have reduced the number of medical malpractice law suits and to have lowered medical malpractice premiums. For instance, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) reports that the number of anesthesiology deaths has declined from 1 in 5,000 to less than 1 in 200,000, and real medical malpractice insurance premiums for anesthesiologists have declined by more than 40% in real terms since 1985.", "Evidence of connections between quality improvement, improved patient safety, lower medical malpractice insurance premiums, and fewer law suits extends beyond anesthesiology. A recent RAND Corporation study found that \"improvements in patient safety reduce malpractice claims.\" Specifically, the study, conducted at the county level in California, found that a county that \"saw a decrease of 10 adverse events (achieved through improvements in the quality of care provided) in a given year would also see a decrease of 3.7 malpractice claims.\" Similarly, in 2010, Virginia Mason Medical Center, in Seattle, WA, was named Hospital of the Decade by the Leapfrog Group, along with the University of Maryland Medical Center, for \"major achievements in reducing medical errors and other innovations in patient safety and quality.\" Virginia Mason reports that,", "with improving quality of care and preventing errors, we have seen a decline in our medical malpractice premiums. We have seen decreases in medical malpractice premiums every year since 2005. As of 2011, our premiums have dropped by 52% since 2005, saving us literally millions of dollars.", "Although other medical systems have also achieved similar outcomes while pursuing efforts to improve quality and reduce or prevent medical errors, some argue that enough is not being done to ensure that hospitals and other providers fully internalize the costs of their errors such that they have a solid business case for improving quality and reducing errors."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
