The ACA does not specifically define this core package but rather lists 10 benefit categories from which benefits and services must be included.", "The 10 benefit categories are as follows:", "ambulatory patient services; emergency services; hospitalization; maternity and newborn care; mental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices; laboratory services; preventive and wellness and chronic disease management; and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.", "For the 2014-2017 coverage years, each state was required to select an EHB-benchmark plan. The benchmark plan serves as a reference plan on which non-group and small-group market plans must substantially base their benefits packages.", "Because states select their own EHB-benchmark plans, there is considerable variation in EHB coverage from state to state. This variation occurs in terms of specific covered services as well as in terms of amount, duration, and scope. For example, some state EHB-benchmark plans may include bariatric surgery as a covered service whereas other state EHB-benchmark plans may not cover bariatric surgery. State benefit mandates also may be considered to be part of that state's EHB and thus add to state-level coverage differences.", "Furthermore, because states can allow non-group and small-group plans to substitute certain services within the categories, coverage in plans within a state also may vary by benefit amount, duration, and scope. For example, a state's EHB-benchmark plan could offer up to 20 physical therapy visits and 10 occupational therapy visits. Another plan in the state could offer coverage consistent with the EHB-benchmark plan by covering up to 10 physical therapy visits and 20 occupational therapy visits.", "In addition to covering the EHB, the ACA imposes a limit on cost sharing (which includes co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles) for the EHB.

The private market often is described as having three segments: the non-group, small-group, and large-group markets; and many of the ACA's provisions focus specifically on the non-group and small-group insurance markets. These reforms are intended to address perceived failures in those markets, such as limited access to coverage and higher costs of coverage relative to the large-group market pl ans, and to provide some parity with the large-group market. For example, benefit coverage in non-group and small-group market health plans generally was perceived to be limited in comparison to benefit coverage in large-group market health plans. Thus, to provide some similarity to plans in the large-group market, the ACA requires non-group and small-group health plans to offer the essential health benefits (EHB), which is a core package of health care services. ", "The EHB are one of the three components of the EHB package. The EHB package requires plans to (1) cover certain benefits (i.e., the essential health benefits); (2) comply with specific cost-sharing limitations; and (3) meet a certain generosity level.

", "The HHS Secretary has the purview to define and periodically update the EHB. However, in defining the EHB, the HHS Secretary must take a number of parameters into account. For example, the scope of the EHB is to be equivalent to the scope of benefits typically provided under an employer-sponsored insurance plan. To accomplish this task, the ACA requires the Secretary of the Department of Labor (DOL) to conduct surveys of employer-sponsored insurance plans to determine typical benefits and provide a summary of the findings to the HHS Secretary.

The HHS Secretary cannot make any coverage decisions, determine reimbursement rates, establish incentive programs, or design benefits in ways that discriminate against individuals because of their age, disability, or expected length of life. Furthermore, the HHS Secretary must take into account the diverse health care needs of the population, which includes women, children, persons with disabilities, and other groups.

The report is supposed to assess whether enrollees are facing any difficulty accessing services, either due to coverage or cost, and to consider whether the EHB need to be modified or updated due to changes in medical evidence or scientific advancement.
