There are many exceptions, however, in which federal courts, and occasionally federal agencies, may order the losing party to pay the attorneys' fees of the prevailing party. The major common law exception authorizes federal courts (not agencies) to order a losing party that acts in bad faith to pay the prevailing party's fees.", "There are also roughly two hundred statutory exceptions, which were generally enacted to encourage private litigation to implement public policy. Awards of attorneys' fees are often designed to help to equalize contests between private individual plaintiffs and corporate or governmental defendants. Thus, attorneys' fees provisions are most often found in civil rights, environmental protection, and consumer protection statutes.", "In addition, the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) makes the United States liable for attorneys' fees of up to $125 per hour in many court cases and administrative proceedings that it loses (and some that it wins) and fails to prove that its position was substantially justified. EAJA does not apply in tax cases, but a similar statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7430, does.", "Most Supreme Court decisions involving attorneys' fees have interpreted civil rights statutes, and this report focuses on these statutes. It also discusses awards of costs other than attorneys' fees in federal courts, how courts compute the amount of attorneys' fees to be awarded, statutory limitations on attorneys' fees, and other subjects. In addition, it sets forth the language of all federal attorneys' fees provisions, and includes a bibliography of congressional committee reports and hearings concerning attorneys' fees.", "In 1997, Congress enacted a statute allowing awards of attorneys' fees to some prevailing criminal defendants."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "I.

It has, however, numerous statutory exceptions (listed at the back of this report), some if not most of which Congress enacted in order to encourage private litigation to implement public policy. Id . at 263. Under these exceptions, a federal court (and sometimes a federal agency) may order the losing party to a lawsuit to pay the winning party's attorneys' fees. Although \"attorney's fees generally are not a recoverable cost of litigation 'absent explicit congressional authorization,' ... [t]he absence of specific reference to attorney's fees is not dispositive if the statute otherwise evinces an intent to provide for such fees.\"", "Fee-shifting has been proposed, not only to encourage lawsuits, but to discourage them, especially tort suits. The English \"loser pays\" rule was included in tort reform legislation proposed by the Bush Administration in 1992, and in \"The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act,\" which is part of the \"Contract With America\" proposed by the Republican House Members in 1994.", "The American rule has two major common law exceptions (instances when federal courts may award attorneys' fees without statutory authorization): the common benefit doctrine and the bad faith doctrine. These derive from the historic authority of the courts \"to do equity in a particular situation.\" This authority has been called the \"supervisory\" or \"inherent\" power of the federal courts.", "Federal courts may use this inherent power even in diversity cases, which are cases arising under state law that are brought in federal court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 when the parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc. , 501 U.S. 32 (1991). In Alyeska , the Court had written that, \"in the ordinary diversity case where the state law does not run counter to a valid federal statute or rule of court, and usually it will not, state law denying the right to attorney's fees or giving right thereto, which reflects a substantial policy of the state, should be followed.\" 421 U.S. at 259 n.31.

The two major exceptions are cases in which a party at its own expense creates a fund or achieves a substantial benefit in which others share, and cases in which a party acts in bad faith.

This exception to the American rule does not shift the cost of attorneys' fees to the losing party, but rather to those who benefit from the suit. The doctrine was originally conceived in Trustees v. Greenough , 105 U.S. 527 (1881), a case against trustees of 10 million or 11 million acres of land who had collusively sold hundreds of thousands of those acres at nominal prices. One beneficiary, after 11 years of litigation at his own expense, recaptured the assets and presented a claim for reimbursement of attorneys' fees. The Supreme Court approved the award, writing that \"if the complainant is not a trustee, he has at least acted the part of a trustee in relation to the common interest.\" Id. at 532.", "In Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co. , 396 U.S. 375, 392 (1970), the Supreme Court held that under the common benefit doctrine there is no requirement \"that the suit actually bring money into the court as a prerequisite to the court's power to order reimbursement of expenses.\" Mills was a stockholders' derivative suit, a type of case which, the Court noted, may bring substantial non-pecuniary benefits.", "Boeing Co. v. Van Gemert , 444 U.S. 472 (1980), was a successful class action in which over $3 million in damages were awarded. Some class members collected their shares of the damages, but others did not. The district court, invoking the common benefit doctrine, ordered that the plaintiffs' attorneys be awarded their fees from the total amount of the judgment, concluding that it was equitable for all class members\u2014claiming and non-claiming alike\u2014to bear a pro rata share of the costs of producing the judgment in their favor. The defendant objected to use of the unclaimed money for this purpose, arguing that the ultimate disposition of the unclaimed money had not been decided. But the Supreme Court affirmed the award of attorneys' fees, holding:", "The common-fund doctrine, as applied in this case, is entirely consistent with the American rule against taxing the losing party with the victor's attorney's fees.... Boeing presently has no interest in any part of the fund. Any right that Boeing may establish to the return of the money eventually claimed is contingent on the failure of the absentee class members to exercise their present rights of possession. Although Boeing itself cannot be obliged to pay fees awarded to the class lawyers, its latent claim against unclaimed money in the judgment fund may not defeat each class member's equitable obligation to share the expenses of litigation.", "Id. at 481-482."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bad Faith Exception", "paragraphs": ["In Hall v.

Subsequently, as another court wrote: \"Federal courts have applied [the bad faith] exception both when bad faith occurred in connection with the litigation and when it was an aspect of the conduct that gave rise to the lawsuit.\" However, some courts have refused to apply the bad faith exception to a party's underlying claim, noting that the Supreme Court's statement in Hall v.

If a court may tax counsel fees against a party who litigated in bad faith, it certainly may assess those expenses against counsel who willfully abuse judicial processes.... Like other sanctions, attorney's fees certainly should not be assessed lightly or without fair notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record. But in a proper case, such sanctions are within a court's powers.", "In Durrett v. Jenkins Brickyard, Inc. , 678 F.2d 911, 919 (11 th Cir. 1982), the court held \"that the Court in Roadway Express intended to authorize the assessment of attorney's fees against counsel who either willfully disobeyed a court order or acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\"", "In Roadway Express , the Supreme Court also noted that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b), \"[b]oth parties and counsel may be held personally liable for expenses, 'including attorney's fees,' caused by the failure to comply with discovery orders.\" 447 U.S. at 763. The Court also found that only excess costs, not attorneys' fees, could be assessed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927, which provided that any attorney \"who so multiplies the proceedings in any case so as to increase costs unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the courts to satisfy personally such excess costs.\" However, the section soon after was amended by P.L. 96-349 , \u00a7 3, to permit awards of attorneys' fees as well as excess costs against counsel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Attorney General Doctrine", "paragraphs": ["The private attorney general doctrine provides that a plaintiff \"should be awarded attorneys' fees when he has effectuated a strong Congressional policy which has benefited a large class of people, and where further the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award essential.\" Many of the statutory exceptions to the American rule are based on this concept. In Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc. , 390 U.S. 400, 402 (1968), the Supreme Court, discussing one such exception, wrote:", "If successful plaintiffs were routinely forced to bear their own attorneys' fees, few aggrieved parties would be in a position to advance the public interest by invoking the injunctive power of the federal courts.

Alyeska at 270 n.46. In Alyeska , however, the Court held:", "[C]ongressional utilization of the private attorney general concept can in no sense be construed as a grant of authority to the Judiciary to jettison the traditional rule against non-statutory allowances to the prevailing party and to award attorneys' fees whenever the court deems the public policy furthered by a particular statute important enough to warrant the award.", "421 U.S. at 263.", "The primary reasons the Court gave for its decision were the difficulty \"for the courts without legislative guidance to consider some statutes important and some unimportant\" and the fact that \"the rational application of the private-attorney-general rule would immediately collide with the express provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412,\" which at the time prohibited fee awards against the United States, except when specifically permitted by statute. Id. at 263-266.", "Congress's immediate response to Alyeska was enactment of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which is discussed below.

Prior to enactment of EAJA, the common law exceptions to the American rule were inapplicable against the United States. Even statutory exceptions to the American rule were inapplicable against the United States unless they specifically authorized fee awards against the United States.", "EAJA allows awards of attorneys' fees against the United States in two broad situations. The first, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), makes the United States liable for the prevailing party's attorneys' fees to the same extent that any other party would be under the common law and statutory exceptions to the American rule, including the statutory exceptions that do not specifically authorize fee awards against the United States. This provision, unlike the rest of EAJA, contains no limitations on the assets or number of employees of parties eligible to recover fees, and no maximum hourly rate for fee awards.", "The second broad situation in which EAJA authorizes fee awards against the United States is codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 504 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02412(d). These sections provide that, in specified agency adjudications and in all civil actions (except tort actions and tax cases) brought by or against the United States, the United States shall be liable for the attorneys' fees of prevailing parties, unless it proves that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.", "This second portion of EAJA contains two limitations on fee awards that are not found in \u00a7 2412(b). First, it prescribes a fee cap unless the court or agency determines that a special factor justifies a higher fee. (Most fee statutes authorize awards of \"reasonable\" fees, with the court determining the amount.) The cap was originally $75 per hour, but P.L. 104-121 , \u00a7\u00a7 231-233, increased it to $125 per hour for cases commenced on or after the date of its enactment, which was March 29, 1996. Second, this portion of EAJA does not allow (with two exceptions) fees to be awarded to individuals whose net worth exceeds $2 million, or to businesses or organizations, including units of local government, with a net worth exceeding $7 million or more than 500 employees.

Fees and expenses awarded under this paragraph shall be paid only as a consequence of appropriations provided in advance.", "This provision thus authorizes fee awards in favor of losing parties and in that respect is unique in the law of attorneys' fees.", "In Pierce v. Underwood , 487 U.S. 552 (1988), the Supreme Court decided three issues concerning EAJA: (1) the applicable standard of appellate review, (2) the meaning of \"substantially justified,\" and (3) the \"special factors\" that allow a court to award more than $75 per hour.", "(1) Standard of Review . Pierce v. Underwood addressed the standard that a federal court of appeals applies in reviewing a decision of a federal district court under EAJA. Either party may appeal a district court's decision under EAJA, and, as the Supreme Court explained:", "For purposes of standard of review, decisions by judges are traditionally divided into three categories, denominated questions of law (reviewable de novo ), questions of fact (reviewable for clear error), and matters of discretion (reviewable for \"abuse of discretion\").", "487 U.S. at 558.", "The Supreme Court found that EAJA did not provide a clear prescription as to the appropriate standard of review (unlike, for example, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01988(b), which provides that \"the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party ... a reasonable attorney's fee\"). The Court, therefore, for a variety of reasons, held that the \"abuse of discretion\" standard was most appropriate for appeals of EAJA court decisions.", "Awards of attorneys' fees under EAJA at the agency level may be appealed to a court only by the prevailing party, not by the United States. The statute, at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0504(c)(2), provides:", "The court's determination on any appeal heard under this paragraph shall be based solely on the factual record made before the agency. The court may modify the determination of fees and other expenses only if the court finds that the failure to make an award of fees and other expenses, or the calculation of the amount of the award, was unsupported by substantial evidence.", "Prior to the 1985 amendments to EAJA, this provision stated that the court could modify an agency decision only if it found \"an abuse of discretion.\" It was intended that the new standard\u2014\"unsupported by substantial evidence\"\u2014permit \"a broader scope of review ... consistent with the normal scope of judicial review of agency actions.\"", "(2) \" substantially justified. \" The United States may avoid liability for attorneys' fees under EAJA by proving that its position \"was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0504(a)(1), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). The legislative history of the original EAJA stated that \"[t]he test of whether the Government position is substantially justified is essentially one of reasonableness in law and fact.\" Twelve of the thirteen federal circuits subsequently interpreted \"substantially justified\" to mean reasonable. See , Pierce v. Underwood , 487 U.S. at 565-566. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was the exception. It reasoned:", "The Senate Judiciary Committee considered and rejected an amendment to the bill that would have changed the pertinent language from \"substantially justified\" to \"reasonably justified.\" S.Rept. 96-253 [96 th Cong., 1 st sess.] at 8. That refusal suggests that the test should, in fact, be slightly more stringent than \"one of reasonableness.\"", "According to this view, the government's position may be reasonable, yet fail to be substantially justified, making it easier to recover fees under the substantially justified standard than under a reasonableness standard. The 1985 amendments to EAJA did not alter the text of the substantially justified language, but an accompanying committee report expressed support for the D.C. Circuit's interpretation:", "Several courts have held correctly that \"substantial justification\" means more than merely reasonable. Because in 1980 Congress rejected a standard of \"reasonably justified\" in favor of \"substantially justified,\" the test must be more than just reasonableness.", "The Supreme Court in Pierce v. Underwood held that substantially justified means reasonable. The Court found that a \"more than mere reasonableness\" test would be \"out of accord with prior usage\" and \"unadministerable.\" \"Between the test of reasonableness,\" the Court wrote, \"and a test such as 'clearly and convincingly justified' ... there is simply no accepted stopping-place, no ledge that can hold the anchor for steady and consistent judicial behavior.\" 487 U.S. at 568. The Court found that the 1985 committee report was not controlling because it was neither \"(1) an authoritative interpretation of what the 1980 statute meant, or (2) an authoritative expression of what the 1985 Congress intended.\" Id. at 566.", "(3) Exceeding $75 (now $125) per hour. EAJA provides that fees \"shall be based upon prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished,\" but \"shall not be awarded in excess of $75 [$125 for cases commenced on or after March 29, 1996] per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.\" 28 U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a02412(d)(2)(A)(ii). (The same cap applies in agency proceedings; see , 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0504(b)(1)(A)). The Court in Pierce v. Underwood held:", "If \"the limited availability of qualified attorneys for the proceedings involved\" meant merely that lawyers skilled and experienced enough to try the case are in short supply, it would effectively eliminate the $75 cap\u2014since the \"prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished\" are obviously determined by the relative supply and quality of services.... We think it refers to attorneys having some distinctive knowledge or specialized skill needful for the litigation in question\u2014as opposed to an extraordinary level of the general lawyerly knowledge and ability useful in all litigation. Examples of the former would be an identifiable practice specialty such as patent law, or knowledge of foreign law or language.", "487 U.S. at 571-572.", "As for other \"special factors,\" the Court wrote:", "For the same reason of the need to preserve the intended effectiveness of the $75 cap, we think the other \"special factors\" envisioned by the exception must be such as are not of broad and general application. We need not specify what they might be....", "Id . at 573.", "The Court, however, specified some items which are not special factors for purposes of exceeding the $75 per hour cap: \"the novelty and difficulty of issues,\" \"the undesirability of the case,\" \"the work and ability of counsel,\" \"the results obtained,\" \"customary fees and awards in other cases,\" and \"the contingent nature of the fee.\" All these \"are factors applicable to a broad spectrum of litigation; they are little more than routine reasons why market rates are what they are.\" Id .", "In Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Jean , 496 U.S. 154 (1990), the Supreme Court held that, under EAJA, a prevailing party may recover attorneys' fees for services rendered in seeking a fee award without regard to whether the position of the United States was substantially justified. If the prevailing party is entitled to fees in the main action, then he is automatically entitled to fees for the time spent seeking fees.

Principi , 541 U.S. 401 (2004), the Supreme Court addressed EAJA's requirement that fee applications be filed \"within thirty days of final judgment in the action,\" and \"allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). The Court held that, when a fee application is filed within 30 days, but fails to allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified, the application may be amended to remedy the oversight, even after the 30 days have elapsed.", "In Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff , 128 S. Ct. 2007, 2019 (2008), the Supreme Court held that, under EAJA, \"a prevailing party ... may recover its paralegal fees from the Government at prevailing market rates.\" The lower court, which the Supreme Court reversed, had held that the prevailing party could recover fees for paralegal services only at their cost to the party's attorney.", "Source of Fees Paid by the Government", "Both agency-awarded and court-awarded fees are \"paid by the agency over which the party prevails from any funds made available to the agency by appropriation or otherwise.\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a0504(d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(4).

It has been held that, in settled cases in which courts are called upon to determine entitlement to attorneys' fees, judges should engage in \"a close scrutiny of the totality of circumstances surrounding the settlement, focusing particularly on the necessity for bringing the action and whether the party is the successful party with respect to the central issue.\" Use of this standard will prevent fee awards in \"nuisance settlements.\"", "In Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v.

The Court concluded that, under \u00a7 1988(b), although \"a person may in some circumstances be a 'prevailing party' without having obtained a favorable 'final judgment following a full trial on the merits,'\" a party must have \"established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims, either in the trial court or on appeal.\" Being granted the right to a new trial was not a victory on the merits; nor were any favorable procedural or evidentiary rulings victories on the merits, even though they may affect the disposition on the merits.", "In Rhodes v.

The question before the Court however was whether a pro se litigant who is an attorney is entitled to fees under \u00a7 1988(b).

The plaintiffs in this case had prevailed in a federal administrative proceeding under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and sought to recover fees under \u00a7\u00a01988(b) in an independent action in federal court. It might have been expected that the Supreme Court would decide whether \u00a7\u00a01988(b) authorized an award of attorneys' fees incurred at the administrative level on the basis of whether an administrative proceeding under Title VI was mandatory, and therefore was a proceeding to enforce Title VI.

In Crest Street , however, the Court referred to this comment in Gaslight as \"dicta\" ( id . at 13), presumably because the plaintiff in Gaslight had filed a court action not solely to recover fees. The Court in Crest Street added:", "Moreover, we now believe that the paradoxical nature of this result may have been exaggerated. There are many types of behavior that may lead others to comply with civil rights laws. For example, an employee, after talking to his lawyer, may choose to discuss hiring or promotion practices with an employer, and as a result of this discussion the employer may alter those practices to comply more fully with employment discrimination laws. In some sense it may be considered anomalous that this employee's initiative would not be awarded with attorney's fees. But an award of attorney's fees under \u00a7\u00a01988 depends not only on the results obtained, but also on what actions were needed to achieve those results. It is entirely reasonable to limit the award of attorney's fees to those parties who, in order to obtain relief, found it necessary to file a complaint in court.", "Id . at 14.", "The dissent in Crest Street , apart from disagreeing with the majority's interpretation of the language and the legislative history of \u00a7\u00a01988(b), argued that the effect of the decision would be to burden federal courts by causing parties who are not required to exhaust administrative remedies to \"immediately file suit in federal court to protect any possible claim for attorney's fees should they subsequently prevail.\" Id . at 21. In Gaslight , in fact, the Court had acknowledged \"that if fees were authorized only when the complainant found an independent reason for suing in federal court under Title VII, such a ground almost always could be found.\" 447 U.S. at 66 n.6. Thus, Crest Street may have little practical import for Title VII.", "It may also be argued that the reasoning of Crest Street does not even apply to Title VII. Although \u00a7 1988(b) was modeled on the attorneys' fees provision of Title VII, there is a difference in their language that may be relevant. Section 1988(b) provides that a court may award attorneys' fees in any action or proceeding \"to enforce\" various civil rights statutes. Title VII, by contrast, says that a court may award fees in any action or proceeding \"under this title\" (as enacted) or \"under this subchapter\" (as codified), in either case referring to Title VII itself. Arguably, a suit solely to recover fees incurred in an administrative proceeding under Title VII is an action or proceeding under Title VII, even though a suit solely to recover fees incurred in an administrative proceeding under Title VI is not an action or proceeding to enforce Title VI. However, this may be an overly literal reading in that when the attorneys' fees provision in Title VII refers to an action or proceeding \"under\" Title VII, it may not have been intended that it refer to itself, but rather only to the rest of Title VII.", "The Supreme Court, in Gaslight , of course, has already interpreted this language and concluded that it \"encompasses a suit solely to obtain an award of attorney's fees for legal work done in state and local proceedings.\" Yet in Crest Street the Court labeled as \"dicta\" its statement in Gaslight that to hold otherwise would be anomalous.

Of course, only if a court may award fees incurred at the administrative level will the question arise whether the agency itself may award such fees.

The court of appeals in Crest Street , in addition, citing the fact that \u00a7 1988(b) on its face authorizes only \"the court\" to award fees, said in dicta that \"it follows that plaintiffs must apply to a court for their fees.\" 769 F.2d at 1033 (emphasis in original). However, in Smith v. Califano , 446 F. Supp. 530 (D.D.C. 1978), the court held that an agency could award fees in a Title VII proceeding. It wrote:", "Title VII is a statute in which Congress already has specifically provided for an award of attorneys' fees. Although the expression of that exception [to the American Rule] is contained in the remedial authority of the courts, the rights protected by the courts are the very same rights the agencies are to protect. Thus, finding authority for the agency also to award counsel fees to one who prevails at the administrative level would not create a \"far-reaching\" exception to the Rule. Rather, it would make the existing exception applicable regardless of the stage at which that federal right is protected.", "Id . at 532-533.", "In addition, the court noted:", "[A]lthough Title VII does not expressly state that an agency may award attorneys' fees, it does state that [in proceedings brought by federal employees] the agency is to enforce the Act \"through appropriate remedies ... as will effectuate the policies of this section....\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02000e-16(b) (Supp. V 1975). Because the \"make-whole\" concept is one of those policies, this provision can be read to permit the agency to award attorneys' fees, thereby making whole one who appears before it.", "Id. at 533.", "This decision was followed in two other Title VII cases. However, two other cases in the same district came to the contrary conclusion, holding that a party who prevails at the agency level under Title VII must go to court to recover his fees.

No reported case appears to have challenged the EEOC's authority to promulgate this regulation.", "An argument may be made, however, that, if the reasoning of Crest Street applies to Title VII, then the legality of these regulations would be placed in doubt. For, if the reasoning of Crest Street applies, which means that courts may not award attorneys' fees incurred by parties who prevail at the administrative level, then the only basis for an agency to award fees would be the \"appropriate remedies\" provision. It is not clear, however, that Smith v. Califano would have reached the same result in the absence of the statute's authorizing courts to award fees. If, under Crest Street , courts cannot award fees to parties who prevail in administrative proceedings under Title VII, then to allow agencies to award fees apparently would constitute a \"far-reaching\" exception to the American rule. Before an agency may order a litigant to bear his adversary's expenses, \"it must be granted clear statutory power by Congress.\" The power to employ \"appropriate remedies\" might not be sufficient.", "Two lower court cases have addressed the question of the recoverability of fees in administrative proceedings under the Rehabilitation Act.

In Watson v. United States Veterans Administration , 88 F.R.D. 267 (C.D. Cal. 1980), a district court held that the agency itself could award fees under \u00a7 501 of the act.

Notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, however, a state may be sued for damages in federal court for violations of laws enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.

Thiboutot , however, held that \u00a7\u00a01983 permits assertion of claims arising under both civil rights and non-civil rights laws. This raises the question whether claims arising under non-civil rights laws should be considered as having been brought under a law enacted to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the laws under which they arise may be enforced through the use of \u00a7\u00a01983. The Court did not have to answer this question in Maine v. Thiboutot because that case was brought in state court, where the Eleventh Amendment does not apply.", "Maher v. Gagne the Court also avoided the question, but for a different reason. This case was brought in federal court, and, like Maine v. Thiboutot , it charged a state with having violated a non-civil rights law. However, the plaintiff in Maher v. Gagne also raised a constitutional claim, and that was decisive. Prior to trial, the case was settled favorably for the plaintiff, without the constitutional issue's being reached. The state argued that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited a fee award because the case involved a purely statutory, non-civil rights claim. The Court held, however, that, under \u00a7 1988(b), a federal court, notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, may award attorneys' \"fees in a case in which the plaintiff prevails on a wholly statutory, non-civil rights claim pendent to a substantial constitutional claim or in one in which both a statutory and a substantial constitutional claim are settled favorably to the plaintiff without adjudication.\" Id. at 132.

In this respect, \u00a7 7430 is similar to EAJA, discussed above. In other respects, however, it is different, and the law governing awards of attorneys' fees in tax cases has undergone multiple changes since Congress first authorized fee-shifting in tax cases in 1976.", "Awards of attorneys' fees in tax cases were first permitted by the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which authorized federal courts to award attorneys' fees to a prevailing party, other than the United States, \"in any civil action or proceeding, by or on behalf of the United States of America, to enforce, or charging a violation of, a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code.\" This provision, commonly known as the \"Allen amendment,\" had little effect because of its limitation to tax cases brought \"by or on behalf of the United States.\" Although in several circumstances the United States may bring suit under the Internal Revenue Code, in the vast majority of tax cases the taxpayer is the plaintiff. See Key Buick Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue , 613 F.2d 1306 (5 th Cir. 1980). Even in those cases that are brought by or on behalf of the United States in which the taxpayer is the defendant, a prevailing defendant is entitled to fees under \u00a7\u00a01988(b) only upon a finding that the action is \"meritless in the sense that it is groundless or without foundation.\" Hughes v.

EAJA instead itself authorized federal courts to award attorneys' fees against the United States in tax cases, except those brought in Tax Court. This exception had not been explicit in the act, but a committee report indicated that the courts empowered by the act to award attorneys' fees \"are those defined in section 451 of title 28,\" and the Tax Court is not among them. Apart from this, awards of attorneys' fees in tax cases could be awarded under the same conditions as other awards against the United States under the EAJA: a prevailing plaintiff whose net worth was within the prescribed limits was entitled to an award up to $75 per hour (or more if a special factor justified a higher fee) unless the United States proved that its position was substantially justified or that special circumstances made an award unjust.", "Next, \u00a7 292 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), P.L. 97-248 , made the EAJA inapplicable to tax cases and enacted \u00a7 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 7430 authorized fee awards in federal courts, including Tax Court, placed a cap of $25,000 on fee awards, and authorized awards only if the taxpayer proved that the position of the United States was \"unreasonable.\" It contained no limits on hourly rates or the net worth of eligible plaintiffs.

Then, in 1988, P.L. 100-647 , \u00a76239, amended \u00a7 7430 to apply in administrative, as well as court, proceedings.", "The 1986 Act, while not placing tax cases back within the EAJA, amended \u00a7\u00a07430 to make it more like the EAJA. Section 7430, as amended in 1988 and 1996, provides that, in any administrative or court proceeding brought by or against the United States, in connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, interest, or penalty under the Internal Revenue Code, the prevailing party, other than the United States or a creditor of the taxpayer, may be awarded litigation costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees.

In Hans v. Louisiana , 134 U.S. 1 (1890), the Supreme Court construed the Eleventh Amendment to prohibit a citizen from suing even his own state in federal court. In Alden v. Maine , 527 U.S. 706 (1999), the Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Amendment prevents Congress from authorizing private suits against a state, even in its own courts, without the state's consent. Notwithstanding the Eleventh Amendment, a state may consent to suit by its citizens or citizens of other states. Missouri v. Fiske , 290 U.S. 18, 24 (1933).", "In Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123 (1908), the Supreme Court held that federal courts may enjoin state officials as individuals from enforcing state laws that violate the United States Constitution. The Court reasoned that an official who attempts such action \"comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subject in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.\" Id. at 159-160. One commentator noted:", "The idea that the court restrained the individual rather than the state was, of course, pure fiction, since the state could not act other than through its officials. But through this fiction the Court apparently sought to guarantee the nation's authority to limit state action.", "In Edelman v. Jordan , 415 U.S. 651 (1974), the Supreme Court explicitly limited the types of relief that may be granted under the theory of Ex parte Young . The plaintiffs in Edelman had sued state officials, alleging that the officials were administering a welfare program in a manner inconsistent with various federal regulations. The district court found for the plaintiffs and ordered the state officials to comply with federal regulations in the future and to disburse all benefits wrongfully withheld in the past. The court of appeals affirmed. The Supreme Court affirmed the prospective portion of the district court's order, but reversed the retroactive portion of the order, holding that because the award \"must inevitably come from the general revenues of the State of Illinois,\" it \"resembles far more closely the monetary award against the State itself ... than it does the prospective injunctive relief awarded in Ex parte Young .\" Id. at 665. The Court acknowledged that \"the difference between the type of relief barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that permitted under Ex parte Young will not in many instances be that between day and night.\" Id. at 667. This is evidenced by the fact that the prospective portion of the district court's order, as well as the retroactive portion, necessarily required the payment of state funds, but this the Court termed a permissible \"ancillary effect\" of the prospective order.", "In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer , 427 U.S. 445, 456 (1976), the Supreme Court lessened the importance of its ruling in Edelman by holding that the Eleventh Amendment is \"necessarily limited by the enforcement provisions of \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" In Fitzpatrick the plaintiffs had sued a state official under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was enacted under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and which includes a fee-shifting provision. Like the plaintiffs in Edelman , the plaintiffs in Fitzpatrick had sought prospective injunctive relief and retroactive benefits; in addition, in Fitzpatrick they had sought attorneys' fees. The district court awarded only the prospective relief, holding that the other relief was barred by Edelman . The court of appeals agreed that Edelman barred an award of retroactive benefits, but held that an award of attorneys' fees was a permissible ancillary benefit.", "The Supreme Court did not decide whether an award of attorneys' fees constituted an impermissible retroactive benefit or a permissible ancillary benefit. Instead, it reversed the denial of retroactive benefits, holding that neither they nor an award of attorneys' fees were barred in situations in which Congress, under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, had provided for suits against states or state officials. The Supreme Court held, in other words, that the constitutional power of Congress to enforce \"by appropriate legislation\" the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to supersede the Eleventh Amendment and allow congressionally authorized suits (and awards of attorneys' fees) against both states and state officials.", "In Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon , 473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985), the Supreme Court held \"that Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\" Subsequently, Congress made explicit that states are not immune under the Eleventh Amendment from suits in federal court under any \"Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-7.", "In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. , 491 U.S. 1 (1989), the Supreme Court held that Congress also has the authority to override states' Eleventh Amendment immunity when legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause. However, in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida , 517 U.S. 44, 72 (1996), the Supreme Court overruled Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. , writing: \"Even when the Constitution vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting States.\" The Court noted, however, that \"an individual may [still] obtain injunctive relief under Ex parte Young in order to remedy a state officer's ongoing violation of federal law.\" Id . at 72 n.16.", "In Alden v. Maine , 527 U.S. 706, 712 (1999), the Supreme Court held \"that the powers delegated to Congress under Article I of the United States Constitution do not include the power to subject nonconsenting States to private suits for damages in state courts.\" This decision continues to allow the federal government to sue the states in federal or state courts, and continues to allow private suits for damages in state courts under statutes enacted pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.", "In Hutto v. Finney , 437 U.S. 678 (1978), the Supreme Court affirmed two awards of attorneys' fees against the State of Arkansas: a $20,000 award by a federal district court and a $2,500 award for services on appeal by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The district court based its award on the bad faith exception to the American rule. The court of appeals affirmed this award on the basis of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), which had been enacted while the appeal was pending, although the court of appeals noted that the award would have been justified under the bad faith exception. 548 F.2d 740, 742 n.6.", "Because \u00a7 1988(b) is a statute enacted pursuant to \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Fitzpatrick held that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to such statutes, the Supreme Court apparently could have affirmed the district court fee award in Hutto on the basis of \u00a7 1988(b) merely by finding that \u00a7\u00a01988(b) permitted awards of attorneys' fees against the states. The Court chose, however, to affirm on the basis of the bad faith exception. As the bad faith exception is a common law rule, not enacted pursuant to a statute that abrogates Eleventh Amendment immunity, the Court had to address the Eleventh Amendment question. It held that the district court award served the same purpose as a remedial fine imposed for civil contempt and did not constitute a retroactive monetary award, and therefore was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment under Edelman .", "In Missouri v. Jenkins , 491 U.S. 274, 280 (1989), the Supreme Court made clear that the \"holding of Hutto ... was not just that Congress had spoken sufficiently clearly to overcome Eleventh Amendment immunity in enacting \u00a7\u00a01988, but rather that the Eleventh Amendment did not apply to an award of attorney's fees ancillary to a grant of prospective relief.\" The holding of Missouri was that the Eleventh Amendment also does not apply to the calculation of the amount of a fee award and therefore does not prohibit enhancement of a fee award against a state to compensate for delay in payment.", "The $2,500 court of appeals award in Hutto was made solely pursuant to \u00a7\u00a01988(b), and in affirming this award the Court held that Congress intended \u00a7\u00a01988(b) to permit awards of attorneys' fees against the states. The Court based this conclusion on the legislative history of \u00a7 1988(b) and on the fact that \u00a7 1988(b) provides for fee awards \"as part of the costs,\" and \"[c]osts have traditionally been awarded without regard for the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\" Id . at 695.

Georgia Highway Express, Inc. , 488 F.2d 714 (1974), involved consideration of 12 factors. Johnson was widely followed by other courts, and was cited with approval by both the House and the Senate when [42 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1988 was enacted.... Setting attorney's fees by reference to a series of sometimes subjective factors placed unlimited discretion in trial judges and produced disparate results.", "For this reason, the Third Circuit developed another method of calculating \"reasonable\" attorney's fees. This method, known as the \"lodestar\" approach, involved two steps. First, the court was to calculate the \"lodestar,\" determined by multiplying the hours spent on a case by a reasonable hourly rate of compensation for each attorney involved. Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp. , 487 F. 2d 161, 167 (CA3 1973) ( Lindy I ). Second, using the lodestar figure as a starting point, the court could then make adjustments to this figure, in light of \"(1) the contingent nature of the case, reflecting the likelihood that hours were invested and expenses incurred without assurance of compensation; and (2) the quality of the work performed as evidenced by the work observed, the complexity of the issues and the recovery obtained.\"...", "We first addressed the question of the proper manner in which to determine a \"reasonable\" attorney's fee in Hensley v. Eckerhart , 461 U.S. 424 (1983). We there adopted a hybrid approach that shared elements of both the Johnson and the lodestar method of calculation. \"The most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate....\" To this extent, the method endorsed in Hensley follows the Third Circuit's description of the first step of the lodestar approach. Moreover, we went on to state: \"The product of reasonable hours times a reasonable rate does not end the inquiry. There remain other considerations that may lead the district court to adjust the fee upward or downward.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. We then took a more expansive view of what those \"other considerations\" might be, however, noting that \"[t]he district court also may consider [the] factors identified in Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc. , 488 F. 2d 714, 717-719 (CA5 1974), though it should note that many of these factors usually are subsumed within the initial calculation of hours reasonably expended at a reasonable hourly rate.\" Id. at 434, n. 9 (citation omitted).", "We further refined our views in Blum v. Stenson , 465 U.S. 886 (1984).... Blum also limited the factors which a district court may consider in determining whether to make adjustments to the lodestar amount. Expanding on our earlier finding in Hensley that many of the Johnson factors \"are subsumed within the initial calculation\" of the lodestar, we specifically held in Blum that the \"novelty [and] complexity of the issues,\" \"the special skill and experience of counsel,\" the \"quality of representation,\" and the \"results obtained\" from the litigation are presumably fully reflected in the lodestar amount and thus cannot serve as independent bases for increasing the basic fee award. 465 U.S., at 898-900. Although upward adjustments of the lodestar figure are still permissible, id. at 901, such modifications are proper only in certain \"rare\" and \"exceptional\" cases, supported by both \"specific evidence\" on the record and detailed findings by the lower courts.", "In short, the lodestar figure includes most, if not all of the relevant factors comprising a \"reasonable\" attorney's fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance the fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling plaintiffs to secure legal assistance.", "In Delaware Valley I , the Court indicated that to be entitled to an upward adjustment, a prevailing party must show that it would have been unable \"to obtain counsel without any promise of reward for extraordinary performance.\" It must present \"specific evidence as to what made the results it obtained ... so 'outstanding.'\" It must show \"that the lodestar figure ... was far below awards made in similar cases where the court found equally superior quality of performance.\" Finally, to adjust a fee upward, a court must make \"detailed findings as to why the lodestar amount was unreasonable, and in particular as to why the quality of representation was not reflected in the number of hours times the reasonable hourly rate.\" 478 U.S. at 567-568. The Court left open \"the question of upward adjustment ... based\u00a0on the likelihood of success, or to put it another way, the risk of loss.\" Id . at 568.

Pennsylvania v. Delaware Valley Citizens ' Council for Clean Air ( Delaware Valley II) , 483 U.S. 711 (1987), which was a 4-1-4 decision. Justice O'Connor concurred in parts of each plurality, which makes her opinion pivotal in determining what a majority of the Court decided in the case. Five justices (Justice O'Connor and the four who joined Justice Blackmun's dissent) decided that upward adjustments generally are appropriate in contingency fee cases. However, five justices (Justice O'Connor and the four who joined Justice White's plurality), decided that, even if \"typical fee-shifting statutes are construed to permit supplementing the lodestar in appropriate cases by paying counsel for assuming the risk of nonpayment ... it was error to do so in this case.\" 483 U.S. at 728.", "Subsequently, however, in Burlington v. Dague , 505 U.S. 557, 567 (1992), the Court, \"[a]dopting the position set forth in Justice White's opinion in Delaware Valley II ,\" held \"that enhancement for contingency is not permitted under the fee-shifting statutes at issue.\" Those statutes were \u00a7\u00a07002(e) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6972(e), and \u00a7 505(d) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(d).

If the contingent fee is higher, then, the Supreme Court held in Venegas v. Mitchell , 495 U.S. 82 (1990), the defendant is liable only for the \"reasonable\" fee, but the plaintiff must still pay his lawyer the higher contingent fee.

It would seem to follow that, in the Blanchard situation, where the \"reasonable\" fee is higher, the prevailing party may keep the difference between the \"reasonable\" fee paid by the defendant and the amount owed under the contingent fee agreement.

Under the Equal Access to Justice Act and under the Internal Revenue Code, awards ordinarily are limited to $125 per hour. Apart from this, fee awards against the United States are calculated the same way as fee awards against other parties. Copeland v. Marshall , 641 F.2d 880 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ( en banc ).

In addition, the plaintiff must pay the defendant's costs incurred after such time.", "In Marek v.

The Court held that, if a lawsuit is brought under a statute, such as \u00a7 1988(b), that provides for awards of attorneys' fees as part of the costs, then the term \"costs\" in Rule 68 includes attorneys' fees. The Court viewed this as the \"'plain meaning' interpretation of the interplay between Rule 68 and \u00a7\u00a01988.\" Id . at 9.", "Though, under Marek v. Chesney , a prevailing civil rights plaintiff who has rejected a settlement offer for as much as he won must pay the defendant's post-offer costs, he never has to pay the defendant's post-offer attorneys' fees.

Chesney means that Rule 68 creates an exception not only to Rule 54(d), but also to all statutes that authorize awards of attorneys' fees to prevailing parties as part of the costs. Under Marek v. Chesny , a prevailing plaintiff otherwise entitled to recover attorneys' fees under one of these statutes is not entitled to recover attorneys' fees incurred after an offer to settle was made if the prevailing plaintiff rejected the offer and then won no more than had been offered.", "The dissent in Marek v.

If it defines \"costs\" to include attorneys' fees, then attorneys' fees incurred after an offer would not be recoverable by plaintiffs who reject a settlement offer and then fail to win more than they had been offered. If it defines \"costs\" to exclude attorneys' fees, then such parties would lose their opportunity under Rule 54(d) to be awarded costs incurred after an offer, but would retain their entitlement to an award of attorneys' fees.", "Alternatively, Congress could amend individual attorneys' fees statutes to provide that attorneys' fees may be awarded either as part of the costs or in addition to costs. It will also have to make this decision with respect to attorneys' fees statutes it enacts in the future. In the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, P.L. 99-372 , which was enacted after Marek v. Chesny , Congress adopted a compromise approach to settlement offers. It included a provision modeled on Rule 68 that bars recovery of attorneys' fees and costs of plaintiffs who reject settlement offers, and applies to administrative proceedings as well as to civil actions under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (formerly the Education of the Handicapped Act; see ch. VII of this report). However, it allows a prevailing plaintiff who would otherwise forfeit costs and attorneys' fees to recover them nevertheless if he had been substantially justified in rejecting a settlement offer. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a01415(e)(4)(D).

Evans was a class action brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking injunctive relief concerning the conditions of mentally and emotionally handicapped children institutionalized by the State of Idaho. One week before trial, the defendant offered the plaintiffs virtually all the injunctive relief they had sought\u2014on condition that the plaintiffs waive their claim to fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). The plaintiff's lawyer \"determined that his ethical obligation to his clients mandated acceptance of the proposal\" ( Id . at 722), but he requested the district court to approve the settlement except for the provision on costs and attorneys' fees. (Class action settlements must be approved by the court under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.) The district court upheld the fee waiver, but the court of appeals reversed on the ground that \u00a7 1988(b) \"normally requires an award of fees to prevailing plaintiffs in civil rights actions, including those who have prevailed through settlement.

In the meantime, other avenues of relief are available.... Indeed, several Bar Associations have already declared it unethical for defense counsel to seek fee waivers....

Beach , 26 Conn. 355, 366 (1857).

And what is true for plaintiffs also holds true for defendants: the cost of defending against an unjust small claim may easily exceed the cost of simply paying what is demanded. The result is distasteful, for it ranks legal rights by dollar value....\" Court Awarded Attorney ' s Fees and Equal Access to the Courts , 122 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 636, 650 (1974).", "Requiring the loser to pay the winner's attorneys' fees might encourage litigation of some meritorious claims and discourage litigation of some nonmeritorious ones. On the other hand, the uncertainty of litigation might also lead to the opposite results. \"[T]he poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents' counsel.\" Fleischmann , supra . In addition, non-meritorious claims might be encouraged by the prospect of avoiding the expense of a lawyer. However, it has also been argued in support of requiring losers to pay winners' lawyers' fees that, while conceding the uncertainty of litigation, it should be assumed that courts will more often than not arrive at a correct result. Otherwise, courts might as well be dispensed with entirely, as it would be cheaper and less time-consuming simply to flip a coin.", "In support of the American rule it has also been argued that \"the time, expense, and difficulties of proof inherent in litigating the question of what constitutes reasonable attorney's fees would pose substantial burdens for judicial administration.\" Fleischmann , supra . Since this comment was made, however, Congress has enacted many fee-shifting statutes that require courts to determine what constitutes a reasonable fee.", "It has also been argued that abandonment of the American rule might have serious consequences for developing areas of the law, since potential litigants might be loath to espouse novel legal theories for fear of incurring additional expenses if they do not prevail.", "Finally, since the prospect of an award of attorneys' fees might at times encourage suits and at other times deter them, the crowding of court calendars has been cited as an argument both for and against the American rule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "XVII.

(These are spelled out in ch. III, supra .) The burden of proof under EAJA is on the United States to prove that its position was substantially justified; the burden of proof under P.L. 105-119 is on the prevailing defendant to prove that the position of the United States was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith. \"[A] determination that a prosecution was 'vexatious' for the purposes of the Hyde Amendment requires both a showing that the criminal case was objectively deficient, in that it lacked either legal merit or factual foundation, and a showing that the government's conduct, when viewed objectively, manifests maliciousness or an intent to harass or annoy.\"", "P.L. 105-119 does not define \"prevailing party,\" so the courts may have to determine whether it includes, for example, a defendant against whom charges are dropped prior to trial, a defendant who is convicted of a lesser charge than the one brought, or a defendant whose conviction is reversed on appeal. One court has held that a defendant was \"not a 'prevailing party' because he was not acquitted or otherwise exonerated. Defendant voluntarily settled his case with the advice of counsel by signing the Diversion Agreement, under which Defendant acknowledged paying the 'capping' fee, paid restitution, performed community service and submitted to 'probation-like reporting.'\" Another court rejected \"the Government's call for a bright-line rule that a dismissal without prejudice can never render a defendant a prevailing party under the statute.\" It also held that the EAJA requirement \"of a 'final judgment' is incorporated into the Hyde Amendment. Using this term, the Court further finds that, under the facts present here, both the dismissals with and without prejudice are final judgments under the Hyde Amendment. If the Court were to accept the Government's position that a dismissal without prejudice is never a 'final judgment' under the Hyde Amendment, then Mr. Gardner's only alternative would be to wait to request attorneys' fees until the statute of limitations on each of the charges had expired.
