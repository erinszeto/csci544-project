Border enforcement has been an ongoing subject of congressional interest since the 1970s, when unauthorized immigration to the United States first registered as a serious national problem; and border security has received additional attention in the years since the terrorist attacks of 2001.", "Since the 1990s, migration control at the border has been guided by a strategy of \"prevention through deterrence\"\u2014the idea that the concentration of personnel, infrastructure, and surveillance technology along heavily trafficked regions of the border will discourage unauthorized migrants from attempting to enter the United States. Since 2005, CBP has attempted to discourage repeat unauthorized migrant entries and disrupt migrant smuggling networks by imposing tougher penalties against certain unauthorized migrants, a set of policies eventually described as \"enforcement with consequences.\" Most people apprehended at the Southwest border are now subject to \"high consequence\" enforcement outcomes.", "Across a variety of indicators, the United States has substantially expanded border enforcement resources over the last three decades. Particularly since 2001, such increases include border security appropriations, personnel, fencing and infrastructure, and surveillance technology. In addition to increased resources, the USBP has implemented several strategies over the past several decades in an attempt to thwart unauthorized migration. In 2014, the Obama Administration announced executive actions to \"fix\" the immigration system. These actions address several issues, including a revised security plan at the southern border.", "The Border Patrol collects data on several different border enforcement outcomes; this report describes trends in border apprehensions, recidivism, and estimated \"got aways\" and \"turn backs.\" Yet none of these existing data are designed to measure unauthorized border flows or the degree to which the border is secured. Thus, the report also describes methods for estimating border security at the strategic and operational levels.", "Drawing on multiple data sources, the report reviews the state of border security. Robust investments at the border were not associated with reduced unauthorized inflows during the 1980s and 1990s, but a range of evidence suggests a substantial drop in unauthorized inflows from 2007 to 2011, followed by a rise from 2012 to 2014 and a decrease in 2015. Enforcement, along with the 2007 economic downturn in the United States, likely contributed to the drop in unauthorized migration, though the precise share of the decline attributable to enforcement is unknown.", "Enhanced border enforcement also may have contributed to a number of secondary costs and benefits. To the extent that border enforcement successfully deters unauthorized entries, such enforcement may reduce border-area violence and migrant deaths, protect fragile border ecosystems, and improve the quality of life in border communities. But to the extent that migrants are not deterred, the concentration of enforcement resources on the border may increase border area violence and migrant deaths, encourage unauthorized migrants to find new ways to enter and to remain in the United States for longer periods of time, damage border ecosystems, harm border-area businesses and the quality of life in border communities, and strain U.S. relations with Mexico and Canada."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The country's immigration and naturalization laws have been subjects of episodic controversy since America's founding, but unauthorized migration only became an issue in the early 20 th century, when Congress passed the first strict restrictions on legal admissions.

Under the new approach, the INS would place personnel, surveillance technology, fencing, and other infrastructure directly on the border to discourage unauthorized flows, a strategy that became known as \"prevention through deterrence.\" According to the 1994 INS plan, \"the prediction is that with traditional entry and smuggling routes disrupted, illegal traffic will be deterred, or forced over more hostile terrain, less suited for crossing and more suited for enforcement.\"", "The strategy had four phases that began with the border patrol sectors with the highest levels of unauthorized migration activity.

Since 2005, CBP has limited voluntary returns in favor of three types of \"high consequence\" outcomes:", "In general, these high consequence enforcement outcomes are intended to deter unauthorized flows by raising the costs to migrants of being apprehended and by making it more difficult for them to reconnect with smugglers following a failed entry attempt. To manage these disparate programs, CBP has designed the \"Consequence Delivery System.... to uniquely evaluate each subject [who is apprehended] and identify the ideal consequences to deliver to impede and deter further illegal activity.\" USBP agents use laminated cards with matrices describing the range of enforcement actions available for a particular migrant as a function of the person's immigration and criminal histories, among other factors, and of the enforcement resources available in each Border Patrol sector.

Furthermore, enforcement data depends on enforcement resources. In general, USBP enforcement outcomes (e.g., apprehensions, estimated got aways) are a function of (1) the underlying unauthorized flows and (2) the agency's ability to detect such flows. Enforcement data alone cannot disentangle these two factors. As a result, enforcement data may tend to overestimate unauthorized flows where resources are robust, and to under-estimate such flows where resources are scarce. Thus, DHS officials have testified that current enforcement data do not offer a suitable metric to describe border security. ", "Given the limits of existing border enforcement data, over time, DHS and USBP have developed different metrics for estimating unauthorized border flows and describing border security. Border security metrics are used at both the strategic and operational levels. At the strategic level, DHS uses metrics to understand its ability to meet border security objectives. The department is currently working to develop a new metric of border security, the unauthorized flow of migrants into the United States . The estimate will be generated through the use of the repeated trials method, also known as the capture-recapture method. Additionally, DHS also reports two other metrics of border security on its annual performance reports. First, the percentage of people apprehended multiple times along the Southwest border, or the recidivism rate, is used to capture USBP's ability to deter migrants from re-entering the United States. Second, the rate of interdiction effectiveness along the Southwest border between ports of entry , or the effectiveness rate, measures USBP's ability to apprehend unauthorized migrants.", "At the operational level, USBP conducts risk assessments that use a range of metrics. Its methodology, \"State of the Border Risk Methodology,\" estimates the magnitude of risk through the use of intelligence information, a detailed awareness of threats at the border, and a standardized measure of risk. Though these assessments are not used as metrics themselves, USBP's methodology monitors certain metrics at the sector level that may be able to speak to USBP's performance (such as the recidivism rate and effectiveness rate). USBP conducts these risk assessments at the sector level and employs them to make day-to-day decisions with regard to how it uses its resources.

This conclusion is supported by key Border Patrol enforcement data described above, including the drop in total apprehensions and the drop in estimated got aways and total estimated known entries across eight out of nine Border Patrol sectors.", "Survey data confirm an apparent drop in unauthorized inflows, and measure such effects away from the border. For example, according to data collected by the Princeton Mexican Migration Project, an average of about 2% of all Mexican men initiated a first unauthorized trip to the United States each year between 1973 and 2002; but that percentage has fallen sharply since 2002, to below 0.4% in 2008-2011. Another study found that the annual probability of a Mexican individual taking an initial unauthorized trip to the United States averaged .009 (ranging from .003 to .014) from 1970 to 2007.", "Estimates of the unauthorized population in the United States report drops of about 1 million unauthorized migrants, from approximately 12.2 million in 2007 to 11.3 million in 2014. Furthermore, the Pew Hispanic Center estimates that net (i.e., northbound minus southbound) migration between Mexico and the United States has resulted in a net loss of 140,000 from 2009 to 2014, meaning more Mexicans have returned to Mexico than have migrated to the United States.", "According to GAO's analysis of Border Patrol metrics, eight out of nine Border Patrol sectors (all except the Big Bend sector) showed improved effectiveness rates between FY2006 and FY2011. In the Tucson sector, the main focus of GAO's analysis, the effectiveness rate improved from 67% to 87% during this period. The San Diego, El Centro, Yuma, and El Paso sectors all had effectiveness rates in FY2011 of about 90%; the Del Rio and Laredo sectors (along with Tucson) had rates above 80%; and the Big Bend and Rio Grande Valley sectors had rates between 60% and 70%.", "Border enforcement is only one of several factors that affect unauthorized migration. Thus, if unauthorized entries indeed fell after 2006, to what degree is this change attributable to enforcement versus other developments, such as the U.S. economic downturn since 2007, and/or economic and demographic changes in Mexico and other countries of origin? Disentangling the effects of enforcement from other factors influencing migration flows is particularly difficult in the current case because many of the most significant new enforcement efforts\u2014including a sizeable share of new border enforcement personnel, most border fencing, new enforcement practices at the border, and many of the new migration enforcement measures within the United States\u2014all have occurred at the same time as the most severe recession since the 1930s. ", "Nonetheless, the drop in recidivism rates suggests that an increasing proportion of migrants are being deterred by CBP's enforcement efforts. For example, one study found that border enforcement did not affect the likelihood of Mexican migrants making their first unauthorized trip to the United States but that it does have a pronounced effect on their likelihood of making additional trips. Surveys of unauthorized migrants repatriated to Mexico in 2005 and 2010 also suggest that enforcement is increasingly likely to deter future immigration. ", "Furthermore, academic research from 2012 provides evidence that border enforcement has contributed to a reduction in unauthorized flows. These findings are noteworthy, in part, because they contradict earlier academic research, much of which found that border enforcement had a limited impact or even was counter-productive when it came to migration control efforts (also see \" Migration Flows: \"Caging\" Effects and Alternative Modes of Entry \"). This research suggests that the recent build-up in immigration enforcement at the border and within the United States may have had a greater deterrent effect on unauthorized migration than earlier efforts.

Unauthorized migration may be associated with crime and mortality in several distinct ways. First, unauthorized migration is associated with crime\u2014apart from the crime of unauthorized entry\u2014because some unauthorized migrants contract with immigrant smugglers and because unauthorized migrants may engage in related illegal activity, such as document fraud. Yet fear of the police may make unauthorized migrants less likely to engage in other types of criminal activity, and research on the subject finds low immigrant criminality rates, especially when accounting for education levels and other demographic characteristics. Second, unauthorized border crossers face risks associated with crossing the border at dangerous locations, where they may die from exposure or from drowning.", "Border enforcement therefore may affect crime and migrant mortality in complex ways. On one hand, the concentration of enforcement resources around the border may exacerbate adverse outcomes by making migrants more likely to rely on smugglers. The 1994 National Strategic Plan predicted a short-term rise in border violence for these reasons. On the other hand, to the extent that enforcement successfully deters unauthorized crossers, such prevention should reduce crime and mortality. The concentration of law enforcement personnel near the border may further enhance public safety and migrant protection, especially where CBP has made a priority of protecting vulnerable populations.", "The empirical record suggests that there is no significant difference in the average violent crime rate in border and non-border metropolitan areas. Indeed, the border cities El Paso, TX, and San Diego, CA, are regularly listed among the safest large cities in the country based on their rankings among similarly sized cities in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report. The specific impact of border enforcement on border-area crime is unknown, however, because available data cannot separate the influence of border enforcement from other factors. ", "With respect to mortality, available data about migrant deaths along the Southwest border are presented in Figure 7 . The figures come from academic research based on local medical investigators' and examiners' offices in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas between 1985 and 1998 (the University of Houston's Center for Immigration Research, CIR); Mexican foreign ministry and Mexican media counts compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego; and data compiled by DHS based on bodies recovered on the U.S. side of the border. All three data sources reflect known migrant deaths, and therefore likely undercount actual migrant deaths since some bodies may not be discovered. Additionally, U.S. data sources generally do not include information from the Mexican side of the border and therefore further undercount migration-related fatalities. ", "As Figure 7 illustrates, data from the CIR indicate that known migrant deaths fell from a high of 344 in 1988 to a low of 171 in 1994 before climbing back to 286 in 1998. According to DHS data, known migrant deaths climbed from 249 in 1999 to 492 in 2005, and averaged 431 deaths per year in 2005-2009. DHS's count fell to an average of 369 per year in 2010-2011, but increased to 471 in FY2012 before falling again to 445 in FY2013 and to a low of 240 in FY2015. From FY1998 to FY2015, 6,571 migrants have died, averaging 365 deaths a year. ", "The ACLU found that known migrant deaths increased from just 80 per year in 1994-1997 to 481 per year in 1998-2008. The apparent increase in migrant deaths in the past decades is noteworthy in light of the apparent decline in unauthorized entries during the same period. These data offer evidence that border crossings have become more hazardous since the \"prevention through deterrence\" policy went into effect in the 1990s, though (as with crime) the precise impact of enforcement on migrant deaths is unknown.

Most notably, social science research suggests that border enforcement has had the unintended consequence of encouraging unauthorized migrants to settle permanently in the United States rather than working temporarily and then returning home, as was more common prior to the mid-1980s. The primary evidence for this so-called \"caging\" effect is that unauthorized migrants appear to be staying longer in the United States and raising families here more often rather than making regular trips to visit families that remain in countries of origin. ", "One study found that, prior to 1986, the average probability of return to Mexico for authorized migrants was .52 and that for unauthorized migrants it was .55. However, in 2006 the probability of return for authorized migrants increased to 1.0, while unauthorized migrants' probability of return dropped to .21. Furthermore, the study found that \"each million dollar increase in the real value of the [Border Patrol's] budget reduces the odds of yearly return migration by 44%.\" Although other factors also likely contribute to these changes, survey results appear to confirm that border enforcement has been a factor behind these longer stays. ", "A second unintended consequence of enhanced border enforcement between ports of entry may have been an increase in unauthorized entries through ports of entry and other means. According to UCSD Mexico Migration Field Research Program research, unauthorized Mexican migrants from one community in Mexico interviewed in 2009 used six different methods to enter the United States, with one in four such unauthorized migrants passing through a port of entry by using borrowed or fraudulent documents or by hiding in a vehicle. Based on three different surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010, UCSD researchers found that the probability of being apprehended while passing through a port of entry without authorization was about half as high as the probability of being apprehended while crossing between the ports. CBP's Passenger Compliance Examination (COMPEX) System reportedly detects very little unauthorized migration through ports of entry, however.

As with the effects of enforcement on border crime and violence, the effects of enforcement on the environment are complex because they reflect changes in migrant behavior and the secondary effects of enforcement per se.", "On one hand, many unauthorized border crossers transit through sensitive environmental areas, cutting vegetation for shelter and fire, potentially causing wildfires, increasing erosion through repeated use of trails, and discarding trash. Thus, to the extent that border enforcement successfully deters unauthorized flows, enforcement benefits the environment by reducing these undesirable outcomes. On the other hand, the construction of fencing, roads, and other tactical infrastructure may damage border-area ecosystems. These environmental considerations may be especially important because much of the border runs through remote and environmentally sensitive areas. For this reason, even when accounting for the possible environmental benefits of reduced unauthorized border flows, some environmental groups have opposed border infrastructure projects because they threaten rare and endangered species as well as other wildlife by damaging ecosystems and restricting the movement of animals, and because surveillance towers and artificial night lighting have detrimental effects on migrant birds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects on Border Communities and Civil Rights", "paragraphs": ["Although economists disagree about the overall economic impact of unauthorized migration, unauthorized migrants may impose a number of costs at the local level, including through their use of schools and other public programs.

On top of this general concern, some people argue that Operation Streamline raises additional questions about whether migrants receive adequate legal protections during fast-tracked criminal procedures. And some have argued that mistreatment and abuse are widespread in CBP detention facilities.

A 2013 Justice Department study found that the number of immigration defendants in federal courts increased 664% between 1995 and 2010 (from 5,103 to 39,001); and that immigration cases accounted for 60% of the overall increase in pretrial detentions during that period. More generally, immigration offenders accounted for 46% of federal arrests in 2010, outnumbering all other crimes and up from 22% a decade earlier.

Apprehensions then increased from 2012 to 2014, before falling in 2015. The Border Patrol's IDENT database also indicates a declining proportion of migrants are apprehended more than once (i.e., recidivism is down). Estimates based on enforcement and survey data and accounting for estimated apprehension and deterrence rates suggest that total unauthorized inflows in 2009-2011 were well below levels observed in the two decades after IRCA's passage, but that unauthorized inflows increased somewhat in 2012.

A comprehensive accounting also may consider various potential unintended consequences of border enforcement on the civil rights of legal residents and U.S. citizens in the border region, on migrants' human rights, on the quality of life in border communities, on the environment and wildlife, and on U.S.-regional relations. ", "What do these findings mean for Members of Congress who oversee border security and immigration policy? Especially in light of current fiscal constraints, some Members of Congress may evaluate future border enforcement in terms of expected returns on America's investments, and they may consider the possibility that certain additional investments at the border may be met with diminishing returns. Border infrastructure may offer an example: with 651 miles of fencing and barriers already in place along the Southwest border, each additional mile would be in ever more remote locations, and therefore more expensive to install and maintain and likely to deter fewer unauthorized migrants. Similarly, some Members of Congress may question the concrete benefits of deploying more sophisticated surveillance systems across the entire northern and southern borders, including vast regions in which too few personnel are deployed to respond to the occasional unauthorized entry that may be detected. ", "Deciding how to allocate border resources therefore requires a clear definition of the goals of border security. Zero admissions of unauthorized migrants may not be a realistic goal when it comes to migration control, as noted above, and is a higher standard than is expected of most law enforcement agencies. While this report focuses on migration control at U.S. borders, border security also encompasses the detection and interdiction of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), narcotics, and other illicit goods; policies to combat human trafficking; and other security goals. These diverse goals are often conflated in an undifferentiated debate about \"border security\"; but each of these goals may suggest a different mix of border investments, as well as different metrics and different standards for successful enforcement outcomes. Should policies to prevent unauthorized migration be held to the same standards as policies to prevent the entry of WMDs, for example?", "Regardless of how these questions are answered in principle, debates about immigration control and border security may benefit from better metrics of border security and unauthorized migration, and from a more analytical approach to program design. The Border Patrol has taken a step in this direction by analyzing recidivism data as a function of different enforcement outcomes through its Consequence Delivery System. This report also identifies several metrics for measuring border security, all of which have advantages and disadvantages. In the context of immigration policy and a possible immigration reform bill, Members of Congress may choose to focus on the total number of unauthorized migrants in the United States, in addition to border flows, since border enforcement is just one of many factors (along with interior enforcement, visa policies, etc.) influencing the size of the unauthorized population, and because more is known about the population number than about border flows."], "subsections": []}]}}
