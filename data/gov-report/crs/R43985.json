Greater budgetary transparency may allay the fears that some community and advocacy groups have about CVE\u2014that it is an effort to co-opt communities into the security process, providing tips, leads, sources, and informants rather than real engagement.

However, some policymakers might also believe that grants to state and local law enforcement might be a way to provide for the safety of U.S. citizens, since much of the country's law enforcement services are provided by local law enforcement agencies.", "Appropriations for two of DOJ's most prominent grant programs to assist state and local law enforcement\u2014the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) and the COPS hiring programs\u2014have decreased in recent fiscal years.

These states do so in various ways. For example, while some states exempt qualified users of medical marijuana from state prosecution, others specifically authorize and regulate medical marijuana. California has a comprehensive law (enacted in 1996) that allows patients to obtain and use marijuana for multiple medical purposes. While some states have legalized medical marijuana in their respective jurisdictions, medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law.", "The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) does not distinguish between the medical and recreational use of marijuana. Under the CSA, marijuana has \"no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,\" and states' allowance of its use for medical purposes contrasts with the federal position. Federal law enforcement has investigated, arrested, and prosecuted individuals for medical marijuana-related offenses regardless of whether they are in compliance with state law; however, federal law enforcement emphasizes the investigation and prosecution of growers and dispensers over the individual users of medical marijuana.", "In a continuing effort to curtail federal interference with state medical marijuana laws, Congress enacted as part of the FY2016 Omnibus language that prohibits DOJ from using funds provided in the act to \"prevent\" 40 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia from \"implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.\" While media outlets and others characterized this language as preventing DOJ from enforcing federal marijuana laws in states listed in the appropriations law, DOJ has said that this language will not stop the department from prosecuting individuals who are in compliance with state law but violating federal law (the CSA). Despite this response from DOJ, the House once again enacted language that prohibits DOJ from using funds provided in the act to \"prevent\" specified states and territories from \"implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.\"", "The DEA is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing the CSA. In the DEA's FY2016 Performance Budget Congressional Submission, the agency cited state allowance of the cultivation, distribution, possession, and use of marijuana for medical purposes as an obstacle in meeting its performance objectives in FY2016. The FY2016 enacted appropriation for the DEA was $2.08 billion. While it is difficult to decipher how much of the DEA budget is used toward marijuana enforcement, the agency's Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program exclusively targets marijuana. This program is funded under the DEA's Domestic Enforcement account, which encompasses the majority of the DEA's investigative and support resources. The FY2015 enacted amount for the DEA's Domestic Enforcement account was $1.59 billion. ", "In the accompanying report to H.R. 2578, the committee directed the DEA to review the medical efficacy of marijuana. Specifically, the committee asked that the DEA \"review all relevant DEA rules governing research on the medical efficacy of marijuana and determine ways to facilitate further research through streamlining the DEA approval process.\" It directed the agency to collaborate with the National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Food and Drug Administration on these efforts and to report back to the committee within 120 days with \"a plan by which the agency can facilitate additional research.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increases to the Crime Victims Fund Obligation Cap", "paragraphs": ["In FY2015, Congress set the Crime Victims Fund (CVF) obligation cap at $2.361 billion, a 216.9% increase over the FY2014 cap. Congress did not specify directions for the increase in CVF funds, which were distributed to crime victims programs according to a formula established by the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA). In FY2016, Congress set the cap at $3.042 billion, a further increase to the cap; however, $379 million was transferred to the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW; for purposes outside of VOCA) and $10 million was designated for the DOJ, Office of the Inspector General for oversight and auditing purposes. After deducting these amounts specified in P.L. 114-113 , the obligation cap is equal to $2.653 billion, a 12.4% increase over the FY2015 cap. While the Administration has previously proposed to fund OVW programs with CVF funds, it had not done so for FY2016 and had requested that the obligation cap be set at $1 billion. The Administration's FY2016 budget had included a proposal to use the CVF to fund grants for domestic trafficking victims, but Congress did not direct CVF money for this purpose in FY2016.", "Until FY2016, CVF money had not been used to fund grant programs outside of those authorized by VOCA, but as the CVF continues to receive comparatively large deposits each year, Congress might consider whether to use receipts from the CVF to continue to fund grant programs that are not authorized by VOCA. While it could be argued that these programs (non-VOCA) assist crime victims, it raises a question about whether this might pave the way for the CVF to be used to support grant programs that might not be victim-focused. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the CVF has a balance of more than $12 billion, which indicates that receipts to the fund were exceeding the congressionally specified cap; however, as mentioned, Congress substantially increased the cap in FY2015 and increased it further in FY2016.", "In a time of fiscal constraint, the CVF might provide an avenue to fund some DOJ grant programs while reducing DOJ's discretionary appropriation; however, there is no guarantee that receipts going into the CVF will be consistent from one year to the next. Therefore, if Congress were to further increase the cap and continue to use funding from the CVF for non-VOCA programs, it is not possible to ensure that there will be a consistent level of funding to support these programs in future budget cycles.", "Congress could decide to eliminate the cap on the Crime Victims Fund altogether. If Congress should decide to eliminate the cap and allow all collected funds to be distributed in a given fiscal year, it could possibly have significant consequences for the DOJ budget. As mentioned, the capped amount and remaining balance in the CVF are considered part of the DOJ budget total. These amounts impact the DOJ appropriation, are used to offset spending limits for DOJ programs, and are included in the overall budget score for DOJ. If Congress were to eliminate the cap, it would have to make up the amount of the CVF through offsets. Moreover, Congress may assess whether VOCA programs would be able to use all money in the fund if the obligation cap were eliminated.
