As a statute, \u00a7\u00a02105(d) cannot define the terms of the Constitution and thus would not resolve the constitutional question, but it may be used as an indication of the sense of Congress regarding the status of Reservists.

Under this argument, because the Constitution gives Congress the authority to judge the qualifications of its Members, courts should not weigh in on the propriety of simultaneous service.

Reservists Committee to Stop the War , as discussed below, the Court decided the case on procedural grounds and no opinion was issued on the substantive claims under the Incompatibility Clause. Courts have heard other cases under the Incompatibility Clause that did not directly challenge simultaneous service as an officer in the Reserves, including a 2005 decision by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.

Reservists Committee to Stop the War", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Supreme Court considered a challenge to simultaneous membership in the Reserves and in Congress as a violation of the Incompatibility Clause in 1973. In Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War , an association of officers and enlisted members of the Reserves and several individual members of the association alleged that Members of Congress who simultaneously served in the Reserves were acting in violation of the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on \"holding any Office under the United States\" while also serving as a Member of Congress. Although the district court held and the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed that \"Article I, Section 6, Clause 2 of the Constitution renders a member of the Congress ineligible to hold a commission in the Armed Forces Reserve during his continuance in office,\" the Supreme Court reversed the decision on other grounds, finding that the committee lacked standing to raise the claim.", "The Court's decision has limited citizens and taxpayers from raising the issue of simultaneous service in Congress and the Reserves. The Reservists Committee asserted their claims on the basis that as citizens and taxpayers, they were injured by the threat simultaneous service created for \"the possibility of undue influence by the Executive Branch, in violation of the concept of independence of Congress implicit in Art. I of the Constitution.\" The Court held that the alleged injury was abstract, speculative, and generalized, and therefore was not a litigable matter for the courts to decide.", "The government raised several arguments to support the claim that simultaneous service in Congress and the Reserves did not violate the Incompatibility Clause. First, according to the government, simultaneous service in the Reserves was not the problem intended to be addressed by the Incompatibility Clause. The \"intent was to avoid the possibility of improper influences upon and corruption of members of the legislative branch that could result from the power of the executive branch to appoint members to office.\" Furthermore, the government argued that \"the minor and infrequent contacts these Reservists have with the military authorities as a result of their membership in the Reserves pose none of the dangers of domination and corruption of the legislative branch by the executive branch that the Framers sought to guard against.\"", "To support its position, the government also cited other court cases that considered the definition of offices and officers of the United States. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that an employee whose \"duties were continuing and permanent, not occasional or temporary\" was an officer of the United States. According to the Court, \"the term [office] embraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties.\" This definition was used by the U.S. Court of Claims in a case challenging the status of a Reservist. The court held that an inactive Reservist was not also an officer of the United States. The court reasoned that \"an officer of the Reserve Corps has no salary or emolument of office. He is not in time of peace, except perhaps while discharging some duty to which he may have been lawfully called ..., amenable to the Army regulations or court-martial. He has no defined duties to discharge.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States v.

The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force assigned Senator Graham to act as an appellate judge on the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. One of the cases assigned to Senator Graham was that of an airman convicted of a drug use violation. The airman challenged the legality of Senator Graham's service on a panel of the Court of Criminal Appeals that reviewed the appeal.", "When the case came before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), the court limited its decision to the issue of \"whether a criminal conviction and sentence, which by statute can be sustained only by an affirmative appellate decision, may be reviewed by an appellate judge who simultaneously serves as a Member of Congress.\" The CAAF noted that the Supreme Court has held that \"the term 'officers of the United States' includes 'all persons who can be said to hold an office under the Government.'\" The Supreme Court has also indicated that the distinction between officers and non-officers depends on whether the individual exercises \"significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.\" The CAAF held that under this definition, military judges are officers of the United States. The court stated that \"the Incompatibility Clause\u2014which prohibits a Member of Congress from 'holding any Office under the United States'\u2014precludes a Member from serving as an appellate judge on a Court of Criminal Appeals\u2014an 'office' that must be filled by an 'Officer of the United States.'\"", "The CAAF limited its decision to whether a Member of Congress could serve as a judge in the airman's proceeding.
