Some contend that an important component of this assessment would be a comparative analysis of the various fuels' greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, reports in the scientific literature and popular press have created some confusion about the climate implications of natural gas. On the one hand, a shift to natural gas is promoted as climate change mitigation because natural gas combustion has a lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity than either oil or coal. On the other hand, methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is itself a more potent GHG than CO2, and some contend that methane leakage from the production, transport, and use of natural gas has the potential to offset the GHG emissions benefits of switching.", "The net climate impact of replacing other fossil fuels with natural gas depends upon a number of analytic assumptions, including the choice of fuel, end-use sector, equipment, and processes modeled.

The findings include the following:", "Natural gas, when combusted at different types of existing U.S. power plants, produces anywhere from 42% to 63% of the CO2 emissions of coal, depending upon the power plant technology. However, in order to more fully assess the climate impacts of a fuel employed in the power sector, analyses aim to aggregate emissions across the entire supply and utilization chain (i.e., from extraction to end use). Such analyses are referred to as life-cycle assessments (LCAs). Due to its potency as a GHG, methane lost to the atmosphere during the production and transport of fossil fuels (i.e., fugitive emissions) can greatly impact the life-cycle GHG emissions estimates for power generation. The Department of Energy currently estimates a fugitive emissions rate (FER) of around 1% in natural gas systems; a number of academic studies estimate rates in the range of 2%-4%. Further, due to its chemical composition, methane's climate impacts are significantly more pronounced in the short term as compared to the long term. Thus, when considering existing power plants, the average natural-gas-fired combined cycle technology produces approximately 50% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal-fired steam generation, both in the short and the long terms, given a FER of around 1%. However, when considering other existing natural-gas-fired technologies (e.g. single cycle) or advanced technologies, the comparative life-cycle emissions benefits of natural gas are reduced. Further, when considering the possibility of higher FERs (e.g., 2%-4%), the life-cycle GHG emissions of both existing and advanced natural-gas-fired technology may be comparable to coal-fired technology in the short term and could remain within range of coal-fired technology for several decades after emissions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Recent expansion in natural gas production\u2014primarily the result of new or improved technologies (e.g., hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling) used on unconventional resources (e.g., shale, tight sands, and coal-bed methane) \u2014has made natural gas an increasingly significant component in the U.S. energy market.

Natural gas is cleaner-burning; it emits less carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) than oil or coal when used to generate electricity in a typical power plant. Further, its combustion emits no mercury (a persistent, bioaccumulative neurotoxin), virtually no particulate matter or sulfur dioxide, and less nitrogen oxides, per unit of combustion, than either oil or coal.

While there are many ways to measure and compare CO 2 emissions across different types of fuels (e.g., by the weight or by the volume of the fuel being burned), one of the most relevant methods for policy considerations is to compare the emissions produced in relation to the energy released (what is commonly referred to as the \"emissions intensity\" of a fuel)\u2014for example, determining how much CO 2 is emitted by natural gas, oil, and coal in order for each to produce one British thermal unit (Btu) of energy.

The primary chemical component of natural gas is methane. Methane\u2014the simplest hydrocarbon\u2014is made up of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH 4 ). Its carbon content (and thus its CO 2 emissions potential) relative to the amount of energy it can release during oxidation is relatively low. Oil is composed of longer hydrocarbon molecules and thus has a higher carbon content. Coal's carbon content is higher still and varies across different types of coal.

EPA currently employs GWP values for methane that were accepted by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as they were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report 2007 (AR4). The AR4 lists methane's GWP as 25 and 72 over a 100-year and a 20-year time horizon, respectively. The AR4 GWP values are reflected in the calculations for Figure 4 through Figure 9 of this report. ", "However, in September 2013, the IPCC released its Fifth Assessment Report 2013 (AR5). AR5 lists methane's GWP as 34 and 86 over a 100-year and a 20-year time horizon, respectively. While these values have yet to be accepted officially by parties to the UNFCCC or by EPA, they are currently employed by much of the academic literature. The use of AR5 GWP values in LCAs serves to further the convergence between the life-cycle GHG emissions intensities of coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power generation when considering higher fugitive emissions rate scenarios for natural gas systems.", " Figure 12 presents the life-cycle GHG emissions estimates for existing coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants under the IPCC AR5 GWP values. The figure shows emissions from natural-gas-fired power plants based on several different estimates of FER. Notably, if the FER is close to the 1.15%, as currently estimated by DOE/NETL, the generation of one MWh of electricity in an average U.S. natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant in 2013 would produce approximately 48% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of a coal-fired steam generator when averaged over a 100-year time frame. Conversely, if the FER were in the range of 2%-4%, as estimated by several academic sources, natural gas could produce 63%-87% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of coal when averaged over a 20-year time frame.

This range highlights the importance that assumptions regarding power plant efficiency, FERs, and GWPs have on the life-cycle GHG emissions comparisons among different types of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. To capture a fuller picture of this comparison, Figure 13 employs a range of variables over a continuous timeline to present life-cycle GHG emissions estimates between existing coal-fired and natural-gas-fired power plants. The figure illustrates that given a FER of around 1.00%, and given GWP values from IPCC AR4, the generation of one MWh of electricity in an average U.S. natural-gas-fired power plant in 2013 would produce approximately 50% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of a coal-fired steam generator across the entire time frame for which it would be measured. However, if the FER were in the range of 2%-4%, as estimated by some academic sources, the impacts of life-cycle emissions from natural-gas-fired power generation could be comparable to coal-fired power generation initially (within 5%-35%) and could remain within range of the coal plant's life-cycle emissions over the first 20 years after the emissions (within 20%-40%).

Figure 14 presents the life-cycle GHG emissions estimates between the most efficient, advanced coal-fired power plant model and the most efficient, advanced natural-gas-fired power plant model (from Table 1 ) using IPCC AR5 GWP values. The figure illustrates that given a FER of around 1.00%, life-cycle GHG emissions from the generation of one MWh of electricity in an advanced natural-gas-fired power plant model would begin approximately 35% lower than a coal-fired model in the short term and improve to approximately 45% lower in the long term. Further, if the FER were in the range of 2%-4%, as estimated by some academic sources, the impacts of life-cycle emissions from advanced natural-gas-fired power generation could be near or greater than advanced coal-fired power generation initially (from 20% less to 20% greater) and could remain within range of the advanced coal plant's life-cycle emissions over the first 60 years after the emissions (within 20%-35%).

In some cases, the accuracy of data is as uncertain as it is significant. Natural gas combustion, on a per-unit-of-energy basis, produces approximately 56% of the CO 2 emissions of coal. Natural gas, when combusted at different types of existing U.S. power plants, produces anywhere from 42% to 63% of the CO 2 emissions of coal, depending upon the power plant technology. However, in order to more fully assess the climate impacts of a fuel employed in the power sector, analyses aim to aggregate emissions across the entire supply and utilization chain (i.e., from extraction to end use). Such analyses are referred to as life-cycle assessments (LCAs). Due to its potency as a GHG, methane lost to the atmosphere during the production and transport of fossil fuels can greatly impact the life-cycle GHG emissions estimates for power generation. DOE and EPA currently estimate a FER of around 1% in natural gas systems; a number of academic studies estimate FERs in the range of 2%-4%. Estimates for coal production are similarly uncertain. Further, due to its chemical composition, methane's climate impacts are significantly more pronounced in the short term as compared to the long term. Thus, when considering existing power plants, a natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant produces approximately 50% of the life-cycle GHG emissions of a coal-fired steam generator, both in the short and the long terms, given a FER of around 1% in natural gas systems. However, when considering other existing natural-gas-fired technologies (e.g. single cycle), or advanced technologies, the comparative life-cycle emissions benefits of natural gas are reduced. Further, when considering the possibility of higher fugitive emissions rates for natural gas production and transport activities (e.g., 2%-4%), the life-cycle GHG emissions of existing natural-gas-fired technology could be comparable to coal-fired power generation initially (within 5%-35%) and could remain within range of the coal plant's life-cycle emissions over the first 20 after the emissions (within 20%-40%). Similarly, when comparing advanced power plants under the possibility of higher fugitive emissions rates (e.g., 2%-4%), the life-cycle GHG emissions of natural-gas-fired technology could be near or greater than coal-fired power generation initially (from 20% less to 20% greater) and could remain within range of the coal plant's life-cycle emissions over the first 60 years after the emissions (within 20%-35%).

Given the results, several points of interest emerge for the consideration of future policy:", "Natural gas resources and technologies are not homogenous. Neither are coal's. The choice of fuel resources, fuel extraction processes, transport options, and power plant technologies for both coal and natural gas returns significant differences in life-cycle GHG emissions estimates. Effective policy considerations would require appropriate specificity and detail. Due to its potency as a GHG, the amount of methane lost to the atmosphere during the production and transport of fossil fuels can greatly impact the life-cycle GHG emissions estimates for power generation. In order to fully understand the climate implications of switching from coal to natural gas in the domestic power sector, improvements are required in the measurement and validation of emissions inventories (i.e., for both coal production and natural gas production). Effective policy considerations would require strategies to attain these inventory improvements. Further, in order to most fully realize the climate benefits of switching from coal to natural gas in the domestic power sector, a FER of approximately 1% is required from natural gas systems. Studies have shown that cost-effective technologies exist to mitigate fugitive emissions from some activities in the natural gas supply chain. Additionally, EPA has recently finalized performance standards for the oil and natural gas sector that may serve to reduce fugitive emissions. Effective policy considerations would require strategies to attain and/or maintain these targeted emissions rates. Given methane's unique characteristics as a GHG (e.g., its short-term potency compared to CO 2 ), effective policy considerations would require an analysis of both the short-term and the long-term climate implications of a fuel's life-cycle GHG emissions. The analysis would likely spur debate over the proper weight to place on both short- and long-term assessments of the costs and benefits of fuel-switching strategies. This report compares the life-cycle GHG emissions between coal and natural gas in the domestic power sector. It does not analyze other fuel-switching strategies that support natural gas (e.g., from coal-fired electricity to distributed natural gas in the home heating sector, from petroleum products to compressed natural gas in the domestic transportation sector, or from regional coal to imported liquefied natural gas in international markets ). These other scenarios would require different analytic inputs and wholly separate assessments. Effective policy considerations would require data and analysis with the appropriate LCAs.
