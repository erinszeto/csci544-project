The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) administers the greatest number of rural development programs and has the highest average of program funds going directly to rural counties (approximately 50%). The Rural Development Policy Act of 1980 also designated USDA as the lead federal agency for rural development. The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agricultural Reorganization Act of 1994 created the Office of the Under Secretary for Rural Development and consolidated the rural development portfolio into four principal agencies responsible for USDA's mission area: the Rural Housing Service, the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, the Rural Utilities Service, and the Office of Community Development.", "The Agricultural Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-79), the most recent farm bill, was enacted on February 7, 2014. Among other changes, the law consolidates several business loan and grant programs into a single business support platform. The law allows prioritization of rural development projects that support strategic economic and community development. The new law provides $150 million in mandatory spending for backlogged rural development loans and grants and $63 million in mandatory spending for the Value-Added Product Grants program. Most existing programs authorized by the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act and the Rural Electrification Act were reauthorized. The Access to Broadband Telecommunication Services in Rural Areas Program was reauthorized and establishes new procedures to compare applications and set funding priorities. Additionally, a new Gigabit Network Pilot Program for high-speed broadband service was authorized at $10 million for each fiscal year FY2014-FY2018. The bill also authorizes a new Rural Energy Savings Program to fund loans to qualified consumers to implement energy efficiency measures. A new provision directs USDA to begin collecting data on the economic activities it funds to assess the short- and long-term viability of award recipients.", "This report provides an overview of the various programs administered by USDA Rural Development's mission agencies, their authorizing legislation, program objectives, eligibility criteria, and FY2005-FY2016 funding for each program.

The Federal Emergency Relief Administration began aiding rural families in 1932. Later, the Farm Security Administration and the Work Projects Administration provided much needed assistance to rural families and farm households.", "In the post-World War II era, widespread rural poverty, most notably among farmers, continued to dominate rural policy concerns. The Eisenhower Administration's Under Secretary for Agriculture, True D. Morse, began a Rural Development Program in 1955 to assist low-income farmers. Because agriculture was the major economic activity in many rural areas of the time, a focus on farms and farm households became de facto rural policy. The War on Poverty during the 1960s continued the focus on rural poverty as a central policy issue. With the continued decline in agriculture as rural America's dominant economic activity, policy attention shifted to rural revitalization. The 1980s farm financial crisis and economic dislocation in rural America brought the importance of rural structural change to the forefront of policy concerns. The further decline of farming to less than 8% of rural employment and the loss of many manufacturing jobs during the past decade have highlighted the growing gap between many rural areas and the nation's urban/suburban areas. While no overarching framework guides rural policy at the federal level, adequate housing, employment creation and business retention, human capital concerns, poverty issues, medical care, and physical infrastructure development remain key foci of federal rural policy.", "The rural population has declined over the past decade. According to the U.S. Census, as of July 2012, approximately 46.2 million people (14.6% of the U.S. population) lived in rural areas, down from approximately 16% in 2000. While rural farming and mining counties have long experienced dwindling populations, more recently rural retirement and recreation areas have also seen declines as the baby-boomer generation increasingly opts for urban areas in retirement. Manufacturing now accounts for about 22% of rural private sector earnings and about 11% of all rural jobs. The service sector, as with the U.S. domestic economy as a whole, however, dominates rural job opportunities. Although over 90% of total farm household income now comes from off-farm sources, farming, and agriculture more generally, remain the major legislative focus for much of congressional debate on rural policy. Since 1973, omnibus farm bills have included a rural development title. The most recently passed is Title VI of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-246 ). Agriculture and manufacturing issues are increasingly seen as part of global and regional restructuring issues, which have significant implications for rural areas, especially those areas where these production sectors remain dominant. How to position rural areas to better compete in a global environment is a key issue framing debates about the future of rural America.", "Omnibus farm bills are the major modern legislative vehicle for addressing many rural development issues. While other legislation has significant implications for rural areas and rural residents (e.g., transportation initiatives, environmental regulation, finance and taxation, Medicare, Social Security), Congress has used periodic farm bills to address emerging rural issues as well as to reauthorize a wide range of rural programs administered by the various USDA rural development mission agencies. While the extent of overlap between federal agencies and programs targeting rural areas has been of concern to some rural policy observers, legislation enacted since 1990 reflects an effort to address rural issues more comprehensively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Authorizing Legislation for USDA Rural Development Programs", "paragraphs": ["USDA's rural development mission is to enhance rural communities by targeting financial and technical resources to areas of greatest need.

The Rural Electrification Act of 1936, to cite one significant example, was central to the provision of electrical power and telephone service throughout rural America. In 1966, Congress created the National Commission on Rural Poverty, which published its famous report, The People Left Behind , the following year. Various loan and grant programs that target improvements in rural social welfare (e.g., housing) were also authorized and administered by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), the agency forerunner of today's USDA Office of Rural Development. Rural policy as an identified congressional concern, however, may be dated to the 1972 Rural Development Act, an amendment to the Consolidated Farmers Home Administration Act of 1961.", "In addition to periodic omnibus farm bills, new rural development legislation generally amends three major authorizing statutes: (1) the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-419); (2) the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-624 ); and (3) the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.
