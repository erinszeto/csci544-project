Revised rules are intended to avoid or minimize adverse impacts of coal mining on surface water, groundwater, fish, wildlife, and other natural resources by limiting the mining of coal in or through streams, placement of waste in streams and limiting the generation of mining waste. Some of the existing regulations that would be replaced by the proposed rule were promulgated more than 30 years ago. OSM asserts that updated rules, which have been under development since 2009, are needed to reflect current science, technology, and modern mining practices.", "The proposal retained the core of existing rules in many respects, including the stream buffer zone rule. It requires that land within 100 feet of a perennial or intermittent stream shall not be disturbed by surface mining activities, including the dumping of mining waste, unless the regulatory authority grants a variance that specifically authorizes surface mining activities closer to or through such a stream. The 2015 proposed rule, called the Stream Protection Rule, also included new requirements for baseline data collection to determine the impacts of proposed mining operations, more specificity on reclamation plans, and more specificity on measures to protect fish and wildlife.", "OSM estimated that the coal industry would incur annual compliance costs of $52 million under the proposal. These costs would be above baseline costs that would be incurred in the absence of the rule. Costs of the proposed rule were expected to consist of $45 million annually for surface coal mining operations and $7 million annually for underground mining operations. Nearly 46% of the expected compliance costs reflect new regulatory requirements on coal mining operations in Appalachian states. Of the increased costs in those states, OSM estimated that 72% are for costs to surface mining operations there\u2014or, 33% of the total cost of the rule. Other regions also are expected to experience operational costs, but impacts are anticipated to vary across mine type (e.g., surface or underground) and region. Because of data limitations, OSM could not quantify benefits of the proposal, but qualitatively, the agency said that the rule is expected to reduce the adverse impacts of coal mining on water resources and aquatic habitat.", "To stakeholders, OSM's Stream Protection Rule raised a number of questions, including whether new regulations are needed; if so, whether benefits of the proposed rule justify the projected compliance and associated costs; and whether an alternative regulatory approach with greater benefits but also increased costs would better achieve SMCRA's purposes.", "Concern that OSM's efforts to develop a new rule would be costly and burdensome to the coal industry has led to strong congressional interest for some time. Oversight hearings have been held, and legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress to halt or re-direct OSM's initiatives, including H.R. 1644 (passed by the House January 12, 2016), S. 1458, and a provision of H.R. 2822. Mining industry groups were very critical of the costs of the proposal, while environmental groups that have generally supported strengthening SMCRA regulations contended that the rule should be stronger to provide more protection to streams. A number of states say that the rule would undermine state authority and that OSM failed to consult adequately with states during development of the rule.", "OSM issued the final revised Stream Protection Rule on December 19, 2016. Opposition by coal industry groups and some Members of Congress was immediate, and legislation to overturn the rule was introduced, including H.J.Res. 11 and H.J.Res. 16 in the 115th Congress. If the final rule were overturned by legislative or presidential action, the existing rules (i.e., the 1983 stream buffer zone rule) would remain in place, unless or until new rules or guidance were issued.", "This report briefly describes SMCRA and the context for the 2015 proposed rule.

Portions of the existing rules were promulgated more than 30 years ago. OSM asserts that updated rules, which have been under development for more than five years, are needed to reflect current science, technology, and modern mining practices. The proposed revisions were based on several needs for federal regulatory action identified by OSM.", "A need for regulatory changes to improve implementation of SMCRA provisions related to stream protection. A need for adequate data to evaluate the impacts of coal mining operations and ensure implementation of SMCRA's requirements. A need for adequate objective standards to effectively evaluate compliance and limit or prevent adverse impacts, as appropriate. A need to apply current information, technology, and methods to incorporate advances in scientific knowledge that have occurred since the SMCRA regulations were adopted.", "To stakeholders, the proposed rule raised a number of issues, including whether new federal rules are needed and, in particular, whether OSM's proposed approach will improve and strengthen implementation of the law. The rule has been controversial since OSM began developing it in 2009. Critics in the coal mining industry and some Members of Congress have argued that revisions of existing rules are not needed and will impose costs that will greatly affect the viability of the coal mining industry in the United States. The new rules are part of a \"war on coal\" by the Obama Administration, some say. At the same time, some environmental advocacy groups that have generally supported OSM's efforts to strengthen regulation of coal mining operations now contended that the proposed rule was not strong enough. Thus, a related issue is whether an alternative regulatory approach with greater benefits but also increased costs would better achieve SMCRA's purposes.", "This report is intended to assist consideration of issues raised by the Stream Protection Rule.

It generally requires that land be restored after mining to its approximate original contour (AOC), that it be revegetated, that acid mine drainage be prevented, that subsided lands be restored, that erosion be controlled, and that certain other measures be taken to reclaim affected lands and waters. ", "Section 506 of SMCRA requires a mining operator to obtain a permit from the regulatory authority prior to the commencement of mining operations. The scope of the permit encompasses the life-cycle of the mining operations from the siting of the mining area through the extraction of coal and related activities, the management and disposal of mining wastes, and the reclamation of affected lands and waters once extraction is complete. Commencing mining operations without an approved permit issued by the regulatory authority is unlawful under SMCRA, and is subject to enforcement actions. In applying for a permit, the applicant must submit its proposal for mining operations to the regulatory authority and specify the measures that would be taken to ensure compliance with the requirements and criteria of SMCRA and the implementing regulations. Prior to the issuance of the permit by the regulatory authority, Section 509 of SMCRA also requires the applicant to obtain a performance bond to demonstrate its financial capability to fulfill permit obligations through reclamation after mining ceases.", "Section 503 of SMCRA provides that any state may obtain primary jurisdiction over regulating surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-federal and non-Indian lands through submission of a program for approval by OSM. Once a state's program is approved, the state has the primary responsibility for achieving the purposes of the act. A primacy state is the sole issuer of permits, and OSM maintains a limited role in a state with an approved program. It evaluates each state's performance in carrying out its approved program, and it provides backup enforcement against violating operators in the event of default by the state. States are required to submit amendments to their programs (e.g., changes to state statutes or regulations) to OSM for determining consistency with the federal program.", "According to OSM, coal mining is currently occurring in 26 states. To date, all but two of those states (Tennessee and Washington) have achieved program primacy; OSM directly regulates surface coal mining and reclamation activities in those two states. At present, no Tribes have primacy.", "The permit is the heart of the SMCRA program, enabling regulatory authorities to determine whether mining may occur and to establish the terms for mining. The permit requirement is designed to protect the public health, safety, and the environment by conditioning permit issuance on the applicant's demonstration that mining and reclamation can be successfully accomplished. The permit requires the mine operator to plan the operation in detail to identify and avoid adverse environmental impacts and to facilitate site reclamation after mining is complete. Some have noted that it also gives the regulatory authority significant enforcement powers over the mining operation, including a basis for evaluating the feasibility of reclamation and risk, if any, to water supplies, land surfaces, public facilities, and other resources. Permits generally are issued for five-year terms. A valid permit carries the right of successive renewal, unless the regulatory authority finds that present mining and reclamation operations are not in compliance with SMCRA and its regulations, or for other reasons, such as the operator has not provided adequate performance bonding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Relationship Between SMCRA and the Clean Water Act", "paragraphs": ["The goal of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to \"restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\" To do so, Section 301 prohibits the discharge of pollutants from point sources into waters of the United States unless consistent with the requirements of the act. The CWA authorizes the discharge of pollutants under two different permit programs, both of which are likely to apply to coal mining activities. Section 404 authorizes discharges of dredged or fill materials into waters of the United States, while Section 402 governs discharges of pollutants other than dredged or fill material. Permits issued under Section 402, known as NPDES permits, restrict the amount of specified pollutants that may be discharged. Section 404 permits are issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (except in New Jersey and Michigan, which are not coal mining states), while Section 402 permits are generally issued by states, including all current coal mining states. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed technology-based wastewater effluent limitations for surface coal mining and reclamation operations, which are codified in 40 C.F.R. Part 434. These technology-based effluent limits and any more stringent water quality-based limits necessary to meet applicable state water quality requirements must be incorporated in NPDES permits. In addition, Section 401 of the CWA requires that each applicant for a federal license or permit submit a certification from the state in which the discharge originates that the discharge will comply with federal and state water quality requirements. ", "Although both SMCRA and the CWA are concerned with environmental impacts of regulated activities, they provide for separate regulatory programs with different purposes and permitting requirements and procedures. The CWA focuses primarily on regulating discharges of pollutants into waters of the United States from coal mining and a wide range of other sources, whereas SMCRA regulates environmental and other impacts of surface coal mining and reclamation operations. The requirements of the CWA have independent force and effect, regardless of the terms of the SMCRA permit, as is recognized in Section 702(a) of SMCRA, which provides that \"Nothing in this Act shall be construed as superseding, amending, modifying, or repealing the [Clean Water Act], the State laws enacted pursuant thereto, or other Federal laws relating to the preservation of water quality.\" Further, Section 508 of SMCRA requires that each permit application include \"the steps taken to comply with applicable air and water quality laws and regulations and any applicable health and safety standards.\"", "OSM points out that SMCRA, unlike the CWA, provides for the regulation of the environmental impacts, including the hydrologic impacts, of all phases of mining operations\u2014design, operation, and reclamation. Concerning coal mining, the CWA's regulatory scope is more limited than SMCRA's. The legislative history of SMCRA notes the limitations of the CWA concerning environmental impacts of coal mining activities.", "The [CWA] does not contain the statutory authority for the establishment of standards and regulations requiring comprehensive preplanning and designing for appropriate mine operating and reclamation procedures to ensure protection of public health and safety and to prevent the variety of other damages to the land, the soil, the wildlife, and the aesthetic and recreational values that can result from coal mining."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Stream Buffer Zone Rule and Revisions", "paragraphs": ["In 1979 OSM promulgated permanent program performance standards to implement SMCRA, including the stream buffer zone rule, for surface and underground mining operations. The stream buffer zone rule provided that no surface area within 100 feet of a perennial stream (a stream having flowing water year-round during a typical year) or a non-perennial stream with a biological community may be disturbed by surface operations or facilities unless the regulatory authority finds that the original stream channel would be restored and that, during and after mining, the activities would not adversely affect the quantity and quality of the stream segment within 100 feet of those activities. Stream-channel diversions done to mine coal beneath a streambed were excluded from these rules.", "In 1983, OSM revised the stream buffer zone and related rules to protect perennial streams and intermittent streams (streams that have flowing water during certain times of the year, when groundwater provides stream flow) from disturbance by coal mining activities. In order to protect streams from sedimentation and channel disturbance, the 1983 buffer zone rules provided that no land within 100 feet of a perennial or intermittent stream shall be disturbed by surface mining activities, including the dumping of mining waste, unless the regulatory authority grants a variance that specifically authorizes surface mining activities closer to or through such a stream. To grant such a variance, the regulatory authority must find that the proposed mining activity will not cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards and will not adversely affect water quantity and quality or other environmental resources of the stream. The 1983 rules deleted the requirements in the 1979 rules that the original stream channel be restored and replaced the biological community criterion for determining which non-perennial streams must be protected with a requirement for protecting all intermittent streams.", "In partial settlement of litigation over coal mining practices in West Virginia, OSM, the Army Corps of Engineers, and EPA developed a draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) on the effects of mountaintop removal mining in 2003. The settlement called for OSM to make changes to its stream buffer zone rule to improve consistency with the Clean Water Act. OSM proposed changes to the rules in 2004, but it subsequently decided to prepare a new PEIS and to draft revised rules and did not finalize the 2004 proposal. Both the PEIS and draft rules were released in 2007.", "OSM issued final revised buffer zone rules in December 2008. As described by OSM, the final rules required that surface coal mining operations be designed to minimize the amount of spoil placed outside the mined-out area, thus minimizing the amount of land disturbed. The rules also required that, to the extent possible, surface coal mining and reclamation operations be designed to avoid disturbance of perennial or intermittent streams and the surface of lands within 100 feet of those streams. If avoidance is not reasonably possible, the rules required that the permit applicant develop and analyze a range of reasonably possible alternatives; the regulatory authority would select the one that would have the least overall adverse impact on fish, wildlife, and related environmental values. According to OSM, the final rules did not mandate avoiding placement of coal mine waste in or within 100 feet of perennial or intermittent streams in all cases, because \"there is sometimes no viable alternative to the construction of coal mine waste disposal facilities in perennial or intermittent streams and their buffer zones, in which case avoidance is not reasonably possible.\" Restoration of stream ecological functions would not be required.", "The 2008 revised rules eliminated the provision in the 1983 stream buffer zone rule that had required a finding that the proposed activity would not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards. In doing so, OSM said that the previous language more closely resembled the Clean Water Act than the underlying provisions of SMCRA. The 2008 rules replaced the finding requirements in the 1983 rules with requirements for a finding that avoiding disturbance of the stream is not reasonably possible and a finding that avoiding disturbance of land within 100 feet of the stream either is not reasonably possible or is not necessary to meet the fish and wildlife and hydrologic balance protection requirements of the SMCRA regulatory program. Because the SMCRA rules would not substitute for or supersede the Clean Water Act, mine operators still would have to comply with the requirements of that law, OSM said. ", "Both industry and environmental groups said that the final rules did little to change the existing practice of disposing excess spoil into valleys and streams. In fact, OSM stated that a key purpose of the 2008 rules was to reduce confusion about the 1983 rule and to conform the regulations to historic practice of federal and state authorities. Environmental groups said that the final rules would actually reduce environmental protection for streams by making it easier for coal mine operators to obtain exemptions from the stream buffer zone requirement, thus increasing destructive mining activities in and around streams.

The Administration was seeking to return immediately to the more stringent 1983 rule until replacement rules could be adopted. The Administration argued that the 2008 rules do not adequately protect water quality and stream habitat. The court rejected the Administration's request, leaving the 2008 rules in place. However, litigation over the rules continued. In February 2014, the same federal court ruled that the 2008 rules had been issued without necessary consultation with federal wildlife agencies (under the Endangered Species Act). The court vacated the 2008 rules and reinstated the rules that had been in effect previously (the 1983 stream buffer zone rule). In December 2014, OSM formally withdrew the 2008 rules.

In November 2009, OSM identified a broad set of regulatory options that it was considering for revisions to the 2008 rules, ranging from formally reinstating the 1983 rule with small conforming changes, to requiring stricter buffer zone requirements for mountaintop removal mining operations on steep slopes. OSM officials subsequently began working on a new rule and an accompanying draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which would apply nationwide, not just in Appalachia. OSM's efforts to revise the rule were criticized, based on concerns about potential economic impacts of the rule and the quality of work on its EIS. However, OSM officials and environmental advocacy groups contended that a new rule was needed to protect waterways from surface mining operations.

However, the statute recognizes that for some types of coal mining operations, meeting this requirement can be difficult. During mountaintop removal mining and steep slope mining, in particular, rock that is taken from its natural state and broken up \"swells\" by as much as 15-25%, and thus cannot be fully returned to the mountain or mine area. The remaining material, called overburden, often is retained in nearby valleys, thus creating valley fills that may bury stream segments.

Forecast compliance costs vary significantly by mine type and between regions. The $52 million total consists of $45 million annually for surface coal mining operations and $7 million annually for underground mining operations. Nearly 46% of the expected compliance costs reflect new regulatory requirements on coal mining operations in the Appalachia region. Of the increased costs for operations in Appalachia, OSM estimated that 72% are for costs to surface mining operations there\u2014or, 33% of the total cost of the rule. Surface mines in the Illinois Basin and Western Interior regions are expected to experience cost increases of $0.60 per ton as a result of the proposed rule, while underground mines in those regions are expected to experience no increase in operational costs. In Appalachia, the average compliance cost for surfaces mines was estimated to increase operational costs by $0.40 per ton, while compliance costs for underground mines in Appalachia are expected to increase $0.01 per ton. ", "OSM also estimated administrative costs of the proposed rule for industry and government, representing primarily monitoring and permitting activities. In most cases, according to the agency, added administrative costs resulting from the rule are expected to be small for industry, adding on average about $0.01 per ton of coal mined. Costs in Appalachia will be slightly higher: $0.03 per ton for surface mining operations and $0.04 per ton for underground mines. Additional administrative costs for government entities are estimated to range from $1,830 per mine for underground mining regulating agencies in the Illinois Basin and the Western Interior, to $2,546 per mine for surface area mining regulating agencies in Central Appalachia and in the Northwest. In total, OSM estimated that government administrative costs will average $46,000 annually, with the highest annual costs experienced by regulating agencies in the Northern Rocky Mountains and Great Plains region ($24,200 total annualized costs).", "OSM estimated that 382 mines operated by small entities (i.e., mines with fewer than 500 employees, which is the Small Business Administration's definition of small entity) would be affected by the proposed rule. Of the total, 91% of such mines are located in Appalachia. OSM also estimated that 76% of the mines in Appalachia owned by small entities would experience compliance and administrative costs of less than 5% as a share of their revenues. However, nearly 11% of such mines in Appalachia would incur costs of 10% or more. In the Draft RIA, OSM notes that SMCRA Section 507(c) establishes a small operator assistance program and says that, if appropriations for it are made available, this program could assist some small operators with training and financial assistance in preparing elements of permit applications. OSM estimated that compliance costs for SBA small entities would range between zero and 3.6% of gross annual revenues, depending on the mining region. In Appalachia, compliance costs are estimated to average 4.7% of gross annual revenues for surface mines and 2.5% of gross annual revenues for underground mines.", "OSM estimated that the total aggregate annual compliance and related costs associated with the proposed rule would not exceed $60 million. Because the projected costs would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, the rule is not considered an economically significant rule by the Office of Management and Budget, nor is it a major rule under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7804.2).", "Absent the proposed rule, OSM's forecast for U.S. coal production showed a decrease of 162 million tons between 2020 and 2040, representing a 15% decrease during that period. The proposed rule was expected to affect coal production and consumption patterns across the United States over and above baseline conditions. OSM recognized that the proposed rule would increase the cost of producing coal, which may lead to an aggregate reduction in coal production. The agency estimates that under the proposed rule, coal production will decrease in aggregate by about 1.9 million tons annually, or approximately 0.2% compared with production expected under the baseline. OSM stated that the reduction largely reflects substitution of natural gas for coal among U.S. power plants, due to the increase in coal prices expected under the proposed rule. These changes in coal production would not be uniform and were expected to occur primarily in Appalachia (coal production is expected to decrease by 17.9 million tons between 2020 and 2040, or 0.4% of baseline production in the region), the Illinois Basin (an expected decrease of 6.4 million tons, or 0.2% of the region's baseline), and the Northern Rocky Mountain region (expected decrease of 14.7 million tons, or 0.1% of the region's baseline coal production).", "One measure of the proposed rule's effects could include reduction in coal reserve values associated with the rule, i.e., if coal reserves are \"stranded.\" However, OSM's analysis indicated that there will be no increase in stranded reserves under the proposal (or any of the other alternatives that the agency evaluated to develop the proposal).

OSM estimated that changes in coal industry employment resulting from the proposed rule will combine with these ongoing trends. Production-related reductions in annual employment demand were anticipated to range from 41 to 590 jobs below baseline projections, but they would be partially offset by annual employment demand increases ranging from 210 to 270 jobs above baseline projections. Some of the expected increased demand for coal-related labor would be for new highly skilled jobs (e.g., engineers and biologists), while others are expected to require similar skills as currently used by the industry (e.g., bulldozer operations).

Although the details of individual states' coal severance tax systems vary, regulatory changes that reduce production in a given region will result in reduced tax revenue. Changes in coal production under the proposed rule also were expected to result in changes in coal severance tax revenue to states. In total, OSM forecast an annualized decline in severance tax revenues of $2.5 million, across all coal-producing states.

Regulatory Alternative 2, which OSM did not select, would have prohibited all mining activities in or within 100 feet of perennial streams and would have prohibited the placement of excess spoil in both perennial and intermittent streams. It would have allowed no exceptions from the requirement to restore mined lands to their approximate original contour. These changes would require an amendment to SMCRA, because the law currently allows exceptions to the AOC requirement for mountaintop removal mining and steep slope mining operations.

The definition of \"material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area\" is revised by removing all proposed criteria and instead providing a list of factors that the regulatory authority, in consultation with the Clean Water Act authority, must identify in identifying material damage thresholds (see \" Definition of 'Material Damage to the Hydrologic Balance Outside the Permit Area' \"). Post-mining requirements for mountaintop removal mining operations are revised. For example, permit applicants will be required to have substantially, but not fully, implemented approved post-mining land use prior to final bond release, and applicants will not be required to post additional bond sufficient to ensure that lands approved for an AOC variance can be returned to AOC if the proposed post-mining land use is not implemented (see \" Approximate Original Contour (AOC) and AOC Variances \"). OSM provided clarification in response to industry criticism that the rule would effectively prohibit underground mining using longwall technology. The final rule states that it does not prohibit temporary impacts to streams and other water resources as a result of longwall mining as long as those impacts do not rise to the level of material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area.

A number of aspects of OSM's analysis changed as a result of regulatory changes reflected in the final rule, revised estimates based on public comments, and other factors. For example, OSM revised its baseline coal demand estimates because of continuing decline of the coal industry, largely due to substitution of natural gas for coal among U.S. power plants. As a result of reduced demand, the Stream Protection Rule, and other developments, OSM forecast a 10% decrease in national coal production (84 million tons, or 10%) between 2020 and 2040, compared with its previous estimates.

The Final RIA concludes that the coal industry will incur annual compliance costs of $81.5 million under the final rule (or 0.1% or less of aggregate annual industry revenues), compared with $52 million under the proposal (see \" Impacts of the Proposed Rule \"). This was caused by increases in forecasts for total industry and regulatory costs due to the rule, particularly with regard to bonding costs, industry administrative costs such as monitoring, and regulatory authority administrative costs. Despite the higher compliance cost forecast, OSM estimates that employment impacts will be minimal: coal employment will be reduced by 124 coal jobs on average each year due to decreased coal mined, while an additional 280 jobs will be created from increased compliance activity on average each year, for a net employment gain of 156 fulltime equivalents.
