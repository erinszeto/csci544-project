Twenty years ago, \"infrastructure\" was defined primarily in debates about the adequacy of the nation's public works\u2014which were viewed by many as deteriorating, obsolete, and of insufficient capacity. A typical report of the time, issued by the Council of State Planning Agencies, defined \"infrastructure\" as \"a wide array of public facilities and equipment required to provide social services and support private sector economic activity.\" According to the report, infrastructure included roads, bridges, water and sewer systems, airports, ports, and public buildings, and might also include schools, health facilities, jails, recreation facilities, electric power production, fire safety, waste disposal, and communications services.", "In a 1983 report, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) defined \"infrastructure\" as facilities with \"the common characteristics of capital intensiveness and high public investment at all levels of government.

Analysis required by that act was to include \"any physical asset that is capable of being used to produce services or other benefits for a number of years\" and was to include but not be limited to \"roadways or bridges; airports or airway facilities; mass transportation systems; wastewater treatment or related facilities; water resources projects; hospitals; resource recovery facilities; public buildings; space or communication facilities; railroads; and federally assisted housing.\"", "The Council established by P.L. 98-501 provided yet another definition of \"infrastructure.\" The Council's report characterized \"infrastructure\" as facilities with high fixed costs, long economic lives, strong links to economic development, and a tradition of public sector involvement.

As a result, the CIAO instituted a new program by which an agency could identify and assess its critical assets, identify the dependencies of those assets on other systems, including those beyond the direct control of the agency, and prioritize.

IV). According to PDD-63 \"these assessments shall ... include the determination of the minimum essential infrastructure in each sector\" (Sec. VIII.1).

These key assets can be people, facilities, services, processes, programs, etc. Next, the \"impact of loss\" for each of these assets is estimated. This is a measure of the loss to the company if the asset is damaged or destroyed. A simple rating system based on user-defined criteria can be used to measure the value of the asset (e.g., very low, low, moderate, high, extremely high) and the impact of its loss. In a more complex risk management system, the value of an asset and impact of loss can be calculated in monetary units. These values may be based on such parameters as the original cost to create the asset, the cost to obtain a temporary replacement for the asset, the permanent replacement cost for the asset, costs associated with the loss of revenue, an assigned cost for the loss of human life or degradation of environmental resources, costs to public/stakeholder relations, legal and liability costs, and the costs of increased regulatory oversight.", "While it acknowledged the need to identify critical assets, the NPC's guidance left it up to individual companies to determine the specific basis for \"criticality\" in their security assessments. It is important to note that the NPC initially defined a \"key asset\" with respect to a potential \"loss to the company\" rather than broader economic or social welfare impacts as called for in federal critical infrastructure strategies. This emphasis illustrates the practical challenge of relying on private companies to identify critical assets in the context of national infrastructure security.", "In an effort to establish and implement a more consistent standard for what constitutes a critical asset, the National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets requires DHS to \"develop a uniform methodology for identifying facilities, systems, and functions with national-level criticality ...

For example, among electric utilities, there was some question as to why certain assets were considered critical by IAIP, since some of those assets were not in use and others did not support significant electric loads. Similar inconsistencies emerged when IAIP's list was compared to critical asset lists developed by state agencies. As the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection in DHS testified before Congress \"what we have done to identify critical assets in the United States and what the states and local municipalities and cities have done often do not reconcile.\" According to press accounts, subsequent classified briefings with Members of Congress to review lists of critical assets in their states have continued to raise concerns about IAIP's critical asset identification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Infrastructure in the 9/11 Commission Report", "paragraphs": ["The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (known as the 9/11 Commission) made its final report public on July 22, 2004.

One concern is that an unclear or unstable understanding of what constitutes a critical infrastructure (or key resource) could lead to inefficient security policies. At the very least, a growing list of infrastructures in need of protection implies growing attention from the federal government and, implicitly, a need for more resources devoted to protect them. Under the Homeland Security Act and other legislation, the federal government is required to interact with each critical infrastructure, to support and maintain a database of vulnerabilities, to integrate the database with threat analyses, to monitor incidents on each of the infrastructures, and to issue warnings as appropriate. These activities call for time and resources. The federal government also may choose to assist financially in effecting necessary protective measures, not only for infrastructure owned and operated at the state or local level, but also for privately owned and operated infrastructures. Allocating limited public resources across an excessively broad range of infrastructures may be an inefficient use of resources. However, arbitrarily limiting the number of critical infrastructures a priori due to resource constraints might miss dangerous vulnerabilities.", "Unclear or shifting criteria for identifying individual critical assets and key assets may also lead to protection inefficiencies, especially where private companies are responsible for security spending. These criteria may become particularly important if federal agencies intend to implement and enforce any potential future security regulations related to critical infrastructure. Various private sector representatives state that they need clear and stable definitions of asset criticality so they will know exactly what assets to protect, and how well to protect them. Otherwise, they risk protecting too many facilities, protecting the wrong facilities, or both. Either outcome would increase ultimate costs passed through to consumers without commensurate security benefits, and could potentially divert scarce private resources from better uses, such as public safety or environmental protection.", "As oversight of the federal role in infrastructure security continues, questions may be raised concerning the ongoing efforts of DHS to define and prioritize critical and key assets. In addition to this specific issue, however, Congress may wish to assess how critical infrastructure identification fits in the nation's overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure. For example, if asset criticality is not clearly defined, increasing resources for infrastructure security inspections by DHS officials could be of limited value. Likewise, diverting infrastructure resources away from safety to enhance security might further reduce terror risk, but not overall public risk, if safety programs become less effective as a result. U.S. infrastructure security necessarily involves many groups: federal agencies, industry associations, large and small asset operators, and critical and non-critical asset owners. Reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common security goals is an oversight challenge for Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
