Missile defense has provento be a challenging and elusive endeavor. Moreover, the question of whether the United Statesshould deploy extensive defenses to protect against ballistic missile attack has been one of the mostdivisive political and national security issues of this generation. ", "The demise of the Soviet Union and the debate over the emergence of ballistic missile threatsfrom other nations changed the nature of the debate. For many, concerns about nuclear stabilitybetween the United States and Russia have receded as the two nations expanded their areas ofcooperation and improved their relationship, especially in the U.S. lead war on terrorism. Instead,many now focus on concerns about a possible attack from an adversary who possesses only a fewmissiles and may not be deterred by fear of U.S. retaliation. Without a missile defense capability,some argue, the United States itself may be deterred from using its conventional forces to protectU.S. allies and friends. Similarly, the United States might be unable to combat aggressive orprovocative actions on the part of \"rogue states\" armed with chemical, biological, or nuclear capableballistic missiles.

It also sought to develop for deployment a limited system to protect U.S. territory fromattack by longer-range ballistic missiles (national missile defense: NMD). Its plans for NMD wouldeventually have conflicted with the terms of the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty with theSoviet Union, which limited the United States and Soviet Union (now Russia) to a single, land-basedsystem for defense against long-range ballistic missiles. The Administration sought to preserve thebasic framework of the ABM Treaty by negotiating modifications that would have permitted thedeployment of a limited, land-based NMD site in Alaska.

President Bush alsostated that the United States would have to \"move beyond the constraints\" of the ABM Treaty. Heemphasized that \"Russia is not our enemy,\" and, therefore, Russia should not be concerned aboutU.S. deployment of missile defenses. Instead of seeking to modify the ABM Treaty so that theUnited States could deploy limited missile defenses, the President said \"we need a new frameworkthat allows us to build missile defenses to counter the different threats of today's world.\" (2) ", "The Administration began to outline the details of its plans for missile defenses in July 2001,after submitting its amended defense budget for FY2002 to Congress.

The Administration stated that it would explore abroader range of technologies and basing modes, \"including land, air, sea, and space-basedcapabilities that had been previously disregarded or inadequately explored.\" However, as isdescribed in more detail later in this report (see Table 1 ), the Administration appears to haveessentially increased funding evenly for each of the missile defense and sensor technologies alreadyin the defense budget. From a funding and programmatic perspective, the Administration did notappear to give increased priority to any particular program or introduce any major new researchdirections for FY2002 beyond what the Clinton Administration was already pursuing, except toaccelerate the process and integrate key components. A similar argument was made with respect tothe FY2003 missile defense budget of $7.8 billion.", "In its missile defense program, the Bush Administration eliminated distinctions betweentheater and national missile defenses (TMD and NMD). Instead, according to General Kadish, thedirector of MDA (formerly the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO)), the Administrationhas \"developed a research, development, and test program that focuses on missile defense as a singleintegrated BMD system.\" Furthermore, the objective of this program is to \"aggressively evaluateand develop technologies for the integration of land, sea, air, or space-based platforms\" and todevelop and deploy a global system of \"layered defenses, capable of intercepting missiles of anyrange at every stage of flight -- boost, mid-course, and terminal.\" (3) ", "Administration officials have highlighted two primary benefits of layered defenses. First,layered defenses would seek to provide the United States with more than one opportunity to targetan attacking missile, thus arguably increasing the chance of shooting it down. (A critique of thelayered defense concept is outlined in the section on Technology and Other Challenges.)", "Second, the layers could complicate an attacker's ability to defeat the overall system. Thisis because countermeasures, which are intended to confuse or overcome defenses, that might beeffective in one phase of a missile's flight might not work in other phases.", "The Bush Administration has emphasized that its missile defense program will concentrateon \"robust research and development\" into a wide range of missile defense technologies. Unlike theClinton Administration, the Bush Administration has not yet identified an architecture (a detailedmissile defense system with specific objectives and capabilities) that it will seek to deploy norestablished a schedule for the development and deployment of any particular system or element; but,a clear underlying objective is the early deployment of a defense designed against missiles aimed atU.S. territory. Because it has not identified the types of technologies or the numbers of interceptorsand radars that it intends to deploy, the Administration will not provide any costs for the missiledefense program or system. It emphasizes that cost estimates are premature under the new approach.", "Administration officials have stated that this research and development effort is \"designedto develop effective systems over time ... and to deploy that capability incrementally.\" The programenvisions the deployment of \"different combinations of sensors and weapons\" when thesetechnologies \"are proven through robust testing.\" These technologies could then be replaced by moreeffective or advanced systems when they become available. This approach is called an evolutionaryacquisition strategy. This strategy differs from the way in which most military acquisition programsoccur. It will likely be the subject of increased scrutiny. An analysis of this strategy and some of itsimplications follows in a subsequent section of this report.", "During congressional testimony in July 2001, Deputy Secretary of Defense Wolfowitz statedrepeatedly that the United States would not violate the ABM Treaty, but that the Treaty stood in theway of the Administration's missile defense efforts. He noted that some of the tests or activitiescould \"bump up\" against the limits in the Treaty in \"months not years.\" (4) However, the BushAdministration also stated that the United States would have liked to reach an agreement with Russiathat would allow these tests, and the eventual deployment of extensive missile defenses, to proceedwithout concern for the Treaty limits. ", "At a meeting in Italy in July 2001, President Bush and Russia's President Putin agreed thatthe two nations would hold discussions that focused on both offensive weapons and defensivesystems. Some interpreted this agreement to mean that the two nations would begin negotiations onnew treaties that would limit offensive nuclear weapons and missile defenses. Administrationofficials stated clearly, however, that these were not negotiations, but consultations. They also statedat that time the Administration did not plan simply to seek modifications in the ABM Treaty, but itwould not allow the Treaty to prevent research and development toward deployment even if thatultimately meant U.S. withdrawal from the Treaty. (5) Rather, the Bush Administration sought to convince Russia thatthe ABM Treaty was no longer relevant and that the two nations should agree to set it aside andreplace it with a new framework for their relationship. According to some reports, the United Stateswould share information about missile defense developments with Russia, but it would not acceptany limits on research, development, testing, or deployment of its systems. Russia, however, did notaccept the U.S. approach, and, on December 13, 2001, President Bush announced that the UnitedStates would withdraw from the Treaty. Actual withdrawal from the 1972 ABM Treaty occurredJune 13, 2002.

Currently, Russia and China are theonly two countries that could attack the United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles(ICBMs). Although other countries with short and medium range missile programs may aspire tojoin this club, there are factors other than scientific and infrastructure to consider. Variables suchas the availability of financial resources, political will, availability of foreign material and technicalassistance, and the affects of non proliferation and export control regimes all play a role in missiledevelopment. In this regard, countries discussed here other than Russia and China should beconsidered as potential future threats outside of their respective regions. Within their respectiveregions however, these countries, along with Russia and China, will present an ever increasingproliferation challenge to U.S. forces, friends, and allies. ", "Ballistic missile proliferation has continued steadily over the past two decades presenting avariety of security challenges to the United States. The number of countries with operationallydeployed ICBMs that could strike targets in the United States remains relatively small. There is,however, a fairly widespread and growing capability to launch shorter range missiles and a slowlyevolving capacity to launch medium range missiles. (6) These short to medium range missiles could not only threaten U.S.forces on a regional basis but could also serve as a precursor for the development of longer rangemissiles over the course of the coming decades. The transition from short to medium range missilesto ICBMs is more a matter of technical expertise than of technology. The principal hurdles todeveloping longer range missiles are manufacturing larger propulsion systems and designing amissile with more than one stage. With an existing short or medium range ballistic missileinfrastructure, overcoming these hurdles becomes an issue of having an experienced and qualifiedscientific and engineering staff. If a country does not have this expertise domestically, it can beimported. The United States routinely monitors ballistic missile development and deployment trendsin a number of critical countries. The countries listed below are those critical countries addressedin the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Foreign Ballistic Developments and the BallisticMissile Threat Through 2015.", "Russia. Russia has the most significant ballisticmissile inventory of all countries of concern. Russia currently has approximately 700 ICBMs (7) capable of delivering over3,000 nuclear warheads of various yields. (8) Russia also maintains a number of ballistic missile-capablesubmarines equipped with approximately 200 launchers that could deliver up to 900 nuclearwarheads. (9) Despite theseseemingly significant numbers, the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces have been in critical declineover the past decade due to a variety of internal and external factors. ", "Because of slower than anticipated development and also in response to the United Stateswithdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the Russian government has slowed the production of its newSS-27 ICBM (START II compliant with one nuclear warhead) and will instead retain a significantnumber of its older SS-18 and SS-24 ICBMs (each capable of carrying 10 multiple independentreentry vehicles (MIRVs)) that were destined to be destroyed under START II ceilings. Russia willretain 154 liquid-fueled SS-18 Satan heavy ICBMs and 36 SS-24 Scalpel ICBMs that were supposedto be eliminated by 2007 under the provisions of START II. (10) Russia's SS-27 Topol-M ICBM was first deployed in 1997 and Russia had deployed 23 SS-27s in silos as of the end of2000. (11) Althoughdesigned to carry one warhead, experts believe that with modifications the SS-27 could carryanywhere from 3 to 6 nuclear warheads. Russia claims to have developed missile defensecountermeasures for the SS-27 allowing the SS-27 to penetrate any known missile defense. Suchcountermeasures could include global positioning technology and independent warhead maneuveringcapability. It is important to note that independent sources have not substantiated Russian claimson the SS-27's penetration capabilities. Over the next five years, the Defense Intelligence Agencybelieves that Russia will focus its limited resources on the SS-27 program, the SS-26 short rangeballistic missile (SRBM), and the submarine-launched SSN-23 and Bulava-30 ballistic missiles. (12) ", "China. China's current ICBM force consistslargely of liquid propellant, single warhead, silo-based missiles. Approximately 20 of these missilesare CSS-4 missiles that can reach targets within the United States. About 12 CSS-3 ICBMs aredeployed and are most likely intended as a deterrent force to Russia, Pakistan, and China. (13) China also has a numbermedium-range JL-1 submarine launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Concerned about thesurvivability of their ballistic missiles, China is focusing on the development of mobile, solidpropellant ICBMs. The Intelligence Community projects that by 2015, most of China's land-basedICBMs will be mobile. (14) ", "China continues to develop solid-fueled DF-31 ICBMs for both silo and mobile basing, aswell as for submarine deployment. China has tested CSS-5 medium-range ballistic missiles(MRBMs) with dummy warheads or what the Pentagon calls \"penetration aids\" designed to defeatmissile defense systems. China is assessed to be capable of developing multiple reentry vehicles(MRVs) for its CSS-4 missiles in the next few years but MRV development for its new mobileICBMs and SLBMs would face significant technical hurdles and would be extremely costly. (15) China continues to deployshort-range CSS-6 and CSS-7 missiles across the Taiwan Strait. U.S. intelligence estimates thatthere are about 350 Chinese missiles deployed within about a 7\u00c2\u00bd minute flight time of Taiwan. Recently, China has offered to reduce the numbers of deployed missiles if Taiwan scales back itsarms purchases from the United States. China has also exported missile technologies to Iran,Pakistan, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia.", "Iraq. Western Intelligence believes that Iraq hasupwards of 20 Al Hussein SRBMs and about a dozen transporter, erector, launchers (TELs) inbreach of 1991's UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 687. (16) Other organizations, suchas the London-based Institute for Strategic Studies, suggest that this number could be closer to adozen or fewer missiles. (17) Iraq has continued its short-range missile program, which ispermitted under UNSCR 687, but U.S. and British Intelligence believe that they are working onextending the range of these missiles in excess of the 150 km range permitted. Iraq has also rebuiltpreviously-destroyed facilities and constructed new facilities designed to produce solid propellantsand to test missile engines with ranges in excess of 1,000 kms. ", "Iran. Iran has one of the largest missileinventories in the Middle East. Iran has a few hundred SRBMs consisting mostly of SCUD-Bs,SCUD-Cs, and Chinese CSS-8 missiles. Iran has also successfully tested and deployed a smallnumber of Shahab-3 MRBMs that could strike targets in Israel, Turkey, and most of Saudi Arabia.The Shahab-3 is based on the North Korean No Dong missile and is believed to have a range of1,300 kms. (18) Iran hasalso publically acknowledged the development of the Shahab-IV as a ballistic missile (laterreclassified as a space launch vehicle (SLV)) with an estimated range of 2,200 kms. (19) Iran is also believed to bedeveloping a Shahab-V with an unspecified range. In all cases, Iran's continuing development of itsmissile program will rely heavily on Russian, Chinese, and North Korean assistance. Despite Iran'scurrent efforts, most U.S. intelligence agencies believe that Iran will not be able to launch anICBM/SLV until the later half of this decade while one agency says that a successful test launch isunlikely prior to 2015. (20) ", "North Korea. North Korea's recent actions inrelation to the Agreed Framework and possible \"reconsideration of the missile testing moratorium\"could foreshadow their resumption of missile testing. The two-stage Taepo Dong 2, which somebelieve could deliver a several hundred kilogram nuclear payload to Alaska, Hawaii, and parts of thecontinental United States may be ready for flight testing in the near future. (21) If North Korea cansuccessfully integrate a third stage, this could boost the Taepo Dong's range to 15,000 km --sufficient range to strike all of North America. (22) North Korea also has hundreds of SCUD and No Dong missilesthat pose a significant WMD threat to U.S. and allied military forces in the region. North Koreahas continued to export ballistic missiles and associated technology, most notably to Pakistan andYemen. On December 11, 2002 the Spanish military intercepted 15 SCUD missiles at sea boundfor Yemen. This was later determined to be a legal shipment and was allowed to proceed. NorthKorea is also believed to be training missile engineers and technicians, most notably Syrian, in thedomestic production of SCUD missiles. ", "India. India continues their aggressive domesticdevelopment of ballistic missiles, primarily to establish a nuclear deterrent to Pakistani first use ofnuclear weapons and as a hedge against a confrontation with China. (23) The Prithvi I, asingle-stage, liquid fueled, road-mobile missile, is currently India's only deployed ballisticmissile. (24) India alsocontinues to develop the Prithvi II, a 250 km SRBM. India has tested the Agni-series of MRBMwith a reported range of 2,000 km. These Agni-series of missiles will likely become operational inthe next few years and will become the mainstay of India's MRBM forces. (25) India has a domestic spacelaunch vehicle program referred to as the Surya program. Intelligence sources believe that Indiacould convert this SLV into an ICBM within one to two years after the decision had been made todo so. (26) India is actively developing the Sagarika SLBM and is attempting to buy or lease nuclear submarines withthe intent of modifying the submarines to accommodate SLBMs.", "Pakistan. Pakistan's pursuit of missile-deliverednuclear weapons is a considered by many experts as a deterrent to India's nuclear program as wellas their numerically-superior conventional forces. (27) Like India, Pakistan is developing an indigenous ballistic missileproduction capacity and has a variety of missiles. The short range (80 km) Hatf I is a simple solidpropellant missile designed not only for domestic use but also for export. The Hatf III (modifiedChinese M-11 missile) is a single-stage, solid propellant missile with a range of at least 300 kms. Pakistan also has a number of No Dong missiles (renamed Ghauri) from North Korea with a rangeof 1,500 km. Pakistan is developing and testing Ghauri 2 and Ghauri 3 missiles with reported rangesof 2,000 and 3,000 kms, respectively. (28) Pakistan is also developing the road-mobile, two-stage solidpropellant Shaheen II with a reported range of 2,500 kms. (29) ", "Libya. U.N. sanctions from 1992 to 1999 arebelieved to have severely limited Libya's ability to obtain the requisite expertise, materials, andequipment to continue its development of MRBMs and ICBMs. (30) Since the removal ofsanctions in April 1999, Libya has actively attempted to refurbish its aging SCUD force as well asobtain complete, long-range missile systems through a variety of foreign suppliers. Reports suggestthat Libya may have received No Dong MRBMs from North Korea, but this has not been confirmedby Western intelligence sources. (31) Libya may be working on its Al Fatah missile that it claims hasa 1,000 km range (U.S. intelligence believes the range is closer to 200 kms.) but this missile has notyet been tested. (32) ", "Syria. Syria possesses an extensive mobileSCUD-B, SCUD-C, and SS-21 SRBM arsenal. (33) These systems could allow Syria to strike deeply into theterritories of potential regional adversaries Israel, Iraq, Turkey, and Jordan. (34) Although Syria has notshown any overt interest in acquiring longer-range missiles, it is possible that as regional securityprospects continue to deteriorate, Syria may attempt to acquire longer-range systems such as the NoDong MRBM."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Issues & Acquisition Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Hit-to-Kill. ( [author name scrubbed], Specialist inNational Defense ) The concept of kinetic kill or hit-to-kill has been a primary focus of the missiledefense program since the conception of the SDI in the early 1980s. Previously, the United Statespursued missile defense concepts that employed nuclear weapons as interceptors. More conventionalexplosive warheads were used to develop the PAC-2 system used in the Persian Gulf war againstIraqi Scud missiles. Advanced and exotic concepts, such as various lasers, were largely deemedimpractical during the late 1980s and early 1990s.", "A kinetic kill interceptor would seek to destroy its intended target through a direct collisionat relatively high speeds. The force of the impact would then destroy the attacking missile orwarhead, render it inoperable, or divert it from its intended target. With such an approach, anear-miss has the same practical affect as a large distance miss: the target is not destroyed. ", "Kinetic kill as a concept for destroying short- and medium-range ballistic missiles appearsto be in the process of proving itself. After a string of failed intercept tests, the THAAD programbegan a series of successful tests. Barring major, unforseen technical or engineering problems, itappears that a kinetic kill warhead for THAAD can be developed. The same is true of the PAC-3system. The next generation Patriot interceptor seems to be proving the concept of kinetic kill forshort-range missile defenses, despite the most recent test failures in February 2002.", "The key question remaining, however, centers around levels of effectiveness, particularly inwartime. Under test-range conditions, most military systems perform better than they do in anoperational environment. The Patriot system used in Desert Storm is a notable example. Prior tothe war, Patriot successfully intercepted 17 of 17 very different targets under a variety of test rangeconditions. Patriot encountered a vastly different operational environment when deployed, and itssuccess or failure during the war is still debatable, and, according to experts, probably unknowable.", "Kinetic kill as a concept for destroying long-range ballistic missiles is even more problematicat this stage. There is no unambiguous, empirical evidence to support the contention that kinetic killfor ICBM defense will work. Missile defense advocates argue that since the mid-1980s, a string ofsuch tests have occurred with varying degrees of success; some have failed to achieve interception,while others were deemed successful. ", "But in almost every case, post-test doubts have been raised. Critics have charged that testresults over the past two decades have been exaggerated by false claims of success and promises ofperformance that later proved false. Many tests were proven to have had their targets significantlyenhanced to ensure the likelihood of success.", "Some missile defense advocates say this may be true. But kinetic kill for ICBM defense iscomparable to where kinetic kill was for systems such as PAC-3 several years ago. They maintain,therefore, that continued development, and especially more realistic testing, is needed to ensure thatthe kinetic kill concept for long-range missiles can eventually be deployed.", "Layered Defenses. ( [author name scrubbed], Specialistin National Defense ) The concept of layered defense, which dates back to at least the 1960s, andwas developed more systematically in the 1980s, envisions deploying several missile defensesystems, each designed to intercept an attacking missile or warhead at a different stage of its flighttrajectory. The concept arguably would allow for multiple intercept opportunities. Although thispresents the possibility that one element of the system may not work as intended, proponents arguethat multiple intercept opportunities significantly increase the chance that an attacking missile orwarhead will be destroyed.", "Proponents of layered defenses argue that each layer is able to attack a different vulnerabilityof the attacking ballistic missile and that, because each layer is statistically independent of everyother layer, the probability of a warhead getting through all of the layers (1 to N) can be given by asimple multiplication of the probabilities of surviving each independent attack. (35) This analysis wouldreadily lead to a conclusion that a defense with three layers, for example, might let extremely fewmissiles or warheads get through.", "Other analysts, however, would argue that this is a wrong conclusion. In the first place, thereis no empirical evidence of an air defense system with a probability of intercept (P i ) much greaterthan about 30 percent (or 0.3). So one might conclude more realistically that the probability that anattacking missile or warhead will survive is closer to 34 percent. (36) Moreover, it isargued, (37) even if oneassumes that each layer is 90 percent effective, the layered defense model fails because the layersare not statistically independent for at least two reasons:", "Each attacking warhead or missile must encounter each of the layers in order,so the performance of one layer will affect the performance of the next layer and so on. For example,if the first layer underperforms because some countermeasure is unexpectedly successful, then thesecond layer will be required to deal with more simultaneous targets than expected; if one missileor warhead avoids interception, that may mean that circumstances are favorable for the next missileto get through also. Even if each layer is over designed by a factor of about 2, failure of one layercan still lead to saturation of the next. For example, if we expect the terminal layer to have to handle10 warheads, we might design it to handle 20, but if earlier layers then fail so that the terminal layeris presented with 30 targets, at least 10 warheads will get through to their intended destination evenif the terminal layer works perfectly. The failure of an early layer would thus result in the collapseof the missile defense system: the layered 'pyramid' defense is balanced on its vertex, rather than setfirmly on its base.", "Until a layered defense has been tested under realistic conditions, when it mustengage warheads nearly simultaneously in each layer, it is unrealistic for defense planners to assumethat there are no problems of command and control among the layers, and that unknown variablesdo not operate to degrade the system in unpredicted ways. Such a test would be expensive anddifficult to achieve, requiring the multiple simultaneous launch of severalICBMs.", "The probability of an attacking warhead surviving intercepts by three \"correlated\" layerscannot be known without making assumptions about the mechanism of the correlation andnon-independence of the layers. In general, critics conclude the performance of the system may beno better than the performance of the best layer, and then only if that layer is not saturated by thesheer numbers of missiles, warheads, or countermeasures.", "Layered defense proponents are likely to understand, and perhaps agree, with many of thesepoints. But supporters will respond by suggesting these issues can be adequately addressed in thedesign of a missile defense architecture and adjustments made during its development (see below).", "Acquisition Strategy & Congressional Oversight. ( Gary Pagliano, Specialist in National Defense ) Some observers, particularly critics of the missiledefense program, have expressed concern that the Administration's overall approach for managingthe program could hinder Congress's ability to conduct effective oversight of it. Three areas of theAdministration's management approach are at issue: The first concerns the Administration's planto use evolutionary acquisition with spiral development to develop and acquire missile-defensesystems. The second concerns a DOD directive that exempts the missile defense program fromcertain reporting requirements that are normally applied to major defense acquisition programs. Thethird concerns a decision to classify certain missile defense testing and program information.", "The Administration and its supporters argue that these three developments are needed to helpthe program proceed expeditiously and to help prevent potential adversaries from learning how toevade or overcome U.S. missile-defense systems when they are deployed. Critics argue that thesethree factors could reduce Congress's ability to understand, track, and thereby conduct effectiveoversight of the Administration's missile defense program. Each of these three developments isdiscussed below.", "Evolutionary Acquisition with Spiral Development. ( Gary Pagliano, Specialist in National Defense ) In presenting its new missile defense program toCongress in 2001, the Administration announced that missile defense systems would be developedand acquired under a relatively new approach called evolutionary acquisition with spiraldevelopment, or spiral development for short. As discussed in another CRS report, (38) spiral development is anoutgrowth of the defense acquisition reform movement of the 1990s, and represents a departure fromthe traditional DOD approach for developing and acquiring major weapon systems. Spiraldevelopment is aimed at achieving certain widely accepted defense-acquisition goals, including thefollowing: (1) getting usable increments of a weapon capability into service sooner; (2) mitigatingtechnical risk in acquisition programs involving new or emerging technologies; (3) taking advantageof user feedback in terms of determining how to modify and improve the system; and (4) facilitatingthe incorporation of new technologies into the system design during the system's life cycle.", "Missile defense was the first major weapon acquisition program to be publicly linked withspiral development. DOD officials, however, have stated that they want spiral development to bethe new \"default\" (i.e., standard) acquisition strategy for major weapons acquisition programs, andhave since announced their intention to apply spiral development to other major weapon acquisitionprograms, such as the Navy's DD(X) next-generation surface combatant program.", "Under an evolutionary acquisition strategy, a basic version of a weapon system is developedand fielded with the intent of subsequently developing and deploying more capable versions of thesystem as technology and requirements are further refined. A critical aspect of evolutionaryacquisition is spiral development, under which the various elements of a weapon system evolveincrementally over time in an iterative manner. Instead of attempting to develop a system that will,upon first deployment, fully satisfy a detailed military requirement, systems under an evolutionaryacquisition strategy would be developed, tested, deployed, and modified in a cyclic process that, inprinciple, would permit weapons developers to incrementally work toward a final systemconfiguration that is eventually capable of meeting its required objectives.", "A distinct characteristic of evolutionary development is a reduced ability, particularly at theoutset of a program, to define what the deployed system might look like at various points in thefuture. Rather than attempting to define final configuration at the outset, evolutionary developmentconsciously treats this issue as an open question to be addressed over time as elements of the systemare developed, deployed, evaluated, and modified. In this sense, the Administration's proposedmissile defense effort is more of an evolving concept than a typical military system in development.", "The Administration's missile defense plan would apply evolutionary acquisition and spiraldevelopment to an entire family of system development efforts related to the common mission ofmissile defense. Under the Administration's plan, missile defense systems would be built, tested,deployed, and evaluated incrementally. The final missile defense system or architecture -- that is,the numbers and characteristics of the land-, sea-, air-, and space-based system involved -- wouldbe determined gradually over the course of several years. During this period, systems capable ofperforming similar portions of the missile defense mission (i.e., the boost phase, the midcoursephase, or the terminal phase) would be in implicit competition with one another for places in thefinal system configuration.", "The Administration's plan to employ this acquisition strategy for missile defense is consistentwith its view that missile defenses are urgently needed. The Administration argues that deployingmissile defenses sooner with less capability than later versions is desirable because any improvementin U.S. missile defense capabilities would complicate enemy planning and thereby strengthendeterrence against ballistic missile attacks. The Administration also argues that the strategy isappropriate for weapon acquisition programs, such as missile defense, where the fundamentaltechnologies involved are less technically mature than they are for well-established types ofweapons, such as aircraft and ships.", "A major consequence of the Administration's proposed evolutionary acquisition strategy isthat the missile-defense program would not feature the familiar phases and milestones of thetraditional DOD acquisition system. Another consequence, already reflected in DOD testimony, isthat BMDO cannot provide Congress with a description of its final missile defense architecture, thecapabilities of any near- or longer-term system, the specific dates by which most elements of theemerging architecture are to be tested and deployed, an estimate of the eventual total cost of themissile-defense program, or estimates of the amounts of funding that the program will require inindividual years beyond FY2002. Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish, Director of BMDO (now MDA), statedthe following to the Senate in July 2001 in introducing the Administration's missile-defense plan", "But before I proceed to describe the newprogram in detail, I would like to make clear what this program does not do. It does not define aspecific architecture. It does not commit to a procurement program for a full, layered defense. Thereis no commitment to specific dates for production and deployment other than for lower-tier terminaldefense systems....", "First, we are recommending a broad, flexibleapproach to RDT&E that allows us to explore multiple development paths and to reinforce successbased on the best technological approaches and the most advantageous basing modes in order tohedge against the inherent uncertainty of the ballistic missile defense challenge. Second, we arerecommending an acquisition approach that is evolutionary, one that will allow us to field systemsincrementally once they are proven through realistic testing. And third, rather than committing toa single architecture as we have done in the past, we will deploy over time different combinationsof sensors and weapons consistent with our national strategicobjectives....", "This robust RDT&E program aims todemonstrate what does and does not work. Those activities showing the greatest promise willreceive greater resource emphasis. Our progress will inform an annual high-level decision-makingprocess that will steer the BMD program in the most promising direction, taking into accountoptimal approaches and the most reliable information on costs, allowing informed research,production, and deployment decisions....", "The business of missile defense requires copingwith a number of technological, developmental, acquisition, and threat uncertainties. For this reason,I cannot tell you today what exactly the system will look like 15, 10, or even five years from now. This system will take shape over time. We do not intend to lock ourselves into a highly stylizedarchitecture based on either known technologies or hoped for advances in technology that will takea decade or more to complete. We intend to go beyond the conventional build-to-requirementsacquisition process....", "Specific system choices and time lines will takeshape over the next few years through our capability-based, block approach. We will increase ourcapability over time through an evolutionary process as our technologies mature and are proventhrough testing. The block approach allows us to put our best, most capable technologies \"in play\"sooner than would otherwise be possible. We have organized the program with the aim ofdeveloping militarily useful capabilities in biannual blocks, starting as early as the 2004-2006 timeframe....", "We must deviate from the standard acquisitionprocess and recognize the unprecedented technical challenges we are facing. We do not have major[missile] defense acquisition programs in the FY2002 budget. We do not have program activitieswith traditional fixed milestones and clearly marked phases showing the road toproduction.", "The new approach to BMD developmentfeatures more streamlined, flexible management through comprehensive and iterative reviews. Wewill establish yearly decision points to determine the status of the available technologies and conceptevaluations in order to be in a position to accelerate, modify, truncate, or terminate efforts in aparticular area. This comprehensive annual review process will also help us make decisions to shapethe evolving systems and allocate resources to optimally support them. (39)", "The Administration and its supporters argue that the use of spiral development for the missiledefense program (or other weapon acquisition programs) will not prevent Congress from conductingeffective oversight, and could even improve Congress's oversight ability in some respects, becauseCongress will retain its role in approving each block, or segment, in a spiral development program,and because the information that DOD provides for the block to be approved will be more reliablethan the potentially speculative information it might present under the traditional acquisitionapproach about what the entire program might look like from beginning to end.", "Critics of the Administration's plan to use spiral development argue that it could reduceCongress's ability to provide effective oversight by putting Congress in the position of approving thestart of a program whose outlines are only vaguely defined, because the lack of an original estimateof the program's overall quantities, cost, schedule, and cost would deprive Congress, years later, ofa benchmark against which to measure performance of the program, and because the built-inpotential for changes in a spiral development program could make funding projections for spiraldevelopment programs more volatile than funding projections for traditional developmentprograms. (40) ", "Exemption from Reporting Requirements. ( GaryPagliano, Specialist in National Defense ) In January 2002, the Secretary of Defense issued amemorandum exempting the missile defense program from certain reporting requirements normallyapplied to major defense acquisition programs (even those that employ spiral development). TheAdministration's stated intent in issuing this directive was to help streamline the management andoversight of the missile defense program and thereby enable it to proceed more expeditiously. Thisobjective is consistent with the Administration's interest in fielding missile defense systems withoutdelay. Critics of the Administration's missile defense program, however, argue that the directive willdeprive Congress of key program information and thereby reduce the ability of Congress to conducteffective oversight of the program. (41) ", "Information to Be Classified. ( Gary Pagliano,Specialist in National Defense ) In May 2002, the Administration announced that certain informationabout the missile defense program, including details about developmental tests, will henceforth beclassified, and, therefore would not be released to the public. Administration officials argue thatclassifying the information will help prevent potential adversaries from learning about the technicalcharacteristics of U.S. missile defense systems and using that information to design ballistic missileswith features designed to evade or overcome U.S. defenses. Critics of the decision argue that someof the information the Administration has decided to classify, such as basic details about earlydevelopmental tests, would be of no practical use to a potential adversary, and that theAdministration's actual motive in limiting access to the information is to shield the missile defenseprogram from public scrutiny and criticism.

The laser would seek to rupture or damage the missile's booster skinto cause the missile to lose thrust or flight control and fall short of the intended target before decoys,warheads, or submunitions are deployed. The ABL's intended range is several hundred kilometers.Major subsystems include the lethal laser, a high-precision tracking system for keeping the laserbeam on target, and an adaptive optics system that compensates for atmospheric effects to keep thebeam tightly focused.", "The ABL program was transferred to BMDO, now the MDA, from the Air Force. The MDAstates there is no current system or architecture envisioned for missile defense, including specificsfor the ABL.

Five of these aircraftwould deploy to a theater to support two 24-hour combat air patrols. These aircraft would bepositioned behind the friendly line of troops and moved closer toward enemy airspace as local airsuperiority is achieved. The most recent cost estimate was $10.7 billion (life cycle costs), whichincludes an estimated $1.6 billion for the current program development and risk reduction phase. ", "The contractor team consists of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and TRW. Boeing is responsiblefor the aircraft and for overall management, including systems integration. Lockheed Martin isresponsible for the beam control systems, including target tracking and atmospheric compensation.TRW is responsible for the lethal laser and for ground support systems. There are numeroussubcontractors.", "The system currently under development will attempt its first missile shoot-down test in2005. BMDO states this half-power ABL could be available for deployment as an emergencycapability immediately following lethality demonstrations scheduled for late 2005. If all goesaccording to schedule, this system and the next two could provide an initial operating capability: one aircraft on station, one preparing to arrive on station, and one on ground alert between FY2009and FY2011, depending on the results of additional operational testing.", "Congressional concerns about the ABL have centered on two main issues: the maturity of keytechnologies and the concept of operations. First, although proponents contend that the ABL employsmature technology, others characterize key aspects (particularly the atmospheric compensationsystem) as experimental. Critics also claim that the tests needed to resolve this question, which arebeing conducted concurrently with the development of the technology, will not take place until 2005.This date is after a second aircraft is scheduled to be ordered, and just months before the firstshoot-down test. The compressed and concurrent nature of this schedule also is an issue of concern.", "The Defense Department's Office of Test and Evaluation informed Congress in its FY2000annual report (January 2001) that the 24-month EMD (Engineering, Manufacturing, andDevelopment) program is \"alarmingly short....[the schedule] allows for no technical problems or testfailures, and the many integration and test activities cannot all physically be accomplished in the timeallotted for EMD.\" However, this schedule is likely to change due to the two year delay for the lethalshoot-down.", "Second, there is disagreement about whether the ABL would be operationally effective, evenif its technology performs as planned. The ability of the ABL to destroy enemy missiles at itsintended range depends on a number of factors, including atmospheric conditions between the laserand the target, possible enemy countermeasures, and the worldwide trend towards deployment oflonger-range missiles for theater operations. Possible technical countermeasures include hardeningthe missile casing, spinning the missile, or applying a polished finish to the missile.", "In addition, the ability to deploy ABL aircraft during crisis or war will depend on the abilityto provide a relatively safe area of operations through air superiority. It is not clear whether enemyforces would wait for this to happen and render their ballistic missile forces more vulnerable, or seeincentives to launch their missiles before ABL systems were deployed, or whether an opponentmight choose to wait out a crisis because a force of ABL aircraft probably would not be deployedon 24-hour combat patrols indefinitely.", "Space-Based Boost. ( [author name scrubbed], Specialistin Science & Technology Policy ) The mission of the Space-based Boost intercept portion of theprogram is to develop the capability of shooting down ballistic missiles of any range in their boostphase (i.e., before the missiles have released their payload) from platforms located in orbit. Twoconcepts are under development: a space-based laser (SBL) and space-based kinetic weapons. Bothconcepts have been under development to varying degrees since before SDI in the early 1980s. Congressional funding support for this portion of the program is waning.", "In FY2002, the Bush Administration had requested $170 million for space-based laserdevelopment, with much of that directed toward the development of an Integrated Flight Experiment,to be conducted in space and initially scheduled for 2012, and the construction of a test facility tobe located at Stennis Space Flight Center. However, Congress, concerned that the technology wasnot mature enough to warrant the development of the flight experiment at this time, appropriatedonly $30 million for the program. As a result, the Integrated Flight Experiment (which was projectedto cost between $1 billion and $3 billion) and the test center were cancelled. The BushAdministration's FY2003 request for the space-based laser was $34 million, and directed primarilyat reducing technical risks associated with key components (the megawatt hydrogen-fluoride laser,mirrors, beam controls, pointing/tracking/fire controls, etc.). Congress reduced the request by $10million in its FY2003 appropriations. ", "The space-based kinetic energy component of the space-based boost phase intercept portionof the program is designed to further develop the key component technologies including the kinetickill vehicle, boosters, sensors, battle management and control, and platform integration. Development work and experiments are to help reduce the technical risks and lead to a designdecision in FY2006 or later. This element was a new start in FY2002 and received $23 million. TheBush Administration requested $53million for FY2003 and had proposed major increases in theprogram in the out-years. Congress cut the request by $50 million. In its appropriations report, theHouse Appropriations Committee stated that greater emphasis should be placed on accelerating themanufacture of existing systems, such as the PAC-3, and on accelerating the development of othermore mature technologies.", "There are a number of issues associated with space-based boost phase intercept. Any suchsystem could also function as a anti-satellite weapon, an issue that remains highly controversial. Thedesirability of stationing weapons in space generates differing opinions. Also, the technical hurdlesassociated with space-based interceptors -- especially lasers, with their weight, size, and reliabilityconstraints -- are difficult. Feasibility is not yet certain, hence the need for the demonstrationprograms. At the very least, how long it will take to overcome those hurdles and at what costremains uncertain. Although no longer a constraint, when the ABM Treaty was in force, testing anddeploying these systems in an ABM mode had been prohibited.", "Sea-Based Boost. ( [author name scrubbed], Specialistin National Defense ) The Sea-Based Boost program was created by the Bush Administration in2001 as part of its new missile defense program. The general idea of using sea-based missiles tointercept enemy ballistic missiles in their boost-phase, however, goes back several years. Thesea-based boost-defense concept is of potential interest because forward-deployed Navy shipsoperating off the coasts of other countries might be close enough to certain ballistic missile launchsites of concern for high-speed, high-acceleration, ship-launched interceptors to fly inland from theship and intercept enemy ballistic missiles during the boost phase.", "The sea-based boost-defense concept appears most feasible for use against missiles launchedfrom sites that are close or somewhat close to international waters, since this would reduce thedistance that the interceptor would need to fly to reach the enemy missile and thereby increase thechance that the interceptor would reach it during its boost phase. The concept might thus have themost potential for intercepting missiles launched from countries such as North Korea, Libya, orperhaps Iran. The concept would appear to offer little potential for intercepting long-range Russianor Chinese missiles, whose launch sites are located deep inland, because these missiles are morelikely to complete their boost phase before a ship-launched interceptor (even one with a high-speed,high-acceleration booster) could reach them.", "Although the Sea-Based Boost program is not yet well defined, a robust sea-based boostsystem would likely require an interceptor missile with:", "a much higher maximum speed, or burn-out velocity (perhaps 6 to 8 kilometersper second [kps]) than that of the SM-3 interceptor missile now being developed for the Sea-BasedMidcourse system (which has a maximum speed of a bit more than 3 kps);", "a high rate of acceleration to maximum speed, to help meet the shortengagement times associated with boost-phase intercepts; and", "a kill vehicle different from the Sea-Based Midcourse kill vehicle, because thelatter is designed to operate against a small and relatively cold target, while a boost-defense killvehicle would need to be capable of operating against a large and hot-burningtarget.", "The first two characteristics will likely require either a major modification to the existingSM-3 missile design or the development of an entirely new missile with a diameter of up to 27inches. Whether a modified SM-3 or an entirely new design, a higher-speed missile developed forthe Sea-Based Boost program might prove suitable, with a different kill vehicle, for use as animproved interceptor for the Sea-Based Midcourse system. Conversely, a higher-speed missiledeveloped for an improved Sea-Based Midcourse system might prove suitable, with a different killvehicle, for use as the interceptor for the Sea-Based Boost system. (See section on the Sea-BasedMidcourse program.) Using the same basic interceptor missile for both programs could reduce totalsea-based missile defense costs.", "It may also be possible, as a near-term stopgap measure, to develop a more limitedboost-phase capability based on the SM-3 missile. Although the SM-3 was designed to interceptslower-moving theater-range ballistic missiles rather than faster-moving intercontinental ballisticmissiles (ICBMs), the SM-3 may have some potential to intercept certain ICBMs -- specifically,those that are fired from coastal launch pads -- during the later (i.e., exoatmospheric) part of theirboost phase, before they have attained their maximum speeds.", "A mid-2002 discussion of the sea-based boost concept stated:", "Although the radar currently in place on Aegiscombatants has enough power and resolution to detect and track ICBMs during the boost phase, thenavy has optimized the system's performance and displays to defend against targets such as cruisemissiles and missiles launched from airplanes. The required modifications for ICBM defense are nottrivial, but they are achievable. What is totally missing at present is a suitable boost-phase missileinterceptor.", "Some U.S. Navy officials proposed using SM-2Block IV (43) missiles toengage boosting ICBMs in the upper atmosphere; that proposal, however, was fraught with a greatdeal of technical risk and required the ship to be within 50 kilometers of the launch site, making theship itself vulnerable. A more practical approach may be developing a missile interceptor intendedto engage the boosting ICBM later in its boost phase above the atmosphere, allowing ships to be asmuch as 1,000 kilometers from the launch site. ", "Developers could use the SM-3 test missiles beingproduced for the navy's midcourse risk-reduction effort as a starting point for suitable interceptormissiles. Successful boost-phase intercept missiles, however, would have to be faster than the testmissiles....", "Using the modified SM-3 or wide-diameter missiles(fast-accelerating interceptors with high terminal speeds), the ship could be as far as 1,000 kilometersfrom the launch point. U.S. Navy ships thus equipped in international waters could engage missileslaunched from all of North Korea or Iraq. The effectiveness of sea-based boost-phase missile interceptors against ICBMs launched from Iran would depend on the part of the country from whichthe ICBMs were launched. In some cases, U.S. forces would need ground-based or airbornesupplements. ", "A sea-based boost-phase capability has clear politicaladvantages and some disadvantages. Its main advantage is the ability to provide a potential defenseagainst ICBMs launched from North Korea and most parts of the Middle East. At the same time, seabasing would present no threat to Russia's and China's land-based ICBM deterrents because thoselaunch points are far inland. ", "As for disadvantages, a sea-based boost-phasesystem would potentially threaten Russia's submarine-launched deterrent, assuming a capabilityexisted to estimate the general location of the submarine. Second, any boost-phase defenses wouldrequire the establishment of a \"no-launch zone\" or other special procedures over the rogue state anda willingness in extremis to delegate the engagement decision to the local U.S. commander. Bothrequirements may be difficult to sustain politically. Finally, any boost-phase concept would requirelaunching the interceptors in the direction of the country launching the ICBMs as well as towardthird parties that may not be involved. For example, launches against North Korean missiles withboost-phase missile interceptors would entail launches on azimuths toward both North Korea andChina. When defending against Iraqi and Iranian missile launches, the boost-phase missileinterceptors would fly over several countries on an azimuth toward Russia. Additionally, debris fromthe engagement (damaged warheads, spent interceptor boosters, and so forth) could have an impacton uninvolved countries. ", "If the United States accepts these politicaldisadvantages, the operational advantages of a sea-based boost-phase interceptor are significant.With the potential exception of Iran, these interceptors are most effective against the countries inneed of dissuasion and deterrence, and they are less effective against former adversaries that needreassurance.

This same booster willbe evaluated (with a different kill vehicle) for sea-based midcourse roles.\" (45) The program could bepursued as either a complement to air- and space-based boost-defense systems or a hedge against thepossibility of technical problems in these other programs. General Kadish also stated in July 2001that MDA is \"going to institute concept studies and [is] looking at concepts on how to do the boostphase with kinetic energy, as a hedge against the directed energy, should we run into problems there.

The goal is to conduct a flybyexperiment and determine whether an infrared sensor can detect the missile. Leap's solid-fuel divertand attitude control system (DACS) would likely be replaced with a larger, liquid fuel system thatwould give the kill vehicle more maneuverability.", "While the boosting missile is easy to spot because ofits large infrared signature, the weapon becomes encased in a plume of hot gases as it reaches higheraltitude and thinner atmosphere.

Achieving a capability against theater-range ballisticmissiles involves modifying the SPY-1 radar to improve its ability to detect and track ballisticmissiles and developing a new version of the Standard Missile interceptor known as the SM-3. Compared to the earlier SM-2 missile, the SM-3 would incorporate a third-stage rocket motor to givethe missile a higher maximum speed (i.e., a higher \"burn-out velocity\"), and a kinetic kill vehicle(KKV) called the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) that destroys the enemy missileby colliding with it.", "MDA Director Kadish's July 2001 testimony and subsequent statements suggest that theAdministration's plan for Sea-Based Midcourse is to proceed with development and deployment ofthe capability envisaged under the NTW program, and then work toward improving the system sothat it can eventually be used against faster-flying intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). MDAofficials have indicated that if developmental testing goes well, the basic version of the Sea-BasedMidcourse system (the NTW-like version capable of intercepting theater-range ballistic missiles)might be ready for deployment in 2005 or 2006.

The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported (67) in February 2001 thatDOD, using the system description at the time, estimated that the life-cycle cost for SBIRS-Lowthrough FY2022 was $11.8 billion. A January 2002 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report (68) estimated the cost through2015 at $14-17 billion (of which $1 billion was appropriated prior to FY2002). In its report on theFY2002 DOD appropriations bill, the House Appropriations Committee reported ( H.Rept. 107-298 ,p. 250) that the program's life cycle cost had grown from $10 billion to over $23 billion. The April15 restructuring plan did not include a new DOD cost estimate, but said that out-year fundingestimates would be developed as part of the FY2004-2009 FYDP.", "Two industry teams were chosen in 1999 for program definition and risk reduction (PDRR).The Spectrum Astro/Northrop Grumman team included Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and others. TheTRW/Raytheon team included Aerojet, Motorola, and others. DOD had been expected to select oneof the teams for the next phase (EMD) in mid-2002. However, as part of the April 15 restructuringplan, DOD decided to merge the two teams. TRW was named the prime contractor, and SpectrumAstro a major subcontractor, for the satellites. Competition at the sensor subcontractor level willcontinue, though. with Raytheon and Northrop Grumman pursuing independent parallel sensordevelopment to demonstrate on-orbit performance with the series of R&D satellites.", "The February 2001 GAO report raised questions over whether SBIRS-Low could meet itstechnical milestones. GAO concluded that five of six critical satellite technologies were tooimmature to ensure they would be ready when needed: the scanning infrared sensor, tracking infraredsensor, fore optics cryocooler, tracking infrared sensor cryocooler, and satellite communicationscrosslinks. GAO also cited concurrency as a concern in that satellite development and productionwere scheduled to occur at the same time; the results of an on-orbit test would not be available untilfive years after the satellites entered production; and software would be developed concurrent withthe deployment of the satellites and not be completed until more than three years after the firstSBIRS-Low satellites were launched. Other critics cite the ability to discriminate between targetsand decoys, and the ability to share information between satellites, as significant technicalhurdles.
