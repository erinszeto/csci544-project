Nonetheless, public concerns about LNG risks continue to raise questions about LNG security. Faced with a perceived national need for greater LNG imports, and persistent public concerns about LNG risks, some in Congress are examining the adequacy of security provisions in federal LNG regulation.", "LNG infrastructure consists primarily of tankers, import terminals, and inland storage plants. There are nine active U.S. terminals and proposals for many others. Although potentially catastrophic events could arise from a serious accident or attack on such facilities, LNG has a record of relative safety for the last 40 years, and no LNG tanker or land-based facility has been attacked by terrorists.

Due primarily to low domestic gas prices, LNG imports stayed relatively small\u2014accounting for only 1% of total U.S. gas consumption in 2002. In countries with limited domestic gas supplies, however, LNG imports grew dramatically over the same period. Japan, for example, imported 97% of its natural gas supply as LNG in 2002, over 11 times as much LNG as the United States. South Korea, France, Spain, and Taiwan also became heavy LNG importers.", "Natural gas demand has accelerated in the United States over the last several years due to environmental concerns about other energy sources, growth in natural gas-fired electricity generation, and historically low gas prices. Supply has not been able to keep up with demand, however, so gas prices have recently become high and volatile. As Figure 1 shows, average annual gas prices at the wellhead have risen from between $1.50 and $2.50/Mcf (\"thousand cubic feet\") through most of the 1990s to above $6.00/Mcf since 2005. At the same time, international prices for LNG have fallen because of increased supplies and lower production and transportation costs, making LNG more competitive with domestic natural gas.

The Elba Island terminal is located on an island five miles down the Savannah River from Savannah, Georgia and ten miles from the Atlantic coast. The terminal completed a major expansion in 2006, allowing it to receive approximately 118 shipments per year. Kenai , Alaska . Built in 1969, this is the oldest LNG marine terminal in the United States and the only one built for export (to Japan). The Kenai terminal is located in Nikiski near the Cook Inlet gas fields. Since 1969 the terminal has exported an average of approximately 34 LNG shipments each year. Lake Charles , Louisiana .

LNG also poses hazards because it is extremely cold. Experts have identified several potentially catastrophic events that could arise from an LNG release. The likelihood and severity of these events have been the subject of considerable research and analysis. While open questions remain about the impacts of specific hazards in an actual accident, there appears to be consensus as to what the greatest LNG hazards are.", "Pool fires. If LNG spills near an ignition source, the evaporating gas in a combustible gas-air concentration will burn above the LNG pool. The resulting \"pool fire\" would spread as the LNG pool expanded away from its source and continued evaporating. Such pool fires are intense, burning far more hotly and rapidly than oil or gasoline fires. They cannot be extinguished\u2014all the LNG must be consumed before they go out. Because LNG pool fires are so hot, their thermal radiation may injure people and damage property a considerable distance from the fire itself. Many experts agree that a pool fire, especially on water, is the most serious LNG hazard. Flammable vapor clouds . If LNG spills but does not immediately ignite, the evaporating natural gas will form a vapor cloud that may drift some distance from the spill site. If the cloud subsequently encounters an ignition source, those portions of the cloud with a combustible gas-air concentration will burn. Because only a fraction of such a cloud would have a combustible gas-air concentration, the cloud would not likely explode all at once, but the fire could still cause considerable damage. An LNG vapor cloud fire would gradually burn its way back to the LNG spill where the vapors originated and would continue to burn as a pool fire. If an LNG tank failed due to a collision or terror attack, experts believe the failure event itself would likely ignite the LNG pool before a large vapor cloud could form. Consequently, they conclude that large vapor cloud fires are less likely than instantaneous pool fires. Flameless explosion . If LNG spills on water, it could theoretically heat up and regasify almost instantly in a \"flameless explosion\" (also called a \"rapid phase transition\"). While the effects of tanker-scale spills have not been studied extensively, Shell Corporation experiments with smaller LNG spills in 1980 did not cause flameless explosions. Even if there were a flameless explosion of LNG, experts believe the hazard zones around such an event \"would not be as large as either vapor cloud or pool fire hazard zones.\"", "In addition to these catastrophic hazards, an LNG spill poses hazards on a smaller scale. An LNG vapor cloud is not toxic, but could cause asphyxiation by displacing breathable air. Such clouds rise in air as they warm, however, diminishing the threat to people on the ground. Alternatively, extremely cold LNG could injure people or damage equipment through direct contact. The extent of such contact would likely be limited, however, as a major spill would likely result in a more serious fire. The environmental damage associated with an LNG spill would be confined to fire and freezing impacts near the spill since LNG dissipates completely and leaves no residue (as crude oil does)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Safety Record of LNG", "paragraphs": ["The LNG tanker industry claims a record of relative safety over the last 45 years; since international LNG shipping began in 1959, tankers reportedly have carried over 47,000 LNG cargoes without a serious accident at sea or in port. LNG tankers have experienced groundings and collisions during this period, but none has resulted in a major spill. The LNG marine safety record is partly due to the double-hulled design of LNG tankers. This design makes them more robust and less prone to accidental spills than single-hulled oil and fuel tankers like the Exxon Valdez , which caused a major Alaskan oil spill after grounding in 1989. LNG tankers also carry radar, global positioning systems, automatic distress systems and beacons to signal if they are in trouble. Cargo safety systems include instruments that can shut operations if they deviate from normal as well as gas and fire detection systems.", "The safety record of onshore LNG terminals is more mixed. There are more than 40 LNG terminals (and more than 150 other LNG storage facilities) worldwide. Since 1944, there have been approximately 13 serious accidents at these facilities directly related to LNG. Two of these accidents caused single fatalities of facility workers\u2014one in Algeria in 1977, and another at Cove Point, Maryland, in 1979. On January 19, 2004, a fire at the LNG processing facility in Skikda, Algeria killed an estimated 27 workers and injured 74 others. The Skikda fire completely destroyed a processing plant and damaged a marine berth, although it did not damage a second processing plant or three large LNG storage tanks also located at the terminal. The Skikda accident did not injure the rest of the 12,000 workers at the complex, but it was considered the worst petrochemical plant fire in Algeria in over 40 years.

A 2007 update from the Coast Guard Boston Sector estimates an average direct cost to the Coast Guard of an LNG delivery to Everett of approximately $62,000. State and local authorities also incur costs for overtime police, fire and security personnel overseeing LNG tanker deliveries. The state of Massachusetts and the cities of Boston and Chelsea estimated they spent a combined $37,500 to safeguard the first LNG shipment to Everett after September 11, 2001. Based on these figures, the public cost of security for an LNG tanker shipment to Everett is on the order of $100,000, excluding costs incurred by the terminal owner.", "Marine security costs at other active LNG terminals could be lower than for Everett to the extent they are farther from dense populations and face fewer vulnerabilities. But these terminals expect more shipments. Altogether, the nine active onshore U.S. LNG terminals, including Everett, expect to have enough capacity for over 1,100 shipments per year in 2009. Increasing LNG imports to meet 13% of total U.S. gas supply by 2030 as projected by the EIA could require some 2,300 LNG shipments to LNG terminals serving the United States. Assuming an average security cost only half that for Everett, or $50,000 per shipment, annual costs to the public for marine LNG security could exceed $55 million by 2009 if active terminals were operating at full capacity. Security costs could exceed $115 million by 2030 based on the EIA projections. At least over the next several years, however, analysts predict that U.S. LNG terminals will operate well below capacity, so actual marine security costs will likely be lower.", "The potential increase in security costs from growing U.S. LNG imports, and the potential diversion of Coast Guard and safety agency resources from other activities have been a persistent concern to policy makers. According to Coast Guard officials, the service's LNG security expenditures are not all incremental, since they are part of the Coast Guard's general mission to protect the nation's waters and coasts. Nonetheless, Coast Guard staff have acknowledged that resources dedicated to securing maritime LNG might be otherwise deployed for boating safety, search and rescue, drug interdiction, or other security missions. LNG security is funded from the Coast Guard's general maritime security budget, so it is not a line item in the FY2009 Department of Homeland Security budget request. However, the Coast Guard's FY2006 budget did include an additional $11 million in funding over FY2005 levels for \"Increased Port Presence and LNG Transport Security,\" specifically including \"additional boat crews and screening personnel at key LNG hubs.\"", "In a December 2007 report, the GAO recommended that the Coast Guard develop a national resource allocation plan to address growing LNG security requirements. In subsequent testimony before Congress, Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Thad Allen expressed concern about the costs to the Coast Guard of securing dangerous cargoes such as LNG and called for a \"national dialogue\" on the issue. During questioning, Admiral Allen acknowledged that the Coast Guard did not currently possess sufficient resources to secure future LNG deliveries to a proposed LNG terminal in Long Island Sound which has subsequently been authorized by FERC.", "State and local agencies are also seeking more funding to offset the costs of LNG security. Otherwise, they believe that LNG security needs may force them to divert limited local resources from other important public services. Addressing these concerns, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires private and public sector cost-sharing for LNG tanker security (Section 311d). In compliance with the act and prior FERC policy, FERC officials require new LNG terminal operators to pay the costs of any additional security or safety needed for their facilities. The FERC has also recommended that LNG terminal operators provide private security staff to supplement Coast Guard and local government security forces.", "The public costs of LNG security may decline as federally mandated security systems and plans are implemented. New security technology, more specific threat intelligence, and changing threat assessments may all help to lower LNG security costs in the future. Nonetheless, the potential increase in security costs from growing U.S. LNG shipments may warrant a review of these costs and associated recovery mechanisms. S. 1594 would allow the DHS to establish a security cost-sharing plan to assist the USCG in securing LNG tankers and other vessels carrying especially hazardous cargo (Sec. 6). H.R. 2830 would prohibit LNG facility security plans based upon the provision of security by a state or local government unless that government has an LNG security arrangement with the facility operator (Sec. 720 (b)). H.R. 2830 would also require the Coast Guard to enforce LNG tanker security zones (Sec. 720(a)), and would require the Coast Guard to certify that it has adequate security resources in the sector where a terminal would be located before facility security plans for a new LNG terminal are approved (Sec. 720(c)).", "The Commandant of the Coast Guard reportedly opposes the requirement in H.R. 2830 for the Coast Guard to provide LNG tanker security on the grounds that it undermines \"the necessary discretion and flexibility to meet ... mission demands in an often-changing, dangerous operating environment.\" In prior testimony before Congress, the Commandant stated that such a requirement would not appropriately balance LNG risks against the risks of other dangerous cargoes in marine transportation, and would amount to a subsidy for private LNG companies. The Commandant also reportedly opposes H.R. 2830 because he believes it does not adequately distribute the LNG security burden among the Coast and state and local agencies involved in LNG projects. Echoing the Commandant's objections, President Bush reportedly has threatened to veto H.R. 2830 because of these LNG security provisions. H.R. 2830 passed the House by a margin (395-7) large enough to override a veto, however, and has yet to pass in the Senate, so it remains to be seen whether these provisions will ultimately change in response to the Commandant's or President's objections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty About LNG Threats", "paragraphs": ["The likelihood of a terrorist attack on U.S. LNG infrastructure has been the subject of debate since September 11, 2001. To date, no LNG tanker or land-based LNG facility in the world has been attacked by terrorists. However, similar natural gas and oil facilities have been favored terror targets internationally. For example, since 2001, gas and oil pipelines have been attacked in at least half a dozen countries. In October 2002, the French oil tanker Limburg was attacked off the Yemeni coast by a bomb-laden fishing boat. In June 2003, U.S. intelligence agencies warned about possible Al Qaeda attacks on energy facilities in Texas. The Homeland Security Council included terrorist attacks on \"cargo ships\" carrying \"flammable liquids\" among the fifteen hazards scenarios it developed in 2004 as the basis for U.S. homeland security \"national preparedness standards.\"", "In addition to warnings of a terrorist threat to energy facilities in general, federal agencies have identified LNG infrastructure in particular as a potential terrorist target. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) specifically included LNG assets among a list of potential terrorist targets in a security alert late in 2003. The DHS also reported that \"in early 2001 there was some suspicion of possible associations between stowaways on Algerian flagged LNG tankers arriving in Boston and persons connected with the so-called 'Millennium Plot'\" to bomb targets in the United States. While these suspicions could not be proved, DHS stated that \"the risks associated with LNG shipments are real, and they can never be entirely eliminated.\" The 2004 report by Sandia National Laboratories concluded that potential terrorist attacks on LNG tankers, could be considered \"credible and possible.\" The Sandia report identified LNG tankers as vulnerable to ramming, pre-placed explosives, insider takeover, hijacking, or external terrorist actions (such as a Limburg -type, missile or airplane attack). Others further assert that terrorists have demonstrated both the desire and capability to attack such shipping with the intention of harming the general population.", "Although they acknowledge the security information put forth by federal agencies, many experts believe that concern about threats to LNG tankers is overstated. In 2003, the head of one university research consortium remarked, for example, \"from all the information we have ... we don't see LNG as likely or credible terrorist targets.\" Industry representatives argue that deliberately causing an LNG catastrophe to injure people might be possible in theory, but would be extremely difficult to accomplish. Likewise, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and other experts believe that LNG facilities are relatively secure compared to other hazardous chemical infrastructures which receives less public attention. In a 2004 report, the FERC stated that", "for a new LNG terminal proposal ... the perceived threat of a terrorist attack may be considered as highly probable to the local population. However, at the national level, potential terrorist targets are plentiful....

LNG terminal operators which have conducted proprietary assessments of potential terrorist attacks against LNG tankers, have expressed similar views. In a September 2006 evaluation of a proposed LNG terminal in Long Island Sound, the Coast Guard stated that there were \"currently no specific, credible threats against\" the proposed LNG facility or tankers serving the facility. The evaluation also noted, however, that the threat environment is dynamic and that some threats may be unknown. Because the probability of a terrorist attack on LNG cannot be known with certainty, policy makers and community leaders must, to some extent, rely on their own judgment to decide whether LNG security measures for a specific facility will adequately protect the public.

This rationale underlies the provisions in P.L. 109-241 that promote LNG shipping to the United States on U.S.-flagged vessels with U.S. crews. Prompted by these provisions, at least four LNG developers have committed to using U.S. crews in their LNG terminal siting proposals.

While rising LNG imports may offer economic benefits, they also pose risks. LNG infrastructure is inherently hazardous and it is potentially attractive to terrorists. Both lawmakers and the general public are concerned about these risks, although the LNG industry has a long history of relatively safe operations and has taken steps to secure its assets against terrorist attack. No LNG tanker or land-based facility has been attacked by terrorists, and federal, state and local governments have put in place security measures intended to safeguard LNG against newly perceived terrorist threats. These measures are evolving, but a variety of industry and agency representatives suggest that these federal initiatives are reducing the vulnerability of U.S. LNG to terrorism.", "The ongoing debate about LNG infrastructure security in the United States has often been contentious. Local officials and community groups have challenged numerous LNG infrastructure proposals on the grounds that they may represent an unacceptable risk to the public. Heightened public scrutiny of LNG facilities has made it difficult to site new LNG terminals near major gas markets and has increased the cost and complexity of LNG terminal siting approval. Nonetheless, both industry and government officials acknowledge that enough new LNG infrastructure will likely be approved to meet long-term U.S. import requirements. Indeed, federal agencies have approved the construction of a number of new U.S. import terminals, several of them onshore. Numerous additional terminal proposals await federal approval. Together with the expansion of the existing U.S. import terminals and the construction of new LNG terminals in Canada and Mexico, the approved U.S. facilities would provide enough added capacity to meet the bulk of U.S. LNG demand for the next 20 years.", "New U.S. LNG terminals may not be ideally located so as to minimize the cost of natural gas, but building them in these locations may be better than not building them at all. Furthermore, because their security has been subject to intense public scrutiny, new LNG terminal and tanker operations may be safer than they might have been without such scrutiny and their siting may be less likely to be challenged at a later time when construction is already underway. The construction and subsequent closure of the Shoreham nuclear power plant in the 1980's due to new public opposition offers an example of the need to resolve safety and security concerns before capital is invested. From a purely economic perspective, therefore, the added costs of building more heavily protected LNG terminals potentially farther from their primary markets may represent the U.S. public's willingness to pay for LNG security. Whether this implicit price of LNG security is reasonable is an open question, but the continued interest of private companies to invest billions of dollars in U.S. LNG terminals suggests that it will not prevent needed LNG development.", "As Congress continues its oversight of LNG infrastructure development, it may decide to examine the public costs and resource requirements of LNG security, especially in light of dramatically increasing LNG imports. In particular, Congress may consider whether future LNG security requirements will be appropriately funded, whether these requirements will be balanced against evolving risks, and whether the LNG industry is carrying its fair share of the security burden. Congress may also act to improve its understanding of LNG security risks. Costly \"blanket\" investments in LNG security might be avoided if more refined terror threat information were available to focus security spending on a narrower set of infrastructure vulnerabilities. Finally, Congress may initiate action to better understand the security and trade implications of efforts to promote U.S.-flagged LNG tankers.", "In addition to these specific issues, Congress might consider how the various elements of U.S. LNG security activity fit together in the nation's overall strategy to protect critical infrastructure. Maintaining high levels of security around LNG tankers, for example, may be of limited benefit if other hazardous marine cargoes are less well-protected. U.S. LNG security also requires coordination among many groups: international treaty organizations, federal agencies, state and local agencies, trade associations and LNG infrastructure operators. Reviewing how these groups work together to achieve common security goals could be an oversight challenge for Congress."], "subsections": []}]}}
