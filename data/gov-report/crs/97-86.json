As of September 15, 2004, 45 tribal TANF plans were in operation in 16states. Their annual rate of federal funding totaled $134.2 million. The 1996 law also appropriated $7.6 millionannually for work and training activities to tribes in 24 states that operated a pre-TANF work and trainingprogram (now named Native Employment Works -- NEW), authorized direct federal funding to Indian tribes foroperation of child support enforcement programs, and set aside a share of child care funds for them. Theoriginal TANF law was scheduled to expire September 30, 2002, but Congress extended funding through severallaws, most recently through September 30, 2004. Pending are two major TANF reauthorization bills:H.R. 4, as passed by the House, and H.R. 4, as approved by the Senate FinanceCommittee. Both bills would renew tribal TANF grants through FY2008 and make tribal organizations eligiblefor new marriage promotion grants.

The law had no provision for administration of cash aid by tribes. However, some Wisconsin tribessubcontracted with the state to provide AFDC independently on their reservations. In FY1994, 1.3% of thenational AFDC caseload (about 68,000 families) were American Indians and Alaska Natives. In addition, morethan 65,000 needy Indians who were not in categories eligible for AFDC received cash aid based on their state'sAFDC benefit standards, but paid by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Under pre-TANF law, more than 80tribes and tribal organizations exercised an option to run their own work and training programs, called JobOpportunities and Basic Skills Training (JOBS) programs, with 100% federal funds. ", "Under TANF, which provides fixed annual state grants through FY2002, numerous Indian tribes and Alaska Native Villages in 16 states (see Table 1) are operating their own tribal family assistanceprograms. Tribes thatoperated their own JOBS program also receive annual appropriations under TANF law of $7.6 million (theirFY1984 funding for JOBS) for work and training activities (renamed Native Employment Works -- NEW). Finally, $28.6 million in Welfare-to-Work (WtW) grants was awarded for FY1998 and 1999 by the LaborDepartment to Indian and Native American tribal governments (86 grantees in FY1998, 91 in FY1999).

By regulation, tribes receive 90% federal funding for the firstthree years, 80% for later years. As of March, 2004, 9 tribes received direct federal funding and handled morethan 21,000 cases.

Thus, two Washington tribes list as additional work activities: \"teachingcultural activities\" and \"barrier removal, including counseling, and chemical dependency treatment.\" TheTanana Chiefs Conference, in Alaska, includes as work activities \"approved subsistence hunting, fishing,gathering.\" Most two tribal plans limit the \"service population\" to Indians.
