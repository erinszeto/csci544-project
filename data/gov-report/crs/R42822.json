Australia is seeking to strengthen its long-standing defense alliance with the United States without jeopardizing its important trade relationship with China. Australia's strategic geography is increasingly focused on its north and west at a time when the United States is also increasingly focused on the same areas, namely Southeast Asia and the northern reaches of the Indian Ocean. An analysis of Australia's role in the United States' Asia strategy is particularly relevant as Congress considers future U.S. strategy, force structure, and defense procurement decisions.", "Australia's place in the U.S. rebalancing to Asia strategy is an important one to a large extent because the United States and Australia share many values and strategic perspectives. Australia's strategic worldview generally is one that views the United States as a force for good in the world and in Australia's Indo-Pacific region. The May 2012 Australian force posture review gives insight into Australian strategic thinking relative to its defense posture. While there is strong support for further developing bilateral defense cooperation with the United States, planned Australian defense budget cuts, and their potential impact on Australian defense capability plans, may place limits on the extent to which Australian defense capabilities can grow in the years ahead. That said, Australia has a relatively strong economy and a political context that could lead to more defense capability development in the future. What is clear is that there is strong bipartisan elite and popular support in Australia for remaining a close and valuable strategic ally of the United States.", "During President Obama's visit to Australia in 2011, he and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced the deployment of up to 2,500 United States Marines to Australia's Northern Territory. This deployment is one of the most tangible examples of the rebalancing to Asia strategy, and also demonstrates Australia's resolve to support that strategy. When in Australia, President Obama stated, \"Our alliance [with Australia] is going to be indispensible to our shared future, the security we need and the prosperity that we seek, not only in this region but around the world.\" The Marine rotational deployment announcement, and subsequent disclosures of additional plans to further expand the United States' already strong alliance relationship with Australia, did much to give the rebalancing to Asia strategy military substance. It was also during his speech to the Australian Parliament that President Obama pledged not to cut the United States' Asia Pacific force posture as cuts to the U.S. defense budget are considered.", "Australia's decision to place renewed emphasis on its strategic relationship with the United States within the context of America's rebalancing to Asia strategy makes its partnership with the United States a valuable piece of U.S. strategic engagement with the Indo-Pacific region. Australia's decision to strengthen its American alliance may also reflect growing uncertainty in Canberra with the evolving correlates of power in Asia."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Australia figures into the U.S. rebalancing to Asia strategy in geopolitical, diplomatic, military, intelligence, and economic terms. Australia is a strong supporter of the U.S. rebalancing to Asia strategy, as it has long held the view that continued U.S. presence in the region is a stabilizing influence on the region that enhances Australian security interests. (For a detailed analysis of the rebalancing strategy see CRS Report R42448, Pivot to the Pacific? The Obama Administration's \"Rebalancing\" Toward Asia , coordinated by [author name scrubbed].) Australia will likely seek to support the U.S. rebalancing to Asia strategy with diplomatic and political support, by providing territory to support U.S. posture in the region, by maintaining interoperability, through joint efforts in the Southwest Pacific, and through joint facilities. While the \"boots on the ground\" deployment of U.S. marines in Darwin is a very significant symbolic deployment, anticipated future expansion of U.S. and Australian naval and air cooperation could be strategically more important. The rotational presence of U.S. forces in Australia should also enhance the ability of U.S. and Australian forces to deploy in a joint fashion to meet regional challenges in the future across a spectrum of contingencies from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to more traditional security situations.", "Australia figures prominently in the new strategy for several reasons. In addition to their symbolic value, the Darwin rotations meet U.S. strategic goals by providing for a more dispersed U.S. force structure in the Asia Pacific, while providing for more joint training opportunities with Australia and other nations in the region and by providing a flexible presence in the region. U.S. marines will reportedly be based at the Australian Bradshaw and Mount Bundy training areas in the Northern Territory. (Go to http://www.defence.gov.au/oscdf/adf-posture-review/docs/base_map.pdf for map of key Australian defense infrastructure sites.) The Marine force in the Northern Territory is expected to expand gradually and is not expected to reach its full strength of 2,500 until 2016. There are several benefits to Australia of the marines' deployment:", "The deployment increases the ability of Australian forces to train and learn from American forces; It provides an opportunity for Australian forces to work with Marines and other countries in combined exercises and training in or close to Australia; It provides a tangible sign of both countries' commitment to adapting and renewing the alliance; and The deployment also enhances Australia's strategic credibility in Asia.", "There is very strong elite and popular support for the alliance in Australia, which finds expression in the leadership of both the ruling Labor Party and the opposition Liberal-National Coalition. Both Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbot are viewed as strong supporters of the alliance. While there is a high level of support for the alliance across the political spectrum in Australia, Australia is also grappling with issues related to having such a close strategic relationship with the United States while also having very important trade ties with a rising China. China became Australia's largest trading partner in 2009. ", "The United States and Australia are also exploring expanded joint training with air and naval assets. The United States Air Force is reportedly exploring the possibility of greater use of Australian airbases in the north of Australia. Of particular note is the possible use of Australia's Naval Base HMAS Stirling near Perth, Australia. This base could be used to support U.S. ships and submarines operating in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).", "The United States and Australia also continue to have a very close intelligence relationship. The two nations have reportedly begun discussions for the use of the Australian Cocos Island for U.S. manned and unmanned surveillance operations. The Cocos Islands are approximately 2,750 km northwest of Perth, Australia. Their location would facilitate surveillance patrols of the northern reaches of the Indian Ocean. ", "Australia is also important in the economic and trade aspects of the rebalancing strategy. Australia has a strong focus on international trade and is the world's 13 th -largest economy. Australia largely avoided the global recession and is expected to grow by 3.25% in 2012. It has a strong resource, particularly mining, sector, which is a significant part of its exports. Australia joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations shortly after the United States signaled its intent to join the negotiations. Such an agreement could build on the progress in trade relations made through the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. China is Australia's largest two-way trading partner, and a significant percentage of Australia's trade is with Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations. Australia's leading trade partners are China (20.4%), Japan (12.1%), and the United States (9%). The United States is the largest investor in Australia and Australia is the ninth-largest provider of foreign direct investment in the United States.", "The Australian component of the United States' rebalancing to Asia strategy is part of a broader set of U.S. initiatives with friends and allies in the region. Other key aspects of the rebalancing strategy include the deployment of littoral combat vessels to Singapore, the shifting of troops from Okinawa to Guam, enhanced dialogue rotations and training with the Philippines, and enhancing defense cooperation with regional friends such as New Zealand. ", "The development of an enhanced alliance on Indonesia's doorstep reportedly appeared to concern Indonesia at first. These concerns appear to have been allayed subsequently. Indonesia has suggested joint military disaster relief exercises with Australia and the United States. That said, attention by the United States and Australia will likely need to be given to Indonesia to reassure Indonesia that their enhanced security alliance is not a threat to Indonesian interests. Indonesia's geographic proximity to Australia will ensure that it remains a strategic priority for Australia."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Political Context in Australia", "paragraphs": ["The expansion of Australia's already close alliance relationship with the United States was facilitated politically by a dramatic increase in Australian popular opinion of U.S. leadership with the election of President Obama. While the alliance and the United States in general have long been very popular with Australia, Australian's opinion of U.S. leadership under former President Bush was relatively low despite the great affection between President Bush and former Prime Minister John Howard. Australians' approval of U.S. leadership increased from 25% in 2008 to 69% in 2010. This increase in popularity of U.S. leadership, along with increased support for the alliance, likely gave Australian political leaders the political space to take the alliance to the next level.", "When Prime Minster Gillard addressed the United States Congress in March 2011, she asserted that Australia \"is an ally for all the years to come.\" In doing so she reflected both elite and popular support for the alliance in Australia. That said, the Gillard government's recent cuts to defense would limit the resources available to fully implement defense plans that were outlined in the last White Paper. An October Newspoll found that Labor's primary vote had increased to 33% as the Coalition's support fell from 47% to 45%. The Coalition is composed of the right-of-center Liberal and National political parties. (For more information see CRS Report RL33010, Australia: Background and U.S. Relations , by [author name scrubbed].)", "Opposition Leader Tony Abbott of the Liberal Party has been critical of the Gillard government's plans to cut defense spending. He reportedly sees one of his key challenges if elected prime minister as seeking to rebuild defense capability that he views as having been underfunded by the Gillard government. Abbot has stated that his government would \"aspire\" to restore 3% real growth in defense spending and would in the first 18 months of his government make decisions on a new generation of submarines, with work on them centering around the South Australian shipyards. He has also pledged to make a decision on other key defense acquisitions such as the Joint Strike Fighter acquisition. Abbott also stated that his government would produce a new defense white paper early in his term of office that would consider \"basing more of our military forces in northern Australia, especially resource rich areas with little or no current military presence.\" Abbott has also promised to protect the \"sharp end of the spear\" and cut the defense bureaucracy. Some view a potential Abbott government as a return to a defense posture that was similar to that of former Prime Minister John Howard. ", "Tony Abbott strongly supported the Gillard government's decision to move forward with the deployment of U.S. Marines to the Northern Territory and to deepen the alliance with the United States. Abbot went so far as to call for Darwin to be made into a new Joint Defense facility. Abbott also called for even closer military and intelligence ties with the United States and stated \"we shouldn't be reluctant to have further joint facilities with the Americans.\"", "Whatever the political outcome of the next election, it is likely that there will continue to be strong support for moving forward with current plans to expand and upgrade Australia's alliance with the United States in the context of the Obama Administration's Pacific Pivot strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ANZUS Alliance and AUSMIN", "paragraphs": ["While U.S. and Australian forces have fought side by side in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Iraq, and most recently in Afghanistan, their ties to one another in the Asia Pacific can be traced back to the invitation by Australia to President Theodore Roosevelt to have his Great White Fleet visit in 1908. The visit of the Great White Fleet to Australia was part of the United States' demonstration of its rising power and blue water naval capabilities and was used by Australia to encourage support for building its own navy. Although the U.S.-Australian strategic partnership can trace its beginnings to this period, it was not until after the fall of then-British-controlled Singapore in World War II that Australia came to view the United States, rather than the United Kingdom, as its most valuable strategic partner.

While New Zealand's anti-nuclear policies led the United States to suspend its alliance commitments to New Zealand during the Cold War, the United States and New Zealand have recently returned to closer defense cooperation through the Wellington Declaration of 2010 and the Washington Declaration of 2012. It should be noted that this return to close defense cooperation between the United States and New Zealand, while a reflection of strengthening bilateral ties, is not a return to the formal treaty alliance. At its core, the ANZUS alliance has a strong foundation built on shared values, history, and culture. It is this base that has allowed the alliance between the United States and Australia to evolve even as the larger geopolitical contexts for the alliance have shifted dramatically over time. The now bilateral ANZUS Alliance between the United States and Australia has evolved through several distinct phases over its history, including Post World War II, Cold War, Post Cold War, the struggle against Islamic militants, and the United States rebalancing to Asia phases.", "When the ANZUS treaty was signed by Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in 1951, Australia was concerned about the potential for a resurgent Japan while the United States was increasingly concerned about the rise of the Soviet Union. During the Cold War, Australia came to share U.S. concerns about the Soviet Union and played a key role in U.S. deterrence strategy through its early warning role. The alliance continued to be relevant through the post-Cold War period and was first evoked by Prime Minister Howard after the 9/11 attacks on the United States and the beginning of the struggle against Islamic militants. The alliance remains strong today, with Australia viewing the geopolitical environment in the Indo-Pacific region in terms very similar to those of the United States. ", "The terms of reference of the alliance have expanded over time. Today the treaty is seen in Australia not only as a means for it to gain support for the defense of Australia, but also as a means of helping to secure a U.S. commitment to help maintain stability in the Asia Pacific region as a whole. While the alliance has enjoyed strong support at the elite level it has also been very popular amongst the people. While President Obama and Prime Minister Gillard, as well as her predecessor former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (whom Gillard replaced in 2010) see the world in largely similar terms, former President Bush and former Prime Minister Howard also shared a similar view of the world. ", "This affinity between the leaders of the two nations is also shared at a popular level. While there have been some limited ebbs and flows over time, Australians overwhelmingly support the U.S. alliance. About 82% of Australians are supportive of the alliance.

This reportedly involved a debate between the Office of National Assessments (ONA) and elements of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and the more hawkish Department of Defense with the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd coming down in favor of a more guarded view of China. Rudd also reportedly made a personal intervention into the White Paper process and the decision to double the submarine fleet. It has also been reported that Rudd, who described himself as a brutal realist on China, advised Secretary of State Clinton to be prepared to use force against China if things go wrong.", "Australia's 2009 Defense White Paper took as its central theme the notion that the distribution of global power was shifting from the West to a more multi-polar and Asia Pacific-centered world. It also reaffirmed the importance of Australia's alliance with the United States and called for the largest peacetime expansion of the Australian navy. It laid the foundation upon which decisions were made to augment Australia's defense capabilities, particularly through the proposed acquisition of a fleet of 12 new and larger submarines, Globe Master transport aircraft, two large amphibious vessels, air warfare destroyers, and upgrades to Australia's F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft to cover an anticipated gap until up to 100 Joint Strike Fighters (JSF) could be purchased. New budget realities may force a rethink of the timeline for some of these systems. A new 2013 Defense White Paper is planned to rearticulate Australia's strategic vision into the future. Its direction may well be influenced by the recently concluded Australian Force Posture Review.", "While there is some strategic unease related to the rise of China, Australia has done very well economically through trade with China. Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr takes the view that global economic and strategic levers of power will be more dispersed in the years ahead.

Dibb has also argued that too much has been made about the inevitability of the rise of China and the relative decline of the United States.

The existence of the alleged secret chapter has not been confirmed. Reports about the alleged chapter were reportedly based on a book, The Kingdom and the Quarry: China, Australia, Fear and Greed , by David Uren. Some believe that in such a conflict China could seek to destroy the Pine Gap Joint U.S.-Australian Signals facility near Alice Springs.", "While the dominant view of the Australian government is for continued strengthening of defense ties with the United States, there is a minority view expressed by some outside government that Australia could harm its economic relationship with China by coming too close to the United States. The chief proponent of this view is Hugh White, a former senior defense official and current Professor of Strategic Studies at the Australian National University. White's \"Power Shift: Australia's Future Between Washington and Beijing,\" published in the journal Quarterly Essay in October 2010, pondered the question of whether China will replace the United States as leader of the Asia Pacific and if so \"should we [Australia] continue to support America and so divide Asia between our biggest ally and our biggest trading partner?\" White draws the conclusion that China will challenge America's position in the Asia Pacific and that the longer it takes for the two sides to restructure their relationship the more likely it will be that the two will become strategic adversaries, raising the chances that a minor conflict could escalate into a more dangerous one. Therefore, according to White's argument, Australia should urge the United States to accommodate China's rise to avoid conflict. In his 2012 book, The China Choice: Why America Should Share Power , White argues that the United States has three options: (1) resist China's challenge and try to preserve the status quo in Asia; (2) step back from its dominant role in Asia, leaving China to attempt to establish hegemony; or (3) allow China a larger role but also maintain a strong presence.

These stem from nineteenth century exposure to the great power rivals of the British Empire and from concerns for much of the twentieth century over vulnerability in the face of expanding Asian powers and populations (heightened by Japan's aggression in World War II).", "In this way, Australia favors a strategic environment that includes the United States as an active and engaged partner in Asia.

The Gillard Labor government announced a budget in May 2012 that should deliver a budget surplus for the 2012/2013 fiscal year ending June 30, 2013. Australia is one of only eight countries with a stable AAA rating from the three major rating agencies. Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan described the budget as seeking to spread the benefits of the Australian mining sector to the most vulnerable segments of society. Some have described Swan as a modern-day Robin Hood who is seeking to \"win back Labor's heartland and get its polls out of the dumpster.\" While tax policy was used to realize savings, budget cuts were also used. This has led to significant cuts to the defense budget. Australian defense spending reached AD$26.5 billion in 2011-2012.", "The Gillard Labor government has reversed previous commitments to increase defense spending and has cut the defense budget by AD$5.4 billion over four years. This would lead to a drop in defense spending from 1.8% of GDP in 2011/2012 to an estimated 1.6%. An estimated AD$1.7 billion of defense budget cuts will come from an anticipated peace dividend derived from the expected end of Australia's military commitments to Afghanistan, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands by mid-2015. ", "The government has cut defense and implemented other policies in order to finance domestic programs while also delivering a budget surplus. At this level of spending, Australia is closer to European levels of defense spending rather than the United States. The United States spends 4.77% of GDP on defense while the United Kingdom (2.57%), Germany (1.34%), and Spain (1.05%) spend far less. The year 2012 is the first in centuries where defense spending in Asia will surpass that of Europe.", "Cuts to the defense budget are to be achieved by reductions in the civilian defense work force and by delaying or cancelling acquisitions and deferring capital works. When announcing the cuts, Prime Minister Gillard made a commitment not to reduce the number of uniformed personnel. It is estimated that the government will save AD$1.6 billion by delaying the purchase of 12 Joint Strike Fighter F-35 aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force by two years. The government has had plans to purchase up to 100 F-35 aircraft for AD$16 billion. ", "Australia has recently made some increases in its defense capabilities. Australia has announced that it will spend $1.5 billion to equip 12 Super Hornet fighter bombers with \"Growler\" electronic warfare capabilities. The Growler system will reportedly enable these aircraft to effectively paralyze enemy communications and missile systems. Australia is the only nation to be allowed to purchase this U.S. technology. Australia's airlift capability has been modernized and expanded in recent years as well. Australia will take delivery of its sixth and final C-17 A Globemaster III in October 2012. The Globemasters give Australia an intercontinental transport capability.", "The government did announce an allocation of funds to advance the design of the navy's new fleet of submarines. The Gillard government, while not ruling out a foreign purchase, stated that the submarines would be built in Adelaide. Australia's existing submarines, the Collins Class submarines, have come under serious criticism including that of a former commander who has described the Collins class as obsolete and unsustainable. The Prime Minister's move forward with the submarines may indicate a relative emphasis on the navy and a maritime focus to Australian strategy in the forthcoming 2013 White Paper. It has also been reported that United States officials have expressed interest that Australia move forward with the submarines purchase. Many international submarine builders, including U.S.-based Electric Boat as well as U.S. systems specialists Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, have expressed interest in the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Australia and Ballistic Missile Defense75", "paragraphs": ["Australia has been a long-standing strategic partner of the United States in the area of early warning of ballistic missile attack, signals intelligence, and strategic communications. During the Cold War, Australia likely put itself at risk of nuclear attack by hosting the Northwest Cape U.S.-Australian naval communication facility. The missile launch detection site at Nurrungar and the Pine Gap signals intelligence ground station may also have been targets during the Cold War.", "Efforts to develop an Asian regional ballistic missile defense (BMD) system designed to counter ballistic missile threats from North Korea seem to be gaining momentum. Such a system could reinforce the rebalancing to Asia strategy. There are reportedly plans to develop a BMD system that could cover large parts of Asia. Such a system could reportedly include an early warning X-band radar in southern Japan and possibly another radar in Southeast Asia which could be linked with missile defense ships and land-based interceptors. ", "Australia has been in consultations with the United States on this development. The 2011 AUSMIN Joint Communiqu\u00e9 stated:", "Australia noted and will continue to consult with the United States as it develops the phased adaptive approach to BMD outlined in the U.S. BMD Review, which will allow missile defense to be adapted to the threats unique to the Asia-Pacific. We are continuing our cooperation to build a more detailed understanding of regional ballistic missile threats; cooperative research on systems to counter such threats; and options for practical cooperation in this area.", "Defence Minister Stephen Smith has stated it is a \"theoretical possibility\" that the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) could be incorporated into an anti-missile system.", "A recent Center for Strategic and International Studies assessment has pointed to potential initiatives with Australia including \"full Australian participation in U.S. theater missile defense, including an Australian decision to equip its new air warfare destroyers with standard missile-3 (SM-3) missiles.\" There is also speculation in the media that the Australian JORN may be incorporated into a larger region-wide system. JORN can reportedly bounce signals off the ionosphere to see beyond the horizon.

While current cuts to the Australian defense budget will likely limit the amount of Australian defense procurement in the near term, based on historical trends, future purchases of key Australian weapons systems will likely lead to sales for the U.S. defense industry. In exercising its role of oversight of the Administration's strategy, Congress may also wish to keep informed of the strategic disposition of one of America's key allies in the region. There are also budget implications which Congress may wish to consider related to America's forward presence in the region."], "subsections": []}]}}
