In the mid-1980s, controversy arose over U.S. family planning assistance when the Ronald Reagan Administration introduced restrictions that became known as the \"Mexico City policy.\" The Mexico City policy required foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning\u2014even if the activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds. Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush also suspended contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) due to evidence of coercive family planning practices in China, citing violations of the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment, which bans U.S. assistance to organizations that, as determined by the President, support or participate in the management of coercive family planning programs.", "President Bill Clinton resumed UNFPA funding and rescinded the Mexico City policy in 1993. In 2001, however, President George W. Bush reapplied the Mexico City policy restrictions. The Bush Administration also suspended U.S. contributions to UNFPA from FY2002 to FY2008 following a State Department investigation of family planning programs in China. In January 2009, President Barack Obama issued a memorandum rescinding the Mexico City policy. The President also stated that the United States would resume U.S. contributions to UNFPA.", "The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is the primary U.S. agency charged with supporting bilateral voluntary family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) worldwide. Since 1965, it has obligated over $13.8 billion in assistance for international family planning activities.

At present, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) maintains family planning projects in nearly 40 developing countries that include counseling and services, training of health workers, contraceptive commodities and distribution, financial management, policy dialogue, data collection, monitoring and evaluation, public education and marketing, and biomedical and contraceptive research and development. USAID applies a broad reproductive health approach to its family planning programs, increasingly integrating it with other interventions in maternal and child health, the enhancement of the status of women, and HIV treatment and prevention. In addition to these bilateral activities, the United States has supported multilateral family planning efforts through annual contributions to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA). ", "Family planning assistance has become a source of substantial contention among U.S. policymakers, centering on two key issues:", "setting appropriate and effective funding levels for family planning assistance, and the use of federal funds to perform or promote abortions abroad and how to address possible coercion in some national family planning programs, especially in China. ", "Arguably, the most bitter controversies in U.S. family planning policy have erupted over abortion\u2014in particular, the degree to which legal abortions and coercive programs occur in other countries' family planning programs, the extent to which U.S. funds should be granted to or withheld from such countries and organizations that administer these programs, and the effect that withholding U.S. funds might have on global population growth and access to voluntary family planning services in developing nations. These issues stem from the contentious domestic debate over U.S. domestic abortion policy that has continued since the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision holding that the Constitution protects a woman's decision whether to terminate her pregnancy. In every Congress since 1973, abortion opponents have introduced constitutional amendments or legislation that would prohibit abortions supported with U.S. foreign assistance funds. As an alternative, Congress has attached numerous provisions to annual appropriation measures banning the use of federal funds for performing legal abortions.", "Much of this debate has focused on domestic spending bills, especially restrictions on abortions under the Medicaid program in the Labor/Health and Human Services appropriation legislation. However, the controversy spilled over into U.S. foreign aid policy when Congress approved an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in late 1973 introduced by then-Senator Jesse Helms (\u00a7104(f)). The provision, widely referred to as the \"Helms amendment,\" prohibits the use of foreign development assistance to (1) pay for the performance of abortions or involuntary sterilizations, (2) motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions, or (3) coerce or provide persons with any financial incentive to undergo sterilizations. Since 1981, Congress has enacted the Helms amendment, as well as other family planning and abortion-related restrictions, in annual Foreign Operations appropriation bills. ", "In the mid-1980s, debate over international abortion restrictions reached the executive branch. In 1984, at the second International Conference on Population held in Mexico City, Mexico, President Reagan issued what has become known as the \"Mexico City policy,\" which required foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify that they would not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning, even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds. In the intervening years, the Mexico City policy has been rescinded and reissued by various Administrations. Most recently, it was rescinded by President Barack Obama in January 2009. ", "In 1985, Congress adopted the \"Kemp-Kasten\" amendment due to the concerns of President Reagan and some Members of Congress that the U.N. Population Fund's (UNFPA's) program in China engaged in or provided funding for abortion or coercive family planning programs. Kemp-Kasten prohibits U.S. assistance to organizations that, as determined by the President, support or participate in the management of coercive family planning programs. ", "Demonstrating the politicized nature of the international family planning debate, presidential determinations regarding the Mexico City Policy and UNFPA's activities in China have generally been divided along party lines. Presidents Reagan, George Bush, and George W. Bush prohibited U.S. contributions to UNFPA and supported the Mexico City Policy, while Presidents Clinton and Obama have supported U.S. funding of UNFPA and overturned the Mexico City Policy.

Such restrictions are found in provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as well as executive regulations and appropriation provisions prohibiting indirect support for coercive family planning (specifically in China) and abortion activities related to the work of international and foreign NGOs. This section addresses two key actions that were initiated in the mid-1980s and have remained particularly controversial in the U.S. family planning debate: the Mexico City policy involving funding for foreign non-governmental organizations, and \"Kemp-Kasten\" restrictions on funding for the U.N.

Thereafter, it become known as the \"Mexico City policy.\" During the George H. W. Bush Administration, efforts were made in Congress to overturn the Mexico City policy and rely on existing congressional restrictions in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 banning direct U.S. funding of abortions and coerced sterilizations. Provisions adopted by the House and/or Senate that would have reversed the policy, however, were removed from legislation under threat of a presidential veto.", "Critics charge that the Mexico City policy is a violation of free speech and the rights of women to choose to have an abortion in countries where it is legal. They contend that the policy undermines family planning and maternal health care services offered in developing nations and may actually contribute to the rise in the number of abortions performed, including some that are unsafe and illegal. They further emphasize that family planning organizations may cut back on services because they are unsure of the full implications of the restrictions and do not want to risk USAID funding. Opponents also believe that the conditions of the Mexico City policy undermine relations between the U.S. government and foreign NGOs and multilateral groups, creating a situation in which the United States challenges their right to determine how to spend their own money and imposes a so-called gag order on their ability to promote changes to abortion laws and regulations in developing nations.

President Bush, in announcing the policy change, noted that American taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or to advocate or actively promote abortion. Supporters of the certification requirement argue that even though permanent law bans USAID funds from being used to perform abortions, money is fungible; organizations receiving American-taxpayer funding can use USAID resources for family planning activities while diverting money raised from other sources to perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws and regulations.

The Administration required that the organization provide \"concrete assurances that [it] is not engaged in, or does not provide funding for, abortion or coercive family planning programs.\" It was particularly concerned with UNFPA's activities in China, where, according to Administration officials, there was evidence of coercive family planning practices.", "Subsequently, Congress legislated a more restrictive UNFPA policy\u2014believed to be aimed at coercive Chinese family planning programs and UNFPA's continuing operations in the country\u2014by enacting the \"Kemp-Kasten amendment\" in the FY1985 Supplemental Appropriations Act ( P.L. 99-88 ). The amendment prohibited the use of appropriated funds for any organization or program, as determined by the President, found to be supporting or participating \"in the management\" of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. Following enactment of P.L. 99-88 , USAID announced that $10 million of $46 million that had been directed for UNFPA during FY1985 would be redirected to other programs due to concerns regarding UNFPA's activities in China, and later said that the United States would not contribute to UNFPA at all in 1986. Most of the $25 million that was originally allocated for UNFPA was spent on other international family planning activities. Even though this pattern to redirect UNFPA transfers to other population assistance programs continued, critics of the Kemp-Kasten amendment and the President's determination to suspend contributions asserted that UNFPA was the world's most effective family planning organization, and that the quality of services provided in developing nations outside of China suffered due to the unwillingness of the United States to support them. At the time of suspension, U.S. payments represented nearly one-third of UNFPA's annual budget. From 1986 through 1993, no U.S. contributions went to UNFPA.", "The Clinton Administration lifted the ban on UNFPA contributions, making available $14.5 million in FY1993 but stipulating that funds could not be used in China. Congressional critics of China's family planning practices attempted unsuccessfully to attach provisions to various foreign aid bills banning U.S. contributions unless UNFPA withdrew from China or the President could certify that China no longer maintained a coercive family planning program.

Since the 2002 determination, the Administration transferred $34 million from each of FY2002, FY2004, and FY2005 appropriations, and $25 million from FY2003 funds that would have otherwise been provided to UNFPA to support bilateral family planning programs and activities combating human trafficking and prostitution.

Given conflicting reports, a State Department investigative team visited China in May 2002 and reported a series of findings and recommendations. The team found no evidence that UNFPA \"has knowingly supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization\" in China, and recommended the United States release not more than $34 million of previously appropriated funds to UNFPA.", "Nevertheless, on July 22, 2002, Secretary of State Powell, to whom President Bush had delegated the decision, announced that UNFPA was in violation of Kemp-Kasten and ineligible for U.S. funding. The State Department's analysis of the Secretary's determination found that even though UNFPA did not \"knowingly\" support or participate in a coercive practice, that alone would not preclude the application of Kemp-Kasten. Instead, a finding that the recipient of U.S. funds\u2014in this case UNFPA\u2014simply supports or participates in such a program, whether knowingly or unknowingly, would trigger the restriction. The assessment team found that the Chinese government imposed fines and penalties on families (\"social compensation fees\") that have children exceeding the number approved by the government. The department further noted that UNFPA had funded computers and data-processing equipment that had helped strengthen the management of the Chinese State Family Planning Commission. Beyond the legitimate uses of these and other items financed by UNFPA, such equipment facilitated, in the view of the State Department, China's ability to impose social compensation fees or perform coercive abortions. The State Department analysis concluded that UNFPA's involvement in China's family planning program \"allows the Chinese government to implement more effectively its program of coercive abortion.\"", "On September 17, 2005, the State Department stated that the United States had been urging UNFPA and China to modify the organization's program in a manner that would permit U.S. support to resume, but that no key changes had occurred that would allow a resumption of U.S. funding under the conditions of the Kemp-Kasten provision.
