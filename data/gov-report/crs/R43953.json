Revising a NAAQS established under the Clean Air Act (CAA) sets in motion a process under which the states and EPA identify areas that exceed the standard (\"nonattainment areas\") using multi-year air quality monitoring data and other criteria, requiring states to take steps to reduce pollutant concentrations in order to meet the standard.", "The 2013 revisions to the PM NAAQS were the subject of considerable congressional oversight. EPA's designation of nonattainment areas may be an issue of interest and debate among Members of Congress, states, and other stakeholders. The PM NAAQS revisions, published January 2013 changed the annual health-based (\"primary\") standard for \"fine\" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (or PM2.5) to a limit of 12 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) from the 15 \u00b5g/m3 limit. Revisions to the PM NAAQS retained the existing 24-hour primary standard for PM2.5 of 35 \u00b5g/m3 (as promulgated in 2006) and the existing standard for larger, but still inhalable, \"coarse\" particles 10 micrometers or less in diameter, or PM10.", "During EPA's consideration of alternative approaches for revising the PM NAAQS, many stakeholders and some in Congress expressed concern about the potential impacts associated with an increased number of areas that may be deemed nonattainment under a more stringent standard. The number of areas ultimately determined nonattainment for the revised PM NAAQS were considerably fewer than some had anticipated.", "Based on its review of recently submitted 2014 air quality data, EPA's April 2015 modifications to the final area designations for the 2013 PM NAAQS resulted in nine areas consisting of 20 counties in four states designated as nonattainment. All but two of the 20 counties have been previously designated as nonattainment for the 2006 and/or the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. In accordance with a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on January 4, 2013, EPA classified all areas determined to be in nonattainment as \"moderate\" nonattainment areas under the authority of Section 188 of the CAA.", "In comparison to the nonattainment area designations as amended by EPA in April 2015, EPA's final designations published in January 2015 were composed of 14 areas comprising 38 counties in 6 states. The EPA April 2015 amended designations changed the nonattainment designation of two areas in Pennsylvania (four counties) and one each in Ohio (three counties) and Ohio (four counties)/Kentucky (three counties) to \"unclassifiable/attainment\" and one area in Kentucky (two counties)/Indiana (two counties) to \"unclassifiable.\" EPA also designated five areas in Georgia (including two counties in Alabama and South Carolina) as unclassifiable.", "States have 18 months from the April 15, 2015, effective date of EPA's final designations to submit State Implementation Plans, which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements intended to bring an area into compliance or maintain compliance. Section 188 of the CAA requires that moderate nonattainment areas achieve attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the end of the sixth calendar year after designation as nonattainment."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Under Sections 108-109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), Congress mandated that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set national ambient (outdoor) air quality standards (or NAAQS) for pollutants whose emissions (1) \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare\" and (2) \"results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" The statute further requires that EPA review the latest scientific studies and either reaffirm or modify previously established NAAQS every five years. EPA has identified and promulgated NAAQS for six principal pollutants commonly referred to as \"criteria pollutants\":", "1. Particulate matter (PM), 2. Ozone (O 3 \u2014a key measure of smog), 3. Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 , or NOx\u2014inclusively, nitrogen oxides), 4. Sulfur oxides (SOx or specifically SO 2 ), 5. Carbon monoxide (CO), and 6. Lead (Pb).", "For particulate matter (PM), EPA established short-term (24-hour) and long-term (annual) standards. Additionally, EPA established separate standards for two categories of PM based on size: \"fine\" particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter (referred to as PM 2.5 ) and slightly larger, but still inhalable, particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers (referred to as PM 10 ). EPA last reviewed and revised the PM NAAQS in 2006. (See PM NAAQS chronology presented in Table A-1 .)", "On January 15, 2013, EPA published its revisions to the NAAQS for PM to provide protection against potential health effects associated with short- and long-term exposure to particulates (including chronic respiratory disease and premature mortality). Because the agency finalized its decision on December 14, 2012, EPA frequently refers to these changes as the \"2012 PM NAAQS.\" In this report, CRS will refer to the changes as the 2013 PM NAAQS based on the January 15, 2013, publication date of the final rule.", "EPA's 2013 PM NAAQS revisions primarily tightened the pre-existing (2006 and 1997) standards for \"fine\" particulate matter PM 2.5 and affected only the stringency of the annual PM 2.5 standard. The 24-hour PM 2.5 standard as revised in 2006 was not similarly strengthened in the 2013 NAAQS revisions. The standards for slightly larger, but still inhalable, particles less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM 10 ) established in 1987 were also not changed to a more stringent level in the 2013 PM NAAQS revisions.", "Establishing NAAQS does not directly limit emissions or directly compel specific emissions controls; rather, it represents the EPA administrator's formal judgment regarding the level of ambient pollution that will protect public health with an adequate margin of safety . Promulgation of NAAQS sets in motion a process under which the states and EPA first identify geographic nonattainment areas (i.e., those areas failing to meet the NAAQS) based on monitoring and analysis of relevant air quality data. States then submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs), which identify specific regulations and emission control requirements that are to bring areas into compliance as well as actions for maintaining compliance.", "On April 7, 2015, EPA published amendments to the final designations for the 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS that were published on January 15, 2015. The changes to area designations were the result of air quality data for 2014 recently submitted by affected states. The effective date of April 15, 2015 (90 days from the date of publication) for the final designation rule remained unchanged.", "The final area designations as amended and published in the April 7, 2015, Federal Register encompass 20 counties or portions of counties (nine areas) in four states as nonattainment only for the 2013 revised annual PM 2.5 standard. EPA also designated five areas in Georgia (including two adjacent counties in Alabama and South Carolina) as unclassifiable. In the final designation rule as published on January 15, 2015, EPA had designated 38 counties or portions of counties (14 areas) in six states. At that time EPA announced that it was also deferring initial designation for 10 areas in three states by up to one year as a result of insufficient data. Included were all of Florida, all of Tennessee except for three counties, and eight areas in Georgia (including two adjacent counties in Alabama and South Carolina). The EPA also designated three areas (including all of Illinois) as \"unclassifiable\" due to insufficiencies in the available ambient air quality monitoring data for these areas for the three-year period (2011-2013). ", "The April 2015 modifications did not impact EPA's designation determinations for areas in Indian country as published in January 2015. Twelve areas in Indian country adjacent to counties designated nonattainment in two areas in California were designated nonattainment for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 standard. EPA designated all remaining state areas and areas in Indian country as \"unclassifiable/attainment\" for the 2013 annual PM 2.5 standard, indicating that \"the areas either have attaining [sic] air quality monitoring data or that air quality information is not available because the areas are not monitored, and the EPA has not determined that the areas contribute to a violation in a nearby area.\"", "As EPA had specified in its April 2013 area designation guidance to states and tribes, the initial area designations for all 2013 PM 2.5 NAAQS nonattainment areas are classified as \"moderate\" as provided under Section 188(a) of Subpart 4 of Part D of Title I of the CAA. EPA had previously implemented the PM 2.5 NAAQS\u2014including nonattainment determinations for the 1997 and 2006 revisions\u2014only under the general implementation provisions in Subpart 1 (\u00a7171-\u00a7176) of Part D in Title I of the CAA (\"Subpart 1\"). However, in a January 4, 2013, decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit determined that EPA had erred in implementing the PM 2.5 NAAQS under Subpart 1 and required the agency to implement the PM 2.5 NAAQS under Subpart 4 of Part D in Title I of the CAA (\"Subpart 4\").", "This CRS report focuses primarily on the NAAQS implementation process for designating geographical nonattainment areas with respect to the tightening of the PM 2.5 annual standard under the 2013 particulates NAAQS, including comparisons with the final designations under the 2006 and 1997 PM 2.5 NAAQS revisions. EPA is not requiring new nonattainment designations for the PM 2.5 24-hour standard or the PM 10 standard, as the levels for these standards were unchanged in the 2013 revisions.

The primary NAAQS as revised included a daily (24-hour) limit for both PM 2.5 and PM 10 and an annual limit for PM 2.5 . (EPA revoked the previous annual limit for PM 10 in 2006.)", "Achieving attainment of the annual standard requires that the three-year average of the weighted annual arithmetic mean PM concentration at each monitor within an area must not exceed the maximum limit set by the agency. The 24-hour standards are a concentration-based percentile form, indicating the percentage of the time that a monitoring station can exceed the standard. For example, a 98 th percentile 24-hour standard indicates that a monitoring station can exceed the standard 2% of the days during the year. For PM 2.5 and PM 10 , EPA set the secondary (welfare) NAAQS the same as the primary standards.", "As modified and published in the January 15, 2013, Federal Register , the PM 2.5 and PM 10 primary (public health) standards as set in the final rule are as follows:", "PM 2.5 : EPA revised the annual standard of 15 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m 3 ) by setting a new limit to 12 \u00b5g/m 3 .

Compliance with the \"annual\" standard is determined by whether the three-year average of its annual average PM 2.5 concentration (at each monitoring site in the area) is less than or equal to 12 \u00b5g/m 3 ; as proposed, EPA retained the daily (24-hour) standard at 35 \u00b5g/m 3 based on the current three-year average of the 98 th percentile of 24-hour PM 2.5 concentrations as established in 2006. PM 10 : EPA retained the current daily PM 10 standard of no more than one exceedance of concentrations of 150 \u00b5g/m 3 per year on average over three years; there is no current annual standard for PM 10 .

Areas are identified as \"attainment/unclassifiable\" when they meet the standard or when the data are insufficient for determining compliance with the NAAQS.", "Tribes have been encouraged to submit NAAQS designation recommendations. The area designation requirements under the CAA (Section 107(d)) are specific with respect to states but do not explicitly reference Indian tribes or Indian country. EPA follows the same designation process for tribes per Sections 110(o) and 301(d) of the CAA and pursuant to the 1988 Tribal Authority Rule, which specifies that tribes shall be treated as states in selected cases (40 C.F.R. Part 49).", "Following state and tribal designation submissions, the EPA Administrator has discretion to make modifications, including to the area boundaries.

Attainment or nonattainment designations are made primarily on the basis of three years of federally referenced monitoring data. EPA began developing methods for monitoring fine particles at the time the PM 2.5 NAAQS were being finalized in 1997, and operation of the network of monitors for PM 2.5 was phased in from 1999 through 2000. EPA's final designations for the 2013 particulates NAAQS were based on 2011-2013 monitoring data.", "The network of monitors and their locations has been modified over time. In conjunction with the October 2006 publication of the revised particulates NAAQS, for example, EPA amended its national air quality monitoring requirements, including those for monitoring particle pollution. The amended monitoring requirements were intended to help federal, state, and local air quality agencies by adopting improvements in monitoring technology. Additional modifications to the PM NAAQS monitoring network were included in the final January 2013 rule.", "EPA also considers a number of other relevant factors when designating nonattainment areas and recommends that states apply these factors in their determinations in conjunction with other technical guidance. Examples of these factors include:", "population density and degree of urbanization (including commercial development); location of sources in relation to population; existing emission controls; traffic and commuting patterns and growth rates; weather and transport patterns (meteorology); geography/topography; and jurisdictional boundaries such as counties (or portions of counties), tribal reservations, metropolitan planning areas, and air districts.", "States and tribes may submit additional information on factors they believe are relevant for EPA to consider.", "Entire metropolitan areas may be designated nonattainment in some cases based on monitoring data in a single location taking into account other factors. States' or tribes' boundary recommendations for an area are to also show that violations are not occurring in those portions of the recommended area that have been excluded and that they do not contain emission sources that contribute to the observed violations.", "The CAA does not specifically require combining neighboring counties within the same nonattainment area, but it does require the use of metropolitan statistical area boundaries in the more severely polluted areas (\u00a7107(d)(4)(A)(iv)). However, unlike the 1997 PM 2.5 standards, Metropolitan Statistical Areas or Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas did not generally serve as the \"presumptive boundary\" for nonattainment areas under the 2013 PM 2.5 standards. EPA made this change when determining nonattainment for the 2006 PM 2.5 standards. Rather than establish a presumption for the minimum size of an area, in its June 2007 guidance EPA instructed states and tribes to evaluate each area on a case-by-case basis. EPA expected that nonattainment areas for the 2006 24-hour PM 2.5 would include counties with monitors violating the 24-hour standard and nearby counties that contribute to that violation.", "EPA also recommended that states and tribes consider using common boundaries for areas to be designated as nonattainment for both the annual and 24-hour PM 2.5 standards. In April 2013, EPA provided similar guidance to states and tribes with regard to the 2013 revisions of the annual PM 2.5 standards.
