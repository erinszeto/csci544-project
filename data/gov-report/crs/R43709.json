Included are funding for the National Estuary Program (NEP) and Coastal Waterways program area and for certain specific water bodies including the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. These programs often involve collaboration among EPA, other federal agencies, state and local governments, communities, and nonprofit organizations.

The grants are subject to a 10% matching funds requirement (including in-kind contributions).

The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have adhered to an earmark moratorium during the 112 th and 113 th Congresses as put forth by the leadership in both chambers. This moratorium has generally precluded earmarks in annual appropriations bills for FY2011, FY2012, FY2013, and FY2014. The moratorium followed the adoption of definitions of earmarks in House and Senate rules. ", "While there is no consensus on a single earmark definition among all practitioners and observers of the appropriations process, the Senate and House both in 2007 adopted separate definitions for purposes of implementing new earmark transparency requirements in their respective chambers.

More than a dozen provisions directed at EPA were included in the general provisions in Title IV of H.R. 5171 as reported by the House Appropriations Committee, including several that would have prohibited or restricted the use of appropriated funds. As noted earlier in this report (see \" Funding Restrictions/Prohibitions \") relatively few of the prohibitive provisions proposed in the House committee reported bill were retained in the Consolidated and Further Appropriations Act, 2015 ( P.L. 113-235 ).

Other provisions proposed in the House committee reported bill would have limited any EPA activities that would address lead-based paint removal, the definitions of the terms ''fill material'' or ''discharge of fill material\" under the Clean Water Act, and financial responsibility with respect to Superfund cleanup.

Historical Funding Trends", " Table B-1 presents the level of FY2008-FY2014 enacted appropriations for EPA by each of the agency's statutory accounts. EPA's funding over the long term has generally reflected an increase in overall appropriations to fulfill a rising number of statutory responsibilities. EPA's historical funding trends tend to parallel the evolution of the agency's responsibilities over time, as Congress has enacted legislation to authorize the agency to develop and administer programs and activities in response to a range of environmental issues and concerns. In terms of the overall federal budget, EPA's annual appropriations have represented a relatively small portion of the total discretionary federal budget (just under 1% in recent years).", "Without adjusting for inflation, EPA's funding has grown from $1.0 billion when EPA was established in FY1970 to a peak funding level of $14.86 billion in FY2009. This peak includes regular fiscal year appropriations of $7.64 billion provided for FY2009 in P.L. 111-8 and the supplemental appropriations of $7.22 billion provided for FY2009 in P.L. 111-5 , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
