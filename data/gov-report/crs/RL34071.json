Meanwhile, belated changes by the British in the makeup of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) were initially undone, but subsequent changes in the Legco selection process have brought things back nearly full circle to where they stood prior to the Handover. There is also unease about the independence of Hong Kong's judicial system and the protection provided by Hong Kong's Basic Law in light of decisions made by the Chinese government.", "Similarly, the civil liberties of the people of Hong Kong remain largely intact. In part, this can be attributed to the increased politicization of the people of Hong Kong. The freedom of the press in Hong Kong is still strong, but also faces challenges\u2014both on the legal front and from allegations of self-censorship on the part of the media owners reluctant to antagonize the People's Republic of China. Yet, even with these challenges, many Hong Kong residents do not appear to perceive a decline in their civil liberties since 1997.", "Economically, Hong Kong is still a major international financial center and a leading gateway into China. However, Hong Kong's economic interaction with the Chinese mainland has grown deeper and broader over the last 10 years than was expected, increasing the city's economic connections with China. This closer tie to the mainland is being bolstered by the signing of a free trade agreement in 2003, called the \"Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement,\" or CEPA, between China and Hong Kong. Current economic and trade dynamics have raised concerns that Hong Kong's relationship with China will shift in the long run from one of synergy to full integration, possibly undermining the HKSAR's \"high degree of autonomy.\"", "Recent social and cultural trends appear to reflect some apprehension about the long-term implications of current economic and political trends. There has been a decline in Hong Kong's expatriate (\"ex-pat\") community, including U.S. nationals. Also, there is a perception that Hong Kong's \"middle class\" is disappearing. Underlying many of these social and cultural trends is a redefinition of Hong Kong by its residents, indicating a closer identification with China.", "At present, few of these long-term trends have had a significant effect on Hong Kong's political or economic situation and its relations with the United States. Under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-383), the United States treats Hong Kong as a separate entity in a variety of political and economic areas so long as the HKSAR remains \"sufficiently autonomous\" from China. While Hong Kong government continues to fulfill its obligations to the United States under existing bilateral and multilateral treaties and agreements, there are still some minor issues that might warrant action by Congress.

The event, commonly referred to as the Handover, marked the end of 155 years of British colonial rule and China's resumption of full sovereignty over Hong Kong. During the last 10 years, there have been modest changes in Hong Kong's political situation and more significant changes in its economy. These political and economic changes have had an impact on Hong Kong's social and cultural identity. Despite some political and economic setbacks, the HKSAR remains a vibrant international trade hub in Asia.", "The actual transferral of sovereignty over Hong Kong was governed by the \"Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong\" (commonly referred to simply as the \"Joint Declaration\") signed on December 19, 1984 in Beijing. Under the terms of the Joint Declaration, China promised that Hong Kong would \"enjoy a high degree of autonomy\" and \"the current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain unchanged\" for 50 years. The Joint Declaration also required China's National People's Congress (NPC) to pass \"a Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\" (generally referred to as the \"Basic Law\") stipulating China's policies on Hong Kong that are consistent with the terms of the Joint Declaration. The National People's Congress passed the Basic Law on April 4, 1990.", "Hong Kong has long been important to the United States in several ways. First, Hong Kong is a major entrep\u00f4t in Asia, especially for trade with China. Second, Hong Kong's longstanding open trade policy has made it a major ally for U.S. efforts to liberalize international trade. Third, Hong Kong's Common Law legal system and its respect for civil liberties are a bellwether in Asia for human rights.", "Congressional interest in Hong Kong was demonstrated by the passage the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-383 ). The act commits the United States to treating the HKSAR as a separate entity from the rest of China in a variety of political, economic, trade and other areas so long as the HKSAR remains \"sufficiently autonomous\" to warrant special treatment. Section 202 of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act empowers the President to make the determination of the status of Hong Kong's autonomy, specifying the factors for consideration to be \"the terms, obligations, and expectations expressed in the Joint Declaration with respect to Hong Kong.\" The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act makes no mention of the Basic Law.", "In addition, the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act states that \"Hong Kong plays an important role in today's regional and world economy\" and that the United States has a strong interest in the continued \"vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong.\" The act also stipulates that the \"support for democratization is a fundamental principle of United States foreign policy,\" which \"naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong Kong.\" Plus, the act states that \"the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of great importance to the United States\" and \"also serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity.\"", "Title III of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act required the Secretary of State to transmit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate an annual report by March 31 (through the year 2000) on the conditions in Hong Kong \"of interest to the United States.\" The act was amended in subsequent years to require this report each year through 2006. No report is required from 2007 onward."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes in Hong Kong Since 1997", "paragraphs": ["On Hong Kong's political front, there has been little progress in the democratization of the selection of the HKSAR's Chief Executive and Legislative Council (Legco) and towards the goal of universal suffrage in Hong Kong. In the area of civil liberties, the freedoms enjoyed under British rule have continued since the Handover virtually unchanged, with the notable exception of the controversy surrounding the proposed anti-sedition legislation in 2003. The freedoms of speech and assembly appear to have been largely respected by the Chinese and HKSAR governments, but there is concern about self-censorship by some in the Hong Kong media.", "After 1997, Hong Kong's economy was subject to a series of external shocks that precipitated and prolonged a recession. The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997, which began almost concurrently with the Handover, had a ripple effect on Hong Kong, resulting in a major asset value realignment, commodity price and wage deflation, and a decline in the city's gross domestic product (GDP). Hong Kong's economic recovery was then delayed by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in the beginning of 2003. However, since the end of the SARS outbreak, Hong Kong's economy has rebounded, in part due to its deepening trade relations with the Chinese mainland.", "In addition to Hong Kong's extended recession and recent recovery, the last 10 years have witnessed a deepening and broadening of its economic and trade ties with the Chinese mainland. This has occurred in part due to global market conditions, but also due to the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, and the Individual Visit Scheme, a new tourism policy for mainland visitors to Hong Kong, introduced by the Chinese government on July 28, 2003. According to some observers, Hong Kong has become the hub of a pan-Pearl River Delta economic region that is one of the major engines of China's high economic and trade growth rates.", "The last 10 years have also seen changes in Hong Kong society and its culture. Hong Kong has experienced a significant decline in the size of its \"ex-pat\" population and a concurrent rise in its \"mainland\" population. In addition, Hong Kong's \"middle class\" has endured declining incomes and a loss of economic security. Also, there is a growing interest and concern about the preservation of \"Hong Kong culture,\" best exemplified by a popular movement to preserve \"historic buildings,\" such as the old railroad clock tower in Tsim Sha Tsui. These social and cultural changes have raised the issue of a \"Hong Kong identity\" that is distinct and separable from a \"Chinese identity.\"", "At present, these political, economic and cultural changes do not appear sufficient to erode Hong Kong separateness from the Chinese mainland. However, there are aspects to these changes that warrant monitoring. The economic changes appear to be blurring the existing border between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, while the social changes may be blurring the difference between being Chinese and being a \"Hong Konger.\" Over time, if the separation between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong effectively disappears for all practical purposes, then the United States and Congress may choose to revisit the decision to extend Hong Kong special treatment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Political Developments7", "paragraphs": ["The HKSAR is an executive-led government, with much of the power in the hands of the Chief Executive and his or her appointed department secretaries. The two most important department secretaries are the Chief Secretary for Administration and the Financial Secretary. Hong Kong's legislature, Legco, has comparatively limited powers; it can effectively veto legislation proposed by the Chief Executive, approves or disapproves of the annual budget, and has some oversight over the operations of the executive branch. Hong Kong's courts have the exclusive power to adjudicate HKSAR legal cases, with the exception of matters related to national defense, foreign policy and the interpretation of the Basic Law. Legal cases involving these three topics are handled by the Standing Committee of China's NPC.", "Since the Handover, there has been serious political debate over the details of Hong Kong's independent executive, legislative, and judicial powers. There have been controversies over the selection process for the chief executive, as well as the chief executive's term in office. Regarding the HKSAR's legislative powers, the key issues have centered about the composition of Legco and the manner by which its members are selected. As for Hong Kong's judicial powers, the main area of concern has been the scope of its powers, particularly with respect to the interpretation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's de facto constitution.", "Besides these general \"constitutional\" issues, there also has been a notable change in Hong Kong's political parties and the level of political involvement of the Hong Kong people. Hong Kong's political parties have changed in both name and character over the last 10 years, indicating the possible development of broad-based parties. Concurrent with the change in the political parties, the people of Hong Kong appear more interested, informed and involved in politics than before the Handover. The politicization of the Hong Kong population in part can be attributed to an increase in their opportunities to be involved in political activities, such as elections. It is also in part due to a widely-held perception that the HKSAR government was somewhat dysfunctional during the first few years after the Handover, forcing people to pay more attention to political issues than they did when Hong Kong was a British colony."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Chief Executive8", "paragraphs": ["The Basic Law fleshes out the process by which the HKSAR's Chief Executive is to be selected. Article 45 stipulates that the Chief Executive \"shall be selected by election or through consultations held locally and be appointed by the Central People's Government.\" The article continues by stating \"the method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress.\" It also indicates that \"(t)he ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.\"", "Annex I of the Basic Law provides the specifics on how the Chief Executive, who serves a five-year term, is to be selected. It stipulates that a \"broadly representative Election Committee\" of 800 people select the Chief Executive. To be nominated, a person must receive at least 100 votes from the Election Committee. The selection of the Chief Executive is based a \"secret ballot on a one-person-one-vote basis.\" However, Annex I is not specific about how to choose the Chief Executive after 2007, saying only that \"(i)f there is a need to amend the method for selecting the Chief Executives for the terms subsequent to the year 2007, such amendments must be made with the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all the members of the Legislative Council and the consent of the Chief Executive, and they shall be reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval.\" Ambiguity in the language in the Basic Law and historical circumstances have led to two specific controversies about the selection and term of office of the Chief Executive.", "Hong Kong's first Chief Executive, Tung Chee Hwa, was selected by the first Election Committee in December 1996 and was selected for a second term in March 2002. However, Tung proved to be a very unpopular chief executive, and resigned for health reasons in March 2005, part way through his second term. Tung's Chief Secretary for Administration, Donald Tsang Yam Kuen, was appointed acting Chief Executive.", "Tung's resignation raised the first controversy, which was about the length of the term of his replacement. According to some legal scholars, the Basic Law only provides for the Chief Executive to serve a five-year term, so the replacement should serve a full five-year term. To others, the replacement should only serve out the last two years of Tung's term, with a new selection taking place in 2007.", "In April 2005, Tsang requested a binding legal decision from Beijing on the duration of the replacement's term in office, arguing that a legal review in Hong Kong independent judiciary would take too long. The Standing Committee of the NPC decided that the replacement should finish out Tung's term, and the next selection should take place as scheduled in 2007. Members of Hong Kong's \"pro-democracy\" political parties and the Hong Kong Bar Association objected to Tsang's request for a decision from Beijing, as well as to the actual decision, on the grounds that it violated the Basic Law and undermined Hong Kong's autonomy. Tsang was selected to fill out the balance on Tung's term in July 2005.", "Following the selection of Tsang in 2005, the second controversy almost immediately emerged in the form of a campaign to change the selection process for the Chief Executive in 2007. Prior to the resignation of Tung in 2005, the Standing Committee of the NPC announced in April 2004 that the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2007 \"shall not be applied,\" but that the specific method of selection could be \"appropriately modified.\" A proposal from Tsang to make incremental modifications in the selection process for Chief Executive in 2007 (as well as the Legislative Council in 2008) was defeated by the Legislative Council in December 2005. As a result, no changes were made in the 2007 selection process.", "Although there was no progress towards universal suffrage for the 2007 Chief Executive selection, Tsang's bid for reelection by the Election Committee did not go unchallenged. Despite Tsang's strong backing by the Chinese government, Alan Leong Kah Kit of the newly-formed Civic Party, ran against Tsang. Leong was able to secure 132 votes in the Election Committee's nomination ballot, making him an official candidate for Chief Executive. During the campaign, Tsang and Leong held two public debates that were broadcast live on television and radio, an unprecedented event for Hong Kong. Although Leong lost the election to Tsang, he did secure 123 votes in the Election Committee. Tsang won with 649 votes.", "Supporters of direct popular election of the Chief Executive point to the precedents set by the 2007 selection process (contested election, public debates, split vote in the Election Committee) as evidence of modest progress. Pro-democracy advocates also point to the ratings for the two debates\u2014surveys show nearly one quarter of Hong Kong's population watched\u2014as evidence that Hong Kong is ready for democratic elections. However, the Chinese government maintains that it is too early to introduce direct election of the Chief Executive.", "During the summer of 2007, the Commission on Strategic Development's Committee on Governance and Political Development, an advisory body to the Chief Executive, is expected to release a legislative \"Green Paper\" examining possible \"models, roadmaps and timetables for electing the Chief Executive by Universal Suffrage.\" The initial expectation was that the \"Green Paper\" would contain up to three specific proposals for Hong Kong's transition to universal suffrage. However, confidential sources report that the final \"Green Paper\" to be issued by the Hong Kong government will probably consist of a summary of the range of options for each of the main topics\u2014models, roadmaps and timetables. For the Chief Executive selection process, among the elements to be discussed in the \"Green Paper\" are: (1) the number of people on the nominating committee; (2) how members of the nominating committee are selected; (3) number of votes required to be nominated; (4) limits on the number of candidates; and (5) transition process to universal suffrage.", "At present, there is no clear indication how soon Hong Kong's Chief Executive will be selected by universal suffrage. The earliest possible date is 2012, but few believe that the Chinese government will approve such a direct transition. Instead, analysts believe the Chinese government will endorse an interim measure that expands the number of people on the Election Committee from 800 to either 1,200 or 1,600 people. According to Cherry Tse Kit Ching Ling of Hong Kong's Department of Constitutional Affairs, the resolution of the model and roadmap will come before the decision on when to have direct election of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage. According to Legco member Leung Kwok Hung, the soonest the Chinese government would consider the direct popular election of the Chief Executive is 2022. However, some observers are concerned that delaying universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive until 2022\u2014half way through the 50 year guarantee stipulated in the Joint Declaration\u2014is altogether part of a Chinese mainland strategy to block democratization in Hong Kong."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Council", "paragraphs": ["The post-Handover story of Hong Kong's legislature, the Legislative Council (Legco), is rather complicated. For most of its history under British rule, Legco consisted of members appointed by the British Governor to represent the interests of Hong Kong's business community. The first time members of Legco were \"elected\" was in 1985, when 12 members were elected by \"functional constituencies\" based on Hong Kong's most important business and economic sectors, 10 were elected by members of Hong Kong's district boards, one from among the members of Hong Kong's Urban Council, and one from among the members of Hong Kong's Regional Council.", "After the signing of the Joint Declaration, the last British Governor, Chris Patten, implemented a series of reforms reconstituting Legco into a more democratic institution. In 1995, the last Legco under British rule was selected with 20 of the 60 seats selected in geographical elections with universal suffrage, 30 seats selected by functional constituencies in which 1.1 million people were eligible to vote, and 10 selected by members of a special Election Committee. In addition, the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18. The stated goal of the Patten reforms was to broaden participating in the election, and to select a Legco that would serve both before and after the Handover. This so-called \"through train\" Legco would provide some additional stability to Hong Kong's government during the transition, according to Patten.", "However, the Chinese government objected to Patten's Legco reforms (except for the lowering of the voting age to 18), stating that they violated the terms of both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. On August 31, 1994, the NPC ruled Patten's Legco incompatible with the Basic Law, and passed legislation stipulating how a \"Provisional Legislative Council\" would be created to take office after the Handover. On December 21, 1996, China's Election Committee selected the members of the Provisional Legislative Council, which met in Shenzhen until the Handover, and replaced the reformed Legco after the Handover. The Provisional Legislative Council remained in office until 1998, when the first post-Handover Legco elections were held.", "In 1998, Hong Kong selected a new Legco to serve a two-year term, as stipulated in Article 69 of the Basic Law. The 60 members of the Legco were divided into 20 members from geographical constituencies, 30 members from functional constituencies, and 10 from the Election Committee\u2014a return to the Patten seat formula of 1995, but without the broader voting base for the functional constituencies.", "Nearly 1.5 million people voted for the geographical constituency seats in 1998, a turnout of about 53% of the eligible voters. In 2000, Hong Kong's third post-Handover Legco was selected, this time with 24 members elected by geographical constituencies, 30 from functional constituencies, and six by the Election Committee to serve a four-year term. Turnout for the 2000 Legco geographical elections was down from 1998\u2014about 43% of the eligible voters participated. The elections of September 2004 saw of a 30-30 split of Legco members between geographical and functional constituencies. The seats reserved for Election Committee were eliminated. The turnout rate for the geographical constituencies rose in 2004 to over 55%\u201412% higher than in 2000 and 2% higher than in 1998.", "Paralleling the push for universal suffrage for the election of Chief Executive, there was increased discussion about the democratization of Legco following the 2004 election. As was previously stated, in April 2004, five months prior to the 2004 Legco elections, the Chinese government announced that while it was open to reforms in the selection of Legco members in 2008, it opposed a direct move to universal suffrage for all Legco seats. This discussion was complicated because it involved not only the issues of universal suffrage and \"one person, one vote,\" but also how Legco was to be constituted and the process of its transformation.", "Tsang's proposed 2005 reforms also included changes in the size and constitution of Legco for the next election in 2008. The number of seats would be increased to 70, equally divided between geographical and functional constituency seats. The five additional functional constituency seats would be filled by increasing the number of Legco members selected by the District Councils from one to six.", "To some observers, Tsang's proposal would have been a first-step along the path towards universal suffrage and democratization. It would have increased the number of Legco members directly elected by popular vote, plus have added five functional constituency members who were to be selected by District Council members, three-quarters of whom were elected by popular vote. Also, it was thought that most of the newly-added Legco members would be \"pro-democracy,\" increasing the likelihood of additional reforms in the future.", "Opponents to Tsang's proposal countered that it would have increased the number of functional constituency seats without expanding the number of people eligible to vote for those seats. For some \"pro-democracy\" advocates, the goal is to eliminate the functional constituency seats, not expand them. For others, the goal is to create a system in which every eligible voter in Hong Kong can vote in one geographical district and in one functional constituency. Neither group saw Tsang's reforms as a positive step towards their respective goal.", "In December 2005, Legco voted against Tsang's incremental reforms. In response, Tsang authorized the Committee on Governance and Political Development to investigate alternative models, roadmaps and timetables for implementing universal suffrage for Legco.", "When compared to universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive, the democratization of the Legco elections is relatively complex, particularly because of the functional constituencies. According to Annex II of the Basic Law, any change in the formation of Legco requires the approval of two-thirds of the current Legco, the consent of the Chief Executive and \"shall be reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for the record.\" Because of the two-thirds requirement, there is concern that the current functional constituency members can effectively block any proposal that dilutes or eliminates their power. Also, in light of previous decisions by the Chinese government on the interpretation of the Basic Law (see below), some observers believe the language of Annex III will be used to argue that any changes made must be approved by the Standing Committee of the NPC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hong Kong's Courts", "paragraphs": ["In general, the operations and authority of Hong Kong's independent judicial system have remained intact since the Handover.

Article 85 reiterates the independence of the Hong Kong courts, stating that they should be \"free from interference.\"", "However, Chapter VIII of the Basic Law, entitled \"Interpretation and Amendment of the Basic Law,\" vests the power to interpret the Basic Law in the Standing Committee of the NPC. In turn, Article 158 stipulates that the Standing Committee \"shall authorize the courts of the [HKSAR] to interpret on their own, in adjudicating cases, the provisions of this Law that are within the limits of the autonomy of the Region.\" Article 158 also states that the HKSAR courts \"may also interpret other provisions of this Law in adjudicating cases.\" However, if these are not appealable decisions \"concerning the relationship between the Central Authorities [the Chinese government] and the Region\" or \"affairs which are the responsibility of the Central People's Government,\" then the HKSAR courts are to seek an \"interpretation\" from the Standing Committee via the Court of Final Appeal prior to rendering a decision.", "Since 1997, there have been three high profile cases where the Chinese government has announced decisions regarding the interpretation of the Basic Law that to some people circumvent or supercede the provisions of the Basic Law.

The first two categories of people eligible for \"permanent resident\" status are: (1) Chinese citizens born in the HKSAR before or after the Handover; and (2) Chinese citizens who have resided in Hong Kong for seven continuous years either before or after the Handover. In addition, Article 24 describes a third category as \"Persons of Chinese nationality born outside of Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2).\" Article 24 also grants all permanent residents the \"right of abode\"\u2014the right to live in Hong Kong. However, Article 22 stipulates that \"people from other parts of China must apply for approval\" for entry into the HKSAR. This includes \"the number of persons who enter the Region for the purpose of settlement.\"", "Following the Handover, a suit was filed in Hong Kong courts on behalf of children born in the Chinese mainland who had at least one parent eligible for permanent resident status in Hong Kong. The suit claimed that these children had the right of abode in Hong Kong under the third category of Article 24, and should be allowed to reside in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government argued that under the terms of Article 22, these children must obtain the approval of the Chinese government.", "The court case created some apprehension about the number of children that would be eligible move to Hong Kong if the courts ruled in their favor. According to one Hong Kong government study, 1.6 million children in China\u2014nearly a quarter of Hong Kong's population\u2014were potentially eligible to immigrate into Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government, and many Hong Kong residents, feared that the influx of so many children would greatly overburden schools, housing and other social services of Hong Kong. As a result, there was a strong desire to see the courts rule against such a broad definition of eligibility for permanent resident status.", "On January 29, 1999, Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal ruled in favor of the broad definition. In response, then Chief Executive Tung went to Beijing to ask the Standing Committee of the NPC for its interpretation of the Basic Law as it applies to this case. Some legal scholars in Hong Kong protested that Tung's request violated Article 158 of the Basic Law, which states that such a request should come from the Court of Final Appeal before it rendered its final decision.", "On June 26, 1999, the Standing Committee announced its decision, siding with the Hong Kong government in favor of a more restrictive interpretation of the Basic Law. In its decision, the Standing Committee stated that children could emigrate to Hong Kong only if one of their parents was already a permanent resident of Hong Kong at the time of their birth and if they obtained approval, as required under Article 22 of the Basic Law. Some commentators were highly critical of the NPC decision, terming it not an \"interpretation\" of the Basic Law, but a \"reinterpretation.\" There continue to be periodic protests in Hong Kong on behalf of the mainland children being kept out of Hong Kong under the restrictive interpretation.", "Although the \"right of abode\" issue has become less prominent over time, when combined with the NPC decisions on Tsang's term and universal suffrage in the 2007 and 2008 elections, the \"right of abode\" issue has brought into question the independence of Hong Kong's courts and the degree of protection the Basic Law provides to the people of Hong Kong."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Growth in Civil Cases", "paragraphs": ["Another major development in Hong Kong's judicial system is the rapid increase in the number of civil cases.

Under the Basic Law, all legal proceedings can be held in either English or Chinese. In addition, all of Hong Kong's laws are available in both Chinese and English. As a result, more people in Hong Kong have access to the laws and may feel more comfortable bringing disputes to court.", "In addition, there is a view that the rise in civil cases also reflects increased awareness and concern among Hong Kong people about their legal rights. In this view, the economic downturn from 1998 to 2003, and the perceived incompetence of the Tung administration (see below), forced people to become more attentive to politics and to Hong Kong's legal system.

According to this scenario, as more and more trade and financial flows in Hong Kong are conducted in renminbi rather than Hong Kong dollars, it will become increasingly difficult to support the current linked exchange rate with the U.S. dollar\u2014or possibly maintain a separate Hong Kong currency. Similarly, it is argued that it will become hard to distinguish between a Hong Kong company that has most of its actual business activities taking place in the Chinese mainland from a mainland company that is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange and operates mostly from its Hong Kong office. So too, the legal distinction between a product of Hong Kong and a product of China may become increasingly difficult to make as the flow of goods and services across the border grows, especially if the product in question makes multiple trips into and out of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. In short, there is a possibility\u2014of unknowable likelihood at this time\u2014that global market forces will push the economies of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland to become fully integrated, which has implications for whether Hong Kong's economy is judged \"highly autonomous\" from the Chinese mainland."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Economic Relations with the United States", "paragraphs": ["According to the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act, economic and trade relations between the United States and Hong Kong were to remain virtually unchanged after the Handover.

Hong Kong remains a separate member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and often is a helpful ally in trade negotiations seeking to further international trade and investment liberalization. The United States and Hong Kong recognize each other as separate customs territories and their customs authorities enjoy a productive and generally friendly professional relationship. The exchange of products subject to U.S. export controls continues, without serious problems. The Hong Kong and U.S. dollars are both fully convertible and openly exchanged in international markets. The two governments successfully concluded a new air services agreement in 2002 that liberalized air services between the United States and Hong Kong. However, there has been no progress on the suggested U.S.-Hong Kong BIT.", "According to official U.S. statistics, U.S. trade with Hong Kong has experienced very little growth since the Handover (see Table 4 ). While there has been a modest increase in exports to Hong Kong, there has also been a slight decline in imports from Hong Kong. As a result, total merchandise trade between the United States and Hong Kong increased by about $300 million over the last 10 years, but the U.S. bilateral trade surplus with Hong Kong increased by $5.0 billion. Also, both exports to and imports from Hong Kong noticeably declined following the events of September 11, 2001. U.S. exports to Hong Kong have since recovered, but imports from Hong Kong have continued to decline, largely due to the relocation of Hong Kong's manufacturing into the Chinese mainland. U.S. service trade with Hong Kong totaled $8.6 billion in 2005 [latest available data], with U.S. exports of $3.7 billion and imports of $4.9 billion. In addition, majority U.S.-owned affiliates operating in Hong Kong provided $9.0 billion in services in 2004 [latest available data], and majority Hong Kong-owned affiliates operating in the United States provided $1.4 billion in services. As of the end of 2005, U.S. foreign direct investment in Hong Kong totaled $37.9 billion.", "While the formal aspects of U.S. economic and trade relations with Hong Kong remain intact, and bilateral trade and investment continues to flow, there are a few areas of long-term concern about U.S.-Hong Kong trade relations. In its most recent survey of its members, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (AmCham HK) found that \"98% of AmCham member companies indicated that they were satisfied with the overall business environment in Hong Kong,\" and half of the companies said they planned on expanding their business in the next three years. However, AmCham HK has also expressed concern about specific aspects of U.S. and Hong Kong policies that they see as hindering better economic and trade relations.", "One of the perennial issues for AmCham HK is the U.S. policy to tax overseas income. According to AmCham HK, the United States is one of only five nations that tax foreign earned income. While the U.S. tax code contains a relatively high exclusion ($82,400 in 2006) that is adjusted for inflation, recent changes in the U.S. tax code increased the effective tax rate by altering the treatment of housing and educational allowances and expenses. According to AmCham HK, the U.S. taxation of foreign earned income makes it nearly twice as expensive to hire U.S. nationals to work in Hong Kong as other \"ex-pats,\" and is pushing U.S. companies in Hong Kong to hire foreign nationals from Australia, Britain, Canada, and New Zealand rather than hire U.S. citizens. Not surprisingly they have called on the United States to discontinue the taxation of overseas incomes, and see the raising of the income exclusion as a minimal step to reduce the negative impact on US. companies and individuals operating in Hong Kong.", "The second major concern of AmCham HK is the rising problem of air pollution in Hong Kong. During the month of May 2007, hourly air pollution readings conducted by the Hong Kong government at roadsides around the city were \"high\" more than two-thirds of the time. On particularly bad days, it is impossible to see across Victoria Harbour, a distance of little more than one kilometer.", "Air pollution is also a growing issue for the people of Hong Kong, and is a high priority of the Hong Kong government. Air quality in Hong Kong has been on the decline since the 1980s, following the opening of southern China to Hong Kong manufacturing facilities. Because the prevailing wind direction is from the Chinese mainland, much of the pollution emanating from Hong Kong-owned factories in Guangdong Province ends up drifting over Hong Kong. In addition, rising traffic congestion and the construction of taller buildings along the waterfront have been cited as contributing factors to Hong Kong's air pollution problem.", "The Hong Kong government is making a concerted effort to reduce the city's air pollution. In July 2006, Chief Executive Tsang announced the \"Action Blue Sky\" Campaign, designed to raise public awareness of air pollution. Hong Kong has already converted nearly all of its taxi cabs from diesel to liquified petroleum gas (LPG) to reduce emissions, and is pushing the private bus companies to convert their fleet of vehicles to LPG. The Hong Kong government is also working with utility companies in both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland to find ways of reducing emissions at power generation facilities. Despite these and other actions, Hong Kong continues to have a significant air pollution problem.", "The third issue raised by AmCham HK is the quality of education available for the children of \"ex-pats\" in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has an extensive network of \"international schools\" that provide an education comparable to the curriculum offered back in the home country. However, the return of many Hong Kong residents to Hong Kong following the Handover has increased the demand for the limited number of openings at these schools."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Important Social and Cultural Trends", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Declining \"Ex-Pat\" Community", "paragraphs": ["Whether it is for the reasons cited by AmCham HK or other causes, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of \"ex-pats\" in Hong Kong since the Handover, especially from Britain, Canada, and the United States (see Table 5 ). Between 1996 and 2001, the number of British \"ex-pats\" living in Hong Kong decreased by nearly 150,000 people. Much of this dramatic decline is attributable to the removal of British troops from Hong Kong following the Handover. However, there is no similar \"troop withdrawal\" to account for halving of U.S. ex-pats in Hong Kong between 1996 and 2001, or the 64% decline in the Canadian population.", "The \"disappearance\" of the Western \"ex-pats\" and the arrival of more mainland Chinese has had a subtle change in the look and feel of Hong Kong. According to some observers, its international quality has declined, while its Chinese cultural attributes are on the rise. In addition, a significant number of executive positions in the private sector that previously were filled by Western \"ex-pats\" are now being done by mainland immigrants. Meanwhile, at the other end of the income spectrum, many jobs previously done by Hong Kong Chinese are being taken by recent mainland immigrants as well.", "The perceived influx of mainland Chinese at both the top and bottom of the income distribution is causing some tensions within the Hong Kong Chinese population. Much as the United States experienced with its waves of immigrants, some people in Hong Kong view the \"newcomers\" with suspicion. This suspicious attitude towards mainland immigrants was reinforced by the Tung administration when it released rather dire predictions of the effects of the arrival of mainland children and their families during the \"right of abode\" controversy. It is not uncommon to hear claims in Hong Kong that mainland immigrants are responsible for a rise in crime, the decline in the quality of education, and a general loss of good manners in Hong Kong since the Handover."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disappearing Middle Class", "paragraphs": ["Along with the decline in its \"ex-pat\" population, there is a perception that Hong Kong may be losing its \"middle class.\" With more and more of the middle management jobs being relocated into the Chinese mainland, analysts say Hong Kong residents are being forced to work harder for less pay. Recent income statistics show some evidence to support this claim. During the depths of Hong Kong's recession, nominal salaries and wages in the private sector declined every quarter from the beginning of 2002 to the end of 2004. In addition, the Hong Kong government recently announced that Hong Kong's Gini coefficient had risen from 0.518 in 1996 to 0.533 in 2006. By contrast, the U.S. Gini coefficient in 2005 was 0.469 and China's Gini coefficient in 2005 was 0.46.", "There are also indications that the Chinese government is concerned about the status of Hong Kong's middle class. During a May 2007 interview with Hong Kong Cable TV, Lu Ping, former director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, stated that prior to the Handover, the Chinese government's \"biggest concern was that big businesses, particularly the ones overseas, might pull out.\" In retrospect, Lu believes, \"Although we had paid attention to people in the middle-class and the grassroots level, who make up the majority after all, it wasn't enough. More could have been done for them.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Preservation", "paragraphs": ["Even before 1997, an undercurrent of nostalgia swept around Hong Kong. While there were very few public expressions of disapproval of Hong Kong's return to China, there were many private disclosures of sadness at seeing the departure of the photo of the Queen in government buildings and other attributes of Hong Kong's British heritage. In addition, musician Anthony Wong Yiu Ming performed a concert to sell-out crowds in 1997 entitled \"People Mountain, People Sea\" ( Yan San, Yan Hoi ) that featured a well-known love song in which one half of an ex-couple expresses his or her sorrow about the end of the relationship, as well as his or her appreciation for everything the other person taught the singer. During the concert, Wong performed the song while dressed up in an outfit patterned after the British Union Jack. The symbolism of Wong's clothing was not lost on the audience.", "Since the Handover, there continues to be an interest in preserving Hong Kong's distinct cultural heritage. The Hong Kong government has increased its efforts to preserve historical buildings, both of Chinese design (such as village temples) and colonial origin. An example of the Hong Kong government's efforts to preserve historical buildings is the reconstruction of Murray House in Stanley in 1999.", "More recently, the proposed demolition of the Railroad Clock Tower in Tsim Sha Tsui and the Queen's Pier on Hong Kong Island gave rise to series of public demonstrations and an occupation of the pier by more than 20 protesters, prolonged debates in Legco, and the advancement and withdrawal of proposals by Chief Executive Tsang to relocate and preserve these historic buildings.

One major aspect of this process is defining\u2014or redefining\u2014Hong Kong's relationship with China.", "An example of the redefinition of Hong Kong's relationship to China is how Hong Kong residents identify themselves. In a survey conducted just after the Handover, 35% of the respondents referred to themselves as \"Hong Kong citizens\" ( Heunggongyan ), 25% said they were \"Chinese Hong Kong citizens\" ( Chunggwok gei Heunggongyan ), 20% called themselves \"Hong Kong Chinese citizens\" ( Heunggong gei Chunggwokyan ), and a bit more than 18% used the term \"Chinese citizens\" ( Chunggwokyan ).

To some pro-Beijing politicians, criticism of the Chinese government is viewed as being unpatriotic and disloyal. However, for pro-democracy politicians, the criticism may be considered an expression of patriotism if the goal is to make Hong Kong and/or China a better place. For typical Hong Kong citizens, the issue becomes one of resolving the tension between one's loyalty to Hong Kong and to China.", "Combining the social and cultural changes with the post-Handover economic dynamics, the issue of Hong Kong's long term ability to remain separate and distinct from the Chinese mainland resurfaces. At present, the Hong Kong government is emphasizing Hong Kong's identity as \"Asia's World City,\" as well as the entryway into the emerging Chinese mainland market. The focus is on projecting Hong Kong as being an international and cosmopolitan city and the natural bridge into China.

For example, in surveys conducted prior the Standing Committee of the NPC announcement of April 2004, between 70% and 80% of the respondents supported the direct election of Chief Executive in 2007. A similar set of surveys found that nearly three-quarters of the people supported direct election of Legco before the Standing Committee of the NPC stated its opposition to the direct elections, and nearly two-thirds continued to support direct elections afterwards.", "Two possible ways for Congress to promote Hong Kong's progress towards universal suffrage and democracy are: (1) closely monitor the work of the Committee on Governance and Political Development as it develops the \"Green Paper\" on \"models, roadmaps and timetables for electing the Chief Executive by Universal Suffrage,\" as well as its Legco reform proposals; and (2) provide assistance to the current Legco in its ongoing research into the policies and practices of the U.S. Congress.
