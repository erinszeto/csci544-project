FRA's safety programs were last authorized in 1994; their authorization expired in 1998. Most measures of rail safety have improved significantly since FRA's last authorization, including the number of grade crossing collisions and fatalities and the number of employee injuries and deaths. These improvements came while the amount of both freight and passenger rail activity on the nation's rail infrastructure was increasing. However, the improvements in safety measures have leveled off in recent years. Given significant projected continued increases in freight and passenger rail activity in the coming decade, there is concern that without additional efforts, some of the gains of the past decade may be lost.", "Among the issues that have dominated debate thus far are alleged shortcomings in the rail hours of service statute (49 U.S.C. 21101 et seq) that limit the act's effectiveness in preventing fatigue among train operating crews, which may be a contributing factor in a significant number of train accidents. A related issue is limbo time, time that train operating crews spend on shift, but not engaged in safety-related duties, after they have reached the limit of their shift under the rail hours of service act, which also contributes to fatigue. Unlike the hours of service rules for other transportation modes, the rail hours of service rules are set in law and cannot be altered through the regulatory process. Other prominent issues have included implementation by railroads of automated collision-prevention technology in trains, the adequacy of FRA track inspections, and safety at highway-rail grade crossings.", "The House (on October 17, 2007) and Senate (on August 1, 2008) passed differing versions of H.R. 2095, the Federal Railroad Safety Improvement Act. On September 24, 2008, the House agreed to the Senate amendment with an amendment pursuant to H.Res. 1492. This amended version of H.R. 2095 incorporated another piece of legislation, the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (differing versions of which were previously passed by both the Senate and House as S. 294), which reauthorizes Amtrak and federal passenger rail programs. Further action is now up to the Senate. According to press reports and information at the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's website, the amended H.R. 2095 includes provisions that would increase the length of the minimum rest period under the rail hours of service act and give FRA the authority to further increase the minimum rest period through regulation, increase the number of FRA safety inspectors, and mandate implementation of positive train control. It would also authorize about $13 billion in funding for Amtrak and passenger rail activities, and direct the Department of Transportation (DOT) to solicit bits to develop and operate high-speed rail lines in 11 corridors, including the Northeast Corridor (for further information about Amtrak reauthorization, see CRS Report RL33492, Amtrak: Budget and Reauthorization, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]).", "This report will be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation is the federal agency primarily responsible for promoting and regulating the safety of the railroad industry.

FRA's safety programs have continued to be funded through annual appropriations bills.", "Reauthorization of the FRA is taking place in a context of improvement in most measures of rail safety. However, there continue to be around 1,000 rail-related deaths each year. The trend of improvement in some rail safety measures, such as train accidents and deaths in grade-crossing collisions, has leveled off in recent years, and with forecasts of significant growth in rail traffic in the future, there is concern over the need to make more progress in rail safety.", "Several hearings have been held in the 110 th Congress in both the House and Senate on reauthorization of FRA. An Administration proposal to reauthorize FRA has been introduced, by request, as the Federal Railroad Safety Accountability and Improvement Act ( H.R. 1516 and S. 918 ). No action has been taken on this legislation in either the House or the Senate.

Senator Frank Lautenberg, Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security, has also introduced a reauthorization proposal, the Railroad Safety Enhancement Act of 2007 ( S. 1889 ). A managers' amendment was adopted and ordered to be reported out of the Commerce Committee on September 27, 2007; the bill was reported out on March 3, 2008.

The sector consists of roughly 570 freight railroads and 118 passenger, commuter, and excursion railroads. These organizations employ around 235,000 people and operate roughly 220,000 miles of track. The vast majority of the rail sector consists of freight railroad operations. The freight railroad industry is divided into three classes, based on operating revenues; there are only 7 railroads in the top category, Class I, for which the threshold is roughly $320 million in annual revenues, but those 7 railroads represent about 70% of freight rail industry employment and own roughly 70% of total U.S. rail mileage.", "The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96 - 448 ) largely deregulated the freight rail industry. Since that time, there has been extensive consolidation of the industry. Employment has been reduced from 480,000 (1980) to 235,000 (2006), while freight revenue ton-miles have increased from 918 million (1980) to 1.96 trillion (2006). The miles of road operated in freight service have been reduced from 177,000 (1980) to 141,000 (2005), while the number of train-miles operated has increased from 718 million (1980) to 811 million (2006). The number of passenger-miles has increased from 12 billion (1980) to 16 billion (2006).", "During this period, the overall safety record of the industry has shown great improvement. Between 1980 and 1994, the annual rate of train accidents (that is, the number of accidents divided by the number of miles traveled by trains) declined from almost 12 accidents per million train miles to just under 4 per million train miles. However, since 1994 the improvement has leveled off, and the rate of train accidents has varied from 3.5 to 4.4 per million train miles since then. In addition to this lack of improvement in the train accident rate, several recent serious accidents have raised concerns about the need for further improvement in rail safety. The numbers of grade-crossing collisions and resulting injuries and deaths declined until 2003, but has shown little improvement since then.", "Most rail-related deaths are to pedestrians trespassing on rail lines and motorists colliding with trains at highway rail grade crossings. While there are nearly 1,000 rail-related deaths each year, only around 20-30 rail employees are killed while on duty each year, and railroads have lower employee injury rates than other modes of transportation and most other major industries.", "FRA classifies the causes of train accidents into five categories: human factors, track and structures, equipment, signal and train control, and miscellaneous. Of these, human factors and track are responsible for the majority of train accidents. Examples of human factor causes of accidents include improperly positioning the switches that determine which track a train will follow (the cause of the Graniteville, SC accident), moving rail cars without checking for safe conditions in the vicinity, and leaving rail cars in a position that blocks track. Examples of track conditions that lead to accidents include defective joint bars (that connect one piece of rail to the next), defective or ineffective crossties (that maintain the proper alignment of the parallel rails that form the track), and broken or worn switches.", "Without further reductions in the rate of train accidents, the number of train accidents and resulting deaths and injuries is likely to grow, due to expected increases in train traffic. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has estimated that between 1998 and 2020 the amount of freight moved by rail (measured by weight) will increase by roughly 50%. Also, many communities are interested in establishing, or expanding already existing, commuter rail operations (which generally operate on the freight rail network) to provide transportation alternatives and manage congestion. Thus, the number of train miles on the nation's freight rail network is likely to significantly increase in the coming years. If train accident rates do not improve, this may lead to increased numbers of accidents, injuries and deaths."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FRA's Role in Rail Safety", "paragraphs": ["FRA's role in rail safety is threefold: to assess the safety of rail operations; to promulgate regulations to promote cost-effective improvements in safety standards; and to enforce compliance with federal rail safety laws and regulations.

FRA also enforces the Hazardous Materials Regulations, prescribed by DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, as they apply to rail transportation.", "FRA is a relatively small agency in relation to the size of the railroad industry it oversees. It has around 800 employees, of whom 650 are classified as safety personnel, including around 430 inspectors (supplemented by 160 state inspectors who work with FRA on safety oversight of railroads), to oversee an industry with over 235,000 employees, 220,000 miles of track, 158,000 signals and switches, and over 1.3 million freight cars and other equipment in service. Although FRA and the state investigators conduct some 63,000 inspections each year, these inspections cover only a small fraction of the operations of railroads each year. To make the most of its resources, FRA focuses inspections at locations judged as likely to have safety problems based on accident data and results of previous inspections. FRA's annual budget for its core safety responsibilities (that is, excluding funding for grants to Amtrak) is roughly $200 million."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FRA's New Initiatives to Promote Safety", "paragraphs": ["FRA's traditional approach to safety is to regulate the design of rail structures and the behavior of rail workers, then to use inspections to enforce compliance with the specific standards.

These include efforts to target its inspections using a more quantitative assessment of risk, as well as new initiatives that make use of risk management approaches to improving safety. For example, FRA has implemented a Confidential Close Call Reporting Program pilot project. This project allows employees of participating railroads to report close calls\u2014that is, incidents where an accident could have occurred, but didn't. The information on the close calls is kept confidential, so that both employees and the participating railroads are shielded from punishment for providing the information. A team composed of representatives of the participating railroads, labor organizations, FRA, and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics will review the information to identify safety problems. A similar program has been in place in the aviation industry for many years, and has contributed to improvements in safety there."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FRA's National Rail Safety Action Plan", "paragraphs": ["In response to concerns raised by the accidents experienced in 2004 and early 2005, in May 2005 FRA instituted a new safety action plan to improve rail safety.

Since the plan was introduced relatively recently, most of its initiatives have not yet been fully implemented, and their overall impact on safety will probably not be known for several years. Some of the initiatives rely on voluntary actions by railroads, such as the adoption of a worker fatigue model to help railroads schedule the duty periods of train crews so as to reduce worker fatigue; thus their implementation is uncertain.", "GAO noted that, while FRA has goals for its safety efforts (e.g., to reduce train accidents caused by human factors), it does not have measures of the direct results of its inspection and enforcement programs that would show their contribution to achieving those goals.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has identified fatigue as a factor in at least 18 rail accidents since 1984 , and notes that, given the difficulty of identifying fatigue as a cause or contributor to accidents, the number of accidents due to fatigue is likely to be underestimated. NTSB has had operator fatigue on its list of \"Most Wanted Transportation Safety Improvements\" since it began keeping such a list in 1990."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rail Hours of Service Act", "paragraphs": ["Congress enacted legislation in 1907 to limit the amount of time certain rail workers, such as train operating personnel and signalmen, can work at one stretch, and to specify the minimum amount of rest they must be provided before reporting for work again. These limits are enacted in law , unlike the hours of service limits for workers in other transportation modes, which are set through the regulatory process. Therefore, unlike for other modes, the rail hours of service limits cannot be changed by DOT through the regulatory process. The rail hours of service law has not been substantially changed since 1969.", "Under the current law, train operating crews and signalmen can work a maximum of 12 hours, after which they must be given at least 10 hours rest. However, if they work less than 12 hours they are only required to be given 8 hours of rest. Under these rules, a train crew worker can work 432 hours a month. This compares to a maximum work schedule of 100 hours in a month for a commercial pilot, 260 hours in a month for commercial truck drivers, and 360 hours in a month for licensed maritime workers aboard vessels under 100 tons when at sea.", "Most rail workers do not work anywhere near the theoretical maximum of 432 hours. According to Association of American Railroads (AAR) data from several railroads collected in 1998-1999, the average work schedule for train, engine, and yard employees was in the range of 125 to 175 hours a month, with 17% working more than 200 hours in a month. Fewer than 1% worked more than 300 hours in a month.", "Both FRA and the NTSB have testified that the current rail hours of service regime is antiquated and does not reflect current understanding of the causes of, and effective countermeasures for, fatigue. The FRA has testified that \"the limitations in [the time that can be worked under the hours of service law], although ordinarily observed, do not seem adequate to effectively control fatigue.\" The NTSB has made several recommendations to DOT over the years to change the rail hours of service act, but DOT has not been able to respond to these recommendations because the rules are set in the statutes.

Moreover, the employee may not know whether they will have to return to work in 8 hours or whether they will have a longer period to rest. If they are called to return to work in 8 hours, the call to report to work, which is required by labor agreements to come early enough to give the employee time to get to work, may come as much as 2 hours in advance of the time to report to work, which could be only 6 hours after the employee left work at the end of their previous shift. Thus a worker could, even under ideal circumstances away from the job, have as little as 5 to 6 hours of undisturbed rest before returning to work.", "The difficulties created by the relatively short length of the minimum off-duty period set by the hours of service act can be exacerbated by the uncertainty of rail employee work schedules. It may be difficult for rail employees to make effective use of their available rest time between shifts, because when they leave work at the end of a shift train crews do not always know when they will next have to report to work. The FRA has testified that crews of freight trains rarely have predictable work schedules. The United Transportation Union has testified that the majority of train crews are subject to call with little notice. This uncertainty makes it difficult for train crews to know how to make the best use of their off-duty time.", "This uncertainty of employee's work schedules is due in part to labor agreements which affect the work scheduling practices of railroads. These agreements prioritize the availability of employees for work based on factors such as seniority. Employees who are called to report to work when they feel they have not had adequate rest can decline the call, but may face disciplinary action if they do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conflict with circadian rhythms", "paragraphs": ["Researchers have learned that human beings, like most mammals, sleep and wake in a cycle approximately 24 hours in length, known as a circadian rhythm. Rapid changes in a person's circadian pattern of sleep and wakefulness disrupt many physiological functions and may impair their performance. The work schedules permitted under the current hours of service rule may in certain instances conflict with employee's circadian rhythms, making it more difficult for them to get adequate rest. Under the current regulations, rail workers can work 8 hours and rest 8 hours, and maintain that schedule indefinitely. Thus, one day they might be resting from midnight to 8 a.m., the next day from 4 p.m. to midnight, the next day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and the next day back to midnight to 8 a.m., a \"backward-rotating\" schedule that never allows the workers to establish a circadian rhythm."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Efforts to Address Fatigue", "paragraphs": ["FRA has adapted a model developed by researchers working with the U.S. military that can estimate the degree of fatigue likely to be experienced by a person, based on such factors as the time of day, the amount of sleep they last got, when that sleep occurred, and how long the person has been awake since then. FRA has tested this model against a record of crew work schedules and found that it is useful in predicting when an employee may be fatigued to the point of increased risk of contributing to an accident. FRA is encouraging rail companies to use this model to inform their crew scheduling practices. FRA is also encouraging and supporting efforts to address sleep disorders among rail employees.", "Railroads and rail labor have cooperated in efforts to address fatigue. For example, the BNSF Railway Company provides train crews 14 hours of undisturbed rest after working 8 hours. CSX Transportation provides a 10-hour period of undisturbed rest, as well as fixed work-rest schedules in some locations.", "However, efforts by rail management and rail labor to address fatigue issues have often achieved limited success. Factors that have constrained the success of the various initiatives include the variability in demand for rail services, which can increase the need for rail labor more quickly than employees can be added, staffing and retention issues that have affected the supply of rail labor, and provisions in collective bargaining agreements which may make a fatigue management practice mandatory in one location and optional in another, even within the same railroad. According to rail labor representatives, programs to provide more predictable work schedules are currently covering no more than 2% of affected employees. Also, even successful voluntary programs are subject to being changed or eliminated as conditions change in the industry.", "A more fundamental difficulty facing efforts to address fatigue is that both rail managers and rail workers have incentives to maintain the status quo regarding rail hours of service. For managers, the current system allows more flexibility in scheduling employees for work than any likely alternative; for workers, the current system provides the opportunity to work more hours (and thus, earn more income) than any likely alternative. For these reasons, voluntary efforts to address fatigue are likely to face much resistance.", "Another difficulty in attempting to address fatigue is the degree to which the current hours of service regime has become intertwined with the contractual arrangements that have been negotiated over decades by rail labor and management. These labor agreements, resulting from collective bargaining, often include provisions that affect how often, and under what circumstances, employees can work. Changes in the hours of service regime may affect the impact of these provisions, and thus upset the balance of interests achieved through long negotiation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limbo Time", "paragraphs": ["Limbo time refers to a situation where a train operating crew has reached the limit of the amount of time it is allowed to work at one stretch under the hours of service law (12 hours), but has not yet reached the location where it is to be released from duty. In such a situation the crew is required to stop the train and not engage in safety-related duties, but it is not allowed to leave the train until a replacement crew arrives, at which time the original crew can be transported to a final release point. The time the crew spends being transported to its final release point is neither on-duty time for purposes of the hours of service law (and so not a violation of the hours of service law) nor off-duty time (and so does not count against the amount of off-duty time the crew is required to be given in order to rest after their shift); hence, \"limbo\" time. The train crews are generally paid for limbo time, but there is concern about its impact on employee fatigue: the minimum rest period currently required after a 12-hour shift may not be sufficient to recover from a shift that was more than 12 hours long\u2014in some cases much more\u2014due to the addition of limbo time.", "Limbo time was created in 1969 amendments to the rail hours of service law. Prior to that change, the time the original crew spent being transported to its final release point was considered off-duty (rest) time. Rail labor requested that the transportation time be considered as on-duty time, but railroads objected that that change would create increased scheduling difficulties for them, since they would have to arrange to stop the trains even further from the pre-arranged destination and have the original crew spend more time being transported to its release point. Limbo time was created to ensure that train crews' off-duty period did not begin until they were truly off duty so that they had the opportunity to rest during their rest period, while still providing railroads operational flexibility without endangering safety. FRA has also interpreted the time the original crew spends waiting with the train for the arrival of transportation to its final release point as limbo time, an interpretation that has been upheld by the Supreme Court. FRA has expressed concern about employees being held on trains for long periods of time while awaiting the arrival of transportation, in the absence of any valid emergency that would justify such long waits.", "Changing conditions in the rail industry since 1969 have increased the scale of the limbo time issue. In the 1960s, the industry consisted of many mid-sized companies operating in relatively small regions, and railroads typically had employees stationed every few dozen miles who could be sent to pick up train crews whose shifts had expired. Since then there has been significant consolidation in the rail industry, which is now dominated by a few major companies whose operations span much larger territories. The average distance covered by a train crew during a shift is now much greater, and there may be few or even no intermediate locations from which transportation can be dispatched to pick up a crew whose shift has expired.", "Industry-wide statistics on limbo time are not available, so the full extent of limbo time is not known, nor can an increase in the incidence of limbo time be documented industry-wide. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) recently presented data on limbo time for train crews at one Class I railroad indicating that the incidence of limbo time at that railroad was increasing. Over the six-year period 2001-2006, the number of crews whose work tours exceeded 14 hours, indicating at least 2 hours of limbo time, increased from between 32,000-33,000 a year in 2001 and 2002 to between 75,000-80,000 in 2005 and 2006. Those crews whose work tours exceeded 15 hours rose from around 12,000 a year in 2001 and 2002 to between 35,000-38,000 a year in 2005 and 2006. The BLET figures show that on 1,003 occasions crews at that Class I railroad spent at least 8 hours in limbo, resulting in a shift lasting at least 20 hours. The NTSB investigation of the Macdona, Texas accident found that the engineer on the Union Pacific train that struck the BNSF train had one shift earlier that month that had lasted 22 hours: 10 hours of limbo time after a 12-hour shift."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Positive Train Control", "paragraphs": ["Fatigue is not entirely preventable, no matter the countermeasures. Researchers have found, for example, that human performance is impaired during the early morning hours (roughly 3-6 a.m.), regardless of how well-rested the worker. Thus there is interest in technologies that can reduce the opportunities for human error resulting from fatigue or other factors to create safety problems. One such technology is positive train control.", "Positive train control (PTC) refers to technology that is capable of preventing collisions between trains, derailments resulting from trains traveling too fast for conditions, and injuries to roadway workers (e.g., maintenance-of-way workers, bridge workers, signal maintainers), as well as potentially limiting the consequences of hijackings and runaway trains. PTC can serve as a backup system able to intervene when a train crew operates a train improperly or fails to comply with signals. Examples of PTC systems vary widely in complexity and sophistication based on the level of automation they implement and the degree of control they are capable of assuming.", "PTC has been on the NTSB's Most Wanted Transportation Safety Improvements list since the list was established in 1990. In its review of the Macdona, Texas accident, the NTSB noted that \"[b]oard accident investigations over the past three decades have shown that the most effective way to prevent train-to-train collisions is through the use of a positive train control (PTC) system that will automatically assume some control of a train when the train crew does not comply with signal indications.\"", "Congress has also been interested in PTC. Since 1992, Congress has on several occasions requested information from FRA about the costs and benefits of PTC and the status of PTC deployment. Since 1994, Congress has provided approximately $40 million to FRA to support development, testing, and deployment of PTC prototype systems in Illinois, Alaska, and among the Eastern railroads.", "In 1997 FRA asked the Rail Safety Advisory Committee to examine PTC. The Advisory Committee concluded that the safety benefit of PTC to railroads did not justify the significant costs of deploying such systems. It estimated that PTC deployment on the Class I railroads would cost from $1.2 billion to $7.8 billion over 20 years, depending on the sophistication of the system, while over the same period the estimated safety benefit from avoided accidents ranged from around $500 million to $850 million, again depending on the sophistication of the system. FRA subsequently issued a regulation establishing a performance standard for PTC (finalized in 2005), but has not required railroads to implement PTC. FRA noted in its 2005 Final Rule on PTC standards that PTC systems offer nonsafety benefits, including substantial public benefits, although the total value of these benefits is subject to debate. FRA concluded that mandating the implementation of PTC systems could not be justified based on \"normal cost/benefit principles relying on direct railroad safety benefits.\" FRA encourages railroads to voluntarily deploy PTC.", "In 2006 the NTSB observed that it was encouraged that FRA had adopted performance standards for PTC in 2005 and that PTC pilot projects are underway at various railroads, but noted that the 2004 Macdona, Texas accident was \"another in a long series of railroad accidents that could have been prevented had there been a PTC system in place at the accident location.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Track Inspections", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, defective track was the leading cause of train accidents.

There had been several previous derailments in the area, and the FRA initiated an audit of CSX track in New York state. The audit found 78 track defects and one serious violation. FRA has announced that it will extend the audit to other railroads' tracks in New York state.", "To make better use of its limited inspection resources, FRA has begun to target its inspections to those sites deemed likely to have problems, based on quantitative analysis of risk factors and past inspections. Some types of track defects are difficult to detect by visual inspection, so FRA has acquired technology that can improve its track inspections. It has recently introduced two new automated track geometry inspection vehicles, which measure the width between rails, whether the rails are level, and whether the shape of each rail complies with federal standards intended to prevent derailments. This brings the track geometry inspection fleet to five. FRA expects that these new vehicles will enable it to triple the amount of track it inspects each year by automated means, to nearly 100,000 miles.

The remaining 90,000 or so crossings are known as private crossings, where the railroad tracks are crossed by, for example, driveways or farm roads.", "The number of collisions and fatalities at grade crossings has been reduced significantly over the past few decades, even as the amount of both train and highway traffic has significantly increased. Since the FRA was last authorized, train miles traveled have increased by 24% (from 655 million miles in 1994 to 810 million miles in 2006), while road vehicle miles traveled have increased by 26% (from 2.3 trillion miles in 1994 to 2.9 trillion miles on 2006). Meanwhile, the collisions at grade crossings decreased by 42% (from 4,979 in 1994 to 2,908 in 2006) However, the trend of improvement has leveled off in recent years. Given the progress that has been made in reducing fatalities at grade crossings over the past decade, some have questioned whether additional Congressional action is needed. On the other hand, highly visible crashes such as the Glendale, California incident bring calls for additional efforts to improve safety at grade crossings.", "All public crossings are required to have warning devices. In most cases these are passive devices: crossbuck signs and pavement markings that warn motorists that they are approaching a railroad crossing, but do not indicate to motorists whether a train is approaching or not. However, train operators are required to sound the locomotive's horn as they approach any crossing.", "Approximately 63,000 of the roughly 150,000 public crossings have been equipped with automated warning devices, such as warning lights and crossbars, that warn motorists if a train is approaching. These devices are installed by state and local transportation agencies; once installed, railroads are responsible for maintaining these devices and ensuring their proper functioning. These devices can be relatively expensive and generally must compete with other transportation improvements for funding.", "The Federal Highway Administration has a Grade-Crossing Hazard Elimination Program that provides $220 million annually to states for safety improvements to grade crossings. The eligibility of crossings for safety improvement funding is based on their risk, with the most dangerous crossings given priority. Most of the crossings in urban areas have been provided with automated warning devices. The provision of automated warning devices to the more than 80,000 public rail-highway crossings that do not have conventional automated warning devices is constrained by both the costs of the devices and by concern on the part of public authorities that increasing the protection provided to motorists at one crossing could be used in lawsuits to argue the inadequacy of protection provided at other crossings in the area.", "Another method of reducing grade crossing accidents is to eliminate the grade crossing. In some cases this is done by elevating the road or rail crossing, but this is a very expensive option. Most often this is done by closing the road where it crosses the railroad tracks. In 1994, FRA set a goal of reducing the-then 280,000 public and private grade crossings by 25% (to 210,000). That goal has not been achieved, though some 30,000 crossings have been closed since then. FRA encourages states and communities to close grade crossings based on the safety benefits. Communities are often reluctant to close grade crossings because of the inconvenience resulting from reducing the number of places where railroad tracks can be crossed.", "FRA also supports Operation Lifesaver, a national nonprofit railroad safety education program which attempts to reduce grade-crossing accidents by educating the public about the dangers of grade crossings and encouraging safe driving behavior at grade crossings. Operation Lifesaver programs in 49 states (and the District of Columbia) use volunteer trainers to make some 30,000 presentations a year to the public, as well as offering training for groups such as commercial truck drivers, school bus drivers, and emergency personnel, and providing public service announcements.", "Fewer than 1% of grade crossing collisions are investigated by FRA each year. Most of the information FRA relies on for analysis of grade crossing collisions comes from accident reports submitted by the railroads. According to the reports, many of these collisions result from incautious behavior on the part of motorists. The DOT Inspector General has recommended that FRA supplement the accident reports submitted by railroads with independent sources of information, such as police reports, event data recorders, and eyewitness accounts, in order to better evaluate the causes of collisions and the extent of railroads' compliance with safety regulations. In response to this recommendation, FRA instituted a pilot study to assess the benefits and costs of analyzing information about crossing collisions from independent sources. The results of that study had not been made public as of late July 2007.", "The DOT's Inspector General has recommended several other steps FRA could take in order to further reduce grade crossing collisions and fatalities. These include ensuring that railroads comply with the requirement to promptly report serious grade crossing collisions, so that the collisions can be investigated; increasing FRA's involvement in grade crossing collision investigations; requiring railroads to clear obstructions (such as vegetation) near crossings to make it easier for motorists to see oncoming trains; requiring railroads and states to provide updated information on grade crossings and the types of warning devices installed at each crossing; and requiring states with the most grade crossings and most accidents to develop plans for identifying and remediating the most dangerous crossings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals", "paragraphs": ["Several hearings have been held in both the House and Senate during the 110 th Congress on rail safety reauthorization issues.
