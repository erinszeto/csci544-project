Six nuclear reactors have permanently shut down during the past five years, and 19 others have announced their intention to close or have been identified as \"at-risk\" of closure by financial consultants and ratings agencies.", "Generally, U.S. nuclear plants are located in one of two market areas: (1) competitive\u2014where the value of electricity fluctuates based on supply-side price offers that are generally a function of fuel (e.g., natural gas) costs and demand-side price bids, and (2) cost-of-service\u2014where the value of electricity is set at a rate based on regulator-approved costs, operating expenses, and a reasonable investment return. Most of the U.S. plants considered vulnerable to shut down before expiration of their operating licenses are \"merchant plants\" that sell all or most of their power into competitive wholesale power markets. The price paid to merchant plants for electric power varies by location and is influenced by the price-setting fuel (usually natural gas and coal), transmission congestion, and other factors. Wholesale electricity prices in certain locations have fallen and electricity sales revenue may be below the fuel and operating and maintenance (O&M) costs of some plants, not considering capital expenditures that may also be incurred.", "CRS analysis of third-party data indicates that 19 of 33 power plants operating in competitive power markets may incur fuel and O&M costs that exceed electricity revenues for each plant in 2016. However, this number declines to seven in 2017 due to rising forward electricity prices as reported by Bloomberg. While merchant generators do have other revenue sources (i.e., capacity payments where available, power purchase agreements, and hedging positions) and additional costs (e.g., capital), CRS was not able to locate plant-specific information about these revenues and costs that would allow for a holistic financial assessment at the plant level.", "The nuclear power industry and its supporters have proposed that Congress take action to prevent currently operating U.S. reactors from shutting down before their licenses expire. Supporters contend that nuclear power should be valued as a domestic source of highly reliable, low-carbon electricity. However, opponents contend that nuclear power suffers from too many drawbacks and that federal incentives should focus instead on renewable energy and efficiency. Nuclear power plants annually provide about 20% of total U.S. electricity generation.", "To date, all of the policy action related to financial support for existing nuclear plants has been at the state level. New York has implemented a Clean Energy Standard (CES) that includes payments to qualified nuclear power plants in the state starting at approximately $17 per megawatt-hour in 2017. The CES has been challenged on legal grounds. A similar program was recently approved by the Illinois legislature, and Ohio has also considered nuclear support.", "Since each nuclear power plant is subject to a unique combination of financial variables, federal-level incentives are challenged because some nuclear plants are expected to continue operating without federal financial support. Should Congress choose to debate financial incentives for existing nuclear plants, several options may be considered. Tax incentives based on capital investment or electricity production could potentially provide financial support for existing nuclear plants. Establishing a carbon price\u2014carbon tax, cap-and-trade, emissions regulations\u2014could also provide some financial assistance to nuclear power, depending on how a carbon price mechanism was designed and implemented. Finally, Congress could authorize and require the federal government to enter into power purchase agreements with nuclear power plants that would provide a guaranteed price for nuclear-generated electricity.

", "Some nuclear plants located in competitive power markets are subject to full or partial rate regulation, which reduces financial risk associated with fluctuating electricity prices. Access to competitive wholesale power market prices can result in regulatory bodies deciding that early nuclear plant retirement is in the best interest of rate payers based on projected electricity prices. Other plants located in competitive power markets operate on a \"merchant\" basis, where electricity prices and revenues are subject to commodity price fluctuations and supply/demand dynamics. Merchant nuclear power plants are the focus of this report.", "Competitive power markets are managed by either a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) or an Independent System Operator (ISO), which operates electricity and capacity markets that determine revenues for nuclear, and other, power generators. Unlike cost-of-service market areas\u2014where generators have electricity price rates that are approved and periodically revised by a state utility commission\u2014competitive power markets are subject to electricity price volatility that results from supply and demand fundamentals as well as fuel (e.g., natural gas and coal) costs for the marginal price-setting generators. While generators operating in cost-of-service market areas are not immune to fuel competition, to date nuclear power plants that have announced early closure or have been identified by financial consultants and ratings agencies as \"at-risk\" of closure are located in competitive market areas.", "U.S. nuclear power plants operating in competitive power markets are in an era of challenging economic conditions\u2014increasing operating costs and low wholesale power prices in some locations\u2014that create uncertainty regarding the future of some plants.

Built by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and operated by Duquesne Light Company, the relatively small (60 Megawatt) power plant was not considered economically viable. However, Shippingport paved the way for additional demonstration reactors that were rapidly scaled up in generating capacity to provide a viable alternative to power plants fired by fossil fuels.", "Harnessing the tremendous energy potential of nuclear fission had been a major federal goal since the development of nuclear weapons during World War II. Post-war policymakers widely anticipated that nuclear power plants could generate much or most of the power that would be needed to satisfy the nation's rapidly escalating demand for electricity, particularly if plutonium and uranium from spent nuclear fuel were recycled for use in advanced fast-neutron reactors. It was also hoped that the widespread adoption of nuclear power would mitigate volatile and rising fossil fuel prices, growing dependence on foreign oil, and air pollution.", "The legal framework for the U.S. nuclear power industry was established by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), which authorized the private sector to own and operate nuclear facilities under AEC licensing. To encourage private-sector adoption of the new and potentially hazardous technology, Congress enacted the Price-Anderson Act as an amendment to the AEA in 1957, establishing a special public liability system for reactor operators and suppliers.", "Shippingport and other small, early commercial nuclear plants were constructed with subsidies under the AEC's Power Reactor Demonstration Program. Beginning in 1963, reactor suppliers began selling substantially larger units\u2014around 500 megawatts and above\u2014on a \"turnkey\" basis to electric utilities. By 1965, plants as large as 1,100 megawatts were being ordered by utilities under a non-turnkey basis, with contract terms similar to those of non-nuclear power plants. Rising coal prices and the apparently improved economics of larger reactors prompted electric utilities to order 20 new nuclear units in 1966 and 31 in 1967\u2014only a decade after the startup of Shippingport. Reactor orders continued at a strong pace through 1971 and then jumped to 38 in 1972 and 41 in 1973.", "However, the wave of reactor orders then receded as dramatically as it had begun. Surging energy prices resulting from the Arab oil embargo in 1973-1974 dramatically slowed the growth of U.S. electricity demand, and it became apparent that electric utilities had ordered too much generating capacity of all types. In addition, nuclear power plant construction costs were sharply escalating, interest rates were rising, and greater safety expenditures were required after the 1979 core-melt accident at Three Mile Island 2. All reactors ordered from 1974 through 1978 were subsequently canceled, and no further reactor orders were placed in the United States until 2008, when contracts were signed for four new units now being built in Georgia and South Carolina. Most of the reactors ordered from 1971 through 1973 were also canceled, for a total of 126 cancellations.", "In addition to the cancellations, the lower-than-expected growth in electricity demand led electric utilities to slow the construction of many reactors that had not been canceled, stretching their completion into the 1980s and 1990s, and to 2016 in the case of one reactor, Watts Bar 2. Of the 256 reactor orders placed through the 1970s, 134 reactors, including the early AEC demonstration plants, ultimately were completed and placed into service.", "Throughout the history of the U.S. nuclear power program, reactors have permanently shut down for a variety of reasons. Many of the small, early AEC reactors were not necessarily expected to operate for a long time, and nine of them had been permanently closed by the late 1970s. Three Mile Island 2, a nearly new reactor, closed in 1979 after its accident. Four reactors were permanently closed during the 1980s, including the Shoreham plant on Long Island, NY, which had never begun full-power operation. During the 1990s, 10 reactors shut down, including the large, two-unit Zion plant in Illinois.", "Rising natural gas prices in the early 2000s significantly improved the economics of nuclear power, because they made gas-fired electric generation more expensive while nuclear generation costs remained comparatively low (discussed in detail later in this report). Existing reactors were no longer being closed, and the first U.S. license applications for new reactors since 1978 were filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC, the regulatory successor to the AEC) beginning in 2007. However, gas prices fell sharply after 2009 and have remained low, primarily because of strong production of domestic shale gas. Six reactors have permanently shut down since the beginning of 2013, and additional closures have been announced.", "The current economic situation has clouded the outlook for new U.S. reactors. NRC has issued construction and operating licenses to seven new reactors and is currently considering applications for seven more. However, except for the four units in Georgia and South Carolina that are now under construction, no commitments have been made to build any others.", "As shown in Table 1 , of the 134 commercial reactors that have started operating since the beginning of the U.S. nuclear power program, 35 have permanently closed, leaving 99 currently operating and 4 under construction. The 99 operating U.S. commercial power reactors are located in 30 states at 60 plant sites. Nuclear power plants annually provide about 20% of total U.S. electricity generation, most recently 19.5% in 2015. Nuclear power accounted for 61.6% of U.S. \"zero carbon\" electricity generation in 2015.", "Under the Atomic Energy Act, nuclear power reactors are licensed to operate for 40 years and are eligible for 20-year license renewals thereafter. Because about half of U.S. reactors started operating in the 1970s or earlier, the licenses of much of the reactor fleet would have expired by now without renewal. As of July 2016, according to NRC, 80 of the 99 currently operating reactors have received 20-year license renewals, and 12 additional renewal applications are under review. The 20-year renewals, allowing 60 years of operation, would extend the licenses of most current reactors through the 2030s and of almost all the remainder through the 2040s. Further 20-year renewals are also possible under the AEA, extending plant lives to 80 years or longer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actual, Planned, and Possible Reactor Closures", "paragraphs": ["After experiencing no commercial reactor closures during the first decade of the 21 st century, the U.S. nuclear power industry has seen six reactors retire during the past five years, with at least 19 more considered to be at risk of closure by their owners or major credit rating agencies (see Table 2 ). However, New York and Illinois have recently taken action to keep seven of the at-risk reactors operating.", "These actual, announced, and potential nuclear plant shutdowns fall into several broad and sometimes overlapping categories. The fundamental problem for most of the at-risk plants is that their revenues depend almost entirely on regional wholesale electricity markets, where prices have been insufficient to cover their costs. Some plants, such as Quad Cities, have relatively low operating and maintenance costs, but still cannot bring in sufficient revenue in their regional markets, because of a combination of oversupply, transmission congestion, and other local factors. Several single-unit nuclear plants, which generally have higher costs per megawatt-hour, are having trouble competing even in markets with relatively high power prices. For example, the Pilgrim plant in the New England market is reportedly receiving revenues that are insufficient to cover fuel, operating and maintenance, and capital expenditures, as discussed below.", "The chronic inability to cover costs during routine operations is not the only source of nuclear plant retirement risk: Marginally economic plants can be vulnerable to closure because of major repairs, capital expenditures, prolonged shutdowns, and other non-routine events. Merchant plants may be especially vulnerable, but such occurrences can even prompt the retirement of rate-regulated plants, as seen at San Onofre and Crystal River.

An industry consultant commented after the announcement, \"This might be the beginning of a new wave of shutdowns.\" Kewaunee closed in May 2013.", "Duke Energy decided on February 5, 2013, to retire the Crystal River 3 reactor in Florida. Crystal River's previous owner, Progress Energy, had severely damaged the reactor's massive concrete containment structure while attempting to replace the plant's steam generators. Duke Energy, which acquired Crystal River in 2012, said it decided to close the plant because of unacceptable uncertainty about the scope, cost, and duration of repairing or replacing the damaged containment structure.", "About two-thirds of U.S. nuclear power plants use steam generators to transfer heat from reactor cooling water to a secondary piping loop in which hot water is converted to steam to drive the turbine generators that produce electricity. Most steam generators have required replacement after 20-30 years of service, a capital expenditure of several hundred million dollars per reactor. Steam generators are such large components that temporary holes must be cut in the reactor containment to remove the old ones and bring in new ones.", "Some nuclear plants have been closed and decommissioned to avoid the cost of steam generator replacement, such as Oregon's Trojan reactor in 1992. However, most nuclear plant owners have opted to replace the steam generators when necessary, and these projects, while requiring complex planning and execution, have become fairly routine in the nuclear power industry. No other steam generator replacement project caused containment damage similar to that suffered by Crystal River 3. Nevertheless, unrelated problems with another steam generator replacement project, at California's San Onofre station, also led to that plant's permanent shutdown just a month after Crystal River 3. Southern California Edison (SCE), the plant's owner, replaced the steam generators in units 2 and 3 in 2010 and 2011, respectively (unit 1 had been retired previously). One of the new steam generators experienced internal leakage about a year later; inspections showed vibration-related damage to all the new steam generators, later attributed by SCE to design flaws. After considering options to repair or replace the damaged steam generators, SCE announced in June 2013 that it would retire San Onofre 2 and 3. The company cited uncertainty about whether and when the units would be allowed to restart at lower power by NRC, pending steam generator replacement or repair, as a major factor in the shutdown decision. Other considerations were the projected price of replacement power while repairs were being implemented and uncertainty about renewal of the two reactors' operating licenses in 2022, according to SCE.", "The Vermont Yankee plant was permanently closed in December 2014 because, according to plant owner Entergy, low power prices in New England were causing chronic losses. The single-reactor plant had received a 20-year license renewal from NRC in 2011, despite vigorous opposition from the state of Vermont that focused on leaks of radioactive tritium. The license renewal allowed the plant to operate until 2032, but Entergy decided two years later to begin decommissioning the unit at the end of 2014. The company cited competition from shale gas-fired generation, the relatively high cost of operating a single-unit nuclear plant, and \"artificially low energy and capacity prices in the region.\"", "Another single-unit nuclear plant, Fort Calhoun in Nebraska, was the most recent U.S. reactor to permanently close, on October 24, 2016. Fort Calhoun had been the smallest operating power reactor in the United States. Because it was owned by the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD), which sets its own rates, the nuclear plant had not been directly subject to the relatively low power prices in the region. However, OPPD determined that it could save up to $994 million for its customers over the next 20 years by closing Fort Calhoun and purchasing low-cost replacement power in the wholesale market. \"The economic analysis clearly shows that continued operation of Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station is not financially sustainable,\" according to OPPD's chief executive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Announced Retirements and Potential Shutdowns", "paragraphs": ["Ten operating reactors are currently facing permanent shutdown dates imposed by their owners or reached through negotiated agreements, as listed in the \"announced shutdowns\" section of Table 2 ."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FitzPatrick and Ginna", "paragraphs": ["Facing the most imminent closure on this list are two single-unit New York plants, FitzPatrick, owned by Entergy, and Ginna, owned by Exelon.

Once expected demand levels and price bids for this time period (e.g., hourly) are determined, the price at which demand and supply intersect, when taking into account SCED considerations, is referred to as the \"market clearing price.\" This is the price received by all generators that offered electricity at a price equal to or below the market clearing price level. As an example, a nuclear plant might offer to sell a certain volume of electricity at $7 per MWh (approximate value for fuel costs) and a wind generator may offer electricity for $0 per MWh. However, if the clearing price is $40 per MWh (because the marginal generator submitted a $40 per MWh offer) then the nuclear plant and wind generator will be dispatched (i.e., ordered to run) and both will receive $40 per MWh for electricity provided during this time interval. Figure 2 provides a hypothetical illustration of how wholesale electricity prices are generally determined.", "Nuclear power being offered at less than the market clearing price does not necessarily mean that it is profitable. Merchant nuclear plants are generally viewed as \"price takers\" in a wholesale power market since the plants generally prefer to operate on a continuous basis, regardless of the market price. However, indications are that some nuclear generators may start following demand load patterns in order to improve electricity sales revenues in some locations. Typically, merchant nuclear plants want to offer prices low enough to clear the market and will participate in the competitive power markets in a way that ensures market clearance and dispatch. As a result, nuclear plant profitability is generally a function of the market clearing price level that is set by price-setting units.", "In practice, price formation in wholesale power markets can be quite complex, with the RTO/ISO having to manage various system constraints (e.g., transmission, scarcity, reliability) that can challenge the simple application of supply and demand curves. Nevertheless, supply and demand fundamentals are the underlying premise by which wholesale electricity prices are determined.", "Generally, price offers are a function of the fuel cost needed to generate a unit of electricity, and do not include capital costs. The fuel cost for wind is zero and, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the fuel cost for nuclear was approximately $7 per MWh in 2015. Also, nuclear generators\u2014because plants generally prefer to operate on a consistent and near-continuous basis\u2014will offer power at low prices. Wind generators\u2014because many projects receive out-of-market revenue/value sources (e.g., power purchase agreements, tax credits, renewable energy credits)\u2014also want to clear the market and may be motivated to submit zero or even negative price offers, if allowed by the respective RTO, to ensure that they clear and are dispatched (for more information see text box below titled Wind Power and Negative Electricity Prices: What Is the Relationship? ). Coal and natural gas generators, on the other hand, will typically offer electricity prices that are a function of fuel acquisition costs, which can vary based on benchmark fuel prices, the location at which the generator purchases the fuel, and the conversion efficiency (heat rate) of the power plant. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Natural Gas and Coal Impact Wholesale Electricity Prices", "paragraphs": ["Natural gas and coal play an important price-setting role in competitive power markets. For the purpose of this discussion, focus is placed on the role of natural gas and how the price of this fuel can affect the wholesale price of electricity paid to generators. Natural gas affects wholesale electricity prices in two primary ways. First, because natural gas power generators are generally able to follow demand/load patterns and can be dispatched with relative ease, they often set prices during peak demand hours\u2014when electricity demand and prices are typically the highest each day. Second, natural gas power generation is a primary price-setting fuel for wholesale electricity prices in competitive power markets. Table 3 indicates the percentage of time intervals that various fuels set the real-time price in three different RTOs during different years. ", "Data contained in Table 3 suggest that natural gas is a primary price-setting fuel within the three RTOs included in the table. The price-setting contribution of natural gas in MISO and PJM has increased over the respective periods included in the table. While the ERCOT price-setting information suggests that natural gas may have declined in terms of its price-setting role within that RTO, the Market Monitor report indicates that the 34% real-time energy price decline observed in this market from 2014 to 2015 was \"primarily driven by lower natural gas prices.\" ", "Commodity fuel prices for natural gas and coal generally have the largest impact on wholesale electricity prices. With natural gas increasing its price-setting role in some competitive markets, a general analysis of fuel costs for natural gas-derived electricity provides an indication about the downward pressure natural gas has exerted on wholesale electricity prices, and therefore revenue for electric power generators. See Figure 3 .", "The fuel cost range for generating electricity from natural gas has declined since peaking in 2008, while the ATC (fuel, operations and maintenance, and capital) for nuclear power generation has increased, relative to 2008 levels. As discussed above, lower natural gas costs generally translate into lower wholesale power prices. The combination of rising nuclear generation costs and declining natural gas prices is contributing to the financial challenges encountered by nuclear power plants in competitive power markets. Natural gas fuel costs per MWh ranges in Figure 3 reflect U.S.-wide averages, and it should be noted that each individual nuclear plant will be subject to a unique set of market and location-based price variables that can impact revenue from electricity sales. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Locational Marginal Prices", "paragraphs": ["In competitive power markets, there is not a single wholesale electricity price paid to all electricity generators operating in an RTO region. Rather, electricity revenues received by generators are a function of locational marginal prices (LMPs), which vary within each RTO. LMPs generally include three primary price components: (1) energy, (2) transmission congestion, and (3) energy losses. LMPs can be affected by market variables such as fuel prices, generation mix, and transmission constraints at a specific location. In some locations, the presence of renewable electricity generation from wind and solar projects can affect LMPs and in some instances can cause real-time LMPs to drop below zero for limited periods of time. (See text box below: Wind Power and Negative Electricity Prices: What I s the Relationship ? )", "As discussed above, the cost of fuel (i.e., natural gas and coal) affects clearing prices, and fuel costs can also vary by location. For example, due to potential transportation cost and infrastructure limitations, the price of natural gas paid by a power generator in Pennsylvania might be different from that paid by a generator in New York. All else being equal, the electricity market clearing price at these respective locations might also be different. Figure 4 shows the range of LMPs for nuclear power plants operating in competitive power markets along with average total costs for nuclear power generation.", "LMP and ATC projected estimates for calendar year 2016 indicate that the entire expected electricity price range for nuclear power plants in competitive markets may be less than the ATC of nuclear electricity generation.

Figure 5 provides average all-in electricity prices for various RTO/ISO markets by revenue source.", "The largest source of non-energy revenue in some competitive power markets is in the form of capacity payments. To ensure resource adequacy, most RTO/ISOs have developed and evolved capacity markets that provide an economic signal that would provide incentives for adequate generation for peak power demands and to ensure that generation resources are available to satisfy future demand. Depending on the RTO, capacity payments can be made through either a bilateral contract between a load serving entity (LSE) and a generator or through participation in a capacity auction that is organized and administered by the RTO/ISO. However, not all RTO/ISOs have a capacity market (e.g., ERCOT does not have a capacity market and uses scarcity pricing as an incentive for motivating new generation sources). For those that do, each has a unique market design that determines the value of and time frame for capacity payments. As indicated in Figure 5 , capacity payments can vary by RTO, and some RTOs have changed their capacity market designs in such a way that may benefit nuclear power generators. Additionally, power plant location can impact the value of capacity payments received by nuclear and other power generators. For example, PJM's 2019/2020 Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) capacity market resulted in clearing prices that ranged from $100 per MW-day to $202 per MW-day across different zones. RPM and similar forward capacity markets guarantee payments for new capacity that performs as projected.

However, an industry source suggests that at least six nuclear plants have PPAs for either all or a portion of their generating capacity.

On June 2, 2016, Quad Cities owner-and-operator Exelon announced that it was moving forward to shut down and retire the plant before the end of its operating license. Available price information, capacity payments, and production costs (fuel, operations and maintenance) make it apparent that the Quad Cities power plant is under a degree of financial stress.

Current electricity price projections and capacity auction results indicate that electricity sales will not be large enough to pay for production costs, although capacity payments in 2017 may provide supplemental revenue that cover production costs. The Quad Cities plant did not clear the 2018/2019 or 2019/2020 capacity auctions; therefore the plant is not eligible to receive capacity payments during those years. Faced with low electricity price projections and revenues that are expected to be less than fuel and O&M costs, not to mention any capital expenditures, Exelon management decided that it is in the financial best interest of the company to shut down the power plant.

However, opponents contend that nuclear power suffers from too many drawbacks (such as accident risk and waste management problems) and that federal incentives should focus instead on renewable energy and efficiency. Furthermore, federal financial incentives for existing nuclear power would likely be opposed by owners of other generating assets that could potentially benefit financially as a result of early nuclear plant retirements. Nevertheless, if federal support for nuclear power were pursued, Congress would have a variety of options to consider, each with its own set of policy questions.", "One challenge associated with federal-level nuclear incentives is that financial conditions across the entire fleet are not uniform.

A carbon price policy could take many forms, including a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade approach, or an environmental regulatory approach such as the Clean Power Plan (CPP). A carbon tax would place a value on carbon emissions that, all else being equal, would increase the cost of producing electricity from carbon emitting fuels. To the extent that such costs are included in marginal-unit price offers from coal and natural gas generators, a carbon tax could effectively increase wholesale market clearing prices that determine electricity sales revenue for existing nuclear power plants.

A CPP rate-based standard (metric tons of carbon per megawatt-hour of electricity generation) does not include existing nuclear in the calculation of megawatt-hours. Therefore, if an existing nuclear plant closes, there will be no change in a state's carbon emissions rate under the rate-based approach. Under the rate-based standard, replacement of an existing nuclear plant with a gas-fired plant could reduce a state's calculated emissions rate, if the emissions rate from the new gas-fired capacity were lower than the state average.", "By comparison, states using a mass-based approach would likely have a stronger incentive to maintain existing nuclear power.
