A major focus was examining and responding to the Trump Administration's evolving trade policy. U.S. trade policy under President Trump to date arguably represents a significant shift from recent past Administrations under both Republicans and Democrats. In particular, the Administration has displayed a more critical view of U.S. trade agreements, made greater use of various U.S. trade laws with the potential to restrict U.S. imports, and placed increased emphasis on bilateral trade balances as a key metric of the health of U.S. trading relationships. Another major issue before Congress involved growing interest in whether and in what ways the U.S. process for determining the national and economic security implications of foreign investment in the United States should be reformed. Continued focus on the U.S.-China economic relationship, and economic sanctions against Iran, Cuba, North Korea, Russia, and other countries also have been of interest to Congress. ", "President Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement (FTA) among 12 Asia-Pacific nations, alongside a stated preference for negotiating bilateral rather than multi-party trade agreements were notable developments in the Trump Administration's policy approach to U.S. trade agreements. Also significant are Administration initiatives to potentially revise the two largest existing U.S. FTAs, through the ongoing renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and modification talks regarding the U.S.-South Korea (KORUS) FTA. These decisions, in addition to the evolving global landscape on trade agreements, including a recently-concluded, revised TPP (now called the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP)) among the 11 parties, without the United States, raise potentially significant legislative and policy issues for Congress, including: (1) potential congressional consideration of legislation to implement a revised NAFTA, (2) the economic and strategic rationale for U.S. participation in multi-party and other FTAs, (3) the extent to which past U.S. FTAs should be modernized or revised and, if so, in what manner, (4) how much priority should be placed in U.S. trade policy on new FTA and multilateral trade agreements, and (5) the effect of FTAs not including the United States on U.S. economic and broader interests, and the appropriate U.S. response to the proliferation of agreements.", "Another major issue is the role of the United States in the multilateral, rules-based trading system under the World Trade Organization (WTO), historically led by the United States. The WTO has served as the foundation of the international trading system and WTO agreements serve as the floor of commitments in U.S. FTAs, but the institution has languished for decades in terms of achieving new multilateral trade disciplines and liberalization in important areas, such as digital trade. President Trump may formally request and justify to Congress an extension of current U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) until 2021, to provide authority for expedited consideration of future trade agreements if they meet specific conditions and criteria. This process would present Congress a significant opportunity to examine the U.S. role in the WTO and current and future trade agreement negotiations, particularly in how they meet TPA's congressionally-mandated U.S. trade negotiating objectives. ", "The United States under the Trump Administration has renewed the use of specific trade laws that have not been used in several years, such as Section 232, designed to investigate the national security impact of specific imports. It has also placed greater emphasis on \"fair\" and \"reciprocal\" trade. For example, with respect to China, a Section 301 case was launched involving China's policies on intellectual property rights and forced technology transfer, among other measures. China continues to be viewed as a growing main competitor of the United States in the global economy, as recognized in the recently-released U.S. National Security Strategy. ", "The policy implications for Congress of potential action under various trade investigations may depend on a number factors such as: how firms, industries and workers are affected by measures, such as increased tariffs, that may be taken; what other countries' reactions may be (such as possible retaliation); and how future actions are in line with core U.S. commitments and obligations under the WTO and other trade agreements. The U.S.-China trade and economic relationship is complex and wide-ranging. It will likely entail continued close examination by Congress in terms of current and future policy issues. In addition to specific trade practices of concern, Congress may undertake closer scrutiny of the economic and geopolitical implications of China's sizable Belt and Road Initiative to finance and develop infrastructure across multiple countries and regions, as well as the proliferation of China's industrial policies in high technology industries that may challenge U.S. firms and potentially disrupt global markets if fully implemented. ", "International trade and finance issues have been important to Congress because they can affect the overall health of the U.S. economy and specific sectors, the success of U.S. businesses and workers, and Americans' standard of living. They also have implications for U.S. geopolitical interests. Conversely, geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can have major impacts on international trade and finance. These issues are complex and at times controversial, and developments in the global economy often make policy deliberation more challenging, because they involve balancing many competing interests. ", "Congress is in a unique position to address these and other issues, particularly given its constitutional authority for legislating and overseeing international trade and financial policy. This report provides a brief overview of select trade and finance issues that may be of interest to the 115 th Congress."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The United States in the Global Economy", "paragraphs": ["Since the end of World War II, the United States has served as the chief architect of an open and rules-based international economic order that has been characterized by trade expansion and growing economic integration. Some see this global economic order fragmenting and becoming less governable. The U.S. leadership role is being challenged both from abroad by rising economic powers such as China and from within the United States by groups that have been adversely affected by U.S. integration in the global economy. ", "Overall, the global economy in 2017 began to display signs of a synchronized recovery among major economies from the 2008-2009 financial crisis and deep economic recession. Similarly, international financial markets improved and are expected to continue growing, despite recent signs of increased volatility. Nevertheless, uncertainty over the direction of monetary policy among major central banks, some concerns about rates of inflation, slower growth in real wages and productivity, and demographic challenges are among the issues that could restrain the recovery. ", "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that global real annual GDP growth increased by 3.7% in 2017, and will increase by 3.9% in 2018, up slightly from previous estimates. This forecast is based on the U.S. economy growing at a rate of 2.7%, as a result of a return to a more normal monetary policy stance and a temporary boost arising from the macroeconomic impact of tax reform and cuts. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that the rate of U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2.6%, compared to an annualized rate of 3.2% in the third quarter. Of broader potential significance is the movement of the dollar against other major currencies. Since the start of 2017, the dollar has depreciated 9% against other major currencies, following a large appreciation over the previous three years. Depreciation in the value of the dollar generally makes imports more expensive reducing the purchasing power of U.S. consumers, and may worsen the U.S. trade deficit in the short term depending on the price sensitivity of import consumption. However, a weaker dollar also generally makes U.S. exports more competitive.", "The IMF forecasts that developed economies as a group will grow at 2.3% in 2018. Although the economic recovery in the EU is progressing, the growth rate is projected to remain low in comparison with other economic recoveries, reflecting high levels of corporate debt and non-performing loans that are restraining business investment. Emerging market and developing economies are projected by the IMF to grow by 4.9%, up from 4.7% in 2017, while China's economy is projected to grow at 6.6% in 2018, down slightly from the 6.8% rate experienced in 2017. Commodity exporters are projected to experience a stronger rate of economic growth as a result of a partial recovery in commodity prices, which also would support a higher rate of growth in global trade volumes. Increased global manufacturing activity and investment in infrastructure and equipment are also projected to support higher levels of global trade.", "Despite these positive signs, the World Economic Forum (WEF) notes a number of risks that could limit the strength and pace of the projected recovery and rate of global economic growth. These risks include: cybersecurity risks in both the private and government sectors; economic risks, including rising trade protectionism; environmental risks; and geopolitical risks (such as conflict over North Korean nuclear development). Other risks include savings and investment relative to GDP, which serve as building blocks for future growth, but continue to lag behind pre-financial 2008 crisis levels in the advanced economies. Similarly, global trade is growing, but lags behind historical levels. ", "Emerging markets (EMs) as a group are expected to face fewer risks to sustainable rates of economic growth in 2018 due to a modest recovery in global trade and more stable exchange rates, inflation, commodity prices, and equity markets. Growth rates are projected to recover somewhat in Russia and Brazil, due to more stable oil and commodity prices, but increased uncertainty over political and policy direction could constrain the rate of growth in Brazil. Additionally, China is expected to experience slower growth rates as it attempts to navigate toward a more sustainable growth model that is more focused on boosting innovation and private consumption, rather than fixed investment and exporting, as sources of economic growth. In Venezuela, a major economic and financial crisis has surfaced that could cause the economy to continue to contract. The IMF projects that continued social turmoil in Venezuela will cause economic activity to fall by 15% in 2018. These and other developments, such as ongoing tension and concern over North Korea's nuclear arms policies, contribute to uncertainties that potentially could impact global markets. ", "Over the long term, developed and developing economies are struggling to find the right policy mix to address low growth, low inflation, and low levels of productivity growth, referred to as structural stagnation by some. Developed and some developing economies are experiencing declining or flat birth rates, which portend a smaller work force in the future and lower potential rates of economic growth. Aging work forces, a demographic unfolding everywhere except Africa and the Middle East, may also restrain economic growth. Under similar challenging conditions, nations in the past have turned to broad, multinational trade liberalization agreements to stimulate economic growth through improvements in productivity by removing market-distorting barriers.", "The United States accounts for approximately a quarter of global gross domestic product (GDP) in nominal U.S. dollars and 9.1% of global trade ( Figure 1 ). Although still recovering from the worst recession in eight decades, overall U.S. economic conditions have improved with the unemployment rate at 4.1% in December 2017 from a high of 10% in 2009. The stabilization in oil prices is affecting the U.S. economy. Relatively low energy prices are expected to raise consumers' real incomes, improve the competitive position of some industries, and stabilize employment and output in the energy sector. ", "With improvements in the economy as a whole, average U.S. real household incomes are slowly recovering from the 2008-2010 economic recession. The United States, similar to other economies, has experienced widening disparity in incomes that many view as fueling domestically-focused political movements and a backlash against globalization. The Trump Administration achieved a major goal by lowering corporate tax rates, a move that is projected to stimulate the economy. The Administration has indicated that it is also turning to infrastructure spending. It has also made reducing U.S. bilateral trade deficits a priority issue, as the U.S. trade deficit in 2017 reached its highest level since 2008. However, using a broader measure, the current account (which includes the trade balance, as well as unilateral transfers and income on overseas investments), the U.S. deficit has fallen significantly since its peak in 2006, as have the surpluses in China and Japan.", "For many economists, an improving outlook for global trade and the potential role for the United States in supporting global growth as a major importer and overseas investor may overshadow potential concerns over global imbalances. The Euro and Japanese yen have experienced periods of volatility since the Brexit referendum vote during the summer of 2016. Policy actions by the Bank of England have led to a slight appreciation in the pound through early 2018. Renewed capital flows to developing economies have sustained a slight appreciation in some currencies, including the Chinese renminbi and the South African rand. In addition, the Mexican peso continued to depreciate in international foreign markets, reflecting uncertainties over the potential impact of a renegotiation of NAFTA. Stronger economic performance and still low interest rates and low rates of price inflation have provided impetus for the U.S. Federal Reserve to strengthen monetary policy by raising interest rates in small steps. In addition, other major economies in Europe and Japan have attempted to pursue more expansionary monetary policies. Reduced levels of uncertainty in global financial markets have reduced upward pressure on the dollar, as investors have been less prone to seek safe haven currencies and dollar-denominated investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Role of Congress in International Trade and Finance", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Constitution assigns authority over foreign trade to Congress. Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations\" and to \"lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.\" For roughly the first 150 years of the United States, Congress exercised its power to regulate foreign trade by setting tariff rates on all imported products. Congressional trade debates in the 19th century often pitted Members from northern manufacturing regions, who benefitted from high tariffs, against those from largely southern raw material exporting regions, who gained from and advocated for low tariffs. ", "A major shift in U.S. trade policy occurred after Congress passed the highly protective \"Smoot-Hawley\" Tariff Act of 1930, which significantly raised U.S. tariff levels and led U.S. trading partners to respond in kind. As a result, world trade declined rapidly, exacerbating the impact of the Great Depression. Since the passage of the Tariff Act of 1930, Congress has delegated certain trade authority to the executive branch. First, Congress enacted the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, which authorized the President to enter into reciprocal agreements to reduce tariffs within congressionally pre-approved levels, and to implement the new tariffs by proclamation without additional legislation. Congress renewed this authority periodically until the 1960s. Subsequently, Congress enacted the Trade Act of 1974, aimed at opening markets and establishing nondiscriminatory international trade norms for nontariff barriers as well. Because changes in nontariff barriers in reciprocal bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements may involve amending U.S. law, the agreements require congressional approval and implementing legislation. Congress has renewed or amended the 1974 Act five times, which includes granting \"fast-track\" trade negotiating authority. Since 2002, \"fast track\" has been known as trade promotion authority (TPA). In 2015, Congress authorized new TPA, through 2021, provided the President requests an extension and Congress does not enact an extension disapproval resolution before July 1, 2018.", "Congress also exercises trade policy authority through the enactment of laws authorizing trade programs and measures to address unfair and other trade practices. It also conducts oversight of the implementation of trade policies, programs, and agreements. These include such areas as U.S. trade agreement negotiations, tariffs and nontariff barriers, trade remedy laws, import and export policies, economic sanctions, and the trade policy functions of the federal government. ", "Additionally, Congress has an important role in international investment and finance policy. It has authority over bilateral investment treaties (BITs) through Senate ratification, and the level of U.S. financial commitments to the multilateral development banks (MDBs), including the World Bank, and to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It also authorizes the activities of various agencies, such as the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im Bank) and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). Congress also has oversight responsibilities over these institutions, as well as the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury, whose activities affect international capital flows and short-term movements in the international exchange value of the dollar.

", "The WTO's future as an effective multilateral trade negotiating organization for broad-based trade liberalization remains in question. The current deadlock in major on-going negotiations is largely due to differences between leading emerging-market economies, such as India, China and Brazil, developing economies, and advanced countries. Most developing countries want to continue to link the broad spectrum of agricultural and non-agricultural issues under the Doha Round and have been reluctant to lower their tariffs on industrial goods. They maintain that unless all issues are addressed in a single package, issues important to developing countries will be ignored. Conversely, developed economies have pushed for change in the negotiating dynamics, arguing that the WTO needs to address new issues, such as e-commerce and digital trade, especially given the growth of major emerging markets, and that advanced developing countries should make commercially meaningful new commitments on market access to their markets. WTO members have been working to achieve consensus on future work plans, but were unable to announce major deliverables or negotiated outcomes at the 11 th Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina in December 2017.

This enables the government to provide low-cost financing to Chinese firms, especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs) which dominate several economic sectors in China. Fortune's 2016 Global 500 list of the world's largest companies included 103 Chinese firms, 75 of which were classified as being 50% or more owned by the Chinese government. At the microeconomic level, the Chinese government (at the central and local government level) seeks to promote the development of industries deemed critical to the country's future economic development by using various means, such as subsidies, preferential loans, tax exemptions, and access to low-cost land and energy. Many analysts contend that such distortionary policies contribute to overcapacity in several Chinese industrial sectors, such as steel and aluminum. Additionally, the Chinese government imposes numerous restrictions on foreign firms seeking to do business in China, such as discriminatory regulations and standards, uneven enforcement of commercial laws (such as its anti-monopoly laws), FDI barriers and mandates, export restrictions on raw materials, technology transfer requirements imposed on foreign firms, and public procurement rules that give preferences to domestic Chinese firms.
