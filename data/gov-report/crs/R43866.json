It is also responsible for managing spectrum use by federal agencies.", "Title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-96), also known as the Spectrum Act, gives the NTIA responsibilities for improving public safety communications. The act required NTIA to assist with the development of the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), created by Congress to deploy a nationwide public safety broadband network. NTIA is also required to assist in planning and funding for Next Generation 9-1-1 (NG 9-1-1) services, which refers to the transition to digital, Internet-based systems to replace existing analog systems that are currently prevalent throughout the United States. The Spectrum Act also gave the NTIA new responsibilities and requirements for spectrum management, especially regarding the reallocation of federal spectrum. The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74, Title X) added further requirements for actions by the NTIA, including identification of additional spectrum for nonfederal use.", "The NTIA also plays a central role in representing U.S. interests in the Internet internationally, including an active role in the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

This increase was largely attributed by the NTIA to its responsibilities in administering grants for broadband network deployment, as required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5). Enacted amounts remained above $40 million until FY2015.The Obama Administration's budget request for FY2015 was $51.0 million, and the enacted amount was $38.2 million.
