{"id": "RS20088", "title": "Dispute Settlement in the World Trade Organization (WTO): An Overview", "released_date": "2012-11-26T00:00:00", "summary": ["The World Trade Organization (WTO) Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) provides a means for WTO Members to resolve disputes arising under WTO agreements. WTO Members must first attempt to settle their dispute through consultations, but if these fail the Member initiating the dispute may request that a panel examine and report on its complaint. The DSU provides for Appellate Body (AB) review of panel reports, panels to determine if a defending Member has complied with an adverse WTO decision by the established deadline in a case, and possible retaliation if the defending Member has failed to do so. Automatic establishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports, and authorization of a Member's request to retaliate, along with deadlines and improved multilateral oversight of compliance, are aimed at producing a more expeditious and effective system than had existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To date, 450 complaints have been filed under the DSU, with nearly one-half involving the United States as a complainant or defendant. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) represents the United States in WTO disputes.", "Use of the DSU has revealed procedural gaps, particularly in the compliance phase of a dispute. These include a failure to coordinate DSU procedures for requesting retaliation with procedures for requesting a compliance panel and the absence of a specific procedure aimed at the removal of trade sanctions in the event the defending Member believes it has fulfilled its WTO obligations in a case. To overcome these gaps, disputing Members have entered into bilateral agreements permitting retaliation and compliance panel procedures to advance in sequence and have initiated new dispute proceedings seeking the removal of retaliatory measures believed to have outlived their legal foundation. Expressing dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement results involving U.S. trade remedies, Congress, in the Trade Act of 2002, directed the executive branch to address dispute settlement in WTO negotiations. WTO Members have been negotiating DSU revisions in the currently stalled Doha Development Round.", "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a mechanism for the USTR, either by petition of an \"interested party\" or on its own accord, to address restrictive foreign trade practices through the initiation of a WTO dispute and authorizes the USTR to take retaliatory action in the event the defending WTO Member has not complied with the resulting WTO decision. While the European Union challenged Section 301 in the WTO on the ground that it requires the USTR to act unilaterally in WTO-related disputes in violation of DSU requirements, the United States was ultimately found to be in compliance with its DSU obligations. Where a U.S. law or regulation is at issue in a WTO case, the WTO's adoption of a panel and, if appealed, AB report finding that the U.S. measure violates a WTO agreement does not give the WTO decision direct legal effect in this country. Thus, federal law is not affected until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to remove the offending measure.", "S. 239 (Klobuchar), the Innovate America Act, would, inter alia, authorize to be appropriated to the USTR $2 million for each of FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 for the purpose of initiating any proceeding to resolve a dispute relating to market access barriers with WTO member countries. S. 708 (Brown, Ohio) would establish mechanisms under the Trade Act of 1974 to require the USTR annually to identify particularly harmful foreign trade practices and, where appropriate, to initiate WTO dispute settlement proceedings to remedy these practices."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["From its inception in 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed by the United States and ultimately by a total of 128 countries, provided for consultations and dispute resolution between GATT parties. A party could invoke Articles XXII and XXIII, the GATT consultation and dispute settlement provisions, if it believed that another party's measure, whether violative of the GATT or not, nullified or impaired benefits accruing to it under the agreement. Because the GATT did not set out specific dispute procedures, GATT Parties developed a more detailed process including ad hoc panels and other practices. Over time, however, the GATT procedure was perceived to have certain deficiencies, among them a lack of deadlines, a consensus decision-making process that allowed a GATT party against whom a dispute was filed to block the establishment of a dispute panel and the adoption of a panel report by the GATT Parties as a whole, and laxity in surveillance and implementation of panel reports even when reports were adopted and had the status of an official GATT decision.", "Congress made reform of the GATT dispute process a principal U.S. negotiating objective in the GATT Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, begun in 1986 and concluded in 1994 with the signing of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement). The resulting WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (Dispute Settlement Understanding, or DSU) reflects the U.S. negotiating objective of creating a mechanism that is more judicial in approach (and, it was hoped, fairer and more predictable) than the diplomatically oriented system favored by other trading partners. While the DSU retains diplomatic elements\u2014for example, the goal of the process is to secure a \"mutually agreed solution\" and contains provisions that may foster a negotiated outcome\u2014the DSU sets out a mechanism that is overall more \"rule-bound\" than the process developed under the GATT. ", "Further, the DSU applies to disputes arising under virtually all WTO agreements (referred to in the Understanding as \"covered agreements\") and thus exists in the context of the full Uruguay Round package of multilateral trade agreements, all of which must be accepted by a country as a condition of WTO membership. The Uruguay Round package not only carried forward original GATT obligations\u2014for example, according goods of other parties most-favored-nation (MFN) and national treatment, not placing tariffs on goods in excess of negotiated or \"bound\" rates, generally refraining from imposing quantitative restrictions such as quotas and embargoes on imports and exports, and avoiding injurious subsidies \u2014but also expanded on these obligations in new agreements such as the Agreement on Agriculture, the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the Agreement on Antidumping, the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The application of the DSU to these new agreements thus created the potential not only for trade disputes on matters that had not been subject to adjudication in the past, but also for adjudication of these disputes under a more judicially styled process than had existed in the past. ", "Congress approved and implemented the WTO Agreement and the other agreements negotiated in the Uruguay Round in Section 101 of the Uruguay Round Agreement Act. The agreements entered into force on January 1, 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding", "paragraphs": ["While the DSU continues past GATT dispute practice, a variety of new features are aimed at strengthening the prior system. These include a \"reverse consensus\" voting rule at key points in the process, legal review of panel reports by a new Appellate Body, deadlines for various phases of the dispute procedure, and improved multilateral oversight of compliance. Under the integrated system of dispute settlement created by the DSU, the same dispute settlement rules apply to disputes under virtually all WTO agreements, subject to any special or additional rules in an individual agreement.", "The WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB), created in Article 2 of the DSU and consisting of representatives of all WTO Members, administers WTO dispute settlement proceedings. As was the case under the GATT, the DSB ordinarily operates by consensus (i.e., without objection). The DSU reverses past practice, however, in a manner that prevents individual Members from blocking certain DSB decisions that are considered critical to an effective dispute settlement system. Thus, unless it decides by consensus not to do so, the DSB will (1) approve requests to establish panels, (2) adopt panel and Appellate Body reports, and (3) if requested by the prevailing Member in a dispute, authorize the Member to impose a retaliatory measure where the defending Member has not complied. In effect, these decisions are virtually automatic.", "Given that panel reports would otherwise be adopted under the reverse consensus rule, WTO Members have a right to appeal a panel report on legal issues. The DSU creates a standing Appellate Body to carry out this added appellate function. The Appellate Body has seven members, three of whom serve on any one case.", "Notwithstanding the rule-oriented nature of the DSU, dispute settlement in the WTO is primarily Member-driven. In other words, it is up to the disputing Members (complaining or defending, as the case may be) to decide whether or not to take particular actions available to them. These actions include initiating the dispute; requesting a panel and, in doing so, setting out the scope of dispute; asking the WTO Director-General (DG) to appoint panelists if the disputing Members cannot agree on the WTO Secretariat's proposed slate; seeking authorization to impose countermeasures against a non-complying Member; requesting that the prevailing Member's retaliation proposal be arbitrated; and imposing retaliatory measures even if the DSB has authorized them. As stated in Article 3.7 of the DSU, the preferred outcome of a dispute is \"a solution mutually acceptable to the parties and consistent with the covered agreements.\" Absent this, the primary objective of the process is withdrawal of a violative measure, with compensation and retaliation being avenues of last resort.", "As of the date of this report, 450 complaints have been filed under the DSU. Not all of these have resulted in panels, however, and in some cases where panel proceedings were initiated, the panel process was discontinued due to a settlement of the dispute or for other reasons. To date, 153 original panel reports have been publicly circulated. Some original panels have also issued compliance panel reports as a result of proceedings initiated by complaining Members under Article 21.5 of the DSU to determine whether defending Members had complied in particular disputes; 29 compliance panel reports have been issued thus far. Well over one-half of all panel reports have been appealed, resulting in 108 Appellate Body reports issued as of this writing.", "Nearly one-half of the 450 WTO complaints filed to date involve the United States as complaining party or defendant. The United States Trade Representative (USTR) manages U.S. participation and is the chief representative of the United States in the WTO, including in WTO disputes.", "The DSU was scrutinized by WTO Members under a Uruguay Round Declaration, which called for completion of a review within four years after the WTO Agreement entered into force (i.e., by January 1999). Members did not agree on any revisions in the initial review and continued to negotiate on dispute settlement issues during the WTO Doha Development Round of multilateral trade negotiations initiated in 2001, doing so on a separate track permitting an agreement to be adopted apart from any overall Doha Round accord. In 2008, the chairman of the dispute settlement negotiations prepared a consolidated draft legal text based mainly on Member proposals, which Members agreed to use in their negotiations; in April and September 2011, the chairman issued reports summarizing subsequent discussions. Although the Doha Round negotiations have stalled, discussions of revisions to the DSU have continued into 2012.", "The United States has proposed such revisions as greater Member control over the process, guidelines for WTO adjudicative bodies, and increased transparency\u2014for example, open meetings and timely access to submissions and final reports. Other Member proposals include, inter alia, a permanent roster of panelists, enabling the Appellate Body to remand decisions to panels for further proceedings, rules for sequencing and the termination of retaliatory measures (see below), tightened time frames, enhanced third-party rights, and special treatment for developing country disputants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Steps in a WTO Dispute", "paragraphs": ["The WTO dispute settlement process consists of three broad stages: (1) consultations; (2) panel and, if requested, Appellate Body review; and (3) if needed, implementation.

An \"as such\" claim challenges the measure independent of its application in a specific situation and, as described by the WTO Appellate Body, seeks to prevent the defending Member from engaging in identified conduct before the fact.", "If a panel is requested, the DSB must establish it at the second DSB meeting at which the request appears as an agenda item, unless it decides by consensus not to do so. Thus, while a defending Member may block the establishment of a panel the first time the complaining Member makes its request at a DSB meeting, the panel will be established, virtually automatically, the second time such a request is placed on the DSB's agenda.

The panel also found, however, that to the extent that the challenged EU measure had not been removed, the United States and Canada had not violated Article 22.8, which requires that sanctions be removed once the offending measure is withdrawn.

Originally applicable to all covered goods entering the United States on or after March 23, 2009, the revisions include removal of some products from the original list of covered products, the addition of new products to the list, modified coverage with regard to certain EU member states, and an increase to 300% ad valorem of duties on one product, Roquefort cheese. The EU announced on January 15, 2009, that it had decided to \"start preparations\" to pursue WTO dispute settlement regarding the carousel statute, stating that it \"breaches the WTO requirement of equivalence between the damage caused by the sanction or ban and the retaliation proposed.\" As noted above, under an MOU with the EU aimed at settling the beef hormone dispute, the United States has agreed not to impose the announced tariff increases on new items and officially terminated these additional duties as of September 19, 2009.", "The EU filed a broader challenge to Section 301 in 1998 based on various obligations in Article 23 of the DSU, which, as noted earlier, precludes certain unilateral actions in trade disputes involving WTO agreements. Section 301 may generally be used consistently with the DSU, though some U.S. trading partners have complained that the statute allows unilateral action and forces negotiations through its threat of sanctions. In United States\u2014Sections 301-310 of the Trade Act of 1974 (DS152), the WTO panel found that the language of Section 304, which requires the USTR to determine the legality of a foreign practice by a given date, is prima facie inconsistent with Article 23 because in some cases it mandates a USTR determination\u2014and statutorily reserves a right for the USTR to determine that a practice is WTO-inconsistent\u2014before DSU procedures are completed. The panel also found, however, that the serious threat of violative determinations and consequently the prima facie inconsistency was removed because of U.S. undertakings, as set forth in the Uruguay Round Statement of Administrative Action (H.Doc. 103-316), a document submitted to Congress along with the Uruguay Round agreements, and U.S. undertakings made before the panel, that the USTR would use its statutory discretion to implement Section 301 in conformity with WTO obligations. Moreover, the panel could not find that the DSU was violated by Section 306 of the Trade Act of 1974, which directs USTR to make a determination as to imposing retaliatory measures by a given date, given differing good faith interpretations of the \"sequencing\" ambiguities in the DSU.
