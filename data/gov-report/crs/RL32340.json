It was left to the House and the Delegatesthemselves to define their role. On January 13, 1795, the House took an important step towardestablishing the functions of Delegates when it appointed James White, the first territorialrepresentative, to membership on a select committee. In subsequent years, Delegates continued toserve on select committees as well as on conference committees. The first fixed assignment of aDelegate to standing committee occurred under a House rule of 1871, which gave Delegates placesas additional members on two standing committees. In these committees, the Delegates exercisedthe same powers and privileges as in the House; that is, they could debate but not vote.", "In the 1970s, Delegates gained the right to be elected to standing committees and to exercisein those committees the same powers and privileges as Members of the House, including the rightto vote. Today, Delegates enjoy powers, rights, and responsibilities identical, in most respects, tothose of House Members from the states. Like these Members, Delegates can speak and introducebills and resolutions on the House floor; and they can speak and vote in House committees.

The Resident Representative formally presents his credentials to the Department ofState and is the representative of the CMNI government to the various governmental departmentsin Washington concerned with Northern Mariana Islands issues, primarily the Department of theInterior. Currently, the Resident Representative has no official status in Congress, although he hasfrequently testified before congressional committees. ", "Representation for CMNI in Congress was not discussed in the Covenant between the UnitedStates and the commonwealth in 1975. In 1986, a report to the Reagan Administration from a groupknown as The Commission on Federal Laws, called for granting the Northern Mariana Islandsnon-voting representation in the House, though no action was taken on this recommendation at thattime.

When the United States and the Mariana Islands agreed to the covenant of association, it was thoughtthat the Mariana Islands lacked sufficient population to warrant a congressional Delegate. Since then,as the population has grown, Members of the House have debated whether to create a new positionof non-voting delegate for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Bills to authorizethe creation of such a post have been introduced regularly in the House since 1994, but suchmeasures usually have not been acted upon. Prior to the 108th Congress, the most recent committeeaction occurred in 1996, when the House Resources Committee reported H.R. 4067 (104th Congress, second session). Introduced by Representative Elton Gallegly, the bill provided forthe election of a Delegate from the Northern Mariana Islands for the congressional term beginningin 1999 (106th Congress).", "The committee approved H.R. 4067 by voice vote on September 18, 1996. FourMembers (Representatives Wes Cooley, Helen Chenoweth, Jack Metcalf, and Joel Hefley), however,later asked that the committee's report reflect their opposition. A fifth committee member,Representative George Miller, filed a formal written dissent. The measure was reported to the Houseon September 27, 1996. No further action occurred.", "The Resources Committee report noted that \"NMI is the last and only U.S. territory with apermanent population that has no voice [in Congress].\" The report continued: ", "The small population of NMI was cited by the MarianasPolitical Status Commission, which negotiated the Covenant for the islands, as the reason NMI wasunable to obtain a nonvoting delegate in the Covenant despite the backing of the executive branchof the Federal Government. NMI population of 15,000 (1970 Census) was considerably less at thattime than the populations of Guam (86,926) and the Virgin Islands (63,200) had been when thoseterritories were granted nonvoting delegates in 1972. Two years after approving the Covenantwithout a provision for an NMI delegate, however, Congress granted a delegate to American Samoawith a resident population of 27,000, most of whom were not U.S. citizens. Today, with a U.S.citizen population of 27,512 and a total population of 59,913, NMI is clearly within the thresholdof population established by precedents both historical and contemporary. (3)", "In opposing the committee's recommendation, Representative Miller argued that theResources Committee had given little formal consideration to the proposal, not even holding ahearing or Member briefing on H.R. 4067 before the markup. Representative Millerfurther charged that there were long-standing labor law abuses in CNMI, particularly with regard toworking conditions that were unsafe or abusive and wage rates substantially below those foundamong the States of the United States or in neighboring Guam. Representative Miller urged thatreform of labor conditions be a pre-condition for authorizing a Delegate for CNMI.", "This nation has a long history of requiring those whowish representation to change behavior such as polygamy or slavery, behaviors which are contraryto the beliefs and ethics of this nation as a whole. I recognize that some assert that we will have abetter opportunity to pressure CNMI into accepting the legal changes we seek if it is represented inthe Congress\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Rather, I believe that only by sending a clear message of disapproval, by denyingmembership in the House of Representatives until sustained and substantive reforms areimplemented, will this House demonstrate that change within the CNMI is required to meet thestandard for equal participation in the Congress commensurate with that of other delegates.

The bill would have established the position of non-voting Delegate from theCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and it would have provided for the election of thefirst such Delegate in the 2006 election cycle. The bill required, in a manner that parallels therequirements for service as a Member of the House, that the Delegate from the Northern Marianasbe at least 25 years old, a citizen of the United States for seven years, and a resident of the territory. Additional eligibility requirements stipulated that the delegate also be a \"domicilary\" of theCommonwealth, a qualified voter in the Northern Marianas, and, at the time of his or her election,not be a candidate for any other elected office.

Nothing that the Resident Commissioner could do in a committee vote couldbecome a final decision unless a majority of the elected Members of Congress supported his position. However, in the standing committee itself I think that the Member from Puerto Rico should havea vote. I think the House has the constitutional authority to give him a vote in that limited area.", "The amendment was opposed by Representative B.F. Sisk, the floor manager of the bill anda senior member of the House Rules Committee. Sisk asked rhetorically whether the Cordovaamendment \"would be interpreted so that he would be entitled to vote in the Committee of the WholeHouse on the State of the Union.\"", "In response, sometime later, Cordova observed that \"The amendment which I have offered refersexpressly to the standing committees.

Duringthe 103rd Congress, Delegates were allowed to vote in the Committee of the Whole, a developmentthat became the focus of intense partisan controversy. In January 1993, the Democratic majorityproposed to amend House Rule XII to permit such Delegate voting. In the event that a matter beforethe Committee of the Whole was decided by the margin of the Delegates' votes, however, anotheramendment (to House Rule XXIII) provided for an automatic re-vote in the full House, whereDelegates could not participate.

They argued that the rule change violated Article I of the Constitution by granting legislativepower to Delegates who were not \"Members [of the House of Representatives] chosen every secondYear by the People of the several States.\" (57) They took issue with the characterization of the Committee ofthe Whole as a committee and maintained, instead, that it was tantamount to the full House. In theircomplaint, the plaintiffs stated:", "[N]on-member voting in the Committee of the Wholeimpairs and dilutes the constitutional rights of the plaintiff-Representatives, both as Members of theHouse and as voters who enjoy the right to full, fair and proportionate representation in the Houseof Representatives.

As his opinion made clear, however, he did soonly because of the automatic re-vote provision. \"If the only action of the House of Representativeshad been to grant to the Delegates from the District of Columbia, Guam, Virgin Islands, andAmerican Samoa, and the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico the authority to vote in theCommittee of the Whole,\" he wrote, \"its action would have been plainly unconstitutional.\" (62) His opinion further stated:", "[W]hile the action the House took on January 5, 1993undoubtedly gave the Delegates greater stature and prestige both in Congress and in their homedistricts, it did not enhance their right to vote on legislation....[B]y virtue of Rule XXIII they [thevotes of the Delegates] are meaningless.
