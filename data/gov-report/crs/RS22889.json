{"id": "RS22889", "title": "The National Directory of New Hires", "released_date": "2014-02-24T00:00:00", "summary": ["The National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) is a database that contains personal and financial data on nearly every working American, as well as those receiving unemployment compensation. Contrary to its name, the National Directory of New Hires includes more than just information on new employees. It is a database that includes information on (1) all newly hired employees, compiled from state reports (and reports from federal employers), (2) the quarterly wage reports of existing employees (in Unemployment Compensation (UC)-covered employment), and (3) unemployment compensation claims. The NDNH was originally established to help states locate noncustodial parents living in a different state so that child support payments could be withheld from that parent's paycheck. Since its enactment in 1996, the NDNH has been extended to several additional programs and agencies to verify program eligibility, prevent or end fraud, collect overpayments, or assure that program benefits are correct. Although the directory is considered very effective, concerns about data security and the privacy rights of employees remain a part of debates regarding expanded access to the NDNH."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) is a database of personal information and wage and employment information of American workers. Employers are required by P.L. 104-193 to send new hire reports to the State Directory of New Hires, which then sends the required information to the NDNH. States also are required to send quarterly wage information of existing employees (in UC-covered employment) and unemployment compensation claims information to the NDNH. Federal employers (i.e., agencies) send their new hire reports and quarterly wage information directly to the NDNH. A new hire report contains six data elements on new employees, which include the name, address, and Social Security number of each new employee and the employer's name, address, and tax identification number. ", "The NDNH contains three components. (1) The first component of the NDNH is the new hires file (i.e., report). It contains information that is also on each employee's W-4 form. (2) The second component of the NDNH is the quarterly wage file. The quarterly wage file contains quarterly wage information on individual employees in UC-covered employment. This information comes from the records of the State Workforce Agencies (sometimes called State Employment Security Agencies) and the federal government. When an individual has more than one job, separate quarterly wage records are established for each job. (3) The third component of the NDNH is the Unemployment Compensation file. The Unemployment Compensation file contains information pertaining to persons who have received or applied for unemployment compensation, as reported by State Workforce Agencies. With respect to this file, the state can only submit information that is already contained in the records of the state agency (i.e., generally the State Workforce Agency) that administers the Unemployment Compensation program.", "Thus, the NDNH obtains its data from State Directories of New Hires, State Workforce Agencies, and federal agencies.", "The NDNH, itself, is a component of the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS), which is maintained by the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and is housed at the Social Security Administration's National Computer Center in Baltimore, MD. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), during FY2010 about 672 million records were posted to the NDNH."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Original Purpose", "paragraphs": ["The original purpose of the NDNH was to help states locate child support obligors who were working in other states so that child support could be withheld from the noncustodial parent's paycheck. It is estimated that about 30% of child support cases involve noncustodial parents who do not live in the same state as their children. States generally use NDNH data rather than state new hire data or state quarterly wage data because they are more likely to acquire earnings information about noncustodial parents who have obtained work or claimed unemployment insurance benefits in a different state, or who are employed by the federal government. Moreover, because many noncustodial parents are in temporary employment or move from job to job, the quick reporting of information on new hires greatly increases the likelihood that the NDNH will be able to locate a noncustodial parent and pass on the information to states, so that the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) agencies can collect child support via income withholding before the noncustodial parent changes jobs. Since its enactment in 1996, access to the NDNH has been expanded, mostly to prevent fraud and abuse, to certain other programs and agencies (discussed later)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "National Directory of New Hires Data", "paragraphs": ["Employers are required to collect from each newly hired employee and transmit to the State Directory of New Hires a report that contains the name, address, and Social Security number of the employee and the employer's name, address, and tax identification number.

The size and scope of the NDNH has continued to cause much concern over whether the privacy of individuals will be protected. In addition to the data security safeguards, federal law includes privacy protection provisions that require the removal or deletion of certain information in the NDNH after specified time periods. It has been argued that stronger safeguards may be needed to prevent the unauthorized intrusion into the personal and confidential information of millions of Americans associated with the NDNH.", "The federal government and states administer numerous benefit programs that provide aid, in cash and noncash form, to persons with limited income. In theory, all of these programs could use the employment and income information contained in the NDNH to verify program eligibility, prevent or end unlawful or erroneous access to program benefits, collect overpayments, or assure that program benefits are correct. Some observers are worried that more of these federal and state programs will try to obtain access to the NDNH. They contend that expanded or wider access to, and use of, these data could potentially lead to privacy and confidentiality breaches, financial fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. They also are concerned that a broader array of legitimate users of the NDNH may conceal the unauthorized use of the personal and financial data in the NDNH.", "Some policymakers maintain that, although many agencies and programs could potentially benefit from access to the NDNH, those entities will not pursue access because many of these agencies currently do not have the computer capacity or capability to use an automated system such as the NDNH. Many of these agencies and programs are administered at the local level where computer availability is limited or computer capability to interface with the automated NDNH is nonexistent. Moreover, many of the privacy protections and strict security requirements tied to the NDNH may be administratively burdensome for many agencies.", "Finally, some child support advocates are concerned that the wider access to the NDNH may have negative repercussions for the CSE program in that as other programs and agencies use the NDNH effectively and find matches in cases that involve an overpayment, those agencies will want to collect their money and may use income withholding as the mechanism to do so. Thus, these other programs will be in direct competition with the CSE program for the income of noncustodial parents."], "subsections": []}]}}
