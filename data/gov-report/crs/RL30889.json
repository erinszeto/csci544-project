In general, this is \"a measure of the cost of credit which must be disclosed on a yearly basis and the calculation of which is determined by the underlying transaction.\" The statute outlines specifically how the annual percentage rate is to be calculated depending on the type of transaction, and delegates authority to the Federal Reserve Board to issue implementing regulations.", "Before the first transaction is made, the creditor must furnish an initial disclosure, including the finance charge, other charges that may be imposed, the fact that the creditor has or will acquire a security interest in the property purchased, a statement of billing rights, and home equity information if applicable. The creditor must also furnish a periodic statement for each billing cycle at the end of which the account has a debit or credit balance of more than $1 or on which a finance charge has been imposed. The periodic statement must be delivered at least 14 days prior to the end of the billing cycle. Disclosures required in the periodic statement include the previous balance, an identification of transactions, credits, periodic rates, the amount of the balance to which the periodic rate was applied, the amount of finance charge, the annual percentage rate, other charges, closing date of the billing cycle and new balance, the free-ride period, and the address for notice of billing errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enhanced Disclosures", "paragraphs": ["The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 included provisions amending the Truth-in-Lending Act to require lenders to make enhanced disclosures related to credit card minimum payments, introductory interest rates, and late payment deadlines and penalties.", "With respect to minimum payments, the law requires the inclusion of the following statement on the front of the billing statement: \"Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.\" Following the statement must be a sample calculation of how long it would take to repay the balance, based on the lender's current minimum payment required. There must also be a toll-free number that consumers may call to receive an estimate of the amount of time it would take to repay their specific balances.", "When an introductory or temporary rate is offered, it must be clearly and conspicuously labeled as \"introductory,\" and the rate after the introductory period must be stated in a clear and conspicuous manner near the listing of the introductory rate.

These include, inter alia , a conspicuous statement that the consumer is not required to complete the credit agreement merely because the consumer has received required disclosures or signed a loan application. Certain additional disclosures are required for extensions of credit that involve any variable rates or payment schedules. The additional disclosures required by the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act do not apply to extensions of credit involving a timeshare interest in a right to use accommodations, facilities, or recreational sites. These additional disclosures must be furnished to the borrower not later than seven business days before the consummation of the transaction, as well as in final form at the time of consummation. The basic disclosures required by TILA for all closed end credit extensions, including those secured by a consumer's dwelling, shall be made before credit is extended or not later than 3 business days after the date the creditor receives the written application of the consumer, whichever is earlier.", "The HOPE for Homeowners Act of 2008 amends the TILA by imposing a fiduciary duty upon servicers of pooled residential mortgages. A servicer of pooled residential mortgages owes a duty to maximize the net present value of the pooled mortgages in an investment to all investors and parties having a direct or indirect interest in such investment, not to any individual party or group of parties. Furthermore, the servicer shall be deemed to act in the best interests of all such investors and parties if the servicer agrees to or implements a modification or workout plan for a residential mortgage or a class of residential mortgages that constitute a part or all of the pooled mortgages in an investment, provided that any mortgage so modified meets specified criteria.", "The Private Student Loan Transparency and Improvement Act of 2008 amends the TILA by imposing consumer protection and disclosure requirements on private educational lenders and making TILA applicable to all private education loans. Such disclosures must be made clearly and conspicuously to borrowers in any application or solicitation for a private student loan and also with the approval of such loan application. Federal Reserve Board is required to create model forms that private educational lenders may use for such disclosures. Private educational lenders that have preferred lender arrangements with institutions of higher education are required to provide them annually with model disclosure form information for each type of private education loan offered to the schools' students or families. Borrowers have 30 days after the loan is approved and the required loan disclosure information is received to accept and consummate the loan transaction. Borrowers may cancel such loans, without penalty within 3 business days of consummation. Private education loans may not be consummated before applicants submit a signed self-certification form, that the Secretary of Education develops and schools provide to students, informing applicants of the availability of, and their possible eligibility for, federal, state, and institutional student aid.", "The act also adds a new section to TILA prohibiting unfair and deceptive private educational lending practices and eliminating conflicts of interest. A private educational lender may not offer or provide gifts to institutions of higher education in exchange for advantages or consideration for such lender related to its private educational loan business. Such lenders may not engage in revenue sharing with schools; use schools' names or symbols in marketing their loans in a manner that implies that such schools endorse the loans; or impose fees or penalties on borrowers prepaying their loans. A person employed in the financial aid office of a school or who otherwise has financial aid duties in a school is prohibited from receiving anything of value other than reasonable expenses for serving on advisory groups established by private educational lenders.
