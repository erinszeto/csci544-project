In 2004, GAO concluded that FSIS and FDA do not know how well companies carry out recalls, and have not effectively tracked them.

Industry representatives assert that FSIS's existing authority to suspend or withdraw its inspection service, which effectively denies a plant the right to market its products, is a strong incentive for establishments to ensure their products are safe to consume. FSIS' authority also enables it to detain meat and poultry products of concern for up to 20 days, and the agency can, with a court's permission, seize, condemn and destroy unsafe food as well.

Measured by volume of products, these two pathogens alone accounted for nearly 80% of the total pounds recalled during the period. More specifically, Listeria concerns were associated with 266 or 30% of all recalls (and by volume, nearly 109 million pounds or 45%) from 1994 through 2009. E. coli O157:H7 concerns were associated with 176 or 20% of all recalls (and a total of nearly 109 million pounds or 34%).", "Of the total number of recalls, 191 or 21% were a variety of products found to be misbranded, often because they contained an undeclared substance or ingredient. These substances were frequently allergens such as undeclared nuts in a processed product. Another 75 or 9% of all recalls during the period, again of a variety of products, were due to reports of foreign materials\u2014from sharp objects such as glass or metal to potentially less hazardous matter such as pieces of plastic wrap. Another 179 recalls or 20% were from a number of different causes, ranging from processing defects like undercooking to ineligible imports (i.e., from countries or foreign plants not determined to have equivalent safety systems).", "As Figure A-1 shows, recall volumes have varied significantly from year to year. Years with large overall volumes typically were because just one or two of the total recalls for that year involved a large quantity of products produced by a single company. For example, 25 million pounds, of the total of 28.3 million pounds of recalled products in 1997, can be attributed to a Hudson Foods recall of ground beef products on August 12 of that year due to E. coli O157:H7 contamination.

The expansion to 21.7 million pounds covered one year of production (back to September 25, 2006), because the plant was carrying over (reworking) each day's production to the next, rather than processing the ground meat in separate batches, which would create a clean break in production, a critical control stressed by industry experts and FSIS officials. In addition, the plant had not followed its own HACCP plan, according to the reports. More specifically, for example, reports indicated that the plant appeared to be grinding meat that did not carry the necessary documentation showing that it had been tested by the supplier for contamination.

Among problems observed by OIG: \"Neither FSIS nor the processing plants involved ... were prepared for the possibility of a recall.

The announcement came after FSIS found that a sample taken from the plant on October 2 had tested positive for Listeria . On October 12, the recall was expanded to approximately 27.4 million pounds of the products, produced between May 1 and October 2, 2002, which Pilgrim's Pride had distributed throughout the country and overseas. Some went to school feeding agencies. Although product samples from various days of production were all negative for the bacteria, environmental sampling in the plant itself matched the strain of Listeria found in the October 9 recalled product, according to FSIS.

This occurred after several Colorado consumers were reported to have become ill from the bacterium after consuming the Hudson product, and subsequent testing found the same strain in a Hudson patty. The recall was expanded to over 1.2 million pounds on August 15 and reached 25 million pounds by the time it was officially ended on February 9, 1999. The plant that produced the patties in Columbus, NE, was closed.

(This was the same problem that re-emerged 10 years later in the Topps recall.) \"The Hudson recall was viewed as an example of the breakdown of the voluntary food recall system. Critics noted that FSIS's lack of recall authority results in dangerous delays when companies such as Hudson question the extent or basis for a recall and wait before acting,\" Roberts wrote, suggesting it was an argument for mandatory recall authority."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
