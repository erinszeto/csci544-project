The standards\u2014formally known as National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone\u2014are standards for outdoor (ambient) air. In 2015, EPA tightened both the primary (health-based) and secondary (welfare-based) standards from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb after concluding that protecting public health and welfare requires lower concentrations of ozone than were previously judged to be safe. Ozone aggravates heart and lung diseases and may contribute to premature death; the primary standard addresses these concerns. Ozone can also have negative effects on forests and crop yields, which the secondary NAAQS is intended to protect.", "The designated nonattainment areas include counties in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Most of these areas have had previous experience as nonattainment for earlier versions of the NAAQS. Designation as nonattainment imposes more stringent permitting and pollution control requirement for new and modified stationary sources of emissions as compared with the requirements in areas that are in attainment of the NAAQS, and requires the development of State Implementation Plans demonstrating how emissions will be reduced sufficiently to reach attainment.", "EPA estimates the cost of meeting the 70 ppb standard in all states except California at $1.4 billion annually in 2025. Because most California areas would have until the 2030s to reach attainment, EPA provided separate cost estimates for California ($0.80 billion annually, post-2025). These cost estimates are substantially less than those from the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry sources, which have been widely cited. The benefits of reducing ozone concentrations were estimated by EPA at $2.9-$5.9 billion annually by 2025. The dollar value of avoided premature deaths accounts for 94% to 98% of this estimate.", "The agency projects that most areas will be able to reach attainment of the new standards by 2025 as a result of already promulgated regulations for gasoline, autos, power plants, and other emission sources. These regulations are being implemented independently of the 2015 NAAQS revision.", "Members of Congress have shown particular interest in whether the expected benefits of the standards justify their projected costs. There is controversy over the methods used to estimate both costs and benefits. As the Clean Air Act is currently written, however, the agency is prohibited from weighing costs against benefits in setting NAAQS standards. The statute simply directs EPA to set the primary standard at a level requisite to protect public health, allowing an adequate margin of safety.", "Various interest groups have lobbied against strengthening the standards. In the 115th Congress, the House has passed H.R. 806 to delay implementation of the 2015 NAAQS until the mid-2020s and to make changes to the process of future NAAQS revisions. The House Appropriations Committee reported a similar delay as a rider to EPA's 2018 appropriation (in Section 432 of H.R. 3354), but the final version of the appropriation (in H.R. 1625/P.L. 115-141) did not include the rider."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On October 1, 2015, under the authority of Sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized revisions to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone from the then-current level of 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. ", "As described in detail below (see \" Implementation of the 2015 Standards \"), under the CAA, revision of the standards sets in motion a process in which states and EPA identify areas that do not meet the standards (\"nonattainment areas\") and the states prepare implementation plans to demonstrate how emissions will be lowered sufficiently to reach attainment in those areas. ", "The revised standards are based on a review of more than 1,000 scientific studies by EPA staff. The EPA science assessment was itself reviewed by a panel of 20 outside scientific experts, a group known as the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC). The EPA Administrator was under a court order to sign any changes or reaffirm the standards by October 1, 2015. A comment period, public hearings, and interagency review had followed the publication of a proposed range of standards in December 2014.", "Ground-level ozone (often referred to as \"smog\") is associated with potentially serious health effects when present in high enough concentrations. These health effects include aggravated asthma, chronic bronchitis, and heart attacks, and in some cases premature death. In the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) accompanying the 2015 rule , EPA stated that reducing concentrations to 70 ppb versus the previous standard of 75 ppb would avoid 320 to 660 premature deaths annually in 2025 nationwide (excluding California). California was excluded from EPA's estimate of both costs and benefits of the nationwide standard, because most areas of the state will have until the 2030s to reach attainment of the NAAQS. California costs and benefits are presented separately in the \" Costs and Benefits of Control \" section of this report.", "High ozone concentrations also affect the growth of plants, causing damage to both forests and field crops. In 2006, the U.S. Forest Service examined 380 monitoring sites in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states and found visible injury to forest plants from ozone at 121 (32%) of them. At 20 of the sites, the damage was described as \"severe.\" In addition, EPA found that \"several economically important crop species are sensitive to ozone levels typical of those found in the United States,\" and estimated that crop losses could be reduced by $400 million to $620 million annually by implementation of a more stringent ozone standard.", "While EPA's analysis has found that there would be substantial health and welfare benefits to reducing ozone, the agency also has concluded that there could be substantial costs. In the RIA, EPA estimated the economic value of the benefits of reducing ozone concentrations to 70 ppb (for areas other than California) at $2.9-$5.9 billion annually by 2025, with costs at $1.4 billion annually in 2025.", "The ozone NAAQS are among EPA's most far-reaching standards. At the level set in March 2008 (75 ppb), 107 million people lived in areas that were designated nonattainment for the standards (see Figure 1 ), as of June 2018. These 38 areas (referred to as \"nonattainment areas\") include 168 counties in 17 states and the District of Columbia. The areas generally coincide with metropolitan areas, but may be larger or smaller. Of the 38 areas, 18 have ozone readings that indicate they have attained the standard, which would leave 20 areas with a combined population of nearly 78 million not attaining the standard.", "When it promulgated the 2015 NAAQS revision, EPA stated that if the most recent monitoring data then available (for the years 2012-2014) were used to identify nonattainment areas for the revised standards, the number of counties showing nonattainment would be 241 in 33 states and the District of Columbia. The actual nonattainment designations promulgated in 2018 are in most cases based on 2014-2016 monitoring data and include just over 200 counties or partial counties in 22 states and the District of Columbia, plus two tribal areas. (See Figure 2 .) In the intervening years, the emissions that contribute to ozone formation have declined, in response to already promulgated standards for motor vehicles, gasoline, power plants, and other sources of emissions. Thus, the number of counties showing nonattainment is lower than the EPA estimate released in 2015. ", "The potential economic, health, and environmental impacts of a change in the ozone NAAQS have led to great interest in EPA's review and implementation of the standards. To assist Members and staff in evaluating the process and its potential impacts, this report provides background on NAAQS, the process used to establish them, the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards, and issues that have been raised as EPA implements the final rule. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are NAAQS?", "paragraphs": ["NAAQS are federal standards that apply to ambient (outdoor) air. Section 109 of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to set both primary NAAQS, which are standards, \"the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the [EPA] Administrator ... are requisite to protect the public health,\" with \"an adequate margin of safety,\" and secondary NAAQS, which are standards necessary to protect public welfare, a broad term that includes damage to crops, vegetation, property, building materials, climate, etc. ", "The pollutants for which NAAQS have been set are generally referred to as \"criteria\" pollutants. The act defines them as pollutants that \"endanger public health or welfare,\" and whose presence in ambient air \"results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" Six pollutants (or categories of pollutants) are currently identified as criteria pollutants: ozone, particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and lead. The EPA Administrator can add to this list if he determines that additional pollutants meet the definition, or delete pollutants from the list if they no longer meet the definition. There have been no changes to the list, however, since the late 1970s.", "NAAQS are at the core of the Clean Air Act even though they do not directly regulate emissions. In essence, they are standards that define what EPA considers to be clean air for the pollutant in question. Once a NAAQS has been set, the agency, using monitoring data and other information submitted by the states, identifies areas that exceed the standards and must reduce pollutant concentrations; these areas are referred to as \"nonattainment areas.\" The designation process is often delayed by litigation over the standards, by EPA's agreement to reconsider aspects of them, or by consultations with the states regarding the specifics of the areas to be designated. Designation of nonattainment areas for the 1997 ozone NAAQS, for example, took seven years. Designations under the 2008 standards took four years. ", "After nonattainment areas are designated, state and local governments have up to three years to produce State Implementation Plans (SIPs), which outline the measures that will reduce emission levels and attain the standards. Finalizing SIPs, through EPA review and approval, often takes longer. ", "Under the CAA, actual attainment of the ozone NAAQS is allowed to stretch over a three-year to 20-year period, depending on the severity of the area's pollution. Ozone nonattainment areas are designated as Marginal, Moderate, Serious, Severe, or Extreme, depending on the level of pollution. Each of these classifications comes with required pollution control measures: the more severe the pollution, the more stringent are the required controls, and the longer the area is allowed before it must demonstrate attainment.", "Thus, establishment or revision of a NAAQS is not an event that requires immediate compliance with an air quality standard; rather, it sets in motion a long and complex implementation process. That process may ultimately have far-reaching impacts for public health and welfare, for sources of pollution in numerous economic sectors, and for states and local governments.", "EPA has several tools available to encourage nonattainment areas to comply with a NAAQS. The most frequently mentioned of these is the potential for highway-fund sanctions: failure to submit or implement a SIP adequate to attain or maintain compliance with the NAAQS can lead to the temporary suspension of federal highway funds for new nonsafety-related projects. Ultimately, EPA can impose a federal implementation or maintenance plan (a FIP) in an area that does not have an approved SIP. Imposition of sanctions or FIPs is relatively rare, however: generally the states avoid sanctions by submitting plans that require sufficient emission reductions to be deemed adequate by EPA.", "In addition to state and local actions to address ambient concentrations of NAAQS pollutants, EPA itself acts to control emissions and concentrations of criteria pollutants through national standards. These national standards apply to products that contribute to ozone and other criteria pollution (particularly mobile sources, such as automobiles) and to stationary emission sources (such as power plants). These standards lead to emission reductions that states can factor into their implementation plans, reducing the need for local air pollution control measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reviewing the Ozone NAAQS", "paragraphs": ["Section 109(d) of the Clean Air Act requires the agency to review each NAAQS every five years. That schedule is rarely met, but it often triggers lawsuits that force the agency to undertake or complete a review. In June 2013, the Sierra Club and three other groups filed suit over EPA's failure to complete the required review of the 2008 ozone NAAQS by the March 2013 deadline, and a court subsequently ordered EPA to propose any changes to the standards by December 1, 2014, and complete the review, with promulgation of any revisions by October 1, 2015.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The NAAQS Review Process", "paragraphs": ["Reviewing an existing NAAQS is generally a long process. To begin the process, EPA scientists compile the scientific literature published since the last NAAQS revision, and summarize it in a report known as a Criteria Document or Integrated Science Assessment (ISA). The ISA for ozone, completed in February 2013, reviewed more than 1,000 scientific studies.", "Ozone ISAs cover topics as wide-ranging as the physics and chemistry of ozone in the atmosphere; environmental concentrations, patterns, and exposure; dosimetry; animal-to-human extrapolation; toxicology; interactions with co-occurring pollutants; controlled human exposure studies; epidemiology; effects on vegetation and ecosystems; effects on UVB (ultraviolet light) exposures and climate; and effects on man-made materials.", "Following completion of the ISA, EPA prepares a Risk and Exposure Assessment to identify exposure pathways, at-risk populations, and health endpoints. This document was completed for the 2015 review in August 2014.", "A final document prepared by EPA staff, the Staff Paper or Policy Assessment, summarizes the information compiled in the ISA and Risk Assessment and provides the Administrator with options regarding the indicators, averaging times, statistical form, and numerical level (concentration) of the NAAQS. A Policy Assessment for the 2015 NAAQS revision was completed and publicly released on August 29, 2014.", "To ensure that NAAQS reviews meet the highest scientific standards, the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act required the Administrator to appoint an independent Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC). CASAC has seven members, largely from academia, state air pollution agencies, and private research institutions. In conducting NAAQS reviews, their expertise is supplemented by panels of the nation's leading experts on the health and environmental effects of the specific pollutants that are under review. These panels can be rather large. The panel for the 2015 ozone review, for example, had 20 members. CASAC and the public make suggestions regarding the membership of the panels on specific pollutants, with the final selections made by EPA. The panels evaluate the agency's work during NAAQS-setting and NAAQS-revision, rather than conducting their own independent review of the standards.

Although the standard was strengthened, the level chosen at that time was subject to controversy. A 23-member CASAC Review Panel unanimously recommended a range of standards more stringent than what the Administrator chose. ", "In September 2009, EPA agreed to reconsider the 2008 standard. As a result, a more stringent primary standard and a different version of the secondary standard were proposed in January 2010. After a year-and-a-half of public comment and review, EPA sent what it considered a final set of standards to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for interagency review. The process was short-circuited, however, by a presidential decision to await conclusion of the next regular review\u2014the review completed in 2015\u2014before promulgating any change.

CASAC stated, \"There is no scientific justification for retaining the current [0.08 ppm] primary 8-hr NAAQS.\" The panel unanimously recommended a range of 0.060 to 0.070 ppm (60 to 70 parts per billion) for the primary (health-based) 8-hour standard.", "EPA staff also recommended strengthening the primary standard. They recommended \"considering a standard level within the range of somewhat below 0.080 parts per million (ppm) to 0.060 ppm.\"", "Based on these recommendations, and his own judgment regarding the strength of the science, Stephen Johnson, the Bush Administration's last EPA Administrator, chose to finalize the standard at 0.075 ppm (75 parts per billion). That revision led to designation of nonattainment areas in April and May 2012, as shown above in Figure 1 .", "The Regulatory Impact Analysis that accompanied the final 2008 standard identified 345 counties in 36 states and the District of Columbia in exceedance of the 0.075 ppm standard, using data for 2004-2006 (the most recent available at the time). By May 2012, when the nonattainment areas were actually designated, the number of counties in nonattainment had fallen to 232 in 26 states and the District of Columbia, based mostly on data for 2008-2010. In the intervening years, emissions declined in most areas as more stringent standards for both mobile and stationary sources took effect. The 2008-2009 recession and other economic factors also contributed to the lower numbers. When the economy is operating well below capacity, emissions generally decline; and changes in the economy (e.g., fewer vehicle miles traveled and a switch to cleaner fuels) have also resulted in lower emissions. As of April 2016, only 115 counties in 12 states exceeded the 2008 ozone NAAQS, although about double that number remained classified as nonattainment pending completion of administrative requirements.", "As noted, EPA began a process to reconsider the 2008 ozone NAAQS in September 2009, and proposed a more stringent primary NAAQS in January 2010. The reconsideration process, which generally relied on the same data as that used to set the 2008 standard, led EPA to recommend a primary NAAQS of 0.070 ppm (70 ppb), within the range recommended by the CASAC Ozone Review Panel in 2008.

Staff concludes that it is appropriate in this review to consider a revised primary O 3 standard level within the range of 70 ppb to 60 ppb. A standard set within this range would result in important improvements in public protection, compared to the current [2008] standard, and could reasonably be judged to provide an appropriate degree of public health protection, including for at-risk populations and lifestages. In its advice to the Administrator, CASAC also concluded that the scientific evidence and exposure/risk information support consideration of standard levels from 70 to 60 ppb. Within this range, CASAC concluded that a level of 70 ppb would provide little margin of safety and, therefore, provided the policy advice that the level of the O 3 standard should be set below 70 ppb.", "Based on these recommendations, the EPA Administrator proposed revising the primary NAAQS on November 26, 2014, to a level somewhere in the range of 65 to 70 ppb.

", "Ozone affects both tree growth and crop yields, and the damage from exposure is cumulative over the growing season. In order to address this damage, EPA staff recommended in the 2008 review that the Administrator establish a new form for the secondary standard: a seasonal (three-month) average that would cumulate hourly ozone exposures for the daily 12-hour daylight window (termed a \"W126 index\"). The staff initially recommended a standard in a range of 7-21 parts per million-hours (ppm-hours). CASAC's ozone panel agreed unanimously that the form of the secondary standard should be changed as the staff suggested, but it did not agree that the upper bound of the range should be as high as 21 ppm-hours, suggesting that the upper bound be no higher than 15 ppm-hours. ", "The Administrator's June 2007 proposal was in line with the staff recommendation, 7-21 ppm-hours, but his final March 2008 choice was to duplicate the primary standard he promulgated at that time. He set a secondary standard at 0.075 ppm averaged over 8 hours, rejecting the advice of both CASAC and his staff.", "The secondary standard carries no deadline for attainment and has never been the subject of penalties or sanctions for areas that failed to meet it, but there was substantial disagreement between the Bush Administration EPA and the Office of Management and Budget over the form in which this standard should be set. OMB maintained that EPA had failed to consider or evaluate the effects of a W126 standard on \"economic values, personal comfort, and well-being\"\u2014terms that are also included in the Clean Air Act's definition of welfare\u2014and thus did not provide a balanced consideration of welfare effects, as required by the act. OMB also maintained that EPA had not adequately demonstrated that the proposed secondary standard would be more protective than one set equal to the primary standard. Ultimately, OMB prevailed. ", "Upon reconsideration, the 2011 draft final standards would also have adopted the W126 index and would have set the secondary standard at 13 ppm-hours, in line with CASAC's recommendations. With the President's request to withdraw the draft standard and await completion of the ongoing five-year review, a seasonal standard was not implemented.", "EPA's August 2014 Policy Assessment renewed this debate, this time with an additional thumb on the scale. The agency's staff again recommended that the Administrator set a secondary standard using the W126 index. The staff recommended a standard somewhere in the range of 7 to 17 ppm-hours, similar to CASAC's recommended range of 7 to 15 ppm-hours. In the interim, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals also weighed in. In a July 23, 2013, decision, Mississippi v. EPA , the court remanded the 2008 secondary standard to EPA for further explanation or reconsideration: the court found that \"EPA must expressly 'determine what level of ... protection is requisite to protect the public welfare,' [citation omitted] and explain why this is so.\" ", "The 2015 final rule is something of a hybrid: it describes the protection offered by the revised secondary standard in terms of a cumulative seasonal approach, but retains the practice of making the standard identical to the primary standard. The overview of the agency's rule states the following:", "EPA also is strengthening the secondary standard to improve protection for trees, plants and ecosystems. Like the primary, an area will meet the standard if the fourth-highest maximum daily 8-hour ozone concentration per year, averaged over three years, is equal to or less than 70 ppb.

Circuit decision in the Mississippi case is an open question. CASAC, in its review of the EPA staff recommendations, made two points that might argue against it being sufficient. ", "First, they stated the following:", "The CASAC does not support a level higher than 15 ppm-hrs. For example, at 17 ppm-hrs, the median tree species has 6% relative biomass loss, and the median crop species has over 5% yield loss. These levels are unacceptably high.... Furthermore, there are specific economically significant crops, such as soybeans, that may not be protected at 15 ppm-hrs but would be protected at lower levels. A level below 10 ppm-hrs is required to reduce foliar injury. A level of 7 ppm-hrs is protective of relative biomass loss for trees and offers additional protection against crop yield loss and foliar injury.", "Second, CASAC specifically did not recommend a three-year average for the secondary standard, stating that if the agency chose a three-year average, \"then the level of the standard should be revised downward such that the level for the highest three-month summation in any given year of the three-year period would not exceed the scientifically recommended range of 7 ppm-hrs to 15 ppm-hrs.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation of the 2015 Standards", "paragraphs": ["Promulgation of the NAAQS Revisions in October 2015 set in motion a long implementation process in which EPA works with state, local, and tribal air quality agencies to identify areas that do not meet the revised ozone standards and then implements measures designed to reach attainment.", "A first major step occurred in October 2016, when the states (and six authorized Indian tribes), using monitoring data and other information, submitted to EPA lists showing recommended attainment/nonattainment area designations. As shown in Table 2 , the states identified 213 counties in 55 potential nonattainment areas. The list included areas in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Indian tribes with designated Clean Air Act authority identified two additional areas as nonattainment.

In this step, EPA reviews the recommendations and finalizes designations after what is often significant dialogue with the states. Negotiations between EPA and the states during the designation process tend to focus on the quality of the monitoring data, whether exceptional events or other factors outside the state's control affected air quality during the monitoring period, and what the boundaries of identified nonattainment areas should be. The boundary question may lead to the inclusion of additional counties or partial counties where emissions contribute to nonattainment downwind, even though the county itself has monitored data demonstrating attainment. The states often provide more recent monitoring data during this process, which may result in an area demonstrating that it has attained the standard or may change the area's classification (e.g., as Marginal or Moderate nonattainment).", "This second step resulted in three separate actions designating areas under the 2015 ozone NAAQS", "on November 16, 2017, EPA designated 2,646 counties as in attainment with the 2015 ozone standards; on April 30, 2018, the agency identified 51 areas with 159 entire counties and 41 partial counties as nonattainment. All other areas, with the exception described in the next bullet, were designated attainment/unclassifiable or unclassifiable; and on July 17, 2018, the agency made final designation decisions for an eight-county area that includes San Antonio, TX, designating one county as nonattainment and the remaining seven counties as attainment. This action completed the area designations with respect to the 2015 ozone standard.", "Once EPA designates nonattainment areas, it classifies the areas into categories based on the severity of nonattainment. The classifications are, in increasing order of severity: Marginal, Moderate, Serious, Severe, and Extreme. EPA also sets a schedule for states to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs), which outline the measures that will reduce emission levels. In a Fact Sheet accompanying the designations, EPA states that \"Areas classified as Marginal are not required to submit plans demonstrating how they will meet the ozone standards. For all other nonattainment areas, states have three to four years after the effective date of final designations to develop and submit required SIP elements to EPA.\" Finalizing SIPs, through EPA review and approval, often takes longer than the three- to four-year period.", "Finally, under the CAA, actual attainment of the standards is allowed to stretch over a three-year to 20-year period, depending on the severity of the area's pollution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Controlling Ozone Pollution", "paragraphs": ["Controlling ozone pollution is more complicated than controlling many other pollutants, because ozone generally is not emitted directly by pollution sources.

Other factors being equal, a cool, cloudy summer will produce fewer high ozone readings than a warm, sunny summer.", "There are also complicated reactions that affect ozone formation. In general, lower emissions of precursor gases (particularly lower emissions of VOCs) lead to less ozone. But under some conditions, higher emissions of NOx lead to lower ozone readings. This makes modeling ozone air quality and predicting attainment more difficult and contentious than the modeling of other air pollutants, and can affect consultations between EPA and the states to determine the boundaries of nonattainment areas and the adequacy of SIPs.", "Most stationary and mobile sources of air pollution are considered to be contributors to ozone pollution. Thus, there are literally hundreds of millions of sources of the pollutants of concern, and control strategies require implementation of a wide array of measures. Among the sources of VOCs are motor vehicles (about one-fourth of total emissions), industrial processes, particularly the chemical and petroleum industries, and any use of paints, coatings, and solvents (about 40% for these sources combined).

A study of the Uintah Basin by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, EPA, the Bureau of Land Management, the Western Energy Alliance, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, and seven universities found that sources external to the basin are not major sources of the ozone found within it, and that among inventoried sources within the basin, 98% to 99% of the VOCs and 57% to 61% of the NOx come from oil and gas operations. The sunlight necessary for ozone to be created is magnified when it is reflected off of heavy snow cover. Snow cover also helps create temperature inversions that trap polluted air in the basins. In winters with little snow, there have been few exceedances of the standards. ", "In 2012, EPA promulgated standards requiring the reduction of VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production and transmission operations, including a requirement to use \"green completions\" on hydraulically fractured onshore natural gas wells.

EPA projected that the Clean Power Plan would cause coal-fired electricity generation to decline 12% to 15% in 2025, resulting in substantial reductions of NOx emissions. The NAM study concluded that more than half of the emission reductions needed to reach attainment would have to come from \"unknown controls,\" which, in an earlier version of its study, it estimated could cost as much as $500,000 per ton of emissions reduced. EPA's modeling of the rule's costs found that unknown controls would play a much smaller role: both the number of tons to which such controls would apply and the cost per ton would be substantially less. NAM's analysis focused exclusively on emissions of NOx, without any consideration of VOC controls. VOC emissions from petroleum and related industries have increased in the past decade, according to EPA, while emissions from most other sources have declined. Recent EPA analyses suggest that there are low cost emission control options in the oil and gas sector.

A map of the entire country distributed by API identified 958 counties nationwide as potentially in violation of a 70 ppb ozone NAAQS.

Similarly, API's map showed Kansas with 75 counties in nonattainment; according to the state's 2016 submission, the standard has already been attained at every monitored location.

Background ozone can originate from natural sources of ozone and ozone precursors, as well as from manmade international emissions of ozone precursors. Natural sources of ozone precursor emissions such as wildfires, lightning, and vegetation can lead to ozone formation by chemical reactions with other natural sources. Another important component of background is ozone that is naturally formed in the stratosphere through interactions of ultraviolet light with molecular oxygen. Stratospheric ozone can mix down to the surface at high concentrations in discrete events called intrusions, especially at higher-altitude locations. The manmade portion of the background includes any ozone formed due to anthropogenic sources of ozone precursors emitted far away from the local area (e.g., international emissions). Finally, both biogenic and international anthropogenic emissions of methane, which can be chemically converted to ozone over relatively long time scales, can also contribute to global background ozone levels.", "In the final rule, EPA identified two definitions of background ozone", "natural background (NB) (ozone \"that would exist in the absence of any manmade precursor emissions\"); and United States background (USB) (ozone \"that would exist in the absence of any manmade emissions inside the U.S.\").", "What the definitions have in common is that they identify ozone levels that cannot be influenced by actions within the jurisdiction of concern.

Areas without monitors (unless they are contributing to an area with monitored nonattainment) have generally been termed \"unclassifiable.\" When nonregulatory monitors indicate exceedance of the ozone NAAQS, designation as nonattainment does not automatically follow.
