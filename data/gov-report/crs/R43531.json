If a borrower defaults on an FHA-insured mortgage, FHA will repay the lender the remaining amount owed. FHA insurance is intended to encourage lenders to offer mortgages to households who might otherwise have difficulty obtaining a loan at an affordable interest rate, such as households with small down payments. Borrowers pay fees, called premiums, in exchange for the insurance, and these fees are supposed to pay for the costs of any mortgage defaults.", "In recent years, increasing foreclosure rates and falling house prices have strained FHA's single-family mortgage insurance fund, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). At the end of FY2013, FHA received $1.7 billion from Treasury to ensure that it had sufficient funds to cover all of its expected future losses on the mortgages that it was currently insuring. This was the first time that FHA had ever required funds from Treasury for this purpose for its single-family program.", "In response to concerns about the financial condition of the MMI Fund, FHA has taken a number of steps in recent years to attempt to improve its financial position. These changes have included increasing the fees that it charges to borrowers, adjusting its underwriting standards, and making changes to the way that it manages delinquent mortgages and foreclosed properties. FHA has also requested additional authorities from Congress, such as improving its ability to hold FHA-approved lenders accountable for the mortgages they submit for FHA insurance. These authorities have been included in legislation that Congress has considered but have not been enacted to date.", "Congress has also been considering additional reforms to FHA. Proposed reforms include increasing the amount of capital that FHA is required to hold in reserve to pay for unexpected increases in future losses and specifying actions that FHA must take if its capital reserves fall below certain thresholds. Some of these proposed additional reforms have been included in several stand-alone bills that have been introduced in recent Congresses, including H.R. 1145 and S. 1376 in the 113th Congress.", "Additionally, reforms to FHA are being considered in the context of broader reforms to the housing finance system. One housing finance reform bill in the 113th Congress, the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners (PATH) Act (H.R. 2767), would have made more far-reaching changes to FHA than those that have been included in other bills. These changes would have included limiting FHA-insured mortgages to only low- and moderate-income borrowers and first-time homebuyers in most circumstances, reducing the share of a mortgage that FHA can insure, and requiring greater risk-sharing with the private sector. The PATH Act would also have removed FHA from HUD and made it an independent agency."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), an agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), insures private mortgage lenders against the possibility that a borrower will default on his or her mortgage. If the borrower does default, and the home goes to foreclosure, FHA will pay the lender the remaining principal amount owed on the mortgage. FHA insurance is intended to encourage lenders to offer affordable mortgages to certain eligible borrowers who might find it difficult to obtain a conventional (that is, non-government-insured) mortgage, such as households with small down payments. FHA requires a 3.5% down payment for most mortgages it insures, which is lower than the down payment required for most conventional mortgages.", "Through its single-family mortgage insurance program, FHA insures eligible mortgages used to purchase or refinance a single-family home. A lender must be approved by FHA to be eligible to offer FHA-insured mortgages, and borrowers and mortgages must meet certain underwriting and eligibility criteria to qualify for FHA insurance. Borrowers also pay fees, called premiums, in exchange for the insurance. ", "FHA's single-family mortgage insurance program is intended to be self-supporting. The money that it brings in from the fees charged to borrowers and any amounts that it recoups from the sale of foreclosed homes is intended to cover the costs of any claims paid to lenders when mortgages default. However, in recent years increasing foreclosures on FHA-insured mortgages and factors such as house price declines have put pressure on the single-family mortgage insurance fund, known as the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). At the end of FY2013, FHA was required to take a $1.7 billion mandatory appropriation from Treasury to ensure that it would have sufficient funds to cover all of its expected future losses on the loans that it was currently insuring. FHA did not need any funds from Treasury for this purpose in FY2014.", "Furthermore, by statute, the MMI Fund is required to maintain a capital ratio of 2%. This means that it is supposed to have an economic value that is equal to at least 2% of the total dollar volume of mortgages that it is currently insuring, where the economic value is the current net assets of the MMI Fund plus the net present value of the estimated future cash flows on the mortgages that it currently insures. In other words, it is a measure of the amount of funds that would be expected to be available to cover any unexpected future losses on the loans that it currently insures, beyond what is needed to cover expected losses. The capital ratio fell below 2% in FY2009, and has remained below 2% since then, turning negative in FY2012 and FY2013. In FY2014, the capital ratio was once again positive, but at 0.41% remained below the 2% statutory requirement.

Recognizing that there is a tension between FHA's mission of expanding access to mortgage credit and its need to maintain the financial soundness of the MMI Fund, these changes generally attempt to improve FHA's financial soundness without unduly limiting access to mortgages for creditworthy borrowers. FHA has the authority to make some of these changes administratively, through policy guidance or rulemaking procedures, while others require congressional action.", "The policy changes that FHA has made in recent years generally attempt to increase FHA's cash reserves, to decrease the riskiness of the mortgages it insures, or both. Many of the changes that FHA has made or could make\u2014including increasing premiums and strengthening underwriting criteria\u2014impact the risk profile of future loans that FHA will insure rather than loans that FHA has already insured. FHA has fewer options at its disposal for making changes that will reduce its risk related to loans that it already insures. However, it has taken some steps that address past loans as well as future loans, such as more aggressively holding lenders accountable for loans they originated that did not meet FHA's criteria, making changes to its procedures for addressing delinquent mortgages (known as loss mitigation), and implementing new methods of selling foreclosed properties (known as property disposition). ", "This section describes several major policy changes that FHA has proposed or implemented in recent years. The changes are divided into three broad categories: ", "changes to eligibility and underwriting criteria (including changes to the premiums borrowers pay), changes intended to enhance FHA's oversight of lenders, and changes to the way in which FHA handles delinquent mortgages and foreclosed properties. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes to FHA's Eligibility and Underwriting Criteria", "paragraphs": ["Mortgages that FHA insures must meet certain underwriting standards and otherwise comply with FHA requirements. Some of the changes that FHA has initiated over the past several years involve increasing the premiums that borrowers pay for FHA-insured mortgages and strengthening the underwriting guidelines for its single-family program. The premium increases are intended to ensure that FHA is charging enough for its insurance to cover its potential costs, as well as to build up additional funds that can be used to pay for higher-than-expected losses on loans that FHA insures. The underwriting changes are aimed at making FHA-insured mortgages less likely to default, and therefore likely to result in fewer insurance claims that FHA has to pay. However, as a result of these underwriting and premium changes, some prospective homebuyers may find that they are no longer eligible for FHA insurance, or that FHA-insured mortgages are no longer an affordable option for them. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes to Mortgage Insurance Premiums", "paragraphs": ["Borrowers of FHA-insured mortgages pay both upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs). The upfront premium is paid when the loan is originated and is calculated as a percentage of the original loan amount. The annual premiums are paid each year and are calculated as a percentage of the outstanding loan amount. The premiums represent a large portion of the cash flow into FHA's single-family insurance fund.", "The maximum levels of both the upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums are set in statute, but FHA can administratively set the actual premiums it charges, as long as it does not exceed the statutory maximum. In recent years, FHA has made a series of changes to the premiums it charges to new borrowers, increasing the premiums several times before announcing a decrease in the annual premiums in January 2015. ", "Table 1 shows the current upfront and annual premiums charged by FHA compared to the maximum premium levels allowed by statute. ", "The upfront premium that FHA is currently charging is 1.75% of the loan amount, compared to a maximum of 3% allowed by statute. The annual premium varies slightly depending on the initial loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of the mortgage. The annual premiums are currently 0.85% of the loan balance (or 0.80% of the loan balance if the initial LTV is 95% or less), compared to a maximum of 1.55% (or 1.50% if the initial LTV is 95% or less) allowed by statute. The current premiums are reduced from premiums of 1.35% and 1.30%, respectively, before the premium decrease in January 2015. These annual premiums are lower than any time since early October 2010, although they are higher than the premiums that were charged prior to that date. ", "For the most part, the changes to the premiums have been made administratively by FHA, although Congress required an increase in the annual mortgage insurance premium of 10 basis points (one-tenth of one percent) in the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-78 ). Congress also passed legislation in 2010 raising the maximum statutory annual premium that FHA is allowed to charge, which allowed FHA to make subsequent increases to the annual premium. The changes to the premiums since October 1, 2008, are shown in Table 2 , along with their effective dates and the FHA administrative guidance (known as Mortgagee Letters) that implemented the changes. ", "There has been much debate about the appropriate level for FHA's premiums. Prior to the reduction in the annual premiums in January 2015, several housing and mortgage industry and consumer groups had called on FHA to lower the premiums, arguing that the higher fees were making FHA-insured mortgages too expensive and may have been making it harder for some creditworthy borrowers to obtain FHA-insured loans. Those in favor of lowering the premiums also argue that setting the premiums too high could harm the FHA insurance fund by reducing the number of borrowers who obtain FHA mortgages (and thus pay fees to FHA) or by leading only riskier borrowers to seek FHA loans while less risky borrowers are able to obtain more affordable loans elsewhere. ", "Other observers have been critical of the decision to lower premiums, particularly while FHA's capital ratio remains below the 2% level required by statute. They note that lowering the premiums is likely to slow FHA's efforts to rebuild its capital reserves. This, in turn, raises concerns that FHA may not have enough funds to cover any increase in its expected costs in the event of another housing or economic downturn and that it could eventually require additional assistance from Treasury (and ultimately taxpayers). Critics of the decision also note that, while premiums that are set too high could lead lower-risk borrowers to seek other types of loans and negatively affect the overall credit quality of FHA's business, premiums that are set too low could also negatively impact the insurance fund. This could happen if the lower premiums lead to an increase in the number of higher-risk borrowers that take out FHA-insured loans without adequately pricing for that risk. Finally, some argue that lowering the FHA fees makes mortgage insurance offered by private companies (known as private mortgage insurance, or PMI) less competitive with FHA for some borrowers, possibly expanding the government's role in the mortgage market when many would like to see the government's role reduced. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to the Premium Cancellation Policy", "paragraphs": ["In addition to changing the amount of the premiums charged, FHA has also changed the length of time that borrowers have to pay the annual mortgage insurance premium. Since 2001, FHA had followed a policy of cancelling borrowers' annual mortgage insurance premiums when the mortgage balance reached 78% of the home's value (based on the initial value of the home), provided that the borrower had paid the premium for at least five years. Effective June 3, 2013, FHA re-instituted a policy of requiring most borrowers to pay the annual mortgage insurance premium for the life of the loan. This policy only affects borrowers who take out FHA-insured mortgages after the effective date. ", "FHA made this policy change because, unlike private mortgage insurers, it continues to insure the entire remaining loan balance for the life of the loan regardless of the loan-to-value ratio. Furthermore, the fact that the premiums were canceled when a mortgage reached 78% of the initial value of the home (rather than the current value of the home), combined with decreases in home prices in recent years, meant that some borrowers could have had their premiums canceled when they actually had very little equity in the home based on the home's current value. This resulted in FHA paying some claims on defaulted mortgages for loans on which borrowers were no longer paying mortgage insurance premiums, and where the home's value was not high enough to recoup the amount of the claim that FHA paid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to Down Payment and Credit Score Requirements", "paragraphs": ["FHA has also increased the required down payment for borrowers with lower credit scores. For most FHA-insured loans, the required down payment is 3.5%. Beginning on October 4, 2010, FHA has required a down payment of at least 10% from borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579, while the down payment requirement of 3.5% remains in place for borrowers with credit scores of 580 or above. ", "Prior to making this change, the required FHA down payment was 3.5% for most borrowers, except that borrowers with credit scores below 500 were required to make a down payment of at least 10%. FHA no longer insures loans made to borrowers with credit scores below 500. FHA has stated that it had not insured many loans where the borrower's credit score was below 500, but that the loans that it did insure with borrower credit scores below that threshold have performed appreciably less well than loans to borrowers with higher credit scores. ", "Implementing a higher down payment requirement for borrowers with lower credit scores is aimed at addressing concerns about \"risk layering,\" or the possibility that a loan may be at a higher risk of default when it exhibits multiple risk factors rather than just one risk factor. Lower credit scores and higher loan-to-value ratios (that is, borrowing a higher amount relative to the total value of the home) are both potential risk factors. Increasing down payment requirements (and, therefore, reducing the loan-to-value ratio) for borrowers with credit scores below 580 is intended to help address that concern. ", " Table 3 summarizes FHA's current down payment requirements.", "FHA made these changes to down payment requirements through rulemaking procedures, and it published a Federal Register notice on July 15, 2010, soliciting public comment on these and other changes. HUD then issued a Final Rule addressing only these changes on September 3, 2010, along with administrative guidance providing additional information on the implementation of these changes.", " Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of borrowers' credit scores by dollar volume of loans insured by FHA in each year between FY2005 and FY2014. The share of the total dollar volume of FHA-insured loans made to borrowers with lower credit scores decreased over this time period, and the share made to borrowers with higher credit scores increased, particularly beginning in FY2009. ", "In each year between FY2005 and FY2007, roughly 30% of FHA-insured loans (by dollar volume) were made to borrowers with credit scores below 600. Since then, the share of mortgages made to such borrowers dropped to below 10% in FY2009 and to 1% or less each year since FY2011. Given this shift towards FHA serving fewer borrowers with credit scores below 600 in recent years, the down payment changes for the borrowers with the lowest credit scores might currently affect only a relatively small share of potential borrowers. However, if borrowers with higher credit scores begin turning to the conventional mortgage market and private mortgage insurance, and if FHA seeks to return to a more traditional role of insuring a higher proportion of mortgages made to borrowers with lower credit scores, it is possible that more borrowers who traditionally might have sought out FHA-insured mortgages could find themselves unable to qualify based on their credit scores and the higher down payment requirements.", "As the share of FHA loans to borrowers with lower credit scores decreased, the share of loans made to borrowers with higher credit scores increased. In FY2011, nearly 60% of the loans that it insured were to borrowers with credit scores of 680 or above, compared to about 20% of loans made to such borrowers in FY2007. In FY2014, based on partial year data, the share of FHA loans made to borrowers with credit scores of 680 or above was about 45%, a decrease of close to nine percentage points compared to FY2013. The share of FHA loans made to borrowers with credit scores between 640 and 679 increased by nearly five percentage points, to 42% from 38%.", "While the change in the distribution of borrower credit scores in recent years may partly reflect the changes in down payment requirements for borrowers with lower credit scores, it likely also reflects the general tightening of mortgage credit in the aftermath of the housing downturn, when even some borrowers with strong credit scores might have had difficulty accessing private alternatives for mortgage insurance, and some borrowers with lower credit scores might not have been able to obtain a mortgage at all. In addition, an increase in the loan limits for FHA-insured mortgages, particularly in high-cost areas, may have made FHA-insured loans an option for more borrowers with better credit scores who live in those areas.

", "\"Seller concessions\" are any contributions to the borrower's closing costs or other settlement expenses that are made by the seller or any other interested third party. Specifically, FHA proposes reducing the amount of allowable seller concessions to the greater of (1) 3% of the lesser of the home's purchase price or appraised value or (2) $6,000. Currently, FHA allows seller concessions of up to 6% of the lesser of the sale price or the appraised value. The notice also revises the items that count as seller concessions.", "FHA maintains that limiting seller concessions to 3% would be in line with industry standards for loans with loan-to-value ratios similar to FHA's, and that FHA-insured loans with higher amounts of seller concessions have performed more poorly in the past. While higher amounts of seller concessions will not be absolutely prohibited, any amount of seller concessions above the 3% threshold will result in a reduction of the mortgage amount that FHA will insure.

If a borrower exceeds these debt-to-income ratios, he or she may still be able to qualify for an FHA-insured loan by showing that certain compensating factors are present, such as substantial savings or a history of sustaining higher housing debts. The new manual underwriting requirements are more specific about how many compensating factors must be present to approve a loan that exceeds the DTI ratios, as well as how high of a DTI will be permitted if compensating factors are present. The new manual underwriting requirements also require borrowers whose loans are manually underwritten to have cash reserves equal to at least one monthly mortgage payment. ", "The notice also lowers the minimum credit score with which borrowers can exceed the DTI ratios if they exhibit compensating factors from 620 to 580.

Therefore, FHA can take certain actions against lenders who submit mortgages for insurance that do not meet FHA's standards. These actions can include suspending lenders from FHA programs or terminating their approval to originate FHA-insured mortgages entirely as well as imposing civil money penalties. HUD's Mortgagee Review Board (MRB) reviews cases of lenders not complying with FHA requirements and enters into agreements to bring lenders into compliance or imposes penalties where necessary.

Therefore, FHA expects that facilitating more short sales will reduce losses to the MMI Fund.

Through this program, FHA sells pools of FHA-insured mortgages that are at least six months past due, and for which servicers have evaluated borrowers for all loss mitigation options, to the highest bidder. The investors that purchase the mortgages are not allowed to foreclose on the property for six months, during which time the investor and the borrower can try to negotiate a solution to avoid foreclosure. FHA sells these loans through two types of pools: national or regional pools and neighborhood stabilization outcome (NSO) pools. Investors who purchase the neighborhood stabilization outcome pools, which include loans in more specific geographic areas, are required to ensure certain outcomes that are intended to protect the surrounding neighborhood from the impact of foreclosures on at least half of the loans in the pool. ", "DASP is intended to reduce losses to the FHA insurance fund by removing non-performing mortgages from FHA's outstanding insurance obligations and sparing FHA the costs of maintaining and marketing a foreclosed property. At the same time, it is intended to potentially help borrowers by giving investors an opportunity to offer borrowers workout solutions that FHA might not be able to offer, and to help stabilize neighborhoods by avoiding a situation where many foreclosed properties go on the market at the same time. However, some have raised questions about whether DASP includes sufficient protections for borrowers and whether FHA should do more to help mission-based nonprofits compete for properties through DASP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Property Disposition Actions", "paragraphs": ["FHA has also expanded a pilot program through which certain foreclosed homes are sold directly by lenders rather than being conveyed to FHA to sell.
