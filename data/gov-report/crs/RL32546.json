This act, which authorized grants for the construction of new teaching facilities, was the first comprehensive legislation to address health care provider supply. Related programs, authorized in Title VII of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), have evolved in subsequent reauthorizations. Beginning in the 1980s, funding for these programs became more focused on alleviating geographic and specialty maldistribution of health professionals, rather than increasing their overall supply. In the 1990s, Title VII programs emphasized support for primary care professionals, students from disadvantaged and/or diverse backgrounds, and individuals who were willing to practice in medically underserved communities. In 1998, the most recent authorization of Title VII programs, Congress regrouped programs into functional clusters ( P.L. 105-392 , Health Professions Education and Partnerships Act). This led to the creation of a range of grants programs for the development of a wide range of health care professionals that make up the health workforce. Employing primary care and public health as frameworks, the legislation targeted: underrepresented minorities in the health professions; students and residents training in primary care medicine and dentistry; faculty in health education, primary health care and public health; and community-based institutions that were in support of creating and building networks for the education and training of the health workforce. Physicians, physician assistants, nurses, psychologists, pediatricians, community health workers, geriatric students, pharmacy students, paraprofessional, and many more would receive support for education and training in the initial years of the program. Further, P.L. 105-392 provided support for the analysis of the nation's health workforce in anticipation of pending and future needs to address supply and demand issues throughout the United States.", "Title VII programs are administered by the Bureau of Health Professions at the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Title VII programs provide scholarships to students through grants and loans to institutions. For FY2008, the enacted appropriation for Title VII programs is $194 million. The FY2009 President's request contains no funding for any of the Title VII programs.", "HRSA also administers two related programs in health workforce development. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) is authorized under Title III of the PHSA, and administered by the HRSA Bureau of Primary Health Care. The NHSC is a scholarship and loan repayment program for certain health care workers who commit to future service in areas of the country experiencing a shortage of health care providers. Eligible providers include primary care physicians (doctors of medicine or osteopathy), primary care nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists and dental\u00a0hygienists, certified nurse midwives, social workers, psychologists, and other mental health providers. The second program, Nursing Workforce Development, is authorized in Title VIII of the PHSA, and administered by the Bureau of Health Professions. Programs in Title VIII focus exclusively on programs for the education and training of nurses at basic and advanced levels of education. Title VIII programs provide scholarships, loans and grants to achieve policy\u00a0objectives.", "A variety of other federal programs also provide support for health professions training, including graduate medical education (GME) programs administered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in HHS, clinical research training supported by the National Institutes of Health in HHS, and training programs in the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. These other programs may or may not provide training that is targeted toward clinical specialization. The HRSA programs in Titles III, VII and VIII of the PHSA are the only federal programs intended to counter market forces that encourage specialization. These programs instead aim to improve the placement of providers in underserved areas, improve the racial and ethnic diversity of providers, and push back against market forces favoring specialization by encouraging \"generalist\" providers, those in primary care, family medicine, and geriatrics.", "According to the Department of Labor, seven of the 20 fastest growing occupations are in the health workforce. Home health aides, medical assistants, physician assistants, physical therapist assistants, dental assistants, dental hygienists, and personal and home care aides comprise the seven groups. Health care aides and assistant occupations are projected to grow especially quickly as organizations try to control costs. Individuals in these occupations may be expected to assume some duties formerly done by more highly paid health care professionals, such as dentists, nurses, physicians, and therapists. Furthermore, continued population growth coupled with an aging populations will continue to demand a high level of quality health care services.", "The effectiveness of Title VII health professions programs in meeting a variety of stated objectives has long been a subject of debate. This has resulted in recommendations from the Administration to eliminate many of the programs, recommendations which have persisted for many years. The country's largest health philanthropy, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, has heralded repeated successes in applying or drawing on lessons learned from Title VII models. Others argue that Title VII programs have made a significant difference in recruiting and retaining health professions in rural areas, where health professional shortages are most severe. In 2006, the General Accounting Office (GAO) assessed Title VII programs and determined that the effectiveness of these programs was difficult to evaluate.", "This report examines the legislative, programmatic and funding histories of Title VII health professions programs, and discusses issues including workforce analysis and the evaluation of program effectiveness.

The act authorized grants for the construction of new teaching facilities and loans to support students in the study of medicine, dentistry, and osteopathy. In the 1970s, when studies indicated that a physician shortage appeared to have subsided, the emphasis of Title VII programs shifted. Through several reauthorizations in the 1970s and 1980s, Title VII programs were seen as a means to improve maldistributions of physicians and other health professionals. Programs were authorized to increase the numbers of health professionals in underserved (mostly rural or inner-city) areas, and to improve the racial and ethnic diversity of the health workforce. In addition, programs were developed to counter the nationwide trend among medical residents toward specialization. The major objective of these programs was to increase support for training and curriculum development in primary care.", "In 1998, Congress reauthorized and consolidated health professions programs in the Health Education Partnerships Act ( P.L. 105-392 ), creating new authority for programs in geriatrician training and health workforce analysis. To provide administrative flexibility, Congress consolidated multiple existing or new programs into clusters. The clusters identify the following areas for Title VII Health Workforce Development: (1) training of minority and disadvantaged professionals; (2) training in primary care medicine and dentistry; (3) interdisciplinary, community-based linkages, to establish training centers in remote areas; (4) health professions workforce information and analysis; (5) public health workforce development; and (6) student financial assistance. Congress also established advisory committees for two of the clusters: primary care medicine and dentistry, and interdisciplinary, community-based linkages. Eventually, mental health providers were made eligible for participation in certain Title VII programs. The Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program was reauthorized in 1998, but since then no new loans have been issued. HEAL continues to receive annual appropriations in order to liquidate existing loans.

These requirements do not generally apply to the public health workforce.", "A wide range of health professionals is eligible to receive support for the education and training activities offered through Title VII programs. Education and training requirements vary for each profession and are reflected in the period of academic study, residency requirements, licensure requirements, and other prerequisites for practice. Title VII support is also available to institutions that train health professionals. Groups of health professionals that are eligible for Title VII support include physicians, dentists, mental and behavioral health professionals, environmental health professionals, dental assistants, and medical assistants.", "Some Title VII programs for training providers emphasize support for primary care, those health care services rendered in general medicine and dentistry, family practice and pediatrics. These fields, which emphasize a breadth of skills and care for the whole patient, contrast with specialty care, which is often focused on specific organs or systems. Primary care providers, who may include physicians, dentists, nurses or physician assistants, provide primary care through integrated, accessible health care services. The American Academy of Family Physicians, representing primary care physicians, defines its members as those who", "[function] as the patient's means of entry into the health care system ... [and are] the physician of first contact in most situations and, as the initial provider, [are] in a unique position to form a bond with the patient ... [to evaluate] the patient's total health needs, and [to provide] personal care within one or more fields of medicine.", "Title VII also supports training of the public health workforce. This workforce may include nurses and physicians, though they may or may not render direct patient care in the course of their work. Public health workers may also be administrators, technicians, veterinarians, animal control specialists, environmental engineers, sanitarians, educators and community outreach workers. The national public health workforce has been estimated at roughly 450,000 to 500,000 employed workers, employed in health departments at the local, state, or federal levels, in health care institutions, in academia, and in other settings. Considerable overlap exists among providers of primary care and those in public health, as both are strongly oriented toward prevention of illness and injury. Individuals in both fields often move between them, or work in both concurrently, during the course of their careers.", "Allied health professionals support or assist in the delivery of public health services or primary health care. They are involved with the delivery of health or related services pertaining to the identification, evaluation and prevention of diseases and disorders; dietary and nutrition services; rehabilitation and health systems management, and others. Dental hygienists, diagnostic medical sonographers, dietitians, cardiovascular technologists, medical technologists, occupational and physical therapists are some examples.

The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses a system of Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) to collect, calculate, and disseminate data about the American workforce. SOC categories provide a consistent format for use in the decennial census, for federal agencies enumerating private-sector workforces relevant to their missions, and for private entities interested in studying the American workforce. Workers are classified into one of over 820 occupations based on similar job duties, skills, education, or experience. Health care workers whose disciplines are supported by Title VII programs are classified in category 29-0000\u2014\"Health care Practitioners and Technical Occupations,\" which is further divided into \"Diagnosing and Treating Practitioners\" such as physicians, pharmacists and dentists, and \"Health Technologists and Technicians,\" which includes, among others, laboratory and radiology technicians, and dental hygienists. The suffix in category 29 allows for finer designations. For example, therapists are coded in the 29-1120 series, and respiratory therapists, in particular are coded as 29-1126.", "Despite its overall utility, the SOC system falls short when applied to Title VII programs in at least two important ways. First, only eight subcategories of physicians are available, including \"other,\" a category likely to become progressively less helpful if trends toward specialization persist. Second, public health workers, a target group for Title VII programs which has grown in importance with the national emphasis on homeland security, are not described in the SOCs. They are likely to be counted as physicians, nurses, technicians, or other practitioners, depending on which degrees they may hold (if any), but the classification scheme misses the fact that their \"practice\" is on populations rather than individuals. An analysis of efforts to enumerate workers in the nation's local health departments found that the SOC system did not correspond in meaningful ways with actual workers and their roles, and concluded that \"no state or national system is in place to track local public health workers in any way.\" One of the few attempts to enumerate the national public health workforce estimated it at about 448,000 individuals, though this effort raised as many questions as it answered: What types of training do these individuals have? What proportion of their time is spent solely on public health practice, versus personal health care, teaching or research? Have they also been counted erroneously toward some other health workforce?", "Attempts by professional associations to enumerate workers in their disciplines sometimes yield results that conflict with BLS findings. For example, in 2000, BLS data indicated that there were 598,000 physicians in the United States, while a study of the same year by the American Medical Association indicated almost 814,000, or 36% more. This shows the difficulty in using different data sources (such as BLS data and state license rolls) both in conducting the count itself, and in the variety of determinations that must be made to answer a given question. If one is interested in the strength of a full-time workforce practicing a specific discipline, then correction must be made for those holding licenses and practicing in multiple states, those engaged in employment other than practice, (including those in administration or who are retired), and those practicing part-time or not at all."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Projecting Future Workforce Strength and Needs", "paragraphs": ["Each year, NCHWA grantees prepare ten-year projections of national health workforce strength based on analysis of data from the BLS Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment Projections.
