From the first flight of the Wright brothers in 1903 to the creation of Google in the 1990s, U.S. scientific and technological innovations have reshaped the global economy and provided both economic mobility and national security for generations of Americans.", "Whether the United States will maintain its preeminence over the course of the 21st century is an open question. Some observers assert that U.S. leadership is at risk. They argue that the United States underinvests in physical sciences and engineering (PS&E) research and underperforms in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. (PS&E research and STEM education are believed to be central pillars in the foundation supporting U.S. scientific and technological achievement.) At the same time, other nations are increasing their commitments to research and education in the STEM fields and, as a result, can compete for a growing percentage of the world's high-value jobs and industries.", "Concern that the United States has fallen or could fall behind in the global race to innovate propelled passage of the 2007 America COMPETES Act (P.L. 110-69) and its successor, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358). The COMPETES Acts authorized increasing funding for targeted federal accounts that support PS&E research (commonly referred to as the \"doubling path policy\") and authorized (or reauthorized) certain federal STEM education programs. The acts also established the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), allowed federal agencies to use prize competitions to spur innovation, and directed the executive branch to coordinate policies providing access to federally funded research\u2014among many other provisions.", "Neither of the COMPETES Acts has been fully funded or implemented. Actual funding for the targeted PS&E research accounts did not reach authorized levels, and most of the STEM education programs established by the acts were not realized. On the other hand, existing STEM education programs that were reauthorized by the acts generally continued to operate. ARPA-E, which was established by the acts, was implemented and continues to operate. Federal agencies are also using the act's prize authority\u2014at least 100 competitions have been initiated under the authority of P.L. 111-358.", "Most of the funding authorizations in the COMPETES Acts have expired. Legislation to reauthorize all or portions of the acts was introduced, but not enacted, in the 113th Congress. Legislators have introduced bills to reauthorize all or portions of the acts in the 114th Congress.

The possibility that the United States has or could lose its historic strengths in scientific and technological advancement\u2014and therefore has or could lose the prosperity and security attributed to that advancement\u2014has become the central rationale for a portfolio of otherwise disparate federal programs, policies, and activities.

In particular, the law established what is commonly referred to as the \"doubling path policy\" for PS&E research. This policy provided annual increases in authorized funding for the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS) and Construction of Research Facilities (CRF) accounts at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Office of Science account at the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014with the implicit goal of doubling combined funding for these accounts over a seven-year period (from an FY2006 baseline).

Other provisions in the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 allow federal agencies to offer innovation prizes and direct the Department of Commerce (DOC) to establish a new loan guarantee program for manufacturers, as well as a regional innovation program. The reauthorization also repealed certain STEM education program authorizations, particularly those that did not receive appropriations between FY2008 and FY2010 (e.g., Math Now).

Advocates for the COMPETES Acts argued that additional support for R&D in the physical sciences and engineering, and in STEM education, would lead to innovation and improve U.S. competitiveness. They noted that many experts consider innovation, particularly technological innovation, to be a driving force behind U.S. global economic competitiveness and national prosperity. As such, many observers consider innovation a crucial national asset.", "Proponents of the acts further asserted that the United States is at risk of losing its innovation advantage. They argued that a combination of external pressures and internal weaknesses threatens the U.S. global position. For example, they noted that changes in the industrial bases and educational attainment rates of rapidly developing countries like China and India have led many analysts to conclude that these countries are able to compete for a growing percentage of the world's high-value jobs and industries. These global changes, advocates asserted, appeared to be accompanied by perceived weaknesses in areas that have long been U.S. strengths. In particular, the acts' proponents raised concerns about federal funding for research in the physical sciences and engineering and about the education and training of U.S. scientists, engineers, and technicians. This case was more fully laid out in the National Academies publication Rising Above the Gathering Storm , which is widely believed to have contributed to the shape and scope of the America COMPETES Act. The argument for, as well as major provisions in, the America COMPETES Act can also be traced to a 2006 proposal by President George W. Bush, known as the American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI).", "Opposition to the acts tended to fall into three broad categories: (1) questions about fundamental assumptions, (2) preferences for alternative policies or approaches, and (3) cost. For example, some analysts disputed fundamental assumptions driving provisions designed to increase the number of STEM graduates, arguing that there is a lack of evidence of extensive STEM workforce shortages and that the bigger challenge is a dearth of attractive employment opportunities in STEM fields. Other analysts preferred to use regulatory and tax policy tools to achieve the acts' objectives, arguing that direct federal investment in R&D in the physical sciences and engineering and in STEM education could distort markets. Finally, opponents raised concerns about costs, arguing that proposed funding increases were too expensive in light of the federal deficit and debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enactment and Reauthorization", "paragraphs": ["The following sections describe enactment of, and selected legislative action related to, the COMPETES Acts.

President Ronald Reagan, for example, proposed a doubling of the NSF budget in FY1987. The 2002 NSF authorization ( P.L. 107-368 ) also sought to double funding for the NSF over a five-year period. Neither the Reagan effort nor the 2002 NSF authorization act resulted in a doubling of NSF's budget within the proposed time frames.

In its May 2014 progress update, OSTP reported that the executive branch was initiating prize competitions under the authority of Section 105 and that it had issued guidance to agencies and created a contract vehicle, as required by the provision.

For example, one study focused on whether (and in what ways) the number of contestants affects the outcome of innovation contests. This study found both positive and negative effects from so-called open innovation contests and suggested that open contests may be most appropriate for problems with a high degree of uncertainty. Another scholar raised questions about the design of innovation inducement competitions, including whether policymakers ought to condition prize payments on a market test (e.g., award the prize only if consumers purchase the technology) and whether prizes can be designed (via pricing conditions) to ensure widespread access to the technologies developed. A third scholar assessed prizes as a policy tool, identifying a wide range of issues for policymakers to consider, such as trade-offs and complementarities between prizes and other innovation policy tools (e.g., patents, grants), as well as prize design considerations and conditions (e.g., rules, outcomes, incentives, deadlines). Several scholars have noted that publicity appears to be a key non-monetary motivation in prize competitions. ", "At least one observer has highlighted the conditions under which prizes may be a uniquely effective tool and suggested best practices for their use. Other observers have sought to provide practical guidance on strategic considerations and tactical guidance in prize design.
