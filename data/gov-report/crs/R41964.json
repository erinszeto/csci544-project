Formulas are set in the 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ).

For example, the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs.

Budget authority = How much money Congress allows a federal agency to commit to spend. It represents a limit on funding and is generally what Congress focuses on in making most budgetary decisions. It is the legal basis to incur obligations. Most of the amounts mentioned in this report are budget authority. 2. Obligations = How much money agencies commit to spend. Obligations represent activities such as employing personnel, entering into contracts, and submitting purchase orders. 3. Outlays = How much money actually flows out of an agency's account. Outlays may differ from appropriations (budget authority) because, for example, payments on a contract may not flow out until a later year. For construction or delivery of services, budget authority may be committed (contracted) in one fiscal year and outlays may be spread across several fiscal years. 4. Program level = Sum of the activities supported or undertaken by an agency. A program level may be much higher than its budget authority for several reasons. User fees support some activities (e.g., food or border inspection). The agency makes loans; for example, a large loan authority (program level) is possible with a small budget authority (loan subsidy) because the loan is expected be repaid. The appropriated loan subsidy makes allowances for defaults and interest rate assistance. Transfers from other agencies, or funds are carried forward from prior years.

The dynamic changed near the turn of the century when farm bills began using mandatory funds for programs that usually were discretionary. Appropriators had not funded some programs as much as authorizers had desired, and authorizing committees wrote farm bills using the mandatory funding at their discretion. Tension arose over who should fund certain activities: authorizers with mandatory funding at their disposal, or appropriators with standard appropriating authority. Some question whether the CCC, which was created to fund the hard-to-predict farm commodity programs, should be used for programs that are not highly variable and are more often discretionary.

Funding was not provided for the Watershed Rehabilitation program in the original Senate-reported bill; however, an amendment was introduced and passed on the Senate floor to include $8 million for the program.", "The FY2011 long-term continuing resolution terminated funding for the Resource Conservation and Development (RC&D) program. The termination of funding continues in the enacted FY2012 appropriations, as requested by the Administration. The RC&D program was authorized in 1962 and consists of 375 designated RC&D areas across the country. An RC&D area is a locally defined multi-county area, sponsored and directed by an RC&D council. NRCS assists RC&D councils through an RC&D coordinator, who facilitates the development and implementation of an individualized and locally determined program (i.e., area plan). According to testimony offered by the chief of NRCS, approximately 80% of the RC&D budget is directed toward personnel. The chief also testified that termination of RC&D funding could mean that the 140 healthiest RC&D councils might survive on funds from elsewhere, while the other 235 will likely be dissolved. ", "Following termination of the RC&D program, as well as other funding reductions in FY2011, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved buyout and early retirement packages for 544 positions at USDA. Over 400 of the 544 buyout offers were made available to NRCS employees. It is unclear how many buyout offers have been accepted at NRCS and whether buyout packages will provide enough budgetary relief from the FY2011 and FY2012 funding reductions. ", "The enacted FY2012 appropriation also provides $7.5 million to a long-dormant program known as the Water Bank Program (WBP). The WBP was authorized in 1970 and operated until funding was eliminated in the FY1995 Agriculture Appropriations Act. According to FY1995 House and Senate appropriations report language, the program was duplicative of the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP, a current farm bill program) and less effective because of shorter contract lengths. Under the WBP, USDA entered into agreements with landowners and operators in migratory waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding areas for the conservation of specified wetlands. The program operated in 12 states, primarily in the northern part of the central flyway, and the northern and southern parts of the Mississippi flyway. The state that received the greatest benefit, in terms of most acres enrolled and payments received, was North Dakota. Although the conference report does not specify location, the Devils Lake and Stump Lake basins in North Dakota have been cited as the potential beneficiaries of the WBP funding. This is further supported by language in the conference report that waives the limitation (15%) on the share of funding that any single state may receive in order \"to ensure efficient administration of the program.\" Additionally, the WBP was originally intended to protect wetlands; however, the conference report allows \"flooded agricultural lands\" to be enrolled in the program. This could allow additional land into the program that may not have been allowed otherwise, such as land flooded by rising lake levels. Incidentally, the Administration requested that an unobligated balance of $745,000 in the WBP be rescinded and permanently cancelled because the last WBP agreement expired on December 31, 2010, effectively concluding the program. The enacted bill does not rescind the funding.

Funding comes from the CCC and therefore does not require an annual appropriation. The enacted FY2012 appropriation accepts many of the Administration's proposed $585 million of reductions to mandatory conservation programs and makes further cuts below authorized levels. The enacted appropriations reduces these programs by $929 million, which is $234 million more than the FY2011 reduction, $22 million more than the Senate-passed reduction, but not as much as the over $1 billion proposed reduction in the House bill ( Table 13 ; see also the discussion in \" Changes in Mandatory Program Spending (CHIMPS) \" and Table 8 ). ", "Funding for the largest conservation program, FSA's Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), would not change and was estimated at about $2.2 billion for FY2012. The enacted FY2012 appropriation adopts the House- and Senate-passed limits to EQIP, NRCS's largest working lands program, of $1.4 billion for FY2012\u2014a reduction of $350 million from the authorized level of $1.75 billion in the 2008 farm bill. The enacted reductions for other conservation programs are more extensive than the Senate-passed bill and USDA's proposal, but not as extensive as in the House bill ( Table 13 ). The primary differences between the enacted, House, and Senate bills are in the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP, $76.5 million reduction in the enacted appropriations compared to a $35 million reduction in the Senate bill and $210 million reduction in the House bill) and the Grasslands Reserve Program (GRP, estimated reduction of $30 million in the enacted appropriations and House bill compared to $50 million reduction in the Senate bill).", "Congress has included reductions in mandatory conservation programs each year since FY2003 in the annual agricultural appropriations law. It usually does not reduce funding as much as requested by the Administration. And because money is fungible, the savings from these reductions are not necessarily applied toward other conservation activities. Prior to the 2008 farm bill, reductions to conservation programs through appropriations law peaked in FY2006 with a reduction totaling $638 million ( Figure 12 ). Since the 2008 farm bill, reductions have primarily affected EQIP and the Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The reductions in FY2012 are the largest reductions to mandatory conservation programs to date. ", "Several conservation, environmental, and farm constituency groups that support conservation programs decry reductions from the funding commitment established in the farm bill. Members of the House Agriculture Committee also have expressed concern over the reductions, which some consider to be an encroachment of the committee's jurisdiction. House appropriators acknowledged these concerns with the following statement in the House report: \"The bill includes over $1.5 billion in limitations on mandatory programs, most of them funded in the 2008 farm bill and most of them in the conservation and bio-energy areas. We expect deep concern about these cuts from the Agriculture Committee, as well as persons supporting these programs.\"", "While most conservation advocates criticize reduced conservation funding for any fiscal year, additional emphasis was placed on reductions proposed in FY2012. Most farm bill program authorities will expire at the end of FY2012. Because CBO uses the last year of authorization to determine the 10-year funding baseline for the farm bill reauthorization, a reduction in the last year of a farm bill's authorization could multiply the effect on the 10-year farm bill.", "To address this concern, the enacted FY2012 appropriation extends select farm bill expiration dates to 2014. Authorities for these programs\u2014AMA, EQIP, WHIP, CSP, and FPP\u2014would expire in FY2012. The extension allows appropriators to score savings in FY2012, but not affect the overall farm bill baseline. CBO could score the amended conservation programs based on their authorized funding level in 2014, which is higher than their reduced level in the enacted FY2012 appropriations. Thus the reductions could have less of an effect on the Agriculture Committee's overall farm bill baseline. Just as the savings from conservation reductions in the enacted 2012 appropriations are not always redirected toward other conservation activities, the reestablishment of the farm bill baseline through expiring conservation programs does not guarantee that future farm bills will extend the same level of support for conservation.", "Programs that are reduced in the FY2012 act but do not have a baseline beyond 2012\u2014when most farm bill program authority expires\u2014are not extended. Programs such as WRP and GRP lack a budget baseline beyond 2012 and therefore reductions in 2012 would not affect the overall farm bill baseline. For this reason, some see these programs as more vulnerable to reductions in appropriations. For example, the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentives Program has authority to spend $50 million until September 30, 2012, and no baseline funding beyond 2012. Under enacted FY2012 appropriations, no funds are to be expended in FY2012, effectively terminating the program before its authorized expiration. Extending these programs' authority would require an offset or reduction elsewhere under current budget law and procedures.

This is done by highlighting various existing programs within USDA that are available to support local farmers; strengthen rural communities; promote healthy eating; protect natural resources; and provide grants, loans and support.

In response to demand for farm-to-school activities, certain USDA nutrition and domestic food programs, such as the farm-to-school and some fresh fruit and vegetable programs, also have been associated with the initiative.

The letter also requested evidence of USDA's congressional authority to spend money for \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" and to provide a full itemized accounting of all spending under the initiative.

Rather, it is a communications mechanism to further enable our existing programs to better meet their goals and serve constituents as defined in the respective authorizing legislation and regulations.
