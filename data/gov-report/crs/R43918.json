", "While decreased appropriations for the Department of Commerce mostly explain the overall decrease in CJS appropriations since FY2010, there have also been cuts in funding for DOJ and NASA. DOJ's FY2015 appropriation is 4.4% below its FY2010 appropriation, and NASA's FY2014 appropriation was 3.8% below its FY2010 appropriation. However, even though NASA received less in FY2015 than it did in FY2010, NASA's FY2015 appropriation is $1.379 billion more than its FY2006 appropriation. In addition, even with cuts to DOJ's appropriation since FY2010, Congress still appropriated $5.316 billion more for DOJ in FY2015 than it did in FY2006. Appropriations for DOJ increased because Congress appropriated increasing amounts for federal law enforcement and counter-terrorism efforts (e.g., the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and for the Office of the Federal Detention Trustee and the Bureau of Prisons to cover expenses associated with a rising number of federal detainees and prisoners.", "Funding for the NSF has, for the most part, steadily increased over the past 10 fiscal years. The NSF's appropriation increased in 8 of the 10 fiscal years between FY2006 and FY2015, and the decrease in the NSF's funding for FY2013 was the result of sequestration. Increased funding for the NSF has mostly resulted from Congress increasing funding for the NSF's Research and Related Activities account."], "subsections": []}]}}
