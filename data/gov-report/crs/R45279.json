Research on buprenorphine as a pain analgesic showed mixed effectiveness, though the drug did demonstrate lower rates of abuse than other opioid pain medications such as oxycodone. More than 20 years after it was first approved to treat pain, buprenorphine was approved by FDA as a treatment for opioid use disorder, under the trade names Subutex\u00ae and Suboxone\u00ae. The difference between the two products is that Suboxone\u00ae combines buprenorphine with naloxone \u2013 an opioid antagonist that blocks opioid receptors from being activated and thereby reduces the risk of abuse.

A 2014 review of buprenorphine efficacy trials conducted by Cochrane found that buprenorphine can be useful in helping individuals discontinue opioid drug use and maintain abstinence. The efficacy of buprenorphine in reducing opioid use, however, appeared to be dependent on several factors. For example, buprenorphine effectiveness seems to be dose dependent. It was only found to be superior to placebo when used at high doses. Buprenorphine was most effective when used at 16mg daily doses or higher, compared to low or medium doses of 15mg or less. The standard of care for buprenorphine treatment currently includes \"flexible dosing\" which involves individual clinicians determining dose based on each patient, rather than fixed dosing consisting of predetermined dosage regimens.

Retention is often essential to achieve the goals of the treatment, namely abstinence from drug use. Retention in treatment for individuals using buprenorphine increases linearly as both the dose of buprenorphine and length of time spent weaning off the medication increase. Put simply, research implies that as the dose of buprenorphine increases, retention in treatment improves. Similarly, with a longer period of tapering off the medication comes greater retention in the treatment. Taper length for buprenorphine is also associated with greater rates of abstinence from other opioids and successful completion of treatment. Therefore, the higher the dose of buprenorphine and the longer individuals are on the medication, the more likely they are to remain in treatment, abstain from opioid use, and successfully complete treatment. ", "Studies seem to indicate that methadone is better able to retain participants in treatment than buprenorphine, but it remains unclear why this is the case. It may be that buprenorphine, being a partial opioid agonist, is less satisfying than methadone because it does not produce a comparable euphoric effect. Also, buprenorphine may not typically be increased to effective doses quickly enough, resulting in more attrition early in treatment. It is also possible that buprenorphine does not retain people as well because mild withdrawal symptoms from the opioid of abuse may still be present for many patients while using the medication. Being only a partial opioid agonist, buprenorphine is also easier to discontinue without withdrawal symptoms of its own, which may make dropping out of treatment less difficult. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Are there any risks to buprenorphine?", "paragraphs": ["Buprenorphine is an opioid itself and therefore carries a risk for addiction and overdose. As a partial opioid agonist, the euphoric effects of buprenorphine are low compared to full agonists like heroin, fentanyl, morphine, or methadone. Therefore, the abuse potential for buprenorphine is generally considered to be less than that of full opioid agonists. Overdoses caused solely by buprenorphine are rare, with most overdoses occurring when the medication is used at the same time as other drugs such as benzodiazepines or other sedatives. Other adverse events associated with buprenorphine diverted intravenously, such as the transmission of communicable diseases, are similar to those of other misused injected substances. When buprenorphine is combined with naloxone, an opioid antagonist, it discourages misuse via injection which may contribute to buprenorphine's lower rates of abuse and overdose.

In one study, patients taking buprenorphine experienced half as many ambulatory care visits compared to those taking methadone, suggesting buprenorphine use was associated with fewer incidents endangering health and safety. Only a few studies have compared mortality rates between buprenorphine and methadone treatments; however, existing data suggest that methadone is associated with a higher potential for mortality in the first few weeks of treatment. Research indicates that rates of opioid overdose with buprenorphine are lower than those associated with methadone. Data from one study conducted in France showed that death rates attributable to methadone may be as much as three times greater than that of buprenorphine, though other studies found no significant differences.

Systematic reviews have become an increasingly important source of information for clinical practice and policymaking. They synthesize large amounts of information and provide better estimations of performance and generalizability than individual studies. ", "CRS' systematic review aimed to determine how well buprenorphine works in the treatment of opioid dependence compared to other treatments (such as methadone) or no treatment at all. Studies were included if they were comparisons of buprenorphine with other interventions in outpatient community settings in the United States and were published in the past five years. These included primary and secondary analyses of randomized control trials, quasi-experimental studies, and cohort studies. The CRS review concentrated on effectiveness rather than efficacy (see textbox under \" How well does buprenorphine maintain people in treatment? \"). Therefore, studies were excluded from this review if they examined efficacy, occurred in inpatient settings, focused on withdrawal, or occurred outside the United States. To identify original articles that met the inclusion criteria, we developed a search strategy for each of the three scientific databases used. We searched PubMed life science and biomedical database, PyscINFO behavioral sciences and mental health database, and CINAHL nursing journal database through July 21, 2017.", "Article Summaries", " Table A-1 provides full citations and abbreviated references to the 16 articles identified above.
