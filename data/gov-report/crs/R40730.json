For a glossary of budget terms and relevant websites, see the Appendix , \"Terminology and Web Resources.\"", "The L-HHS-ED bill typically is one of the more controversial of the regular appropriations bills, not only because of the size of its funding total and the scope of its programs, but also because of the continuing importance of various related issues, such as restrictions on the use of federal funds for abortion, human embryonic stem cell research, and needle exchange programs. This bill provides discretionary and mandatory funds to three federal departments and 13 related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA). Discretionary funding represents less than one-quarter of the total in the bill. Among the various appropriations bills, L-HHS-ED is the largest single source of discretionary funds for domestic (non-defense) federal programs (the Department of Defense bill is the largest source of discretionary funds among all federal programs).", "This section presents several overview tables on funding in the bill, particularly discretionary funding, and discusses related issues such as 302(b) allocations and advance appropriations.

Unless otherwise specified, appropriations levels in this report refer to program level amounts . Current year discretionary appropriations represent discretionary appropriations in a given bill for the current year, plus discretionary appropriations for the current year that were enacted in prior years\u2014for example, FY2010 appropriations that were enacted in the FY2009 act. As the annual congressional appropriations process unfolds, current year discretionary appropriations, including scorekeeping adjustments (see below), are measured against the 302(b) allocation ceilings (discussed later in this report). Note that media reports and comments from the Administration about appropriations activities typically cite figures representing the current year discretionary totals rather than the program levels in the bill. Advance appropriations are funds that will not become available until after the fiscal year for which the appropriations are enacted (for example, funds for certain education programs like Title I Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies for the Education of the Disadvantaged that were included in the FY2009 act that could not be spent before FY2010 at the earliest). Scorekeeping adjustments are made to account for special funding situations, as monitored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "Because appropriations may consist of mixtures of budget authority enacted in various years, both of the summary measures mentioned above are frequently used: program level appropriations and current year appropriations. How are these measures related? For an \"operational definition,\" program level funding equals (a) current year, plus (b) advances for future years, minus (c) advances from prior years, and minus (d) scorekeeping adjustments. Alternatively, current year funding is derived by taking the program level (total in the bill), subtracting the advances for future years, adding in the advances from prior years, and applying the scorekeeping adjustments.

In the first stage, Congress establishes the 302(a) allocations \u2014the maximum spending totals for a given fiscal year that are allowed for each House and Senate committee with jurisdiction over spending legislation, including both authorizations and appropriations. This task is typically accomplished through the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, where spending totals are specified through the statement of managers in the conference report. In years when the House and Senate do not reach a budget agreement, these totals may be set through leadership arrangements in each chamber.

This process creates the basis for enforcing discretionary budget discipline, since any appropriations bill reported with a total above the ceiling is subject to a point of order. The 302(b) allocations can and often do get adjusted during the year as the various appropriations bills progress toward final enactment. Table 5 shows the 302(b) discretionary allocations for the FY2010 L-HHS-ED appropriations determined by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, together with the comparable amount for the FY2009 appropriations.

Advance appropriations may be used to meet several objectives.

The law appropriated $2.3 billion for the PHSSEF, $909 million (65.0%) more than in FY2009. Among its activities funded within the PHSSEF, HHS has responsibility for procuring and stockpiling emergency medical countermeasures. To better align programmatic and financial responsibilities, the President and Congress agreed to transfer all of the remaining balances in the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF) from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to HHS. The funds were originally appropriated as multi-year money to DHS in FY2004, to remain available until FY2013. According to the FY2010 L-HHS-ED conference report, \"As of October 31, 2009, data from HHS indicate that $3,033 million remains unobligated and available in the Project BioShield SRF\" ( H.Rept. 111-366 , p. 1045). As one portion of countermeasures funding, the President requested availability in FY2010 of $1,264 million of the SRF money. The House approved $764 million, choosing to transfer $500 million of the BioShield money to NIH. The Senate committee agreed with the request for $1,264 million. The law provided $960 million for the activities, and transferred $304 million to NIH. Also within the PHSSEF, pandemic influenza preparedness was funded at $585 million in regular FY2009 appropriations. The President and Congress agreed to decrease the amount by $231 million, to $354 million for FY2010. HHS also has $7.7 billion in supplemental FY2009 funds for pandemic influenza contingencies, available until expended, that were provided in P.L. 111-32 in June 2009. L-HHS-ED acts since FY1998 have barred federal funding for needle and syringe exchange programs set up to prevent HIV infection in intravenous drug users. The House bill as passed replaced the ban with a restriction on such programs being located within 1,000 feet of facilities used by children. The Senate bill as reported retained the prior ban. The conference agreement prohibited funding for such programs in any location that local public health or law enforcement agencies determine to be inappropriate (\u00a7505 of P.L. 111-117 , Division D).", "ARRA provided HHS with an additional $21.9 billion in discretionary funding for FY2009, including $10.4 billion for NIH.

As evidence of the perennial volatility of this issue, these provisions have been subject to periodic revision during the annual consideration of L-HHS-ED appropriations. From FY1977 to FY1993, abortions could be funded only when the life of the mother was endangered. The 103 rd Congress modified the provisions to permit federal funding of abortions in cases of rape or incest. The FY1998 L-HHS-ED appropriations, P.L. 105-78 , extended the Hyde provisions to prohibit the use of federal funds to buy managed care packages that include abortion coverage, except in the cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. The FY1999 L-HHS-ED appropriations, P.L. 105-277 , continued the FY1998 Hyde Amendments with two added provisions: (1) a clarification to ensure that the restrictions apply to all trust fund programs (namely, Medicare), and (2) an assurance that Medicare + Choice plans (now Medicare Advantage) cannot require the provision of abortion services.

The FY2006 through FY2010 L-HHS-ED appropriations retained the Weldon amendment language and the Hyde restrictions.

The Obama decision directed NIH to issue new guidelines for the conduct of embryonic stem cell research. Draft guidelines were released on April 23, 2009, and final guidelines were issued on July 6, 2009. In December 2009, NIH created a new registry of human embryonic stem cell lines that are eligible for use in research supported by federal funds under the 2009 guidelines. As of February 1, 2010, a total of 43 stem cell lines were listed in the new registry.

Funding of $500 million was requested for Early Childhood Grants, intended to encourage local educational agencies (LEAs) to use Title I-A funding to implement or expand high-quality early childhood education programs. An additional $300 million was requested for The Early Learning Challenge Fund, intended to provide competitive grants to states to improve the standards and quality of early learning programs serving children from birth to age five. Neither the House nor the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding for Early Childhood Grants or for the Early Learning Challenge Fund. No funding was provided for these programs in the conference agreement, as enacted in P.L. 111-117 . The Administration also recommended funding for four new smaller programs in FY2010\u2014a Promise Neighborhoods Initiative at $10 million, a Teach for America Initiative at $15 million, a High School Graduation Initiative at $50 million, and a Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative at $30 million. Both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding the Promise Neighborhoods Initiative at $10 million in FY2010. The House recommended providing up to $15 million for the proposed Teach for America Initiative; the Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $20 million for the initiative. Both the House and the Senate Committee on Appropriations supported funding the High School Graduation Initiative at the Administration's proposed funding level of $50 million. The Senate Committee recommended $30 million for the Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative; the House did not recommend funding for the initiative. The conference agreement, as enacted in P.L. 111-117 , provided $18 million for Teach for America and $50 million for the High School Graduation Initiative.

The conference agreement, as enacted in P.L. 111-117 , provided $546 million for School Improvement Grants in FY2010. The budget proposal requested funding for an expanded Striving Readers program of $370 million for FY2010, $335 million more than FY2009 funding. The House recommended funding the Striving Readers program at $146 million for FY2010. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended funding of $263 million; its Striving Readers proposal would have eliminated the Early Reading First Program as a separate program, instead incorporating it into the Striving Readers Program. The conference agreement, as enacted in P.L. 111-117 , eliminated Early Reading First as a separate program; it increased the funding for the Striving Readers program to $250 million and expanded it to cover children from birth through high school.

For FY2009, the maximum total grant award was $5,350, consisting of a maximum award from discretionary funds of $4,860 and a maximum award from mandatory funds of $490. The FY2010 House bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation did not accept the proposal to make all Pell Grant funding mandatory. Under both versions of H.R. 3293 , the maximum Pell Grant would have equaled $4,860 in discretionary funding plus a maximum of $690 in mandatory funding for a maximum total award of $5,550. Using the congressional assumption that the Pell Grant program would continue to have discretionary funding, the budget proposal would have supported discretionary funding of $17.5 billion in FY2010, an increase of $207 million over FY2009.
