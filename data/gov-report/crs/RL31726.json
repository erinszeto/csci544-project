Some observers argue that the Administration has not beenpaying enough attention to the region and to instability in several countries. They maintain that theUnited States, faced with other pressing foreign policy problems like the war in Iraq and the globalanti-terrorist campaign, has fallen back to a policy of benign neglect of the region. In contrast, othersmaintain that the United States has an active policy toward Latin America and point to theconsiderable assistance and support provided to Colombia and its neighbors as they combat drugtrafficking and terrorist groups. They also point to the momentum toward free trade in the regionthrough negotiation of numerous free trade agreements, and to increased bilateral and regionalcooperation on security issues.", "Congressional attention to Latin America in the 108th Congress continued to focus on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism efforts in the Andean region, trade issues, and potentialthreats to democracy and stability. U.S. counter-narcotics efforts focused on continuation of theAndean Counterdrug Initiative supporting Colombia and its neighbors in their struggle against drugtrafficking and drug-financed terrorist groups. With regard to trade, Congress approvedimplementing legislation for a bilateral free trade agreement with Chile in July 2003; the UnitedStates signed a combined U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement(DR-CAFTA) on August 5, 2004, but Congress did not consider implementing legislation before theend of the 108th Congress. Congress also paid increased attention to economic, social, and politicaltensions in South America that threatened democratic order, particularly in the Andean region. Inthe Caribbean, Haiti's persistent poverty and political instability remained a congressional concern,as did assistance to Haiti and other Caribbean nations in the aftermath of devastating damageincurred by hurricanes and storms in 2004. Congress also continued to debate the appropriate U.S.policy approach to Cuba, the region's only holdout to democracy, as it did for the past several years.

", "In 2002 and 2003, the region as a whole experienced slower economic growth with 2002 registering a gross domestic product (GDP) decline of 0.6% and a per capita income decline ofalmost 2%, the worst economic performance in almost two decades. Argentina, Uruguay, andVenezuela suffered the deepest recessions, skewing the regional data downward, while most othercountries had slow, but positive, growth rates. For 2003, regional economic growth was estimatedto be 1.5%, with a per capita income increase of 0.2%.

Every country in the region, with theexception of Haiti, experienced positive economic growth, and per capita income for the region asa whole increased by an estimated 4% for the year. (1)", "In South America, the economic downturn in 2002 and 2003 increased political pressure on elected governments and led some in the region to question democracy and the democraticfree-market model of development. The Andean governments of Bolivia and Peru faced violentprotests, which in Bolivia, led to the resignation of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada on October17, 2003, just 15 months after he was elected. Colombia faced challenges from drug traffickingorganizations, as well as from two left-wing guerrilla groups and a rightist paramilitary group, allof which, combined, have been responsible for thousands of deaths each year. Venezuela wasplagued by political polarization between supporters and opponents of President Hugo Chavez,although Chavez's victory in the August 2004 recall referendum has the potential of reducingpolarization. Argentina's democratic political system was under considerable stress after socialprotests over economic conditions led to the resignation of a democratically elected President inDecember 2001. The political and financial situation eventually stabilized, and bold policy movesin the areas of human rights and institutional reform by President N\u00c3\u00a9stor Kirchner, inaugurated inMay 2003, helped restore Argentines' faith in government. ", "In Central America, countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua emerged from the turbulent 1980s and 1990s with democratic institutions more firmly entrenched, yet violent crimewas rampant. While the 1996 peace accords in Guatemala brought an end to the 36-year civilconflict, the government did not fully implement substantive reforms associated with the peace planand the human rights situation remains poor. A new Guatemalan President, Oscar Berger, waselected in December 2003 and was inaugurated on January 14, 2004. Observers are hoping that hewill improve upon the performance of his predecessor.

The agency supported such activities as education, poverty reduction, health care,conservation, natural disaster mitigation and reconstruction, counter-narcotics and alternativedevelopment, and HIV/AIDS prevention and education. In addition, the United States provides foodassistance, anti-terrorism assistance, and security assistance. The Peace Corps was active in manyLatin American and Caribbean nations.

Through October 2004, the United States committed or obligated $22.6 million in such assistance. On October 5, 2004, the House approved H.Con.Res. 496 (Lee) expressing support forthe provision of humanitarian assistance to Caribbean nations devastated by the storms. Subsequently, Congress approved $100 million in emergency supplemental funding for the regionin the aftermath of the storms ( H.R. 4837 , P.L. 108-324 ).

The proposal wassomewhat similar to legislation proposed by Senator McCain, S. 1461 , andRepresentatives Kolbe and Flake, H.R. 2899 , but no action was taken on thesemeasures. Prospects for action was thwarted by opposition from those who wanted to providebroader amnesty to undocumented workers in the United States as well as from those who believedthat such a proposal constituted a reward to those people living in the United States illegally.", "President Bush met with other hemispheric leaders at a Special Summit of the Americas held in Monterrey Mexico from January 12-13, 2004.

U.S. policy was criticized for having returned to a policy of benign neglect as theAdministration focused its attention on such pressing problems as the global anti-terrorismcampaign, the war in Iraq, and homeland security. They argued that the United States cannot affordto let the region become unstable politically or economically, because it is an important market forU.S. exports, and an important supplier of U.S. energy needs, and increased instability could leadto increased illegal migration.", "Others suggest that despite its attention to crises and issues worldwide, the United States maintained an active policy toward Latin America. They point to the momentum for free trade inthe region and to the assistance and support provided to Colombia and its neighbors as they combatdrug trafficking and terrorist groups in the Andean region.

For over two decades, U.S. policy towards the AndeanRegion has focused almost exclusively on counternarcotics efforts, that is, curbing the cultivationof coca leaf, its transformation into cocaine, and its subsequent trafficking. Success in controllingcoca and coca base production in Bolivia and Peru seemed to be offset in the mid-to-late 1990s bythe expansion of coca cultivation into uncontrolled areas of Colombia, which previously had servedonly for the refinement of coca base into cocaine. In the last few years, drug traffickers have alsobegun to cultivate opium poppies and transform them into high-grade heroin in Colombia. Eightypercent of the world's cocaine originates in Colombia.", "In 2000, the 106th Congress approved expanded political, economic, and military assistance to combat drug production and trafficking in Colombia under the Clinton Administration's proposalto support Plan Colombia ( P.L. 106-246 ), an initiative of then President Pastrana of Colombia(1998-2002). In 2002, it approved the Bush Administration's Andean Regional Initiative (ARI), thecontinuation of the Clinton policy in Colombia and a sizable expansion of assistance to six ofColombia's neighbors: Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela ( P.L. 107-206 and P.L. 107-115 ). ARI funding included antinarcotics assistance, known as the Andean CounterdrugInitiative (ACI), as well as Foreign Military Financing, Development Assistance, Child Survival andHealth funds, and Economic Support Funds. The 107th Congress also approved a major shift in U.S.Andean policy by authorizing the use of U.S. assistance to help Colombia counter threats to itsstability from illegal armed groups of the left and right which substantially finance their operationsthrough the drug trade.", "The 108th Congress continued to scrutinize indicators of the effectiveness of U.S. assistance to the Andean region. (For FY2004, the Bush Administration budget request did not use the term\"Andean Regional Initiative,\" instead making separate requests for the Andean CounterdrugInitiative, Foreign Military Financing, and the other development assistance programs from theirregular accounts.) According to United States and Colombian officials, coca cultivation dropped15% in Colombia during 2002 and 21% in 2003. This marked the first reduction in acreage devotedto coca cultivation in Colombia. Poppy cultivation was reduced by 24% in 2002. It is believed thatthe Plan Colombia goal of having sprayed 50% of the country's coca crop by the end of 2005 mayhave been accomplished two years ahead of schedule. It should be noted that spraying does notprevent, although it may discourage, the replanting of illicit crops. However, according to theAdministration, during 2002 and 2003, coca cultivation picked up in Bolivia, reversing a decliningtrend there. Peru's coca cultivation in 2003 decreased 15%. ", "Critics of U.S. policy contend that winning the war against drugs is a losing proposition as long as demand continues. They argue that policy should focus on the \"demand side\" because they viewproviding treatment for the users of illegal narcotics as the only permanent solution. The BushAdministration has, however, recast the debate, arguing that the United States faces not only a threatfrom drug production and trafficking in the Andean region, but also from the increasing instabilitybrought on by insurgent guerrilla organizations that are fueled by the drug trade. To the BushAdministration and its supporters, the assistance to Colombia is necessary to help shore up ademocratic government besieged by drug-supported leftist and rightist armed groups. Substantialassistance to Colombia's neighbors is warranted, they argue, because of an increasing threat fromthe spillover of violence from Colombia, and the possible resurgence of drug cultivation in somecountries and its spread from Colombia to others. ", "Although some critics agree with this assessment, they argue that the Bush plan overemphasizes military and counter-drug assistance and provides inadequate support for protecting human rightsand encouraging a peace process in Colombia. In particular, they express concern that currentmilitary assistance is drawing the United States into Colombia's guerrilla conflict in support ofarmed forces which, they charge, have substantial ties to rightist groups guilty of gross violations ofhuman rights. This concern grew with the August 2002 inauguration of President Alvaro Uribe, whois viewed by some as tolerating the actions of rightist armed groups, despite his statements that hewill neither tolerate violence against nor on behalf of the government. In July 2003, President Uribeannounced that an agreement had been reached with the rightist paramilitary umbrella organization,the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), that would result in its disarmament by the endof 2005. Part of the demobilization plan entails a controversial legislative proposal by PresidentUribe to grant conditional amnesties to illegal combatants who disarm and provide some form ofrestitution under court supervision. Critics also voice skepticism that U.S.-funded aerial fumigationand alternative development projects can effectively cut coca and poppy cultivation, and provideadequate livelihoods to induce growers to voluntarily give up illicit crops.", "ACI and Related Funding Programs. The United States has made a significant commitment of funds and material support to help Colombia and theAndean region fight drug trafficking since the development of Plan Colombia in 1999. Congresspassed legislation providing $1.3 billion in assistance for FY2000 ( P.L. 106-246 ) and has provideda total of $3.7 billion from FY2000 through FY2004 in both State Department and DefenseDepartment counternarcotics accounts. Since 2002, Congress has granted expanded authority to usecounternarcotics funds for a unified campaign to fight both drug trafficking and terroristorganizations in Colombia. The three main guerrilla groups in Colombia participate in drugproduction and trafficking, and have been designated foreign terrorist organizations by the StateDepartment. For FY2004, Congress approved $731 million for the Andean Counterdrug Initiative( P.L. 108-199 ). In November 2004, Congress again approved the Administration's request of $731million for FY2005 ( P.L. 108-447 .)", "The ACI account funds, among other things, support for the eradication of illegal crops and the destruction of laboratories, as well as economic and social development. Congress also approved$110 million in FY2004 in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Colombia. In the past, FMFfunding has been used to train and equip a Colombian Army brigade to protect the Ca\u00c3\u00b1o-Lim\u00c3\u00b3n oilpipeline in Colombia. The FMF request for FY2005 is $108 million. Congress has regularlymaintained a number of provisions relating to human rights, aerial fumigation, and prohibiting U.S.military personnel from participating in combat operations. Current law also imposed a cap of 400each on U.S. military and civilian personnel deployed in support of Plan Colombia ( P.L. 106-246 ,Section 3204(b)through(d) as amended by P.L. 107-115 ). In response to an Administration request,Congress approved increasing the cap on military personnel to 800 and contract employees to 600in the FY2005 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 108-375 , H.R. 4200 , H.Rept.108-767 ).", "The Killing and Capture of U.S. Citizens. Congress has expressed repeated concerns regarding the capture and killing of various U.S. citizensby the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the first case occurred on February 13,2003. On that morning, a Cessna 208 aircraft carrying four American contractors and a Colombiancrash landed in the Colombian province of Caquet\u00c3\u00a1. The pilot and one of the contractors were shot,the other three contractors were captured by the FARC. Subsequently, in March 2003, three moreAmerican contractors were killed in a plane crash as they were searching for the capturedcontractors. Both planes involved in these crashes were Cessna 208s, which some contractemployees have complained are not suitable for use in Colombia because they cannot perform thesteep climbs required by mountainous terrain. A fifth American was killed in April 2003 when hisT-65 air tractor crashed while spraying opium poppies. While these flights were consideredaccidents, fumigation flights have been fired on, and since August 2003, two planes have beendowned by hostile fire. On August 25, 2003, a spray aircraft piloted by a U.S. citizen was shotdown, resulting in injuries to the pilot. An OV Bronco aircraft was downed on September 21, 2003,reportedly by hostile fire, killing its Costa Rican pilot. The ELN claimed responsibility for theshootdown.

Following the April 2001 accidental shooting down of an airplane carrying U.S. missionaries in Peru by the Peruvianmilitary working with U.S. assistance, the Air Bridge Denial Program, an effort to intercept drugtrafficking flights, was suspended in both Peru and Colombia. Congress inserted language in theforeign aid funding bills requiring that safety enhancements be instituted before such flights couldresume in Peru. Although discussions are still ongoing with Peru, Secretary of State Powellrecommended to President Bush on August 5, 2003, that flights be resumed in Colombia afteragreement was reached with Colombian authorities on protocols to ensure enhanced safety. Theprogram resumed soon thereafter. The FY2005 request was for $21 million, and Congress approved$11.2 million.

This outlook was reflected in the spirited debate overTrade Promotion Authority (TPA), which continued for eight years before legislation permitting\"fast-track\" approval of trade agreements was passed in August 2002. It was also seen in the debatethat emerged over the implementing legislation for the U.S.-Chile FTA, among others, that waspassed by Congress in July 2003. In the meantime, the Bush Administration is pursuing, and insome cases has completed, other FTAs with Latin American countries that will require congressionalapproval before they can take effect.", "U.S.-Chile FTA. On January 1, 2004, the U.S.-Chile free trade agreement (FTA) went into effect. The United States and Chile signed the longanticipated FTA in Miami, Florida on June 6, 2003, concluding a 14-round negotiation process thatbegan on December 6, 2000. Congress held hearings before the House Ways and Means, SenateFinance, and both Judiciary Committees. The House passed the U.S.-Chile Free TradeImplementation Act ( H.R. 2738 ) on July 24, 2003 by a vote of 270 to 156, followed bythe Senate one week later, 66 to 31. President George W. Bush signed the implementing legislationinto law ( P.L. 108-77 ) on September 3, 2003. The FTA allows 85% of all consumer and industrialgoods to be traded duty free immediately, with 75% of tariffs on farm goods and Chile's luxury taxon automobiles to be eliminated within the first four years, and tariffs on sensitive goods tradedbetween the two countries to be phased out over a period of up to 12 years. Chile's rules governinginvestment, services trade, intellectual property rights, labor, environment, dispute resolution, andother issues critical to the United States are also clarified and made more transparent. There are noprovisions on antidumping or countervailing duties, key trade issues for Chile and Latin Americain general. Because multiple FTAs are now being contemplated, some Members of Congressexpressed serious reservations about certain provisions in the U.S.-Chile agreement becoming\"templates\" for future FTAs. In particular, congressional hearings focused on provisions related tolabor, capital controls, and the temporary entry for business persons.", "U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America FTA (DR-CAFTA). On December 17, 2003, the United States concluded negotiationson a U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) with four of the five Central AmericanCommon Market (CACM) countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua). CostaRica agreed to CAFTA on January 25, 2004, following additional bilateral discussions with theUnited States on various sensitive issues. The agreement was signed by all five parties on May 28,2004, at the Organization of American States in Washington, D.C. Separately, the United States andthe Dominican Republic on March 15, 2004, concluded negotiations on a similar FTA. On August5, 2004, all seven countries signed the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free TradeAgreement (DR-CAFTA). Because of the many controversies surrounding the FTA, noimplementing legislation was introduced in the 108th Congress.", "The DR-CAFTA negotiations were ground breaking in trying to reconcile the needs of five (and eventually six) different U.S. trading partners within a \"bilateral\" framework. The DR-CAFTA wasnegotiated in part as a regional agreement in which all parties would be subject to the same basicframework and rules, but each country was also able to define its own market access schedules. Thisflexibility allowed Costa Rica to delay joining the agreement and for the Dominican Republic to beadded as a new partner when it acceded to \"the same set of obligations and commitments.\" It alsoappended a separately negotiated schedule for market access.", "If the DR-CAFTA is implemented, more than 80% of U.S. consumer and industrial exports would become duty-free immediately, with all tariffs removed within 10 years. Tariffs would go tozero on information technology products, agricultural and construction equipment, paper products,chemicals, and medical/scientific equipment, among others. Over half of current U.S. farm exportsto the region would become duty free immediately, including \"high quality\" cuts of beef, cotton,wheat, soybeans, certain fruits, and vegetables, processed food products, and wine. For the mostsensitive agricultural products, tariffs and tariff rate quotas would be phased out over 15-20 years,with sugar, white corn, potatoes, and onions escaping full duty-free treatment for some countries. Advances were also made in other areas important to the United States including services trade,intellectual property rights, investment, and government procurement.", "The DR-CAFTA, however, faces political uncertainty. In the United States, some industry groups oppose liberalizing trade rules for the region's major exports, apparel and agricultural goods,and labor advocates also resist the agreement. For the U.S. Congress, reconciling these diverseinterests is a difficult task given the competing nature of the negotiating goals. Also, support for theagreement has been jeopardized by the Dominican Republic's passage of a revenue bill that includesa 25% tax on beverages containing high fructose corn syrup. The USTR considers the tax \"to beinconsistent with the Dominican Republic's obligations under the agreement\" and has recommendedto Congress that implementing legislation not include the Dominican Republic, unless the tax isrepealed. As of mid-December 2004, the Dominican Senate had voted to repeal the tax, but furtherlegislative action is needed, leaving the fate of the DR-CAFTA unclear.", "Panama Trade Agreement. On April 26, 2004, the United States and Panama initiated negotiations for a bilateral FTA. By building on theDR-CAFTA framework, negotiators have been able to move quickly. To date, six rounds have beencompleted, with a seventh round scheduled to begin January 10, 2005. Panama is a services-basedeconomy, which distinguishes it, and the trade negotiations, from those of its Central Americanneighbors. Agriculture and maritime concerns have been the most challenging issues to negotiate. The United States also has sought to loosen Panamanian rules limiting activities of foreignprofessionals and is focused intently on government procurement provisions, given Panama's planto invest some $8 billion to increase the capacity of the Panama Canal. Unlike the DR-CAFTA,there is little textile and apparel trade, and labor issues have not taken on the same importance. Panama is also a beneficiary of the Caribbean Basin Initiative's (CBI) unilateral trade preferencesof the United States and is among the largest recipients of U.S. foreign direct investment in LatinAmerica. Panama seeks to solidify U.S. market access and investment benefits in the FTA. For theUnited States, Panama has long been of strategic commercial and security importance, even as asmall trading partner. Much of the draft agreement has been completed. Sensitive market accessissues, especially agriculture, and government procurement issues related to projects in the PanamaCanal Authority, have yet to be finalized. The agreement is expected to be concluded early in 2005,and implementing legislation may be introduced in the 109th Congress.", "Free Trade Area of the Americas. The Free Trade Area of the Americas is a regional trade proposal among 34 nations of the Western Hemisphere thatwould promote economic integration by creating, as originally conceived, a comprehensive(presumably WTO-plus) framework for reducing tariff and nontariff barriers to trade and investment. Formal negotiations commenced in 1998 and the process so far has led to three draft texts, the lastreleased at the eighth trade ministerial meeting that took place November 17-21, 2003, in Miami.
