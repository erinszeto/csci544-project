In addition, interest on bonds issued by certain nonprofit entities and authorities is also exempt from federal income taxes. Together, these tax preferences are estimated to generate a federal revenue loss of $309.9 billion over the 2012 to 2016 budget window. Along with this direct \"cost,\" economic theory holds that tax-exempt bonds distort investment decisions (leading to over-investment in this sector). As with many other tax preferences, the income exclusion is being examined as part of fundamental tax reform.", "Generally, the tax preference directly benefits two groups: issuers and investors. Issuers, principally state and local governments (but also certain nonprofits and qualified private entities) benefit from a current lower cost of borrowing. Investors, particularly those in the top tax brackets, benefit from mostly tax-free income. In particular, the top 10% of all earners realize more than 77% of the total reported tax-exempt interest income.", "This report first explains the tax preference and the distribution of the receipt of tax-exempt interest. An analysis of the impact of several different proposals then follows. Included in this analysis are proposals to (1) cap the benefit at a specific income tax rate (as offered in the FY2013 budget), (2) eliminate the tax preference and lower overall rates (as proposed in the Simpson-Bowles (SB) deficit reduction plan), and (3) change the current tax exclusion for investors to a tax credit (or subsidy) for issuers (as proposed in the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Revenue Options report). The proposals differ in the relative impact on investors and issuers.", "The proposal in the President's FY2013 budget would be felt relatively equally by issuers and investors and would not address the economic inefficiency of using tax-exempt bonds to encourage investment in public capital. The SB tax reform plan would eliminate the tax preference thereby eliminating the economic inefficiency generated by the current tax preference, but would also eliminate the relative benefit of tax-exempt bonds for both issuers and investors. The CBO proposal also eliminates the tax preference for investors, but would preserve the issuer preference albeit at a lower level. The economic inefficiency arising from the current tax preference would also be eliminated by the CBO proposal. The CBO proposal can be modified to yield a roughly equivalent subsidy to the current tax-exempt bond preference for issuers.", "This report will be updated as significant new proposals or legislative events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The current budget situation has prompted Congress to examine a variety of revenue raising options. Repealing or modifying some or all of the long list of so-called tax expenditures is often included as part of those options. The exclusion from income of the interest paid on state and local government debt is one such tax expenditure. There are three primary types of proposals that include changes to state and local government bonds\u2014capping the preference, eliminating the preference, and changing the preference to a direct issuer subsidy. These three types can be seen in the following proposals. The President's FY2013 budget proposal would include partial elimination of the tax preference by capping the preference at the 28% marginal tax rate. The Simpson-Bowles (SB) deficit reduction plan proposes complete elimination of the tax preference. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \"Revenue Options\" report proposes changing the tax exclusion for investors to a direct tax subsidy to issuers .", "One of the cited reasons for the elimination (or at least modification) of the tax exclusion for interest on state and local government bonds (tax-exempt bonds) is that the preference is a financially and economically inefficient tool for inducing public capital investment. In short, the federal revenue loss is greater than the subsidy to state and local governments. Thus, modifying, eliminating, or reducing the tax preference could generate federal revenue and make the federal tax code more economically efficient.", "Policymakers must weigh a variety of competing concerns when evaluating these proposals to modify tax-exempt bonds. Issuers, such as governments and certain private entities, benefit from lower cost of borrowing and relatively high-income investors benefit from the resulting tax-free income. With the proposals presented here, issuers would likely encounter higher borrowing costs and relative wealthy investors would lose a significant tax preference. In particular, the top 10% of all earners realize more than 77% of the total reported tax-exempt interest income. The reduced benefits accruing to issuers and these investors, however, should be weighed against the benefit of a potentially more efficient (and to some, equitable) federal income tax.

The Administration's 2013 budget includes a tax expenditure estimate of $227.5 billion for the 2013 to 2017 budget window for public purpose state and local government bonds ( Table 1 ). The 2013 budget also estimates that non-governmental tax-exempt bonds (so-called qualified private activity bonds) will generate an additional $78.7 billion in revenue losses over the same time frame. The single largest non-governmental tax expenditure for tax-exempt bonds is for non-profit hospital bonds ($26.9 billion). The column identified \"Rank\" in Table 1 is the position of the provision in the list of all 173 federal tax expenditures contained in the 2013 budget.", "How this tax subsidy is distributed across taxpayers underlies the analysis of the potential impact of tax reform proposals. The President's 2013 budget would cap the exclusion of interest income from tax-exempt bonds at 28%.

Consequently, proposals that change the tax rules for tax-exempt bonds will have a greater impact on higher-income taxpayers.", "The Internal Revenue Service, Statistics of Income Division (SOI), publishes annual summaries of the composition of income for all tax returns. Relatively few returns report earning tax-exempt interest income. In 2009, approximately 4.5% of all returns (6.3 million) reported tax-exempt interest income. As income increases, however, the percentage of returns reporting tax-exempt interest income rises significantly. Almost two-thirds (64.1%) of returns with adjusted gross income (AGI) over $1 million included tax-exempt interest income.", " Table 2 presents the distribution of interest income by AGI with a break at the $200,000 income threshold. The $200,000 income level roughly approximates the income threshold at which policymakers have discussed reducing preferences in the tax code\u2014as in the FY2013 budget proposal. In 2009, 80.6% of returns reported AGI under $200,000. These returns with AGI of less than $200,000 accounted for just 50.5% ($37.2 billion) of tax-exempt interest income. The remaining 19.4% of returns with AGI above $200,000 reported 49.5% ($36.4 billion) of tax-exempt interest income. ", "The data by broad AGI groups presented in IRS published reports provides a reasonable assessment of the distribution of tax-exempt interest income. The IRS also releases data for public use that can be organized to address different policy questions. For example, Figure 1 reports the portion of tax-exempt interest reported by tax return decile for the 2007 tax year. The deciles for the figure are created by sorting all returns by AGI from lowest to highest. The first decile is the first 10% of returns and includes many returns with \"negative\" income. Each successive decile represents the next 10%. The deciles provide a smoother climb up through the range of AGI. The tenth or highest decile, returns with AGI above $113,400, reported over 77% of all tax-exempt interest income and exceeded total AGI for the cohort. Interestingly, the bottom decile, with negative aggregate AGI, actually claimed 2.0% of the interest income and was the only other cohort with tax-exempt interest income that exceeded aggregate AGI. This income cohort likely includes filers that in previous years had been in higher income cohorts and are temporarily in this lowest cohort. This cohort also includes retired taxpayers that do not earn wage and salary income.", "Within the top decile, tax-exempt interest income is even further concentrated in the top one percent of AGI. In 2007, the top one percent of returns all reported AGI over $407,500 and earned 49.0% of all tax-exempt interest income. Clearly, the benefit of the tax exclusion is concentrated in the upper income groups. Thus, modification of the tax preference will impact this income cohort the most."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Value of the Tax-Exemption to Issuers", "paragraphs": ["Generally, the interest rate on tax-exempt bonds is considered the \"cost of capital\" for the issuing entity.

Thus, the relative difference between taxable bonds and tax-exempt bonds (or spread) is a straightforward way to evaluate or quantify the value of the interest exclusion to issuers.", "The next section reviews selected proposals that would modify the tax preferences for tax-exempt bonds.

More generally, the market interest rate where the after-tax rate of return on a taxable bond matches the tax-exempt rate is commonly called the \"market clearing rate.\" If some of the interest on a tax-exempt bond becomes taxable, then the market clearing rate will increase.", "The change in the market clearing rate is a rough gauge of the relative impact of the proposed modification to the tax treatment of interest paid on tax-exempt bonds. In Table 3 , the column labeled \"Hypothetical Taxable Bond Rate\" is a taxable investment that serves as an investment alternative to tax-exempt bonds. Under current law (the third column), higher income investors would be willing to accept ever lower tax-exempt bond returns because the after-tax return to taxable bonds, the alternative, declines with the marginal tax rate. For example, a taxpayer in the 35.0% marginal tax bracket would earn a 3.90% after-tax rate of return on a taxable bond with a hypothetical 6% pre-tax rate of return. Thus, any tax-exempt bond that pays interest that is greater than 3.90% would provide a higher after-tax rate of return.", "Under the proposed cap the tax benefit is capped at the 28% marginal tax bracket. As a result, previously tax-exempt interest would be taxed for those in tax brackets above 28%. The higher required yield for the tax-exempt bond under this policy reflects the higher marginal tax rate which exceeds the proposed cap. The after-tax rate of return for partially tax-exempt bonds under the proposal for taxpayers in the 35.0% marginal tax bracket would rise to 4.19%, a 0.29% \"premium\" when compared to current law for a taxable investment with a 6% pre-tax return. The size of the premium would move with prevailing market interest rates. The higher the market interest rate, the larger the value of the premium. The market clearing rate for a tax-exempt security is the following if the taxpayer's marginal tax rate exceeds the cap: ", "where the t i is the individuals tax rate and the policy tax rate cap is t cap . If the tax rate were less than the cap, then the clearing rate is simply:", "The link between a taxpayers marginal tax rate and the value of investing in tax-exempt bonds complicates the investment decision for taxpayers.

The response to the changing tax status of tax-exempt bonds by investors as proposed by the cap, however, may be muted. Most tax-exempt bonds would still provide a greater after-tax return than comparable taxable investments. The array of marginal tax rates in the first column of Table 3 are a mix of current law rates and rates as proposed in the President's FY2013 budget. Specifically, the top two rates, 36.0% and 39.6%, would apply to taxpayers filing joint returns with taxable income over $250,000 and single taxpayers with taxable income over $200,000 in 2013 if current law is not extended.", "For example, a taxpayer in the 33% tax bracket who holds a $100,000 taxable bond with a 6% coupon payment would receive $6,000 each year. Investors then determine tax implications to arrive at the after-tax return of investments. Under current law, the taxes would amount to 33% of that amount or $1,980. After paying this tax, the investor would have $4,020. Thus, a tax-exempt bond investment would need to offer at least 4.02% to lure this investor under current law. In contrast, under the proposal, the investor would need a 4.23% return on a tax-exempt bond because some of the interest would be taxed. The last column of Table 3 provides a relative measure for \"tax premium\" on tax-exempt bonds for the selected tax rates given a 6% market interest rate on taxable bonds. Note that for the highest rate investors, the premium approaches 50 basis points or almost one-half a percent.", "The number of taxpayers in the top two brackets comprise just 1.9% of all returns in 2007, but 35.2% of all tax-exempt interest or $25.6 billion (see Table 4 ). If the 28% proposal were in effect, these taxpayers would pay some tax on these earnings. Assuming the hypothetical 6% market rate and no change in taxpayer behavior, then the additional revenue would be $70.3 million for this cohort. As discussed earlier, for the 33.0% marginal tax rate investors, taxes would be owed at the 5% rate difference between the cap amount and marginal tax rate (7% for the 35% marginal tax bracket). Even with the premium imposed by this proposal, there is still a significant subsidy for these taxpayers.

This group would include international investors and U.S. pension funds. These new investors, who do not pay U.S. taxes, place no value on the tax exclusion. The increased demand of these two types of investors combined would have positive impact on the tax-exempt bond market and a generally negative impact on the taxable bond (or similar taxable asset) market. This effect, however, will likely be minimal.", "As with the income tax cap, the impact of the SB proposal would be concentrated in the top two current marginal tax rates.

Under current law, the tax preference applies to all projects regardless of relative risk. Thus, the absolute value of the tax preference (and federal revenue loss) is greater for projects with a greater risk profile. This arises because the interest rate premium on those projects is greater (i.e., the interest rate is higher). Returning to Table 3 , the hypothetical comparative taxable bond was assumed to be 6.0% and an investor in the 35% bracket needed a tax-exempt return of at least 3.9% to invest in the tax-exempt bond. If the project were deemed riskier, then the rate on a taxable bond of like risk could be as high as 8.0% (the higher rate is the so-called \"risk premium\"). This implies the tax-exempt interest rate would need to be at least 5.2% to justify investment in the riskier project. Under SB, issuers of riskier bonds would not receive more federal assistance as the risk premium increases.", "The elimination of the exclusion of interest on state and local government debt would also have a differential impact across states. States that rely more on debt will realize a greater increase in the cost of debt than states less reliant on debt. And, within states, relatively debt reliant local governments would also be relatively worse off. In FY2009, state and local governments in Massachusetts, New York, and Kentucky all had debt outstanding exceeding 25% of state gross domestic product (GDP). In contrast, governments in Iowa, Idaho, and Wyoming had debt to GDP ratios of less than 12%.
