One way to stay within these limits is to appropriate no more than the allocated amount of discretionary funding in the regular annual appropriations act. Another way is to find ways to offset a higher level of discretionary funding. A portion of the cost of regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding.

Congress transferred more than $54 billion, mostly from the general fund of the Treasury, to the highway trust fund during the period FY2008-FY2014 to keep the trust fund solvent.

The tax is a fixed amount assessed per gallon of fuel sold, not a percentage of the cost of the fuel sold: whether a gallon of gas costs $1 or $4, the highway trust fund receives 18.3 cents for each gallon of gasoline and 24.3 cents for each gallon of diesel. Meanwhile, the capacity of the federal gas tax to support transportation infrastructure has been diminished by inflation (which has reduced the purchasing power of the revenue raised by the tax) and increasing automobile fuel efficiency (as more efficient vehicles are able to travel farther on a gallon of fuel). CBO has forecast that gasoline consumption will be relatively flat through 2024, as continued increases in the fuel efficiency of the U.S. passenger fleet will offset increases in the number of miles driven. Consequently, CBO expects highway trust fund revenues of $37 billion to $38 billion annually from FY2014 to FY2024, well short of the current $53 billion annual level of authorized expenditures from the fund.", "When the authorization provided by MAP-21 expires at the end of FY2014, Congress will again face policy choices concerning surface transportation.

If such a borrower defaults on the mortgage, FHA repays the lender the remaining amount that the borrower owes on it. The provision of FHA insurance is intended to make mortgage credit more widely available, and at a lower cost, than it might be in the absence of the insurance.", "The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA) specifies the way in which the costs of federal loan guarantees, including FHA-insured loans, are recorded in the federal budget. It requires that the cost of loans insured in a given fiscal year be recorded in the budget as the net present value of all of the expected future cash flows from the loans that will be insured in that year. This is referred to as credit subsidy (and the net present value of the cash flows expressed as a percentage of the volume of loans expected to be insured in that year is the credit subsidy rate ).", "FHA's largest program insures mortgages on single-family homes, and that program is administered through the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund). Historically, the mortgages insured under the MMI Fund each year have been expected to have a negative credit subsidy cost, meaning that the money that those loans will earn for the government (such as from fees paid by borrowers) is expected to exceed their costs (such as from claims paid to lenders for defaulted mortgages). A negative subsidy cost results in offsetting receipts , which, in the case of the MMI Fund, can offset other costs of the HUD budget. ", "For FY2015, the President's budget estimated that the MMI Fund would generate $12.2 billion in negative credit subsidy. Combined with an additional $876 million in negative credit subsidy from other FHA programs, the President's budget estimated that FHA would generate about $13.1 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2015 that could be used as offsetting receipts. ", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does its own estimates of FHA's credit subsidy rate and offsetting receipts, and the CBO estimates are used by congressional appropriators to determine budget authority. CBO's estimate for the amount of negative credit subsidy that will be generated by the loans insured under the MMI Fund in FY2015 is $4.2 billion lower than the estimate included in the President's budget. CBO estimates that loans insured under the MMI Fund in FY2015 will result in $8 billion in negative credit subsidy for the MMI Fund rather than the $12.2 billion estimated in the President's budget. ", "Because offsetting receipts are subtracted from gross budget authority to arrive at net budget authority, a lower amount of offsets reduces the amount of new appropriations that can be provided while remaining within agreed-upon limits on net budget authority.

Under those contracts, HUD provides subsidies to the owners to make up the difference between what eligible low-income families pay to live in subsidized units (30% of their incomes) and a previously agreed-upon rent for the unit. No contracts for newly subsidized units have been entered into under this program since the early 1980s. When the program was active, Congress funded the contracts for 20- to 40-year periods, so the monthly payments for owners came from the original appropriations. However, once those contracts expire, they require new annual appropriations if they are renewed. Further, some old contracts do not have sufficient funding to finish their existing terms, so new funding is needed to complete the contract (referred to as amendment funding). As more contracts have shifted from long-term appropriations to new appropriations, this account has grown and become the second-largest account in HUD's budget.", "The FY2015 President's budget proposed a decrease of almost $200 million in PBRA compared to FY2014 ($9.7 billion compared to $9.9 billion). The budget also proposed that all PBRA contracts be funded on a calendar year (CY) schedule, from January through December. Currently, PBRA funding is based on the month in which contracts were entered into. In recent years, due to funding levels for the program, HUD has sometimes \"short-funded\" contracts, providing owners with less than one year of funding. The President's budget proposed that FY2015 funding be used to fund all contracts through CY2015 (in some cases, this would mean less than one year of funding would be needed). Then, FY2016 funding would be used to fund all contracts for the full 2016 calendar year at an estimated cost of $10.8 billion. Calendar year funding would bring PBRA in line with Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance and Public Housing, where units are already funded on a calendar year basis.", "Both the House-passed bill ( H.R. 4745 ) and Senate Appropriations Committee-passed bill ( S. 2438 ) follow the President's proposal for calendar year funding, and would provide $9.7 billion for PBRA.

The Senate Committee-reported bill would provide $10 million for SHOP, but would continue to provide this funding in its own account rather than as a set-aside within the HOME account.", "The President's budget also included several legislative proposals related to HOME. One proposal involves the thresholds for local jurisdictions to become eligible to receive their own allocations of HOME funds (localities that receive their own allocations of HOME funds are referred to as participating jurisdictions). Currently, a local jurisdiction becomes eligible to receive a direct allocation of HOME funds if it is eligible for a formula allocation of at least $500,000 in a given year, or at least $335,000 in years when less than $1.5 billion is appropriated for the program. The President's budget proposes removing the lower threshold, so that localities would only become eligible to be participating jurisdictions if they were eligible for a formula allocation of $500,000, regardless of the total amount of appropriations in a given year. ", "The budget also proposes revising provisions regarding \"grandfathering\" of participating jurisdictions. Currently, a locality that has been participating in the program can continue to participate even if its formula allocation falls below the threshold. The proposal in the budget would eliminate this grandfathering, and instead would allow a locality to continue to qualify as a participating jurisdiction for a five-year period. The budget noted that, due to a higher number of participating localities and decreasing appropriations in recent years, many jurisdictions are receiving allocations that are too small to effectively administer affordable housing programs. Removing the lower threshold and ending grandfathering would result in fewer participating localities, but higher grant amounts for localities that continue to participate.", "The House-passed bill contains language that has been included in recent appropriations laws that would disregard the lower threshold for localities to become participating jurisdictions during the fiscal year, meaning that localities would have to reach the higher $500,000 threshold in order to become participating jurisdictions even with a total program appropriation of less than $1.5 billion. The bill does not include the permanent changes that are included in the President's budget, such as permanently changing the threshold requirement or making changes to the grandfathering provision. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported bill also contains the language that would disregard the lower threshold for localities to become participating jurisdictions in FY2015. The Senate Committee-reported bill also adopts some legislative changes included in the President's budget request, but like the House-passed bill, it does not permanently change the threshold requirements or make changes to the grandfathering provision.
