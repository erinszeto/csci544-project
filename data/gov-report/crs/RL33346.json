Such technologies would involve separation of plutonium, uranium, and other long-lived radioactive materials from spent fuel for re-use in a nuclear reactor or for transmutation in a particle accelerator. Most of the proposed AFCI funding would be for an engineering-scale demonstration of a separations technology called UREX+ ($155 million), in which uranium and other elements are chemically removed from dissolved spent fuel, leaving a mixture of plutonium and other highly radioactive elements. Proponents believe the process is proliferation-resistant, because further purification would be required to make the plutonium useable for weapons and because its high radioactivity would make it difficult to divert or work with.", "However, the House Appropriations Committee expressed concern that more fundamental research on the UREX+ process was needed, particularly on waste byproducts, before moving ahead to the demonstration phase. As a result, the House-passed energy and water funding bill would have held the program's spending to $120 million. But the Senate Appropriations Committee, calling GNEP \"imperative\" for reducing nuclear waste and increasing energy supplies, boosted AFCI funding by $36 million over the request. As noted above, the spending plan provides $167.5 million for the program.", "Removing uranium from spent fuel would eliminate most of the volume of spent nuclear fuel that would otherwise require disposal in a deep geologic repository, which DOE is developing at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.

FutureGen is a project to demonstrate co-production of electricity and hydrogen from coal without emissions. For FY2007, the House Appropriations Committee recommended rescinding $257 million of clean coal funding because it is \"no longer needed to complete active projects in the program.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee would instead have deferred $203 million and rescinded $50 million from the CCTP.

Although DOE's Operating Plan allocates an increase relative to the funding originally proposed for FY2007, it provides less funding for the program than the $6.59 billion that Congress appropriated for FY2006. Accounting for the use of prior year balances, DOE's plan indicates a larger amount of funding was allocated in FY2006 for the Defense Environmental Cleanup account, resulting in a greater decrease in FY2007 for the program when a comparison is made to FY2006 funding including the use of these balances. (See the notes to the table below.)", "A substantial portion of the reduction in funding for the program relative to FY2006 is due to the completion of cleanup at \"accelerated closure\" sites, such as Rocky Flats in Colorado. Despite the overall decrease, DOE's plan allocates over $100 million more for closure activities at Rocky Flats than any of the original proposals for FY2007, and more than twice the original proposals for administration of closure sites. For sites where cleanup is not complete, there are varying decreases and increases in funding when comparing DOE's FY2007 Operating Plan to the President's FY2007 request, the FY2007 proposals considered in the 109 th Congress, and the FY2006 appropriation. Sites with some of the larger differences in funding include those where substantial cleanup and waste disposal challenges remain, such as Hanford (WA) and Savannah River (SC), both of which store high-level radioactive waste in underground tanks. As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, this waste must be removed for permanent disposal in a geologic repository.", "The adequacy of funding to clean up Hanford has been particularly controversial for many reasons, including potential risks from radioactive contamination migrating through groundwater into the Columbia River, and the delayed construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant. This facility is a key element in DOE's plans to treat the substantial volume of high-level radioactive waste to be removed from the underground tanks at Hanford, and to solidify that waste for permanent disposal in a geologic repository. This task is one of the more costly cleanup challenges across the complex of sites. Construction of the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant has been delayed as a result of various engineering and design issues.

DOE reports that it had cleaned up 81 of the 114 geographic sites as of the end of FY2006. Although DOE has disposed of substantial quantities of waste and remediated many areas of contamination at the remaining sites, much work remains to be done to complete cleanup at many of them. DOE expects to complete cleanup at certain sites within the next few years. However, the Department anticipates cleanup to continue for decades at the larger and more complex sites, such as Hanford, Savannah River, and the Idaho National Laboratory, where high-level radioactive waste is in need of treatment and disposal, and soil and groundwater contamination is generally more severe.

Developing reliable estimates is especially challenging for the larger, more complex sites where many final decisions have yet to be made because of technical limitations and uncertainties, such as the \"end state\" of many sites. DOE periodically revises its estimates of outstanding costs to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes as individual project baselines and assumptions change. These estimates have varied widely over time by many billions of dollars. DOE reports its financial liabilities for the Environmental Management Program, and all of its other program responsibilities, in its annual financial statements contained in the department's performance and accountability reports. DOE's Performance and Accountability Report for FY200 6 estimated that, as of the end of FY2006, $159 billion would be needed to complete cleanup and dispose of wastes at the remaining sites administered under DOE's Environmental Management Program. The $159 billion estimate is not adjusted for inflation and is in FY2006 dollars.", "In addition to inflation, other factors could cause actual costs to exceed the $159 billion estimate. For example, actual costs could be higher than expected, depending on whether federal and state regulators may require more stringent and costlier cleanup actions than DOE plans to take. Costs also could rise if initial cleanup actions prove inadequate to protect human health and the environment over the long-term. Future performance of cleanup actions is especially critical for nuclear waste sites because of the rate of decay of radioactivity, which can be thousands of years depending on the particular radionuclide. Predicting the effectiveness of methods to contain radioactive wastes over such long periods of time is challenging, if not impracticable in some cases. Consequently, additional funding could be needed at sites where cleanup was thought to be complete, if the initial cleanup proves inadequate over time.", "DOE's $159 billion estimate also does not include the costs of long-term care of sites once cleanup remedies are in place to ensure the protection of human health and the environment into the future.

These responsibilities include surveillance and monitoring, long-term operation and maintenance of soil and groundwater cleanup remedies, and disposal of excess materials remaining on-site after closeout under the Environmental Management Program. DOE estimated that this $18 billion cost would be incurred over 75 years through FY2081. DOE expects some long-term site care to be needed beyond this time, requiring additional funding.
