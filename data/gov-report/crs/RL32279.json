For both SSDI and SSI disability benefits, disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death. In general, the individual must be unable to do any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience. Special rules apply to statutorily blind individuals and to children under the age of 18 applying for or receiving SSI.", "Both programs are administered by SSA and therefore have similar application and disability determination processes. Although SSDI and SSI are federal programs, both federal and state offices are used to determine eligibility for disability benefits. SSA determines whether someone is disabled according to a five-step sequential evaluation process where SSA is required to look at all of the pertinent facts of a particular case. Current work activity, severity of impairment, and vocational factors are assessed in that order. If SSA finds that a claimant is disabled, the agency must periodically reevaluate his or her impairment(s) to ensure that the individual continues to meet the program's respective eligibility criteria.", "If a claimant's application for benefits is denied at any point during the disability determination process, the claimant has the right to appeal the decision. During the appeals process, claimants may present additional evidence or arguments to support their case, as well as appoint a representative to act on their behalf. In most states, the appeals process is composed of four stages: (1) reconsideration by a different disability examiner; (2) a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ); (3) a review before the Appeals Council; and (4) filing suit against SSA in U.S. district court.", "The SSDI program is funded primarily through Social Security payroll tax revenues, portions of which are credited to the Disability Insurance (DI) trust fund.

OASDI is a form of social insurance designed to protect against the loss of income due to retirement, disability, or death. Like Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), SSDI replaces a portion of a worker's lost earnings based on the individual's career-average earnings in jobs covered under Social Security. Specifically, SSDI provides monthly benefits to insured workers under the full retirement age who meet the statutory test of disability and to their eligible dependents. The SSDI and OASI programs are funded primarily through a payroll tax levied on current workers who are in jobs covered by Social Security.

Although the SSI program is administered by SSA, it is funded through general revenues\u2014not by payroll taxes. The federal benefit provided through this program, unlike through the SSDI program, is a flat amount (reduced by other countable income), and it is not related to prior earnings. In addition to the federal SSI payment, many states provide supplements to certain groups or categories of SSI recipients.

In-kind support and maintenance includes food, clothing, or shelter that is given to an individual. Earned income includes wages, net earnings from self-employment, and earnings from services performed. If an individual meets all other SSI eligibility requirements, his or her total monthly SSI payment equals the maximum federal benefit rate ( plus the amount of an applicable federally administered state supplementation payment) minus countable income. Not all income is counted for SSI purposes, and different exclusions apply to earned and unearned income.

The medical determination for both types of disability benefits is made based on evidence gathered in an individual's case file. State disability examiners\u2014with the help of medical and psychological consultants\u2014typically use medical evidence collected from the claimant's treating sources (i.e., a physician, psychologist, or other acceptable medical source) to determine the severity of the claimant's impairment(s). Ordinarily, there is no personal interview with the applicant on the part of the state personnel who decide the claim.", "Claimants who do not meet the criteria in the medical listings (Step 3) proceed to a more individualized assessment that examines their residual functional capacity to perform work. Residual functional capacity (RFC) is a function-by-function assessment based upon all of the relevant evidence of an individual's ability to do work-related activities. At Step 4, the state DDS evaluates a claimant's RFC to complete past relevant work. If the claimant cannot perform past relevant work, his or her application is forwarded to the final step of the determination process. At Step 5, the state DDS uses a claimant's RFC along with vocational factors, such as age, education, and work experience to determine whether he or she can perform any work that exists in the national economy.

In most states, claimants who are dissatisfied with the initial determination may request to have their case reconsidered by a different examiner from the state DDS office. The disability examiner will reexamine the evidence from the original decision, along with any new evidence submitted with the appeal. After a review of the evidence, the claimant is notified in writing of the decision. If the claimant disagrees with the reconsideration decision, he or she may proceed to Step 2. Step 2. Administrative Hearing. Claimants who are dissatisfied with the reconsidered judgment (or who disagree with the initial determination and reside in a state where the reconsideration step has been eliminated) may request a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). During a hearing, an ALJ will investigate the merits of an appeal by informally questioning the claimant, as well as any scheduled witnesses such as medical or vocational experts. A claimant and his or her representative may also present additional evidence, examine evidence used in making the determination under review, introduce witnesses, question witnesses, and present oral or written arguments in support of a favorable decision.
