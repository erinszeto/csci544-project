All programs are based in statute. Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes the 8(a) Program; Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, the SDB program; and various transportation statutes, the DBE program. However, many of the specific requirements pertaining to these programs derive from agency regulations.", "8(a) firms, SDBs, and DBEs are all characterized as \"disadvantaged\" because they are at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals or groups. However, social and economic disadvantage is defined somewhat differently for each program. Members of certain racial and ethnic groups are presumed to be socially disadvantaged for purposes of the 8(a) and SDB programs, while women are also presumed to be socially disadvantaged for purposes of the DBE program. Similarly, individuals' net worth must be $250,000 or less for entry into the 8(a) Program, while net worth can be as high as $750,000 for newly designated SDBs and $1.32 million for newly designated DBEs.", "The programs for the various types of firms also differ in their operation. The 8(a) Program is open only to firms that have been certified by SBA, and firms and individual owners may generally participate in the 8(a) Program for a maximum of nine years. 8(a) participants are eligible for set-aside or sole-source contracts, as well as other assistance from the SBA. All 8(a) firms qualify as SDBs. Non-8(a) firms must be certified as SDBs by procuring agencies, private certifying entities, or state or local governments to qualify for federal programs for SDB prime contractors, although they may self-certify for similar programs for SDB subcontractors. SDB certification, when required, generally lasts three years, but could last longer and apparently be renewed. There are government-wide and agency-specific goals for the percentage of federal contract and subcontract dollars awarded to SDBs. Additionally, certain prime contractors must have \"plans\" for subcontracting with SDBs as terms of their contracts. Agencies may also use past performance in subcontracting with SDBs as an evaluation factor in source selection decisions, or give prime contractors \"monetary incentives\" for subcontracting with SDBs. DBEs must be certified by the state of the funding recipient. Certifications generally last \"until and unless revoked,\" and there is no apparent limit on the number of times firms may be recertified. There is a national goal that 10% of federal funding for certain transportation-related projects be awarded to DBE contractors and subcontractors. Funding recipients must generally set similar goals, including on individual contracts.", "Contracting opportunities for disadvantaged small businesses are perennially of interest to the Members and committees of Congress because of small businesses' widely asserted role in job creation.

Presumptions based on race have been found to constitute \"explicit racial classifications,\" subjecting programs that incorporate them to \"strict scrutiny\" if they are challenged on the grounds that they violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. For a challenged program to survive strict scrutiny, the government must show that the program is necessary to meet a compelling government interest. Presumptions based on gender are similarly subject to heightened scrutiny, with the Supreme Court in United States v. Virginia having required the state of Virginia to provide an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for its policy of maintaining an all-male military academy. In contrast, classifications that are not based on race, gender, or another suspect classification, and that do not involve the exercise of a fundamental right, will generally be upheld so long as they are rationally related to a legitimate government interest. ", "The ability of programs to withstand strict or other heightened scrutiny may depend, in part, upon how the program is structured. In a recent decision, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that the 8(a) Program is not unconstitutional on its face, although it is unconstitutional as-applied in the military simulation and training industry. Particularly in its rejection of the facial challenge to the 8(a) Program, the court emphasized certain aspects of the program's history and requirements when finding that \"breaking down barriers to minority business development created by discrimination\" constituted a compelling government interest, and the government had a strong basis in evidence for concluding that race-based action was necessary to further this interest. For example, the court rejected the plaintiff's assertion that the 8(a) Program was \"not truly remedial,\" but rather favored \"virtually all minority groups \u2026 over the larger pool of citizens,\" because non-minority individuals may qualify for the program, and all 8(a) applicants must demonstrate economic disadvantage. Similarly, in finding that the program was narrowly tailored to meet the government's interests, the court noted (1) that goals for contracting with small disadvantaged businesses are purely aspirational, and there are no penalties for failing to meet them; (2) the nine-year limits on program participation for individual owners and firms; and (3) that SBA may not accept a requirement for the 8(a) Program if it determines that doing so will have an adverse effect on another small business or group of small businesses. The court emphasized that the last two factors, in particular, helped ensure that race-conscious remedies do not \"last longer than the discriminatory effects [they are] designed to eliminate,\" and \"work the least harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit.\"", "On the other hand, in 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit focused less on the details of the program than on the evidence of discrimination before Congress when Congress reauthorized the program when striking down a Department of Defense (DOD) program for SDBs. Specifically, the Federal Circuit found that the DOD program\u2014which allowed DOD to take 10% off the price of bids or offers submitted by SDBs when determining which bid or offer had the lowest price or represented the best value for the government\u2014was unconstitutional on its face because Congress lacked a strong basis in evidence for concluding that race-conscious contracting was necessary to remedy discrimination in the defense industry when it reauthorized the program in 2006. The district court, which had upheld the constitutionality of the challenged SDB program, had found that six state and local disparity studies, along with other statistical and anecdotal evidence, constituted a strong basis in evidence for the re-enactment. However, the Federal Circuit disagreed. It found that the six state and local disparity studies\u2014which had been the \"primary focus of the district court's compelling interest analysis and of the parties' arguments on appeal\" \u2014did not constitute a strong basis in evidence because they did not provide the \"substantially probative and broad-based statistical foundation ... that must be the predicate for nationwide, race-conscious action.\" A similar lack of evidence of discrimination also played a part in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia finding that the 8(a) Program is unconstitutional as applied in the military training and simulation industry. However, in this case, DOD conceded that it had \"no evidence of discrimination, either in the public or private sector, in the simulation and training industry.\""], "subsections": []}]}}
