Major habeas legislative activity in the 111th Congress fell within three areas: proposals to permit state death row inmates to seek habeas relief based on evidence that they are probably innocent (H.R. 3320 and H.R. 3986); proposals to amend federal law in response to the Supreme Court's determination that the level of judicial review afforded Guantanamo detainees failed to meet constitutional expectations (H.R. 64, H.R. 591, H.R. 630, H.R. 1315, H.R. 3728, and S. 3707); and recommendations for revision of several areas of federal habeas law from witnesses appearing before recent House Judiciary Committee hearings.

It has been sought by state and federal prisoners convicted of criminal offenses and by the detainees in Guantanamo. The Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush , 553 U.S. 723 (2008), held that limitations on the judicial review of detainee status were contrary to the demands of the privilege of the writ and suspension clause. The Court has thus far declined to hold that a state prisoner sentenced to death, but armed with compelling evidence of his innocence, is entitled to habeas relief. Legislation was introduced in the 111 th Congress to deal with both issues. Moreover, the Constitution Subcommittee of the House Committee on the Judiciary has held hearings on habeas review and received recommendations for legislation on related issues. This report is a brief overview of those recommendations and legislative proposals.

One of these prohibits filing repetitious habeas petitions claiming that the petitioner's state conviction was accomplished in a constitutionally defective manner. This second or successive petition bar does not apply where newly discovered evidence establishes that but for the constitutional defect no reasonable jury would have convicted the petitioner (constitutional defect plus innocence). But suppose the new evidence merely demonstrates the petitioner's innocence, unrelated to the manner in which he was convicted? The Supreme Court has never said that habeas relief may be granted on such a freestanding claim of innocence. It has twice said, however, that assuming relief might be granted in a freestanding innocence case, the evidence on the record before it did not reach the level of persuasion necessary to grant relief. A third such case is now working its way through the federal court system.", "Two bills offered in the 111 th Congress would have established actual innocence as a ground upon which habeas relief might be granted, the Effective Death Penalty Appeals Act ( H.R. 3986 ) and the Justice for the Wrongfully Accused Act ( H.R. 3320 ). Representative Moore (Kansas) introduced H.R. 3320 on July 23, 2009.

The Court favored a clear and convincing evidence standard in cases where the petitioner challenged not his conviction but claimed he was innocent of the aggravating factor that justified imposition of the death penalty. The statutory provisions, established in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, now favor a clear and convincing evidence standard in the constitutional defect plus innocence exception to the second or successive petition bar.

Under existing habeas law, federal courts are bound by state court determinations and application of federal law, unless the decisions are contrary to clearly established federal law, constitute an unreasonable application of such law to the facts, or constitute unreasonable finding of facts. Faced with evidence of the petitioner's probable innocence, the Johnson bill would have released federal habeas courts from the binding impact of such state court determinations: They would have no longer been bound by a state court decision that \"resulted in, or left in force, a sentence of death that was imposed without consideration of newly discovered evidence which, in combination with the evidence presented at trial, demonstrates that the applicant is probably not guilty of the underlying offense,\" proposed 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(3).

Two of the witnesses were critical of the \"opt in\" provisions under which states gain the advantage of streamlined habeas procedures in capital cases, if they satisfy the provision of counsel standards. Chief Justice Kogan would repeal the provisions, fearing that amendment would only introduce further \"confusion, waste, and wheel-spinning.\" Mr. Hanlon urged alternatively that the role of gatekeeper \u2013 the determination of whether a state is qualified to opt in, now vested in the Attorney General \u2013 be returned to the federal courts.

With two exceptions, the Teague rule denies the use of federal habeas to establish, or to retroactively claim the benefits of, a new rule, that is, an interpretation of constitutional law not recognized before the end of the period for the petitioner's direct appellate review of his state conviction and sentence. From Chief Justice Kogan's perspective, \"The chief problem is deciding what counts as 'new' in these circumstances.\" He expressed the view that habeas treatment of harmless constitutional errors committed at the state level \"warrants serious attention.\" Finally, he pointed to the apparent incongruity of section 2254(e)(1), which asserts that a state court's finding of facts is presumed correct, and section 2254(d)(2), which asserts that habeas must be denied with respect to a claim adjudicated in state court unless the state court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts.", "If the history of habeas reform debate holds true, each of the points made by the three witnesses is likely to find a counterpoint in any future debate.
