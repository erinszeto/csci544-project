Titles III and VI effectuate changes in the regulatory structure governing depository institutions and their holding companies and, thus, constitute a substantial component of the reform effort. Under Title III, there will no longer be a single regulator of federal and state-chartered savings associations, also known as thrifts or savings and loan associations. Title III abolishes the Office of the Thrift Supervision (OTS) and contains extensive provisions respecting the rights of affected employees as well as other administrative matters. It allocates the OTS functions among three existing regulators: the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will regulate federally chartered thrifts; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), state-chartered thrifts; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), savings and loan holding companies. Title III also makes certain changes to deposit insurance: it makes permanent the increase of deposit insurance coverage to $250,000, and makes that increase retroactive to January 1, 2008. It extends full insurance coverage of non-interest bearing checking accounts for two additional years and authorizes a similar program for credit unions. Included in Title III is also a requirement that the Department of the Treasury and each federal financial regulatory agency establish an office of Minority and Women Inclusion.", "Title VI addresses some perceived inadequacies with respect to prudential regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies, including the existence of certain exceptions to the Bank Holding Company Act's (BHC Act's) general prohibition on affiliation of banking institutions and commercial or manufacturing concerns; investment in hedge funds or private equity funds and proprietary trading by banking institutions; gaps in the authority of the FRB to oversee all of the subsidiaries of bank holding companies; the need for greater coordination among the regulators with respect to enforcement actions, charter conversions, and mergers and acquisitions; and elimination of some of the differences affecting the regulation of thrifts and banks, state-chartered and federally chartered institutions, and bank and thrift holding companies.", "Each of the federal banking agencies has begun the process of implementing applicable provisions of the legislation and has published information on projected activities. The full implications of Titles III and VI will not be apparent until the agencies promulgate the many implementing regulations required before many of the provisions go into effect. Generally, the legislation specifies a time period for when a particular rulemaking is to be completed; in some cases, studies are required before the rulemaking may occur."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background and Overview", "paragraphs": ["Titles III and VI of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, P.L. 111-203 , address certain issues that many Members of Congress, including the major drafters of the legislation, the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, perceived as impediments to effective regulation of the banking industry and possible contributing factors to certain aspects of the financial crisis of 2008. The version of Title III reported by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, on which the final version is based, sought \"to increase the accountability of the banking regulators by establishing clearer lines of responsibility and to reduce the regulatory arbitrage in the financial regulatory system whereby financial companies 'shop' for the most lenient regulators and regulatory framework.\" The final version takes a step in that direction by abolishing one of the regulators, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the agency which had supervisory authority over Washington Mutual and Indy Mac Bank, the failures of which represented large losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The act distributes the OTS functions, regulating savings associations (thrifts or savings and loans) and savings and loan holding companies. Under Title X of the bill, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will assume much of the OTS responsibility for overseeing compliance by savings and loan associations with federal consumer protection laws. Title III allocates prudential supervision among three federal regulators. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) will now regulate federally chartered thrifts as well as national banks; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will now regulate state-chartered thrifts as well as state-chartered banks which are not members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS); and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) will now regulate both bank holding companies (including financial holding companies) and thrift or savings and loan holding companies, as well as state-chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System (FRS). Other provisions of Title III provide for reallocation of OTS personnel and property among those agencies, with various safeguards respecting employee rights and status. ", "Many of the provisions of Titles III and VI appear to be designed to correct perceived inadequacies in terms of the prudential regulation of banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies or discrepancies between the regulation of banks and savings associations. For example, there are provisions preventing depository institutions under supervisory or enforcement orders from changing their charters without full consent by the existing chartering authority and a plan for meeting the requirements of the enforcement order. There are numerous provisions requiring greater coordination among regulators and provisions enhancing the authority of FRB to oversee all of the components of holding companies. There are also provisions providing backup examination and enforcement authority in case the FRB's efforts fail to meet the standards imposed under the statute. There are various provisions designed to minimize regulatory differences applicable to different types of banking institutions and to address what have appeared to be loopholes permitting certain companies to own or control a depository institution without having to submit to consolidated regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act). ", "Miscellaneous matters addressed in Title III include changing the basis of deposit insurance assessments imposed on banks; permanently increasing deposit insurance coverage to $250,000; applying that increase retroactively to January 1, 2008; and establishing offices of Minority and Women Inclusion in the Department of the Treasury and in the federal financial regulatory agencies. ", "Title VI contains a number of provisions designed to tighten regulation of banking activities possibly threatening the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies. There are provisions tightening the controls on transactions with affiliates, derivative and swaps operations, and lending limits. There are also restrictions on banking companies making investments in hedge funds or private equity funds or engaging in proprietary trading, patterned on a proposal by a former FRB Chairman and current Chairman of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
