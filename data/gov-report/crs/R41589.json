The nation's security should be secure. Yet the debate over national security seems to be both intensifying and broadening. The problem appears not only in the difficulty of finding a winning strategy in the long war against acts of terrorism but having to face economic constraints that loom large in the public debate. In addition, the global financial crisis and recession have highlighted the trade-off between spending to protect against external threats and spending to provide jobs and income for citizens at home. The United States has long been accustomed to pursuing a \"rich man's\" approach to national security. The country could field an overwhelming fighting force and combine it with economic power and leadership in global affairs to bring to bear far greater resources than any other country against any threat to the nation's security. The economy has always been there both to provide the funds and materiel for defense and to provide economic security for most households. Policies for economic growth and issues such as unemployment have been viewed as domestic problems largely separate from considerations of national security.", "The world, however, has changed. Globalization, the rise of China, the prospect of an unsustainable debt burden, unprecedented federal budget deficits, the success of mixed economies with both state-owned and private businesses, huge imbalances in international trade and capital flows, and high unemployment have brought economics more into play in considerations of national security. Traditionally the economy has entered into the national security debate through its impact on the nation's hard power: the funding of defense, the efficacy of the defense industrial base, and the use of economic sanctions and other instruments as non-kinetic tools of warfare. The long-term efficacy of hard power, however, depends greatly on the ability of a country to provide for it through an ever growing and innovative economy.", "National security depends also on soft power, the ability of a country to generate and use its economic power and to project its national values. This, in turn, depends on long-term factors that contribute to economic growth and increase the total resource base available not only for defense but to provide economic security in the form of income and business opportunities for individuals. Economic growth depends on building human capital. It also depends on science, technology, and innovation. In addition, the increased integration of the U.S. economy into global markets means that U.S. security also depends on global economic stability, on a balanced international economy, the ability to coordinate key economic policies with other leading nations, and deterring threats to the international financial system. Soft power also enables the country to project American values through diplomacy, economic assistance, fostering democracy and human rights, and promoting sustainable development abroad. Congress plays a major role in each of these elements of national security.", "This analysis illustrates how disparate parts of the U.S. economy affect the security of the nation. Security is achieved not only by military means but by the whole of the American economy. In national security, the economy is both the enabler and the constraint. This report briefly addresses each of the above issues and provides a context and some possible alternatives to current policy. The purpose of this report is not to provide an exhaustive analysis but to survey the landscape, show how each issue relates to national security, examine possible Congressional actions, and refer the reader to relevant CRS products and analysts."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and the Congressional Interest1", "paragraphs": ["U.S. national security underpins the system in which Americans live. National security is essential to an environment and geographical space in which people can reside without fear. It consists, first, of physical security on both the international and domestic sides. This includes protection from threats external to the country and safety in the homeland. These generally are accomplished through hard power and homeland security efforts. Second, it consists of economic security\u2014the opportunity and means for people to provide for their own well being under an economic system that is vibrant, growing, and accessible. Third, U.S. national security involves outreach through soft power in an attempt to win the \"hearts and minds\" of people across the globe. Soft power complements hard power, and, in cases, may substitute for it. Also, the myriad links between governments, businesses, and people across national borders means that American security increasingly depends on countries and activities in far flung places on the globe. ", "Traditionally, the economy entered into the national security debate through four issues: the defense industrial base, base closures and program cuts, international economic sanctions, and export controls. These issues still garner much of the attention from the vantage point of the military. From the point of view of the nation as a whole, however, economic security takes on a broader meaning. ", "This report examines the role of the economy in national security from both macroeconomic and microeconomic points of view. The macroeconomic issues center on the budget and deficit reduction. The microeconomic issues focus on providing for the general well-being of the people and in supporting other components of national security. This report also examines the major sources of long-term economic growth and progress and policies that affect them. It further addresses the coordination of policies among nations, particularly the G-20, and foreign policies that affect human rights, the development of democracy, and U.S. economic assistance. This broad review of economics and national security illustrates how disparate parts of the U.S. economy affect the security of the nation and that security is something achieved not only by military means but by the whole of the American economy and how it performs. In national security, the economy is both an enabler and a constraint. ", "The economic issues related to national security are both broad and complex. In order to keep this report to a manageable length, this study takes the President's 2010 National Security Strategy as a beginning construct and largely limits the analysis to the issues raised there. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of the economic contributors to national security as well as to furnish links to further resources. Issues, such as reducing the federal budget deficit, immigration, international trade, or innovation, are related to national security in ways that are too numerous and complex to address fully here. Further information can be found in the CRS reports cited or can be obtained by contacting the CRS analysts indicated.", "In the United States, the renewed public debate over national security appears to be generated primarily by three global changes. The first is the nature of the external threat to physical security\u2014the rise of terrorism and militant Islam. The second is the aftermath of the global financial crisis, particularly the large federal budget deficit and slow rate of recovery. The third is the growing presence of emerging nations, such as China, India, and Brazil, and the shift of economic power toward them. These changes have created gaps and trade-offs that arguably are undermining the sense of security of Americans. Some may say, \"What good is protection from a future threat, when I am unemployed because my job just went to China?\" Others may say, \"What good is a high salary, if I am dead in a terrorist attack? ", "This debate over national security reaches deep into the fiber of American society. It is not merely political theater, and it is receiving a fillip by the weakened U.S. economy. A vibrant, growing, and dominant economy can hide a multitude of problems. Even though wealth and economic means cannot guarantee U.S. security, it can buy a comfortable sort of insecurity. ", "The economic issue of the day now centers on what measures to take to return the economy to its long-term growth path and reduce the gap between the potential and actual levels of U.S. gross domestic product. If the economy were to grow faster, many of the constraints on the federal budget would be eased. There are two major schools of thought on this matter. The Keynesian approach to growth is to continue government deficit spending through the recession and initial recovery phase in order to offset lower consumption by households and reduced levels of investment by businesses. When the economy recovers, the deficit can be reduced. The supply side approach is to cut the federal budget deficit now because deficits may discourage investment by causing uncertainty about future policy changes that will be needed to restore fiscal balance. The supply side approach also attempts to keep taxes on entrepreneurs low in order to induce them to invest more in productive capacity and create more jobs. Each approach recognizes that the long-term security of the nation depends greatly on having a vibrant and growing economy.", "Congress plays a major role in each element of national security. Whether it be policies dealing with the military, economy, budget, education, economic growth, technology, international relations, or opening markets abroad, Congressional action is essential. Not only does Congress provide funding for these elements of national security, but it provides oversight, defines the scope of U.S. action, and provides a crucible in which U.S. policies are debated and often determined. Congress allocates the resources to respond to national security threats, and in so doing it plays a part in determining the relative strength of hard and soft power options and the roles individual agencies will play.

This document presents the major national security concerns of the country and how the existing administration plans to deal with them. The George W. Bush Administration's issued its final NSS in March 2006, and in May 2010, the Obama Administration released its first NSS. ", "The 2010 NSS noted numerous world conditions, laid out a national security strategy, and set some goals, many of them economic. It began with three observations:", "the world is now in a moment of transition, of sweeping change; globalization has both opened opportunities and intensified the dangers Americans face from terrorism, the spread of deadly technologies, economic upheaval, and changing climate; and even as the war in Iraq ends and the focus of military action has turned to Afghanistan, a superior military is necessary as the United States faces multiple threats from nations, nonstate actors, and failed states.", "The NSS then laid out some goals, both military and economic, along with policies deemed necessary to ensure a safe and secure United States. Those related to the economy were:", "in order to build an America that is stronger, more secure, and able to overcome challenges while appealing to aspirations of people around the world, the United States must foster economic growth, reduce the federal budget deficit, educate our people, develop clean energy alternatives, pursue science and innovation, and build capabilities and alliances to pursue interests shared with other countries and peoples; the United States seeks an international order and cooperation with other nations that will counter violent extremism and insurgency, stop the spread of nuclear weapons, combat climate change, sustain global growth, and help countries feed themselves; and the United States will continue to advocate for and advance human rights, economic development, and democracy as a bulwark against aggression and injustice."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Twenty-First Century Challenges to National Security", "paragraphs": ["The challenge of the twenty-first century is to adapt U.S. policy to account for how the world has changed. These changes can be highlighted by reviewing some traditional perceptions that helped shape U.S. security policy. During the latter half of the twentieth century, five large ideas seemed to have permeated politics in the Western world writ large:", "peaceful settlement of issues was better than going to war (no more world wars, although regional conflicts persisted); other countries would tolerate U.S. hegemony in exchange for keeping the peace; the United States and Europe could determine policy on most major international issues; the United States could assist countries to democratize because democracies were more likely than dictatorships to have shared values and to keep the peace; and Western culture was appealing and more universal than any other.", "These fundamental ideas played a large role in shaping and maintaining U.S. national security first in a bipolar world shrouded in the Cold War and then in a more multi-polar system in which countries, such as China, have gained relative economic power and have brought a different set of interests and values to the table. While each of the above ideas has carried over to a certain extent into the twenty-first century, each also has eroded considerably. ", "Similarly, in the economic and financial realm, four large ideas or priorities helped shape both U.S. domestic and international economic policy:", "market capitalism was superior to socialism (high standards of living, vibrant entrepreneurs, and innovation were nourished best by free markets); security considerations trumped economics (e.g., wars had to be won even at high economic cost; U.S. retaliation against allies in trade disputes [such as those with Japan and South Korea] had to be tempered by its potential impact on alliance relationships); economic growth and employment were best fostered by monetary and fiscal policy rather than by industrial policies that \"picked winners and losers\"; and imbalances in trade and capital flows were largely self correcting (foreign exchange rates determined by capital markets and appropriate government fiscal and monetary policy would bring balance into international accounts).", "These economic and financial precepts still hold sway, but they are being challenged by an evolving and demanding security and economic environment. The rise of the Asian model of development with mixed market and socialist economies, large state-owned enterprises in China and the Middle East, government intervention into foreign exchange markets, and overt protection of domestic industries from import competition along with chronically large trade deficits and rising national debt of the United States and many European nations have called most of these economic ideas into question. In the globalized and conflicted world of today, the United States may require a more nuanced and direct approach to the economy in order to ensure the long-term security of the nation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Role of the Economy in U.S. National Security5", "paragraphs": ["For several decades following World War II, providing national security was conceptually simple. The United States maintained the world's preeminent military backed by the world's largest economy and led the Western world by providing power-based leadership, serving as a beacon for democratic values, and maintaining a system of military alliances. The conventional wisdom was that Washington could provide security for the nation primarily by keeping Soviet bombs at bay and communist ideology from creeping across the planet. The economy always was there, both to fund the military and underpin the provision of economic security for households. Policies for economic growth and issues such as unemployment were viewed as domestic problems largely separate from considerations of national security. ", "As the world begins the second decade of the twenty-first century, the United States still has a preeminent military, large economy, strong alliances, and democratic values. However, the economy has come more into play because the country has long been accustomed to pursuing a \"rich man's\" approach to national security strategy. The United States could field an overwhelming fighting force and combine it with economic power and leadership in global affairs to bring to bear far greater resources than any other country against any threat to the nation's security. ", "The world, however, has changed, and with it so have the challenges of providing U.S. national security. Setting aside questions concerning the size, composition, and capability of the U.S. military, the economy enters into the debate on national security through three overlapping roles. The first is the economy as the source of funds, materiel, and personnel for the military. The second is the economy as a provider of economic security and well-being for Americans. The third is the economy as the foundation for interaction among countries and of building shared or competing interests. This includes the flow of wealth generated by trade that allows countries to build their military and financial power, in particular the steady flow of oil revenues into the Middle East and the large trade surplus by China. It also includes U.S. legitimacy and resource availability as it strives to help other countries develop and to foster human rights and democracy abroad.", "In the United States, the domestic economic policy debate is divided into two major areas. The first centers on how to divide the existing economic pie or how to allocate existing economic resources among competing interests. This debate focuses on the macroeconomy, specifically on the level of the federal budget and its deficit; on the ability of the economy to fund both national defense and social programs and on issues such as savings, investment, and international trade. This deficit issue involves both cost and opportunity cost\u2014both the size of the budget and the alternatives foregone by allocating funds to one use instead of another. It also revolves around whether current costs should be shifted to future generations by borrowing today to cover the federal budget deficit and expecting future taxpayers to repay the resulting debt. ", "The second issue is how to enlarge the existing pie or how to increase economic growth and productivity in order to generate more resources for all programs. Growth depends both on sufficient aggregate demand by households, businesses, and government and by growing and productive supply. Over the long-term, the growth of supply depends on the microeconomic side of the economy and includes science and technology, education, business methods, natural resource use, and other elements of the economy that generate economic activity and progress.", " Figure 1 provides a simplified overview of how the economy enters into national security considerations. National security is sought through a combination of hard power, soft power, and economic opportunity. The economy underpins each of these by providing funding, human and other resources, capital, products, and an appealing culture and economic model. The operation of the economy, in turn, relies on government fiscal, monetary, and industrial policies; on the quality and quantity of human resources; on progress in science and technology; and on the global economy through trade and capital flows. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Other Roles of the Economy in National Security", "paragraphs": ["The issues in Figure 1 comprise the focus of this report and are those emphasized in the 2010 National Security Strategy . The economy and economic tools, however, enter into national security considerations in several other ways. These include economic sanctions, export controls, economic incentives, expeditionary economics, and economic issues as a cause of conflict. They are briefly presented here because of their relevance to current security policy.", "Economic incentives or disincentives can be both an adjunct to and substitute for hard power. The use of hard power or the threat of using it by the military often is buttressed by economic tools such as financial and economic sanctions, financial incentives to change the behavior of potential enemies before or during combat, or reestablishing a local economy after combat (expeditionary economics). ", "Economic and financial sanctions lie between diplomacy and open warfare. They are used either to punish countries for some action or to induce them to change their behavior without resorting to kinetic means (shooting them). The sanctions on Iran and North Korea imposed by the United Nations are two prominent examples of the use of this tool. Sanctions tend to be coercive but not lethal and less likely to trigger open warfare. The efficacy of economic and financial sanctions, such as a trade embargo, however, depends greatly on cooperation by countries near the target country. In the North Korean case, although the trade and financial sanctions are being implemented by nations, such as South Korea, Japan, and the United States, they cannot work well without the full cooperation of China.", "Related to economic sanctions are export controls. Under the Export Administration Act ( P.L. 96-72 ) Congress delegates to the Executive Branch the authority to regulate foreign commerce by controlling exports of sensitive dual-use goods and technologies. These are exports that have both civilian and military applications and that may contribute to the proliferation of nuclear, biological, and chemical weaponry. Congress is considering reauthorizing and rewriting this act. In the policy debates, there are those who advocate that controls be liberalized in order to promote exports. Although exports of particular goods and technologies can adversely affect U.S. national security, some argue that current export controls are too strict and hinder U.S. businesses in competing for sales abroad. They claim that many products under export control are available from other exporting countries and that the resultant loss of market share and jobs can harm the U.S. economy. This, in turn, has a negative effect on U.S. national security. Others, however, argue that further liberalization of export controls may compromise national security goals by putting sensitive products into the hands of potential adversaries. Those in this camp tend to view security concerns as being paramount in the U.S. export control system and that such controls can be an effective method to thwart proliferators, terrorist states, and countries that can threaten U.S. national security interests.", "As for the role of financial incentives as a weapon in open combat, armies have long been able to buy loyalties, pay potential enemies not to fight, finance local security forces consisting of unemployed potential insurgents, or offer rewards for the capture or killing of particular enemy leaders. This goes beyond, for example, carrying sacks of money into meetings with tribal sheiks. Such financial incentives can complement direct military campaigns by establishing a reward-based system in which members of the local citizenry view siding with the U.S. military preferable to aiding, or actually becoming, the adversary. For example, the U.S. Marine Corps Small Wars Manual stresses the importance of focusing on the social, economic, and political development of the people as well as on destruction. In Iraq, the use of financial incentives and the direct funding of armed Sunni militias as a key factor in the Awakening in Anbar province has been extensively debated. ", "An emerging field of economics addresses how to re-establish a viable economy during or after an invasion or counter-insurgency campaign. This is referred to as expeditionary economics. The chaos and destruction following hot battles present an economic condition ripe for corruption and extortion often with a security, economic, and governmental infrastructure that does not function. Yet during and in the aftermath of war, street markets often thrive, vendors can price gouge, and civilians have to go somewhere for food, water, and necessities. The questions of expeditionary economics include who should set up and govern such markets (particularly if the existing government has been toppled), how to allocate military resources between waging war and providing security for citizens, and eventually how to build a self-sustaining economy. This entails creating jobs, extending basic services to citizens, improving infrastructure, and making progress toward fiscal sustainability. These are particularly difficult if they must be done while a war or counter-insurgency campaign is being conducted\u2014as is the case currently in Afghanistan.", "A further role of economics in national security centers on economic factors as a contributor to conflicts both among countries and within national borders. Access to resources, such as oil, diamonds, water, and territory, continues to create tensions and can be a casus belli that either may lead to overt hostilities between contesting countries or incite sectional and factional violence within nations. The list of territorial claims in dispute among nations is long, and history is replete with examples of conflicts over diamonds, oil, or other minerals. Even though the sharing of resources, such as river water by India and Pakistan, can necessitate cooperation between countries, it also holds the potential for conflict, although, so far, conflicts over water have been minimal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Macroeconomic Issues in National Security", "paragraphs": ["At the macroeconomic level, the recession of 2008-2009 in combination with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and rising costs for domestic social programs have pushed the U.S. budget deep into deficit. Alarm bells have been sounding from many quarters that the nation is on an unsustainable fiscal path. The issues for Congress include whether to slow the growth of the budget deficit and how to do so without compromising national security, how to achieve a balance between military and civilian expenditures, and whether a \"peace dividend\" is forthcoming as expenditures for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan diminish.", "Economic growth requires both sufficient demand on the macroeconomic level and increased productivity at the microeconomic level. Microeconomic policies combine with monetary and fiscal policies at the macroeconomic level to attempt to enlarge the overall size of the economy in order to provide the \"rising tide that lifts all ships.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Federal Deficit and Military Spending13", "paragraphs": ["The macroeconomic debate centers on the federal government's budget and its components in general and military expenditures in particular. The expectation is that the current and projected growth in the national debt is not sustainable and, given the slow recovery from the financial crisis, the nation is facing a period of increased austerity that will compel deep cuts in the federal budget. The question is when those cuts should be made and to what extent the Pentagon is to be included or exempt from budget cuts. In August 2010, Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that the national debt is the single biggest threat to national security.", "In theory, the budget for the national security community, including the military and homeland security, should be sufficient to address foreign threats, defend the homeland, prevail in ongoing wars, and help define and advance U.S. interests abroad, including, to a certain extent, projecting U.S. democratic values and human rights. In practice, there is considerable disagreement on how best to address these tasks and the ways and means necessary to carry them out. Without concurrence on the tasks, one can hardly expect a public policy consensus on the optimal size of the military budget and whether the amount being spent is too great or too small. The line of reasoning in the public debate, therefore, tends to be that the military budget is either too large or too small relative to what the country can afford, to past expenditures, to the overall federal budget, to what is spent on other programs, or to what other nations spend. Another line of reasoning is that the military budget also is too large or too small relative to current war fighting needs, to rising threats from non-state actors (such as terrorists) or from states with nuclear weapon programs (such as North Korea and Iran), or for its participation in alleviating the effects of natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, infectious diseases, or climate change).", "U.S. defense expenditures account for nearly $700 billion in annual budget outlays, including some $400 billion in contracts for goods and services. The impact on U.S. gross domestic product exceeds $1 trillion. U.S. defense expenditures are roughly equal to those of the next 14 countries combined, account for about 20% of the U.S. federal budget, and comprise an estimated 4.9% of U.S. gross domestic product. ", "Since the debate over military spending is quite extensive, a detailed review of that debate lies beyond the purview of this report. Here we cite a statement from the Secretary of Defense plus two representative studies, one for increasing or maintaining defense expenditures and the other for considering cuts. We also present some relevant economic data.", "In 2010, Defense Secretary Robert Gates called for significant cuts in defense spending. He has outlined some details of his plans to save $100 billion over the next five years. This includes new guidelines on how the Pentagon buys goods and services with more fixed price contracts, cutting overhead, gaining efficiency, and closing the Joint Forces Command in Norfolk, Virginia. (For further discussion, see the section below on \"Defense Acquisition and Contracting Process.) Secretary Gates, however, has warned against sharp reductions in military spending, arguing that such cuts would be \"catastrophic\" to national security. ", "In October 2010, the Heritage Foundation, American Enterprise Institute, and the Foreign Policy Initiative issued a report claiming that the arguments frequently made for Pentagon spending cuts are false and that the Pentagon is actually underfunded given the need for comprehensive military modernization and to prepare fully for the wars of the future. The argument rests primarily on the global reach and expanding responsibilities of the U.S. military, the need to update military hardware, and the fact that spending on entitlements, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, has outstripped that of the Pentagon. The report noted that even if Pentagon spending of about $700 billion were eliminated entirely, it would only halve the fiscal deficit of around $1.3 trillion and hardly put a dent into the $13.6 trillion national debt. The report was followed by an op-ed piece by the heads of the three authoring organizations that argued that a strong military is necessary to keep the peace, and peace is required for global prosperity. Hence, military spending is not a net drain on the U.S. economy.", "A counter view of the debate has been put forward by the Sustainable Defense Task Force. On June 11, 2010, it issued a report that concluded that at a time of \"growing concern over federal deficits, it is essential that all elements of the federal budget be subjected to careful scrutiny. The Pentagon budget should be no exception.\" The report presents options that the Task Force argues could save up to $960 billion between 2011 and 2020. The options include recommendations that focus on cutting programs based on unreliable or unproven technologies, missions and capabilities with poor cost-benefit relationships, capabilities that mismatch or over-match current and emerging challenges, and management reforms. Based partly on this report, a group of 57 Members of Congress sent a letter to the Commission on Fiscal Responsibility calling on the Commission to subject military spending to the same rigorous scrutiny that non-military spending was to receive and to do it in a way that would not endanger national security.", "On December 1, 2010, the Commission released its proposals to reduce the budget deficit. These proposals included $828 billion in deficit reduction between 2012 and 2015 through cuts in discretionary spending, tax reform, health care cost containment, mandatory savings, Social Security reform, and changes in the budget process. In particular, the Commission recommended that both security and non-security discretionary spending be cut by an equal percentage. Since security spending is twice as large as non-security discretionary spending, equal percentage cuts imply that the amount of cuts in security spending would be twice as large as that in non-security spending.", "As shown in Figure 2 , since 1980, the share of national defense (excluding Veteran's Affairs) has been declining after a bulge in the late 1980s. From 22% in 1980 it is now around 20%. The figure also demonstrates the argument that defense alone will not solve the budget deficit problem. Human resources command a larger share of the budget (67% in 2010). ", " Figure 3 shows federal government budget outlays and receipts in trillions of current dollars. This shows the dramatic impact of the global financial crisis on government revenues from 2008 and the gradual recovery expected through 2015. It also shows the steady increase across the budget that has occurred since 2000 and the futility of trying to cut outlays enough to reduce the budget deficit significantly without considering changes to entitlements (Health [mostly Medicaid], Medicare, Social Security, and Income Security) in addition to the Other category and National Defense. Data in Figure 3 are not adjusted for inflation to show how actual government outlays have changed relative to government receipts. While total receipts are projected to recover as the economy recovers, government outlays are projected to continue to rise. How much each will change depends greatly on actions by Congress.", " Figure 4 shows the amount of gross federal debt and that held by the public (including the Federal Reserve). The difference between the two amounts is that debt held in government accounts. The total debt is the accumulation of federal budget deficits and surpluses. In 2009, at $11.9 trillion, the gross debt amounted to 83% of U.S. annual gross domestic product. How much of a burden is this on the U.S. economy? Currently, the Treasury has few problems in issuing securities to fund the debt. Treasury securities are in such demand that in late October 2010, in some secondary markets, investors were willing to accept negative interest rates. It is true that China and Japan combined hold about $1.6 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, and they are being pressured to reduce their trade surpluses and, in the case of China, reduce their buying of dollar assets in order to strengthen the dollar vis-\u00e0-vis the renminbi. In the short-term, therefore, the financing of the deficit does not appear to be a problem. Over the medium- to long-term, however, interest payments will take an increasingly larger share of the federal budget, and, as world economies recover, investors may seek higher returns elsewhere. This could cause interest rates to rise throughout the economy and reduce U.S. well-being as Americans are taxed to make interest payments to foreign holders of U.S. debt and as fewer investments are made in U.S. manufacturing and infrastructure because of higher interest costs. The national debt crises in Iceland, Greece, and Ireland, moreover, have raised the specter of countries nearing default on sovereign debts and requiring large rescue packages. Although the situation in the United States is different, at some point markets could become greatly concerned over the large U.S. debt and take actions adverse to U.S. interests. History has shown that when investors decide to dump a country's securities or currency, the drop in confidence is fast and the downward slope steep.

As part of the 2010 National Security Strategy , the President calls for achieving long-term fiscal sustainability. To accomplish this goal, he calls for creating a responsible federal budget that reduces the budget deficit by making the best use of taxpayer dollars and working with global partners and institutions.", "The Administration initially proposed to work toward reducing the deficit using a multi-pronged approach. Components of this approach include placing a three-year freeze (in nominal dollar terms) on non-security discretionary spending, implementing a new fee on the largest financial services companies to recoup taxpayer losses for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and eliminating \"tax loopholes and unnecessary subsidies.\" The Administration also created the above-mentioned bipartisan fiscal commission, which is tasked with providing recommendations to generate additional budgetary savings and further improve the budget outlook in the medium-term. Together, these proposals, also included in the President's FY2011 Budget, are aimed at cutting the deficit in half by the end of the President's current term.", "The current economic climate poses challenges to achieving the deficit reduction goals of the NSS. Numerous actions taken by the federal government in FY2008 and FY2009 have had major effects on the budget deficit, including two major economic stimulus measures and a variety of programs in response to the financial turmoil. The impact of this legislation, along with health care reform and any additional legislation enacted, will affect deficit levels in FY2010 and beyond. The final costs of federal responses to the nation's economic turmoil will also depend on the pace of economic recovery, how well firms with federal credit guarantees weather future financial shocks, and government losses or gains on its asset purchases.", "Most budget analysts agree that deficit reduction is key over the long-term in order to stabilize the economy and establish sound fiscal policy. However, the question over the short- to medium-term is how to ensure the continuation of economic recovery, while, at the same time, providing indications that the Administration and Congress are committed to improving the long-term budget outlook. If a more sustainable fiscal path is not achieved, high budget deficits and the resulting high levels of federal debt could limit the government's flexibility in meeting its obligations or in responding to the emerging national needs.

It is of most concern, perhaps, in its absence: during recessions, periods of high unemployment and bankruptcy, and when there is a gap between economic expectations and reality. When economic times are difficult, the tradeoff between physical and economic security comes into clearer focus. Economic security depends greatly upon (1) an economic growth rate sufficient to keep the rate of unemployment low and provide opportunities for entrepreneurs, (2) U.S. industries able to compete in international markets, and (3) U.S. leadership in science, technology, and innovation. ", "Historically, three microeconomic issues related to defense spending have generated considerable political debate. The first is the sufficiency of the dedicated defense industry or what is often called the defense industrial and technological base. This includes whether sufficient civilian industrial capacity and relevant technology exists to support military procurement (particularly if there is a surge in needs or a shift in security-related technology that necessitates new capabilities such as in cyber warfare). The second deals with the Pentagon's procurement and contracting process and how to ensure the integrity of the defense supply chain. The third deals with how defense dollars are spent in local communities and the level of spending that supports jobs in specific areas\u2014even if the expenditures are for products or roles deemed unnecessary by the Pentagon (e.g. bases identified for closure or continued procurement of certain big-ticket military hardware items).", "In the following section, these three microeconomic issues are addressed.

In the preindustrial United States, with small standing militaries and rare threats to the national defense, the output of this \"arsenal system,\" augmented when necessary by purchases from foreign suppliers and contracts with private gunsmiths and boat builders, proved adequate to meet the nation's defense needs.", "The advent of industrialization and mass mobilization for war, presaged by the nation's experience in the Civil War, initiated a gradual change in how the United States approached the task of providing itself with weapons of war. Throughout the latter half of the 19 th century, neither the Army's Ordnance Department nor the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair could reasonably be considered leaders in the introduction of innovative military technologies. Outside reformers, such as the President or congressional committees, often had to push both the military departments and private industry to create a significant domestic war production capacity. Even so, the United States entered the 20 th century with industrialization efforts focused on a rapidly expanding commercial market. World-class military hardware, when deemed necessary, was procured abroad from arms makers in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.", "The American entry into World War I in 1917 saw unprecedented mobilization of the industry and manpower for the national defense. In many respects, though, the experience provided more lessons in how not to mobilize industry than how to do so well. The sudden upsurge of material needs in the Army and Navy overwhelmed the existing military procurement bureaucracies and the government's production facilities. Private industries pursuing suddenly lucrative production contracts flooded the nation's transportation system and led to a meltdown of the Army's distribution network. The popular image of the American doughboy using French and British weapons in the trenches and flying French, Italian, and British aircraft can be seen as much a result of the inadequacy of Army procurement and distribution practices than the technical superiority of European industries.", "The lessons of the First World War were not lost on those who had to plan for a potential American involvement in World War II twenty-three years later. For the nation's industry, the impact of the Great War had been mixed. Though military contracts had proven profitable, procurement had been overestimated and uncoordinated, the level of technology incorporated in weapon designs had been low relative to European arms, and type of contracts used had left liability for early cancellation largely with the companies. The abrupt declaration of the Armistice in November 1918 had caught many unawares, led to the abrupt termination of many contracts, and precipitated thousands of court claims against the government.", "Between the world wars, defense appropriations plummeted to relatively miniscule levels. Industry demobilized, turning again to satisfying civilian demand, and the needs of the Army and Navy could once again be satisfied largely by government arsenals and shipyards.", "Paradoxically, the Great Depression helped to set the stage for the creation of a dedicated defense industry. Military appropriations fell further\u2014to the point that Congress authorized new Navy construction one ship at a time\u2014and the funds that were made available went to basic procurement, not innovative technology development. The rapid rearmament of Europe in the mid-1930s and the large-scale Japanese assault on China provoked little response from the U.S. government until the end of the decade, when Congress began increasing defense appropriations and the War Department undertook to place as many procurement contracts with as wide a supplier base as possible.", "Even with a rapidly expanding domestic war materials market and major armed conflict raging in Europe and Asia, private enterprise proved reluctant to invest in the war-specific productive capacity needed to meet the potential demand. Instead, manufacturers remembered the industrial dislocations of 1918 and 1919 and preferred to focus on a slowly recovering, but more reliable, civilian market. Nevertheless, with both the Administration and Congress preparing for a potential military conflict of unprecedented scale, industry had little choice but to negotiate plans for potential war mobilization. The methods upon which the government agencies and corporations eventually settled minimized corporate risk while retaining flexibility to meet unanticipated demands: emphasis on subcontracting, temporary conversion of existing civilian production capacity to war manufacturing, expansion of existing private plants, and construction of government-financed, government-owned facilities that would be staffed and operated by private corporations. While the war effort followed all four paths, the government-financed expansion of private factories and the government construction of contractor-operated facilities (the GOCOs) endured to form the core of the post-war military-industrial complex.", "When the storm broke at the end of 1941 and the United States entered the conflict, the vastly expanded production needs of the war again overwhelmed the production capacity of the government's arsenal system. This opened war material development and production to a number of new, primarily civilian, players. Prominent among them, the Office of Scientific Research and Development, independent of both War and Navy Departments, contracted for military research and production of innovative weapons such as the proximity fuse, airborne radar, and the bazooka. Congress encouraged industrial development by liberalizing private corporate financing through accelerated asset depreciation and allowed the government to guarantee corporate debt. The Defense Plant Corporation, a government corporation, purchased or built production facilities operated by contractors. The Office of Production Management\u2014later the War Production Board\u2014prioritized war material deliveries and controlled nonessential (nondefense) production.", "As the war neared its conclusion, procurement wound down, contracts were terminated, temporary civilian agencies disbanded, and government controls on labor, finance, and industry were eased. At war's end, both armed services and industry demobilized. Defense appropriations plummeted, and privately owned manufacturing capacity shifted back to civilian production, straining to satisfy consumer demand held in check by a decade of depression and four years of war.", "But the U.S. could not return to its prewar posture. The nation's position in world politics and economics had changed fundamentally by 1945, having assumed worldwide responsibilities in defense\u2014as demonstrated by the Berlin Crisis, the rise of Communist governments in Europe and Asia, and in an unexpected war in Korea. The problem, as seen by both the Truman and the Eisenhower administrations, was to create a global defense at a price that would not cripple the domestic economy. The solution that both presidents pursued was technology as a substitute for high-cost manpower. U.S., indeed Western, defense would rely on a strategy of containing the influence of the enemy, the Soviet Union, within a defined geographic area.", "The military component of this containment strategy would not take the form of large, expensive standing armies ringing the communist world. Rather, the threat of Soviet-inspired expansion would be met with the threat of immediate, devastating attack with atomic, later thermonuclear, weapons delivered by new aircraft, missiles, ships, and submarines.", "The ensuing competition among the various military services to establish claims on this unprecedented approach to high-technology warfare encouraged the rapid rise of something not seen before, a peacetime civilian sector of industry dedicated to providing the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps with high-quality, cutting edge military systems. The focus on a nuclear first line of defense combined with strategic alliances prompted a spirited competition among the military services as each laid claim to some portion of the nuclear mission. The late 1940s and 1950s saw the creation of the Air Force's Strategic Air Command and development of the intercontinental bombers\u2014later missiles\u2014able to carry nuclear bombs and warheads to any point in the Soviet Union. Likewise, the Navy doubled the threat to Soviet targets, buying nuclear-capable aircraft and missiles and the large ships and submarines able to carry them close to the Soviet border. Even the Army staked a claim, creating a doctrine for fighting a contaminated ground war that would employ smaller nuclear weapons. Referred to as the Pentomic Army, these atomic soldiers needed both weapons and specialized equipment to operate on the nuclear battlefield.", "The desire to minimize manpower and cost and maximize the effectiveness of firepower helped to create an expectation that each new military system would perform significantly better than the one it succeeded. This expectation eventually came to be shared by the military that conceived of, managed, and used the systems, the legislators who paid for them, and the private corporations that actually built them. Two important factors reinforced that expectation\u2014the enduring presence of the Soviet Union, a powerful, sophisticated peer adversary that could project its presence globally, and the continued strengthening and consolidation of budgeting and program control in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "For the next half-century, each military department would have a well-defined protagonist against whom it could plan a war, and each would be competing within a centralized budgeting process for the wherewithal to fight it. As a result, the military departments demanded ever more capable and sophisticated weapons and supporting systems, and private industry strove to meet the needs of \"the customer.\"", "As the Cold War continued, some companies, such as Lockheed, General Dynamics, Raytheon, and others, devoted significant portions of their activities to defense projects. A number of corporations came to specialize in serving particular defense niches. Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation (later Grumman Aerospace Corporation), for example, became known as the premier builder of fixed wing aircraft for the Navy. Thus, President Dwight D. Eisenhower could be moved to devote a significant portion of his 10-minute farewell address to the nation on January 17, 1961 to this new phenomenon.", "Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations.

What can be said is that the economic impact, in general, is proportional to the size of the facility or contract relative to the size and resources of the local economy, the types of workers involved (whether they have the skills to find jobs in other industries), and whether the loss is primarily of household expenditures by military personnel (groceries, gasoline, rents, etc.) or of contracts needed to maintain capital- and skill-intensive manufacturing facilities (e.g. shipbuilding or aircraft production). ", "Economic impact studies of such actions often rely on multiplier effects. These are defined either as the number of jobs in the community generated by each job paid for by the military or by how much economic activity is generated in the local community by a dollar spent by the military. For the employment multiplier, the concept is that each direct job created generates indirect employment by those industries that support that job holder. For the income multiplier, the concept is that a dollar spent in the local community is then re-spent as purchases are made through the relevant supply chain. The more of each dollar that is spent (not saved) at each round and the less that is spent on imports the higher the multiplier effect. These multipliers can range from less than 1 to as much as 2.5 or 3.0 depending on the nature of the military expenditure, and the economic conditions in the community. When considering a base closure or loss of large procurement program, the multiplier also depends on the resiliency of the workforce and the length of the period of adjustment. The more quickly the bases are converted to civilian use, the higher the value of underlying real estate, the lower the clean-up costs, and the more vibrant the local and national economy, the lower the impact of the base closure on the local communities. ", "For communities that are adversely affected by a base closure or loss of a large procurement contract or program, the adjustment period for securing new jobs can be difficult and is normally longer than four years, with some communities requiring up to 20 years. Base realignments or program cuts also have a fiscal effect on local governments as they deal with changes in their revenue base and issues such as a mismatch between existing infrastructure (particularly roads and schools) and the needs of the military. A Government Accountability Office study of 73 base closures over the 1988 to 2003 period found that the percent of jobs recovered by local communities ranged from 0% to more than 1,000%.

Congressional support for the 2007 America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ), which in part sought to improve economic competitiveness through STEM education, reflects a similar position. In this sense, the STEM education provisions of the National Security Strategy are broadly consistent with existing federal policy.", "Nevertheless, many issues in federal STEM education policy remain contentious. While the STEM education provisions of the President's 2010 National Security Strategy reflect consensus positions by and large, generally speaking, opinions vary on how to implement these objectives. ", "For example, observers disagree about whether the problem with the U.S. scientific and technological workforce is on the supply side or the demand side. The general consensus seems to be that the U.S. is not producing enough STEM graduates and scientifically literate citizens. As a result, policymakers have paid much attention to policies that seek to increase the supply of STEM-trained workers, such as reforms to improve STEM teaching or increase financial aid for STEM college students. ", "Other analysts argue that the pursuit of supply side solutions fails to address demand side factors like the limited attractiveness of scientific careers and differential employment rates in certain STEM fields (for example, surpluses in the life sciences and shortages in engineering). These analysts argue that the U.S. STEM education system may actually produce too many scientists. They suggest more attention to policies addressing demand side factors, such as increasing the number of tenure-track jobs and providing grants for early-career scientists.", "Beyond the supply-demand debate are other questions about the relative value of STEM education data, the interpretation of that data, and implications for policymaking. Reformers sometimes argue that poor student performance on mathematics and science tests, among other things, indicates a need to overhaul the U.S. STEM education system. Other analysts dispute claims that poor performance on average should be interpreted as suggesting general reform of the U.S. STEM education system. The data, they argue, show that the U.S. is a top producer of the highest- and lowest-scoring students. This distinction, they claim, merits a subtler policy response targeting only low-performing students.", "Other issues in STEM education policy include debates about whether STEM education reform can or should be undertaken outside of general education reform. The scope and scale of federal STEM education programs is also an open question. Some studies have found a lack of coordination, or even of an accurate count of federal STEM education programs. STEM advocates have also advanced a variety of policy options\u2014for example, hands-on learning, specialty schools, or teacher training\u2014designed to address various perceived deficiencies.

Those opposing increases in temporary workers assert that there is no compelling evidence of labor shortages and cite the growing rate of unemployment.

One set of arguments in opposition to such efforts, which generally characterize such activities as \"industrial policy,\" includes the inability and/or inefficiency of the government in making such decisions; the supplanting of the judgment of the market and dampening of market signals; and the role of politics in the selection of technologies, companies, and/or industries for favored treatment. A second thrust in opposition to this type of funding, generally referred to as the \"corporate welfare\" argument, is that such an approach forces individual taxpayers to subsidize companies (including sometimes highly profitable, large, multinational corporations) for the benefit of shareholders.", "President Obama's R&D funding record with respect to regular annual appropriations has been one of small increases (and perhaps cuts when adjusted for current dollars). The President's FY2010 R&D request was 0.4% above the estimated FY2009 appropriation; his FY2011 request for R&D was 0.2% greater than the estimated FY2010 appropriation. However, analysis of President Obama's R&D funding record is complicated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ). ARRA provided billions of dollars of R&D funding to multiple agencies, some with the authority to spend it in FY2009 and beyond.

The figures are calculated for both current dollars and constant 2000 dollars. In each period, for both R&D and research alone, the compound annual growth rates are positive.", "Concerns about flat or declining federal funding for physical science and engineering research led to calls from leaders in industry and academia to substantially bolster funding. In 2006, President Bush initiated, as part of his American Competitiveness Initiative, an effort to double research funding for the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy's Office of Science, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology laboratories. These agencies were chosen, in part, because a substantial portion of their research portfolios is focused on the physical science and engineering disciplines. President Obama, in his A Strategy for American Innovation, adopted the same objective and target agencies, proposing agency funding levels in FY2010 and FY2011 toward completing the doubling effort in 2017. The actual FY2010 funding increase for these agencies was 4.3%, below the 7.2% rate required annually to achieve a 10-year doubling. ", "There are also issues related to how effective increases in federal research funding may be in stimulating U.S. economic growth and job creation. First, historically, the time required to conduct basic research and translate the knowledge into new products has been measured in decades. Thus, while these investments may be critical to long-term scientific, technological, and industrial leadership, investments in research are generally unlikely to produce near-term commercial results. ", "Second, the conditions that facilitated the United States' ability to reap the benefits of federal research have changed significantly over time. After World War II, the United States dominated global R&D. As late as 1960, the United States accounted for more than 69% of global R&D; federal funding alone accounted for 45% of global R&D. Accordingly, the R&D investments of the Federal government could drive global technology development pathways, and American companies\u2014as well as the U.S. economy and workers\u2014were generally the first to benefit. Today, the Federal government accounts for about 10% of global R&D, not because the federal investment has declined in absolute terms, but because other public and private investors around the world have grown at a faster pace. As new competitors emerged around the globe, many have been aggressive in accessing the results of the U.S. federal research investment which is largely performed in the open and available to all. Digitization of this research has expanded its accessibility and may have further eroded its unique value to U.S. companies. ", "Third, U.S. firms have more options than ever as to where to conduct work and locate production. Thus, even U.S. companies that are successful in translating the knowledge generated by federal research investments into products may opt to conduct related activities\u2014such as design, engineering, manufacturing, and support\u2014in locations outside of the United States. In the post-WWII era, these activities would have been more likely to occur within U.S. borders, creating economic growth and jobs in the U.S. economy.", "While federal investment in research may be required for retaining U.S. scientific, technological, and industrial leadership and for generating economic growth and jobs, it may be insufficient in this regard in the absence of other policies affecting the relative attractiveness of the United States for the conduct of innovation, production and related work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transforming the Energy Economy132", "paragraphs": ["The 2010 National Security Strategy characterizes a national reluctance to move away from fossil fuels as leading to energy dependence which is likely to undermine both our national security and economic prosperity.

These price variations represent a more than 70% change in price during a seven-month period. In 2010, oil prices have varied between a low of approximately $70 per barrel and a high of approximately $85 per barrel.

", "A key factor in assessing the likelihood of an energy transition as proposed in the NSS is the substitutability of energy sources in a wide variety of final uses. For clean energy technologies to be adapted, it would be beneficial if the transition could be accomplished maximizing the use of existing infrastructure and final consumption goods. Within any given energy sector, the less substitutable and less able to use existing infrastructure a new energy source is, the more costly and time consuming the transition is likely to be. ", "For example, in the automobile and light truck transportation sector, which accounts for almost half of U.S. crude oil consumption, gasoline is the key fuel. A large infrastructure of refineries, pipelines, and service stations exist to supply product to the market. Recently, ethanol has been added to gasoline, requiring separate handling facilities, but still utilizing the same final consumer distribution system. Replacement of gasoline, either by a transition fuel, [natural gas based fuels are already being proposed to replace diesel fuel in trucks], would require a new, large-scale distribution system providing convenient access for consumers, and running parallel to the existing system. A later transition, to perhaps an electricity-based system, would make the existing oil-based infrastructure largely obsolete. On the consumer side, only limited possibilities for the conversion of the existing fleet of vehicles to alternative fuels exist. Due to the large automobile fleet and its relatively slow turn-over, it likely to take a number of years for the gasoline powered automobile/light truck fleet to be transformed to renewable energy based fuels.", "Electricity generation could use the existing infrastructure as long as energy transition implies simply burning different fuels at the existing centralized generating plants. The barriers in that case are largely a national policy choice: should the United States draw on its large coal reserves, or cut back on domestic mining with the attendant implications for employment in the that sector? A more decentralized electric generating system, perhaps based on solar energy, would, as in the case of the oil industry, make capital investments in generating facilities largely redundant. ", "Jobs will very likely be created in both the transition to, and the achievement of a clean, renewable energy future. However, it is also likely that jobs will be lost in the traditional energy industries. Whether these gains and losses will offset each other, or favor one side or the other is unknown. Also unknown is whether the new jobs created will be higher or lower paying jobs than the ones they supplant. In addition, the skill requirements and locations of the new and old energy industry jobs will likely differ, making it less likely that actual individuals who lose a job will be able to find a job in the clean energy industry.", "To the extent that clean, renewable energy sources also implies domestic sourcing, key cost elements may decline. The cost of imported oil and petroleum products attained a yearly historic peak of over $400 billion in 2008, and is projected to reach approximately $181 billion in 2010. Reducing gasoline usage will decrease these totals. In addition, some analysts tie a share of the U.S. defense budget to securing oil supplies. To the extent that reducing, or doing away with, this responsibility scales back the required military force, the actual savings may exceed the reduced cost of oil imports. ", "A key benefit from the transformation of the energy economy to cleaner fuels is likely to be the reduction in carbon emissions. Fossil fuels, to one degree or another, all necessarily emit carbon. The carbon can be captured, and other pollutants can be treated, but all at a cost. Using fuels that do not emit significant amounts of carbon while achieving similar levels of performance is a more direct way to confront climate change issues.

Subsidies for shale oil, solar energy, and other alternatives have so far generally not resulted in products that met the market test.

To maintain these benefits to global commerce and scientific achievement, the NSS calls for investments in space technology R&D, strengthening the space industrial base, and collaboration with universities to encourage students to pursue space-related careers.", "For the first two of these goals related to space technology R&D and the space industrial base, the NSP directs federal departments and agencies to strengthen U.S. leadership in space-related science, technology, and industry by conducting basic and applied research, encouraging the commercial space sector, and ensuring the availability of space-related industrial capabilities. Specifically, it directs the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, and others to \"reinvigorate U.S. leadership by promoting technology development, improving industrial capacity, and maintaining a robust supplier base.\" The goals of investing in technology R&D and strengthening the industrial base are also consistent with proposals in the Administration's FY2010 budget for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), such as increased NASA funding for space technology development rather than specific flight missions, and a new initiative to help industry develop commercial crew launch services.", "Because significant national security capabilities are provided by commercial space assets, some national security analysts have expressed concern over the state of the U.S. space launch industry and other factors affecting access to space for commercial satellites. The NSS does not specifically mention commercial access to space, other than its general references to space capabilities and the space industrial base.

At present, congressional attention to space workforce policy is focused primarily on the end of the space shuttle program, the proposed termination of NASA's Constellation program, and the impact of these changes on the existing workforce. An Administration budget amendment in June 2010 proposed transferring $100 million from NASA to the Departments of Commerce and Labor \"to spur regional economic growth and job creation along the Florida Space Coast and other affected regions.\" In light of these concerns about the future of the existing space workforce, some analysts might question the focus in the NSS on encouraging additional university students to choose space-related careers.", "The NSS additionally identifies U.S. space capabilities as critical to U.S. national security interests.

These objectives were largely in place from the George W. Bush and even earlier Bill Clinton era space policies, although most analysts argue that the tone of the Obama NSP stresses greater international cooperation on all these issues.

Many of these efforts are in place or underway throughout the U.S. national security space environment. In particular, the Administration is looking to lead continued development and adoption of international and industry standards designed to minimize orbital debris, such as through the UN Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines. Additionally, the NSP states the United States will continue its own efforts to conduct research, and develop technologies and techniques to deal with the challenges and threats to U.S. national security assets posed by orbital debris. Finally, the Administration is looking to enhance collaboration even further between the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, NASA and other U.S. agencies, as well as industry and foreign nations to improve global understanding of the threat to all in space posed by orbital debris and to seek ways to deal with that problem.", "Another emphasis is the Obama Administration's stated interest in space-related arms control measures that it argues would be equitable, effectively verifiable, and enhance the national security of the United States and its allies. Arguably, this differs from the Bush Administration approach that stated the United States would not accept limitations on U.S. freedom of action in space. Beyond some potential arms control measures such as those mentioned above regarding orbital debris, there does not appear to be any broad or overarching arms control measure being seriously considered by the Administration. In fact, despite some stated Administration support for a proposed UN Prevention of an Arms Race in Space agreement, for example, the Obama Administration has refrained from voting for such resolutions when the opportunity has presented itself. Neither has the Administration indicated specifically whether it will support the space arms control treaty introduced by Russia and China at the 2008 Conference on Disarmament.

Trade and its impact on labor and wages in the economy generates much debate. On one hand, there are those who extol the benefits of free trade and argue in favor of a free and open trading system. On the other hand, some argue that foreign trade, principally imports, destroys jobs, undermines communities, and reduces the standard of living for many Americans.", "Basically, trade represents an exchange of goods or services between two or more willing parties. Economic theory holds that such trade allows nations to use their resources in the most efficient way possible in order to maximize the total amount of goods and services that are available to their citizens, a common definition of a nation's standard of living. As a result of this maximization process, it is thought that nations trade because it serves their national interests. In the same way that individuals gain by specializing in activities that use their strongest skills and then trade with others, nations specialize in the production of certain goods and then trade with other nations for the goods they do not produce. Essentially, nations export in order to import goods and services they do not produce, or cannot produce efficiently. Most economists maintain that trade increases total welfare by spurring changes in the productive processes of the economy that make production more efficient and it increases the amount and variety of goods and services that are available to consumers. Economic theory argues, however, that the total number of jobs in the economy and the level of wages are determined primarily by the macroeconomic environment and not through trade, although trade can add to the rewards for labor, if that is a nation's abundant factor of production. This means, though, that for an economy such as the United States, trade alone is not seen as determining the level of wages, the level of output, or the level of employment and, therefore, does not serve well as a jobs creation program.", "In the current highly globalized economy, trade has come to represent a complex set of transactions. Nations not only trade goods and services, but they also trade a broad range of financial products. In addition, liberalized capital flows and floating exchange rates have greatly expanded the amount of capital that flows between countries. As a result of these financial transactions, nations that have a surplus of saving can lend that excess saving to nations with deficient saving, closely linking national economies. In the U.S. economy, foreign capital inflows play an important role by bridging the gap between domestic supplies of and demand for capital. Capital inflows help keep U.S. interest rates below the level they would reach without them, and they allow the nation to spend beyond its current output, including financing its trade deficit. ", "Another aspect of capital mobility and capital inflows is the impact such capital flows have on the international exchange value of the dollar. Demand for U.S. assets, such as financial securities, translates into demand for the dollar, since U.S. securities are denominated in dollars. As demand for the dollar rises or falls according to overall demand for dollar-denominated assets, the value of the dollar changes. These exchange rate changes, in turn, have secondary effects on the prices of U.S. and foreign goods, which tend to alter the U.S. trade balance. The prominent role of the dollar means that the exchange value of the dollar often reacts to economic and political news and events across national borders. While the global role of the dollar helps facilitate a broad range of international economic and financial activities, it also means that the dollar's exchange value can vary greatly on a daily or weekly basis as it is buffeted by international events. A triennial survey of the world's leading central banks conducted by the Bank for International Settlements in April 2010 indicates that the daily trading of foreign currencies through traditional foreign exchange markets totals $4.0 trillion, up from the $3.3 trillion a day reported in the previous survey conducted in 2007. In addition to the traditional foreign exchange market, the over-the-counter (OTC) foreign exchange derivatives market reported that daily turnover of interest rate and non-traditional foreign exchange derivatives contracts reached $2.5 trillion in April 2010. The combined amount of $6.5 trillion for daily foreign exchange trading in the traditional and OTC markets is nearly half the size of the annual U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and more than three times the annual amount of U.S. exports of goods and services. The data also indicate that 85% of the global foreign exchange turnover is in U.S. dollars.", "Increasing the rate of saving in the U.S. economy can be supported by any number of policy objectives, but it is not necessarily a path to a higher level of employment. By increasing the amount of domestic saving in the U.S. economy relative to the level of demand for those funds, the economy would be less reliant on foreign capital inflows. In turn, a lower level of demand for foreign capital would lower demand for the dollar, thereby reducing pressure on the international exchange value of the dollar. As the dollar would weaken in international markets, U.S. exports would become more price competitive, which would tend to shift production and employment in the economy towards the production of export goods. Such a shift in employment most likely would not add to the total number of jobs in the economy, but would represent a shifting of the existing jobs toward the export goods sectors. Increasing saving in the economy and reducing the inflow of foreign funds may also ease the concerns of those who argue that the exposure to foreign holdings of U.S. assets increases the overall risks to the economy should foreign investors decide to withdraw from the U.S. financial markets for political or economic reasons.

Chinese economic policies are viewed by many as a significant cause of the global imbalances. ", "To illustrate: ", "Gross savings are the total level of domestic savings, including private, corporate, and government. Savings represents income that is not consumed or spent by businesses. Over the past several years, the United States has maintained one of the world's lowest gross savings rates (i.e., total national savings as a percent of GDP), while China has maintained one of the world's highest national savings rates. From 1990 to 2009, U.S. gross national savings as a percent of GDP declined from 13.5% to 8.7%, while China's rose from 37.8% to 50.5%. The United States does not save enough to fund its investment needs and must borrow from abroad, while China has excess savings relative to its investment needs. In 2008, the ratio of U.S. gross domestic savings to gross investment was 66.9%, the lowest among the world's major economies. On the other hand, the ratio for China was 122.2%, one of highest among major economies. Nations that do not save enough to meet domestic investment run current account deficits and those that save more than they need for domestic investment run current account surpluses. In nominal dollar terms, the United States had the world's largest current account deficit at $706 billion in 2008, while China had the world's largest current account surplus at $426 billion. These balances were also significant as a share of GDP: 9.6% for China and -4.9% for the United States. Until very recently, domestic private consumption has been the dominant contributor to U.S. GDP growth. In 2008, private consumption as a percent of GDP was 70%, the highest among the major world economies. Private consumption as a percent of GDP for China was 35.3%, among the world's lowest. Analysis by the International Monetary Fund estimated that fixed investment related to tradable goods plus net exports together accounted for over 60% of China's GDP growth from 2001 to 2008, (up from 40% from 1990 to 2000). This was significantly higher than that in the G-7 countries (16%), the euro area (30%) and the rest of Asia (35%). ", "Many economists contend that China's economic policies have favored sectors producing tradable goods at the expense of other domestic sectors, which led to over-investment in many industries and suppressed domestic consumption. For example, China's central bank heavily intervenes in foreign exchange markets to limit the appreciation of its currency, the renminbi (RMB) or yuan against the dollar and other major currencies. This policy makes Chinese exports cheaper, and foreign imports into China more expensive than they would be if market forces determined the exchange rate of the RMB. Such policies have led China to become the world's largest holder of foreign exchange reserves at $2.5 trillion through June 2010, a large share of which (some estimate around 70%) is in U.S. dollar assets. Rather than just hold onto dollars that earn no interest, China has invested a large share of these holdings in U.S. securities, especially U.S. Treasury securities which are used to fund U.S. budget deficits. China is the largest holder of U.S. Treasury securities, estimated at $844 billion as of June 2010. Many analysts contend that Chinese large-scale investment in the United States contributed to artificially low real U.S. interest rates that in turn led to the U.S. housing bubble and subsequent global financial crisis and economic slowdown.

The Chinese government responded with a $586 billion economic stimulus program that was largely focused on infrastructure development as well as loose monetary policies to boost bank lending in order to boost domestic demand. These policies appear to have been successful in the short-run. While many of the world's largest economies fell into recession in 2009, China's was able to maintain fairly healthy economic growth, with real GDP growth at 9.1% in 2009 (although down from 13% in 2007) and an estimated 10.1% in 2010.

It has stated plans to further improve infrastructure, boost education spending, improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution, and develop a comprehensive social safety net, For example, in April 2009, the government pledged to implement a three-year, $124.4 billion, plan to begin the establishment of universal health care plan to be in place by 2020. However, some remain skeptical of China's willingness to eliminate its export-oriented economic policies. For example, in June 2010, the Chinese government announced it would allow its currency to gradually appreciate against the dollar and other currencies, a policy that was implemented from July 2005 to July 2008 (when the RMB was allowed to rise by 21% against the dollar) but was halted when the global economic slowdown began in mid-2008. Yet, the RMB has appreciated by only 0.6% from June though August 21, 2010. Some U.S. economists have charged that China's currency policy has forced other Asian economies to try to hold down the value of their currency against the dollar in order to compete against Chinese exports. This in turn, some contend, has diminished U.S. exports and has undermined global economic recovery.

When the global financial crisis hit, leaders decided that emerging-markets were too important to exclude from these discussions. The G-7/G-8 leaders convened, for the first time, leaders from a more diverse set of countries that included advanced and emerging-market countries (the G-20).

Illicit actors may seek to store criminal proceeds within the international financial system or use legitimately-sourced funding stored in the international financial system with the intent to use it for the financing of illicit activities. Although there are no reliable and precise estimates for either the amount of such dirty money, experts widely agree that the combined total volume circulating in the international financial system is likely vast.

Policies to combat financial crimes can be described as evolutionary, building and refining upon prior efforts as new financial threats emerge, while remaining roughly consistent with the goals of prior administrations. With such evolutionary progress, U.S. efforts to protect the international financial system from illicit threats appear to have also grown in terms of the scope and number of programs in place, as well as in the amount of resources and number of personnel involved. One of the most significant changes over time, however, is the strategic context in which financial threats are framed and identified. ", "NSS documents under President Bill Clinton, for example, emphasized money laundering and other \"threats to the integrity and reliability of the international financial system\" as manifestations of post-Cold War, non-state transnational security problems, primarily drug trafficking, which was identified for the first time as a national security threat in 1986 (National Security Decision Directive 221) and remained a major U.S. policy concern throughout the 1990s. Other non-state transnational threats included terrorism and other international organized crimes such as arms trafficking and migrant smuggling. According to the Clinton Administration's 1999 NSS, for example, transnational threats were among the top five \"most serious threats to U.S. security.\" Key identified means to confront such threats in the Clinton Administration's NSS included standardizing laws and regulations governing financial institutions, improving international law enforcement cooperation in the financial sector, and extending the reach of financial sanctions to international terrorists support networks. ", "President George W. Bush's 2002 and 2006 NSS documents were influenced by and responded primarily to the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As a result, threats to the international financial system became largely framed, particularly in the 2002 NSS, in the context of terrorist financing. Yet, the primary mechanism through which new counter-terrorist financing programs were established centered on modifications to existing anti-money laundering programs. Goals included identifying and blocking the sources of funding for terrorism, freezing the assets of terrorists and those who support them, denying terrorists access to the international financial system, protecting legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, and preventing the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative financial networks. By 2006, however, the Bush Administration had expanded its emphasis on terrorist financing to include other threats to the international financial system, such as proliferation finance by WMD (weapons of mass destruction)-smuggling networks, money laundering by international criminals, and the illicit appropriation of government assets by corrupt political leaders. Unlike the Clinton Administration's NSS, discussion of threats to the international financial system were not limited to non-state actors, particularly with the additional emphasis in the 2006 NSS of illicit financial activity by corrupt foreign politicians and foreign countries seeking nuclear technologies through illicit smuggling networks. ", "President Barack Obama's 2010 NSS not only builds upon prior NSS documents to identify combating threats to the international financial system as a national security priority, but also includes other U.S. government strategy documents that seek to target and block illicit international financial activity, several of which were issued during the Bush Administration. In reverse chronological order, these include the 2010 National Drug Control Strategy, the 2008 U.S. Law Enforcement Strategy to Combat International Organized Crime, the 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy, the 2006 U.S. Strategy to Internationalize Efforts Against Kleptocracy, and the 2006 National Strategy to Combat Terrorism. ", "Common policy threads across the Clinton, Bush, and Obama Administrations center around three key goals: (1) applying financial measures to freeze and block assets of specially designated criminal entities and their associates; (2) expanding financial regulatory and enforcement tools to monitor and combat money laundering, both domestically and through multilateral venues; and (3) encouraging international financial intelligence and law enforcement information sharing. Notable developments in U.S. policy to combat international financial crimes have included the: ", "Enhanced financial regulatory authorities. For example, section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which amended the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, allows the Treasury Department to apply enhanced banking regulatory requirements, called \"special measures,\" against designated jurisdictions, financial institutions, and international transactions that are found to be involved in criminal or terrorist financing activities. Development of further financial regulatory standards internationally. This has included enhanced emphasis on developing international regulatory standards and procedures for mutual evaluation of financial regulatory practices through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and FATF-style regional bodies; Expansion of international law enforcement cooperation. Such initiatives have included: 1. creation of the Egmont Group, an international consortium of national Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) through which financial intelligence data can be shared internationally through secure servers; 2. establishment of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) in several countries in Latin America to facilitate bilateral law enforcement cooperation in trade and customs irregularities that could be indicative of trade-based money laundering; 3. establishment of a foreign political corruption task force to facilitate law enforcement cooperation on kleptocracy cases and support for the World Bank's Stolen Asset Recovery (StAR) Initiative to repatriate assets stolen by corrupt political leaders, and 4. enhancement of international cooperation on combating bulk cash smuggling, such as with Mexico to combat bulk cash movements of drug proceeds from the United States to Mexico; Application of targeted financial sanctions. For example, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) has gained increased authority to freeze assets and block transactions within U.S. jurisdiction of specially designated individuals involved in drug trafficking, terrorism and terrorist financing, WMD proliferation and other illicit activities. Provision of targeted foreign assistance to combat financial crimes. For example, such assistance has included U.S. support for the institutional development of foreign countries' financial legal framework, regulatory bodies, law enforcement capacity, and intelligence functions; and Introduction of foreign-deployed threat finance cells in Iraq and Afghanistan. Such threat finance cells are intended to track and target the financial flows and transactions associated with insurgent, terrorist, and other illicit actors that are of national security priority. Reorganization of offices and missions within the Department of Treasury. This has included a heightened emphasis on countering the financing of terrorism and other financial crimes through, in 2005, the creation of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).", "With the exception of the imposition of additional economic sanctions against North Korea and Iran related to WMD proliferation concerns, most of these policy initiatives had begun before the Obama Administration. There are no apparent public indications that the current Administration plans to update the 2005 money laundering threat assessment or revise the 2007 U.S. money laundering strategy. A question for policymakers is whether the absence of more recent strategic guidance to combat financial crimes is indicative of an inherent embrace of prior Administrations' strategic direction for combating financial crime and strengthening the international financial system. Some observers might question whether the current balance of priorities\u2014among counterterrorism financing, anti-proliferation financing, and traditional anti-money laundering goals\u2014remains the same as they had been under prior Administrations. Further, policymakers may also question how existing strategic guidance for combating financial crimes can respond to emerging threats and novel alternate financing and laundering methods for which an effective government response may not exist. ", "Another question for policymakers is how to coordinate U.S. government resources, programs, and data related to combating financial crime. More than a dozen federal agencies are involved in U.S. efforts to protect the international financial system from financial crime threats, including the Departments of Treasury, Justice, State, Defense, and Homeland Security, as well as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In recent years, the U.S. Government Accountability Office has issued several reports on U.S. efforts to combat international financial crimes, variously recommending improved interagency and international coordination, as well as improved efforts to align U.S. resources with strategic mission priorities.

If elected officials rule ruthlessly, they will forfeit U.S. support, the report says. Supporting the Rights of Women and Girls .

At the same time, however, President Obama has continued many country programs, many that were conducted by previous administrations. According to the State Department's Advancing Freedom and Democracy Report , May 2010, the Obama Administration is continuing to assist with: elections; development of institutions such as courts that will support a democracy; training media on independent reporting; promoting citizen participation in, and access to, government; gender equality; and government transparency.

Obama takes a quieter, more humble stance on democracy promotion, mentioning it several times, but not highlighting it as the previous administration did in its National Security Strategy, 2002. For example, the NSS states that this Administration \"is promoting universal values abroad by living them at home and will not impose these values through force.\" Supporters believe Obama's is a more realistic approach that may be more likely to succeed than the aggressive style of the George W. Bush Administration. ", "A concern expressed by both proponents and opponents is a lack of discussion about cost. The NSS does not mention the cost of democracy promotion and human rights programs or from where the money will come. As the 112 th Congress seeks to reduce the budget deficit, foreign affairs funding is being eyed by some as a place to cut expenditures.", "Measuring democracy promotion and human rights progress can be done with specific projects that seek, for example, to create a voter data base, increase voter turnout, establish free media, or reduce political arrests. In the long-term, however, it is very difficult to measure overall progress and declare success in achieving democracy and respect for human rights because of its abstract nature and because backsliding is always a possibility.

The Obama Administration is pursuing a range of specific and targeted initiatives, such as food security and global health that the President believes are essential to security and prosperity for all people worldwide. Like the Bush Administration before it, the Obama Administration supports the elevation of development alongside defense and diplomacy (sometimes called the 3 Ds) as key to achieving U.S. national security and promoting U.S. national interests abroad. The NSS presents a whole-of-government approach for applying the three D tools. For development that requires improved coordination to implement assistance programs, pursuit of a development that reflects U.S. policies and strategies, and certainty that U.S. policy tools are aligned to support development objectives. The report also suggests that development is a way to support existing partnerships and assist other countries in becoming capable, democratic future partners. To do that, the Administration is expanding civilian development capability, engaging with international financial institutions that leverage U.S. resources and advance U.S. objectives, working toward a development budget that reflects U.S. policies and strategies, and aligning foreign policy tools that support U.S. development objectives.", "The Administration's sustainable development goals are to:", "Increase Investments in Development by providing a deliberate and focused global development agenda across U.S. government agencies, increasing foreign assistance funding, expanding investments in effective multilateral development institutions, and leveraging the engagement of other countries to share the burden.

Exercise Leadership in the Provision of Global Public Goods by shaping and leading global partners on challenges (i.e., how to control epidemic disease, how to adapt to global warming, and how to make advances in agricultural output) that stifle development progress but cannot be resolved by the individual countries alone and are not being fully addressed with bilateral efforts. The Administration supports overseas partners with increased investments and technologies to assist them with low-carbon productivity, advances in food security, and resilience against impacts of climate change.

Some say creation of the F Bureau has weakened USAID. Whether the Obama Administration will continue this office or make some other organizational change that would strengthen USAID or expand the Department of State's development assistance responsibilities is currently unclear. The Administration's Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) released on December 15, 2010 states that this Administration will be focused on sustainable development outcomes with a premium placed on broad-based economic growth, democratic governance, game-changing innovations, and sustainable systems for meeting basic human needs. It does not address the issue of continuation of the F Bureau. Clearly identifying which agency will take the lead on development assistance budgets and program implementation, as well as how the Department of Defense aid activities will be integrated, is of critical interest.

Some in Congress, however, are working to cut foreign affairs spending in the FY2011 budget, arguing in favor of domestic spending and deficit reduction. While this works against the Administration's goal to double foreign aid spending, President Obama's National Security Strategy acknowledges that \"the United States must be strong at home in order to be strong abroad.\" To ensure the best use of tax dollars spent on foreign aid, transparency, monitoring, and measuring development program results are key. The Administration's NSS, as well as legislation introduced by both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have included language in legislation to require increased transparency and monitoring of development programs.

It may take years before sustainable development programs can be identified as successes or failures. Furthermore, whether development is sustainable may be influenced by government and regional instability, resources, trade potential, corruption in the country, and activities of other donor countries. In its report on the Millennium Development Goals, the Administration stated, \"Our commitment to sustainability and innovation will be underpinned by a relentless commitment to measuring results.\" To measure results, the Administration has stated it will ", "look at MCC's rigorous impact evaluation approach; collect baseline data and improve indicators, providing technical assistance to recipient countries to develop their own monitoring capacity; strengthen USAID's capacity to monitor and evaluate with the new Office of Learning, Evaluation, and Research; and promote strong monitoring and evaluation functions in multilateral organizations that we support.", "Beyond measuring progress toward sustainable development, is whether long-term development always results in countries becoming stronger partners with the United States. With numerous other influences in the world and other donor countries competing, whether that translates to greater U.S. national security and promoting America's interests seems unlikely in every case.", "Reaction to President Obama's first NSS regarding sustainable development is mixed. Some praise its multilateral tone, compared with the unilateral tone in President Bush's first NSS of 2002. Foreign aid experts note favorably the concepts of working with former allies and new partners, strengthening international institutions, and integrating government agencies, as well as acknowledging challenges of an interconnected world. Criticism, however, includes how to lead abroad in solving trans-boundary problems such as climate change when there is no consensus at home, the lack of specifics on how to increase burden-sharing abroad during a worldwide recession, and where to find the willingness in Congress to invest in long-term development projects in these tight economic times.
