SNAP reaches a large share of low-income households. In FY2018, a monthly average of 40.3 million persons in 20.1 million households participated in SNAP.", "Federal SNAP law provides two basic pathways for financial eligibility to the program: (1) meeting program-specific federal eligibility requirements; or (2) being automatically or \"categorically\" eligible for SNAP based on being eligible for or receiving benefits from other specified low-income assistance programs. Categorical eligibility eliminated the requirement that households who already met financial eligibility rules in one specified low-income program go through another financial eligibility determination in SNAP.", "In its traditional form, categorical eligibility conveys SNAP eligibility based on household receipt of cash assistance from Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, or state-run General Assistance (GA) programs. However, since the 1996 welfare reform law, states have been able to expand categorical eligibility beyond its traditional bounds. That law created TANF to replace the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, which was a traditional cash assistance program. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant that finances a wide range of social and human services. TANF gives states flexibility in meeting its goals, resulting in a wide variation of benefits and services offered among the states. SNAP allows states to convey categorical eligibility based on receipt of a TANF \"benefit,\" not just TANF cash welfare. This provides states with the ability to convey categorical eligibility based on a wide range of benefits and services. TANF benefits other than cash assistance typically are available to a broader range of households and at higher levels of income than are TANF cash assistance benefits.", "As of October 2018, 43 jurisdictions have implemented what the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has called \"broad-based\" categorical eligibility. These jurisdictions generally make all households with incomes below a state-determined income threshold eligible for SNAP. States do this by providing households with a low-cost TANF-funded benefit or service such as a brochure or referral to a telephone hotline. There are varying income eligibility thresholds within states that convey \"broad-based\" categorical eligibility, though no state has a gross income limit above 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. In all but six of these jurisdictions, there is no asset test required for SNAP eligibility. Categorically eligible families bypass the regular SNAP asset limits. However, their net incomes (income after deductions for expenses) must still be low enough to qualify for a SNAP benefit. That is, it is possible to be categorically eligible for SNAP but have net income too high to actually receive a benefit. The exception to this is one- or two-person households that would still receive the minimum benefit.", "Neither the Agriculture Act of 2014 (\"2014 Farm Bill,\" P.L. 113-79) nor the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (\"2018 Farm Bill,\" P.L. 115-334) made changes to SNAP categorical eligibility rules.

It also provides recent information on current state practices with regard to categorical eligibility. Under current law and regulation, it is a state option to implement broad-based categorical eligibility for SNAP.

These rules were eliminated in the rewrite of food stamp law enacted in 1977, but they were reinstated in phases during the early 1980s through 1990. Categorical eligibility was seen as advancing the goals of simplifying administration, easing entry to the program for eligible households, emphasizing coordination among low-income assistance programs, and reducing the potential for errors in establishing eligibility for benefits. The Food Security Act of 1985 conveyed categorical eligibility to all households receiving cash aid from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), SSI, or state-run GA programs.

Within some federal rules, states set AFDC eligibility and benefit amounts, but federal law established it as a cash welfare program. AFDC eligibility rules were generally more restrictive than those for food stamps, and most AFDC families also received a substantial food stamp benefit.", "TANF, on the other hand, is a broad-purpose block grant that gives states broad flexibility to expend funds.

These activities include the traditional cash assistance programs\u2014which convey traditional categorical eligibility. However, in FY2016 traditional cash welfare accounted for only 24% of all expenditures from the TANF block grant and MOE funds.

TANF benefits and services to achieve the first two goals of TANF (provide assistance, end dependence of needy parents on government benefits) must be for needy families with children. These benefits or services are need-tested, though states determine their own income thresholds. These benefits are often available to families at higher levels of income than is cash assistance, often a multiple of the federal poverty threshold, and without an asset test.

These states convey categorical eligibility through receipt of cash and certain TANF noncash benefits, such as child care and counseling. \"Broad-based\" categorical eligibility . These states have expanded categorical eligibility in ways that make most, if not all, households with low incomes in a state categorically eligible for SNAP. States could make all low-income households in a state\u2014including those without children\u2014eligible for a TANF-funded service directed at either the reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies or promoting two-parent families goals of TANF. If a state opted to do so, any low-income household (under 200% of poverty, per regulation) could either receive, or be authorized to receive, such a TANF-funded service.
