The proposed National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (NDAA FY2010) and the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (IIA FY2010) both contain provisions that would affect programs and funding for current and future cybersecurity-related programs. In May 2009, the Obama Administration issued its 60-day review of cybersecurity policy, declaring that U.S. information networks would be treated as a strategic national asset.", "There is no single congressional committee or executive agency with primary responsibility over all aspects of cybersecurity; each entity involved pursues cybersecurity from a limited vantage point dictated by committee jurisdiction. Many different initiatives exist, but because of fragmentation of missions and responsibilities, \"stove-piping,\" and a lack of mutual awareness between stakeholders, it is difficult to ascertain where there may be programmatic overlap or gaps in cybersecurity policy.", "Drawing from common themes found in the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI), a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Commission for the 44th Presidency, and the proposed near-term action plan from the President's recent Cyberspace Policy Review, this report identifies cybersecurity policy issues that have been proposed for priority consideration. The report lists and synopsizes current legislation at the time of this writing that has been developed to address various aspects of the cybersecurity problem.

A persistent set of issues has stymied significant progress in detecting and deterring existing threats and implementing effective safeguard measures. Issues that appear to continually challenge U.S. cybersecurity efforts include", "uncertainty of the geographic location of the perpetrators of cyber attacks; the evolving integration of mobile technology devices into critical information infrastructure; the introduction of new vulnerabilities to the nation's infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated threats; a poorly coordinated federal-private sector approach to addressing emerging risks; and legal ambiguities with respect to U.S. response and offensive actions. ", "While the ever-changing nature of modern technological devices is often noted as a complicating factor in securing the nation's telecommunications and cyber infrastructure, many security observers suggest that an equally daunting group of strategy and policy challenges must be addressed if the United States is to continue to rely on technology as a major component of societal activities. Since 2008, a number of strategy and policy proposals have been offered that may assist in addressing the appropriate balance of relying on emerging technology and network-centric governance while safeguarding critical infrastructure and control systems, as well as privacy and civil liberty considerations.", "Recent events such as the April 2007 cyber attacks on Estonia and cyber attacks during the 2008 Georgian incursion have served to increase awareness that cybersecurity is not just about protecting computers, but also has implications for U.S. national security and economic well-being. The Obama Administration declared that U.S. critical information infrastructures are a strategic national asset in a May 29, 2009, speech by the President. Recognizing the importance of cyberspace over the past few years, both the legislative and executive branches of government have developed cybersecurity legislation and related initiatives, respectively. However, just as there is no single congressional committee that can claim primary jurisdiction over cyberspace, neither is there a single executive agency or department with sole cybersecurity responsibility or commensurate authorities. As the President stated, \"No single official oversees cybersecurity policy across the federal government, and no single agency has the responsibility or authority to match the scope and scale of the challenge. Indeed, when it comes to cybersecurity, federal agencies have overlapping missions and don't coordinate and communicate nearly as well as they should\u2014with each other or with the private sector.\" \u00a0", "Cybersecurity is a cross-cutting field that affects many government and non-governmental stakeholders. As such, one of the most basic concerns, but most difficult to address, is that the term itself can carry different connotations for the various entities. For example, the U.S. military views cyberspace as a warfighting domain as well as a force enabler, enhancing troops' ability to operate in real-time and with improved situational awareness. For the Department of Defense, cybersecurity takes on an offensive or defensive national security role. For other government stakeholders, cybersecurity means information security, or securing the information that resides on cyber infrastructure such as telecommunications networks, or the processes these networks enable. And for some, cybersecurity means protecting the information infrastructure from a physical or electronic attack.

This report does not discuss reorganizing the executive branch to better address cybersecurity-related issues, nor does it discuss the military's role in securing federal cyber networks.

These issues are compared to the current statutory framework, new legislative efforts in the 111 th Congress, and executive branch initiatives to identify commonalities and possible gaps.

For the Department of Defense, cybersecurity is both the protection of its own networks, processes and content\u2014sometimes referred to as \"information assurance\"\u2014as well as enabling the freedom of movement to fight and win battles in cyberspace. This approach differs from that of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which is tasked to coordinate cybersecurity between the rest of the federal government and the private sector. DHS's task is complicated, as cyberspace technology and processes are largely owned and operated by the private sector, and as the authority of the federal government to exert control over cybersecurity activities may be limited. Some point to the 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace as a framework for organizing and prioritizing federal cybersecurity efforts, including the private sector. However, others note that this document fails to take into account the rapid rate of change in technologies or fails to offer a comprehensive strategy for combating current threats and anticipating future threats.", "At the operational level, some security observers are concerned about the federal government's present ability to first detect and then respond in a coordinated way to a cyber incident of major significance. Agencies may have their own response plans, procedures, and responsible entities that vastly differ from those of other cooperating agencies. The Cyber Incident Annex to the National Response Plan of December 2004 describes many different authorities and policy documents to guide a response, as well as many different organizations that must communicate effectively in the event of a crisis. Multiple federal information systems enterprise networks make a concerted strategic approach to network security even more difficult, in that each has its own authentication procedures and security standards.", "Another cybersecurity difficulty for the government is balancing the protection of civil liberties and individual privacy protections with the desire for comprehensive security of networks and information. It is difficult to secure information infrastructures and their content without tradeoffs between security and the freedoms associated with the Internet. Many concerned about civil liberties fear that the executive branch will use its national security powers and national defense mandate as justification for encroaching on privacy without adequate oversight. Others regard security measures, such as network traffic monitoring, as a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that \"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence.\" Complicating the issue is a lack of consensus on the definition of \"privacy\" in the context of the Internet, and a lack of consensus on what sort of government resolution may be necessary as a network security measure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recent Initiatives Addressing U.S. Cybersecurity Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, numerous executive branch, legislative, and think tank recommendations and proposals have been offered to address various aspects of ongoing and emerging cybersecurity issues.

The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 and National Security Presidential Directive 54 establishing the CNCI are classified, although some details of the initiative have been made public through departmental press releases, speeches by executive branch leaders, and analysis offered by individuals who follow cybersecurity- and terrorism-related issues. ", "Reportedly, the CNCI \"establishes the policy, strategy, and guidelines to secure federal systems.\" The CNCI also delineates \"an approach that anticipates future cyber threats and technologies, and requires the federal government to integrate many of its technical and organizational capabilities to better address sophisticated threats and vulnerabilities.\" Rather than serving as an overarching national strategy document with specific instructions for federal agency implementation activities, the CNCI is seen as a plan of action for programs and initiatives to be addressed at the operational and tactical level. Given the classified nature of the presidential directives and the secrecy accompanying department and agency activities related to this issues, few details are known about CNCI-related federal government implementation efforts. According to one media account, Steven Chabinsky, Deputy Director of the Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, stated at an information technology security conference that there are 12 objectives supporting the initiative's goal of comprehensively addressing the nation's cyber security concerns. These include the following:", "1. Move toward managing a single federal enterprise network (an integrated communications system architecture for the federal government with common security standards across the network). 2. Deploy intrinsic detection systems. 3. Develop and deploy intrusion prevention tools. 4. Review and potentially redirect research and funding. 5. Connect current government cyber operations centers. 6. Develop a government-wide cyber intelligence plan. 7. Increase the security of classified networks. 8. Expand cyber education. 9. Define enduring leap-ahead technologies (investing in high-risk, high-reward research and development to ensure transformational change). 10. Define enduring deterrent technologies and programs. 11.

This new \"Cyber Coordinator,\" sometimes referred to as a \"Cyber Czar,\" would report to the National Security Advisor and the Director of the National Economic Council. On December 22, 2009, the White House announced that the President's new Cybersecurity Coordinator would be Howard Schmidt, an information security expert with many years of experience in government, law enforcement, and industry. According to an e-mail announcement sent to the White House e-mail list by John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, the new coordinator will have \"regular access to the president\" and will be considered a key member of the national security staff, while working closely with the economic team. Although the position's exact mandate and scope of responsibilities is unclear, some duties will include improving federal agencies' computer security and coordinating national cybersecurity awareness campaigns. While the creation of this position and subsequent naming of a senior official to coordinate cyber related activities is seen by many as a positive step, some security observers are concerned that the lack of apparent authority of the coordinator will reduce his ability to comprehensively address changes enumerated in the 60-day review.", "Programs in several departments address various aspects of cybersecurity within their respective areas of responsibility. While every department and agency has an individual and collective role in securing federal cyber enterprises, some organizations have appeared to have greater authority and capability than others. A few of the departments and their accompanying responsibilities are noted below. ", "The Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has primary responsibility for reducing cyber vulnerabilities in the electrical grid. In the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-139 ), Congress directed NIST to lead the Department of Energy and other agencies in ensuring an interoperable, secure, and open energy infrastructure that will enable all electric resources to contribute to an efficient and reliable electricity network. Specifically, EISA gave NIST \"primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of smart grid devices and systems.\" Cybersecurity and associated standards are being addressed as part of this Smart Grid Interoperability Framework that is under development. NIST is also tasked to promote the development of key security standards and guidelines to support the implementation of and compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA; P.L. 107-347 ).", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has recently adopted new interoperability standards for health care information technology. HHS is responsible for implementing privacy and security standards for electronic personal health information.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) leads the cybersecurity coordination for non-military departments and agencies in the federal government. The National Cyber Security Directorate works with private industry on a voluntary basis to promote safe cybersecurity practices. DHS is also home to the National Cyber Security Center, a clearinghouse whose mission is to coordinate information from all agencies to help secure cyber networks and systems, foster collaboration, and improve situational awareness. ", "The Department of Defense (DOD) has a number of programs designed to address vulnerabilities and threats to its own networks. Secretary Gates recently announced the creation of a new sub-unified command under the U.S. Strategic Command, to be called U.S. Cyber Command (CYBERCOM). This new command is to coordinate a unified approach to defending and securing military cyber networks. The December 2006 National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations (NMS-CO) guides computer network attack and defense principles. The Defense Industrial Base (DIB) initiative provides a vehicle through which DOD and industry partners can better share information on cyber threats and defense practices. DOD also has established a Cybercrime Center (DC3) that assists in criminal, counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and fraud investigations by the Defense Criminal Investigative Organizations (DCIOs) and DOD counterintelligence activities. In addition to setting forensics standards, it provides training and testing laboratories for protection of defense information systems.", "Common themes often noted by many cybersecurity experts underscore a lack of transparency and dearth of defined departmental roles and responsibilities in addressing cyber-related issues from a comprehensive national approach. Such concerns often assert that a continuation of addressing cyber incidents as a myopic individual agency responsibility will eventually lead to increased systemic national vulnerabilities and put the nation at greater risk. It is argued by some that a more strategic approach to detecting, identifying, mitigating, and responding to future cyber incidences may strengthen both the individual agency and the whole-of-government approach to securing the technologies that underpin every aspect of modern society.

The most recent strategy, the 2003 National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace, outlined a unified, whole-of-government approach to dealing with cybersecurity. Some say that the 2003 policy has not kept pace with the rapidly evolving technologies and threats in cyberspace, and have called upon the Administration to craft a new national cybersecurity strategy with the assistance of Congress. Others say it is not a comprehensive strategy but is instead a set of recommendations, much like the CSIS Commission report. The Administration's 60-day review's near-term action plan calls for preparing and updating a new national strategy for securing communications and information infrastructure. ", "From the table, the legislative branch appears to share this concern; legislation proposed in S. 733 calls upon the President to present a national strategy within one year of the bill's enactment. This bill would also create a national advisory panel to oversee implementation of the strategic plan and to periodically advise the president on the need for revising the strategy. Some have criticized the provision, which would give the President emergency control over public and private networks in the event of a crisis, and have argued that the bill is vague in addressing civil liberties protections. As this legislation is marked up, alternative proposals may be considered.", "Another area of interest is executive branch organization. As the federal government continues to organize to defend its strategic cyber assets, some Members of Congress have proposed legislation that would create new offices or positions, or give greater authority and direction to existing positions. It is unclear how proposals such as S. 778 to establish the Office of the National Cybersecurity Advisor within the Executive Office of the President fits with the administration's recently proposed Cyber Coordinator, a cabinet position that will report to both the National Security Advisor and the Director of the National Economic Council.", "Privacy and civil liberties concerns are not highlighted in recent congressional proposals. However, there are Internet privacy and non-disclosure policies written into statutory frameworks that may not specifically address cybersecurity, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; P.L. 104-191 ) and personal health care information safeguards, or the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 ) and financial information for corporations or individuals. Civil liberties is an area of concern for both Congress and privacy advocates, but does not appear to be an immediate priority reflected in legislative action to date. This may suggest to some that existing programs have emphasized securing networks before tackling the attendant issues such as freedom of speech, privacy, and civil liberty protections as they pertain to the Internet. ", "Upon review of the legislation contained in Table 1 , another common area of focus appears to be addressing issues related to workforce development, outreach, and collaboration-based initiatives. The proposed S. 733 in its initial version contained provisions for presidential cybersecurity authorities. Rewrites of this legislation reportedly may revise this provision.
