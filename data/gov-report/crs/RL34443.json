The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) provides a comprehensive federal scheme for the regulation of employee pension and welfare benefit plans offered by private-sector employers. ERISA contains various provisions intended to protect the rights of plan participants and beneficiaries in employee benefit plans. These protections include requirements relating to reporting and disclosure, participation, vesting, and benefit accrual, as well as plan funding. ERISA also regulates the responsibilities of plan fiduciaries and other issues regarding plan administration. ERISA contains various standards that a plan must meet in order to receive favorable tax treatment, and also governs plan termination. This report provides background on the pension laws prior to ERISA, discusses various types of employee benefit plans governed by ERISA, provides an overview of ERISA's requirements, and includes a glossary of commonly used terms."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) protects the interests of participants and beneficiaries in private-sector employee benefit plans. Governmental plans and church plans generally are not subject to the law. ERISA supersedes state laws relating to employee benefit plans except for certain matters such as state insurance, banking and securities laws, and divorce property settlement orders by state courts. An employee benefit plan may be either a pension plan (which provides retirement benefits) or a welfare benefit plan (which provides other kinds of employee benefits such as health and disability benefits). Most ERISA provisions deal with pension plans. ERISA does not require employers to provide pensions or welfare benefit plans, but those that do must comply with its requirements. ERISA sets standards that pension plans must meet in regard to:", "who must be covered (participation), how long a person has to work to be entitled to a pension (vesting), and how much must be set aside each year to pay future pensions (funding).", "ERISA sets fiduciary standards that require employee benefit plan funds be handled prudently and in the best interests of the participants. It requires plans to inform participants of their rights under the plan and of the plan's financial status, and it gives plan participants the right to sue in federal court to recover benefits that they have earned under the plan. ERISA also established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to insure that plan participants receive promised benefits, up to a statutory limit, should a plan terminate with a lack of sufficient assets to pay promised benefits. In order to encourage employers to establish pension plans, Congress has granted certain tax deductions and deferrals to qualified plans. To be qualified for tax preferences under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), plans must meet requirements with respect to pension plan contributions, benefits, and distributions, and there are special rules for plans that primarily benefit highly compensated employees or business owners.", "Responsibility for enforcing ERISA is shared by the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). In the Department of the Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service oversees standards for plan participation, vesting, and funding. The Department of Labor regulates fiduciary standards and requirements for reporting and disclosure of financial information. The PBGC\u2014a government-owned corporation\u2014administers the pension benefit insurance program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Historical Development of Pension Plans in the United States", "paragraphs": ["The first employer-sponsored pension plans in the United States were established in the late 19 th century in the railroad industry. At that time, pensions were regarded as gifts in recognition of long service rather than as a form of compensation protected by law. Pension benefits often were paid from employers' annual revenues and sometimes were reduced or terminated if the company paying the pension became unprofitable or went out of business.", "Congress first gave pensions and profit-sharing plans preferential income tax treatment in the 1920s. At that time, few households paid income taxes, so these tax benefits did not immediately spur the growth of the private pension system. The Revenue Acts of 1938 and 1942 outlined more specific requirements for \"tax-qualified\" pension plans, including the requirement that benefits and contributions not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Tax qualification means that the employer can deduct the amounts contributed to the plan, the earnings on the pension trust fund are exempt from taxes until distributed, and covered employees do not have to pay income tax on the employer's contributions to the plan. Employers also are allowed to \"integrate\" their pension benefit formulas with Social Security benefits to partly offset the relatively more generous income replacement rates that Social Security pays to low-wage workers.", "During the Second World War (1941-1945), pensions and other deferred compensation arrangements were exempt from wartime wage controls. Employers who were unable to pay higher wages due to these controls could increase workers' total compensation by offering new or increased pension benefits. Also in 1940s, the federal courts declared that pensions were subject to collective bargaining, and that employers had to include pensions among the benefits for which unions could negotiate. In addition, the expansion of the income tax to include more households and the introduction of higher marginal income tax rates made the tax advantages of pensions considerably more valuable to workers. Both of these developments led to more widespread adoption of employer-sponsored pensions during the 1950s and 1960s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Origins of ERISA", "paragraphs": ["As the number and size of private pension plans grew in the 1950s and 1960s, so did the number of instances in which employers or unions attempted to use the assets of these plans for purposes other than paying benefits to retired workers and their surviving dependents. In 1958, Congress passed The Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act, which required public disclosure of pension plan finances. Advocates of the legislation expected that greater transparency of pension funding would ensure that the funds held in trust for workers' pensions would not be misused by plan sponsors. After the Studebaker automobile company terminated its underfunded pension plan in 1963, leaving several thousand workers and retirees without the pensions that they had been promised, Congress began considering legislation to ensure the security of pension benefits in the private sector.", "During the early 1970s, both the House and Senate labor committees drafted bills to regulate the private pension system. The Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee reported a pension bill in 1972. Up to that point, the legislation had been handled exclusively as a labor issue, but since most private pension plans benefitted from the favorable tax treatment accorded them under the Internal Revenue Code, the Senate Finance Committee also asserted its jurisdiction. As passed by Congress in 1974, ERISA included elements produced by the House and Senate labor committees, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee. Title I of the law, which sets standards for pension plans of employers engaged in interstate commerce, is under the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Education and Labor and the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Title II, which makes conforming amendments to the Internal Revenue Code for tax-qualified plans, is under the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The labor and tax committees share jurisdiction over the PBGC.", "ERISA was signed into law by President Gerald Ford on Labor Day, September 2, 1974. Congress has amended ERISA over the years to provide greater protection to survivors and spouses of pension plan participants, improve pension funding practices, strengthen the finances of the PBGC, alter the limits on tax-deductible pension plan contributions, and to ensure that tax-favored plans are broadly based and do not unduly favor a firm's owners and other highly compensated employees.", "Before ERISA was enacted, an employer could terminate an unfunded pension plan without being liable for any additional pension contributions. If there were insufficient assets in the pension plan to pay all claims, participants had no legal recourse to demand that employers use company assets to continue funding the plan. ERISA protects the benefits of participants in most private-sector pension plans by requiring companies with defined benefit pension plans to fully fund the benefits that participants have earned. The law prohibits companies from using pension funds for purposes other than paying pensions and retiree health benefits. It also limits the age and length-of-service requirements that firms can require participants to meet to receive a pension. ERISA also requires all private-sector sponsors of defined benefit pension plans to purchase insurance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Types of Qualified Retirement Plans", "paragraphs": ["ERISA and the IRC classify employer-sponsored retirement plans as either defined benefit (DB) plans or defined contribution (DC) plans. A defined benefit plan specifies either the benefit that will be paid to a plan participant or the method of determining the benefit. The plan sponsor's contributions to the plan vary from year to year, depending on the plan's funding requirements. Benefits often are based on average pay and years of service. For example, the benefit might be defined as 1.5% of the average of the employee's highest five years of pay multiplied by his or her number of years of service. This would result in a benefit equal to 45% of a participant's \"high-five\" average pay after 30 years of service. Some DB plans, particularly plans covering workers who belong to unions, pay a flat benefit per year of service. For example, if the benefit is defined as $30 per month for each year of service, the monthly pension benefit after 30 years of service would be $900.", "ERISA requires DB plans to be fully funded. The assets held in the pension trust must be sufficient to pay the benefits that the plan's participants have earned. The employer bears the investment risk for the assets held by the plan. If the assets decrease in value, or if the plan's liabilities increase, the plan sponsor must make additional contributions to the pension trust fund. The assets of qualified DB plans are exempt from creditors' claims if the sponsor is in bankruptcy, and DB plan benefits are insured up to certain limits by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.", "A defined contribution plan is one in which the contributions are specified, but not the benefits. A defined contribution plan (also called \"an individual account\" plan) is one that provides an individual account for each participant that accrues benefits based solely on the amount contributed to the account and any income, expenses, and investment gains or losses to the account. The employee bears the investment risk in a DC plan, and DC plans are not insured by the PBGC.", "When ERISA was enacted in 1974, most employer-sponsored retirement plans were defined benefit plans. The number of defined benefit plans continued to grow until the mid-1980s. The number of DB plans then began to fall while the number of DC plans increased. Analysts have suggested several possible reasons for these trends, including rising global competition that put greater pressure on companies to reduce costs, a more mobile workforce that preferred the portability of benefits earned in DC plans, the higher costs of maintaining DB plans after stronger funding requirements were put into place by ERISA, and the greater attractiveness of DC plans after Section 401(k) of the tax code was added by the Revenue Act of 1978. Although the standards established under ERISA have made workers' pensions more secure, some employers\u2014especially small employers\u2014apparently decided that the plan funding requirements of ERISA made DB plans too expensive to maintain. The decline in the number of DB plans since the 1980s has been the result mainly of terminations of small plans. By the late 1990s, defined contribution plans had overtaken defined benefit plans in number of plans, number of participants, and total assets. ( Table 1 .)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hybrid Plans", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, many employers have converted their traditional DB plans to \"hybrid\" plans that have characteristics of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The most common of these hybrids is the cash balance plan . A cash balance plan looks like a defined contribution plan in that the accrued benefit is defined in terms of an account balance. The employer contributes an amount equal to a fixed percentage of pay to the plan and pays interest on the accumulated balance. However, a cash balance plan is not an individual account owned by the participant. Assets are held in a common trust, and each participant's \"account balance\" is merely a record of his or her accrued benefit. Because plan sponsors are obligated to provide the participants with benefits that are no less than the sum of contributions to the plan plus interest, cash balance plans are considered to be defined benefit plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Revenue Act of 1978 and 401(k) Plans", "paragraphs": ["The most common defined contribution plans are 401(k) plans, named for the section of the IRC added by the Revenue Act of 1978 under which they were authorized. In 1981, the IRS published regulations for IRC \u00a7401(k). Soon after, the first 401(k) plans were established. A 401(k) plan is an \"individual account plan.\" Its defining feature is that the employee, as well as the employer, can make pre-tax contributions to the account. Taxes on these contributions and on investment earnings are deferred until the money is withdrawn. Before Section 401(k) was enacted, DC plans for private-sector employees were funded by employer contributions or by after-tax employee contributions. Typically, participants in a 401(k) plan can allocate their account balances among a menu of investment options selected by the employer or by a plan administrator appointed by the employer. The participant's retirement benefit consists of the balance in the account, which is the sum of all the contributions that have been made plus interest, dividends, and capital gains (or losses) minus fees and expenses. Upon separating from the employer, the participant usually has the choice of receiving these funds through a series of withdrawals or as a lump sum. Some 401(k) plans allow participants to purchase a life annuity through an insurance company, but defined contribution plans are not required to offer annuities.", "In most 401(k) plans, the employee must elect to have contributions to the plan deducted from his or her pay, decide how much to have deducted, and direct these contributions among the plan's investment options. The employer often contributes either a fixed dollar amount or percentage of pay to the account on behalf of each participant. Employer contributions are sometimes conditioned on the employee also making contributions. In a 401(k) plan, the employer can reduce or suspend its contributions to the plan if business conditions are unfavorable for the firm, or for any other reason. Although 401(k) plans are the most numerous DC plans, they are not the only kind of DC plan.

The most significant changes to ERISA since its original passage were enacted in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA)( P.L. 109-280 ). In December of 2008, Congress passed the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008 (WRERA) ( P.L. 110-455 ), which makes several technical corrections to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-280 ) and contains provisions designed to help pension plans and plan participants weather the current economic downturn.

These sections may require disclosure of information to plan participants and beneficiaries, as well as reporting of pension and welfare plan information to governmental agencies. Some of the reporting and disclosure requirements provide that certain materials must be disseminated or made available to participants at reasonable times and places. Other requirements arise only upon the written request of a plan participant or beneficiary or upon the occurrence of a specific event. Reports and disclosures required by ERISA include summary plan descriptions, annual reports, and summaries of plan modifications.

Under the \"3% rule,\" a participant must accrue at least 3% of the participant's anticipated normal retirement benefit in each year of participation, up to a maximum of 33-1/3 years. Under the \"fractional rule,\" benefit accrual is focused on a worker's proportionate years of service under the plan. For example, if benefits can accrue for a maximum of 40 years up to the date of the plan's normal retirement age (such as 65), a worker starting under the plan at age 25 and working to age 60 would get 35/40 of the maximum credit toward a pension.", "These tests limit the amount of \"backloading,\" a practice of providing a higher benefit accrual rate for later years of service than for earlier years. \"Front loading\" benefits (providing a higher accrual rate for earlier years of service than for later years) is permitted, but decreases in the rate of benefit accrual cannot be based on the participant's age.", "In a defined contribution plan, the participant's accrued benefit is the balance in his or her account.

However, the anti-cutback rule does not prevent a plan from freezing accrued benefits, reducing the rate at which benefits will accrue in the future, or eliminating future benefit accruals altogether.", "Although an accrued benefit is generally defined in monetary terms, the Supreme Court has held that the anti-cutback rule applies not only to a particular sum of money, but to a plan amendment which hinders a participant's receipt of benefits. In Central Laborers ' Pension Fund v. Heinz , a retired plan participant's benefits were suspended by the plan following a plan amendment that prohibited participants from engaging in the type of post-retirement employment he performed. The plaintiff claimed that this suspension violated ERISA's anti-cutback rule. The plan argued, among other things, that the anti-cutback rule applies only to amendments affecting the dollar amount the plan was obligated to pay, and that a mere suspension of benefits did not eliminate or reduce an accrued benefit. The Court rejected this argument and affirmed the decision of the lower court, stating that \"as a matter of common sense, a participant's benefits cannot be understood without reference to the conditions imposed on receiving those benefits, and an amendment placing materially greater restrictions on the receipt of the benefit 'reduces' the benefit just as surely as a decrease in the size of the monthly benefit payment.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2.

Discrimination has been alleged, among other things, because of the structure of a cash balance plan, under which employees receive both pay credits and interest credits. After the employee terminates employment, pay credits will generally cease, but an employee will typically continue to earn interest credits. Because a younger employee has more time before retirement age in which to earn interest than an older employee, an accrued benefit may be greater for a younger employee.

Under the act, a plan is not considered age discriminatory if a participant's entire accrued benefit, as determined under the plan's formula, is at least equal to that of any similarly situated, younger individual. A \"similarly situated\" individual is defined as an individual who is identical to the participant in every respect, including length of service, compensation, position, and work history, except for age. The PPA provides that cash balance plans do not discriminate against older workers if, among other things, benefits are fully vested after three years of service and interest credits do not exceed a market rate of return.

In the case of a nonvested participant, years of service before any break in service must be taken into account upon re-employment. In a defined contribution plan, if a participant who is not 100% vested incurs a break in service of less than five years and subsequently returns to work, all service after returning to work must be added to the pre-break service in determining the vested portion of the pre-break benefit.

A plan must offer at least three investment options (besides employer securities) to which an individual may direct the proceeds from the divestment. Individuals must be allowed to diversify their employee contributions out of employer stock as often as other investment changes are allowed, but at least quarterly. In addition, employees who have completed three years of service must also be allowed to diversify employer matching contributions and employer nonelective contributions out of employer stock.

The Court rejected the beneficiary's claim, explaining that ERISA Section 409 did not authorize a beneficiary to bring a claim against a fiduciary for monetary damages.

In LaRue , a participant in a 401(k) plan requested that plan administrators change an investment in his individual account. The plan administrators failed to make this change, and the individual's account suffered losses of approximately $150,000. LaRue brought an action under Section 502(a)(2) alleging that the plan administrator breached his fiduciary duty by neglecting to properly follow the investment instructions.

First, the Court explained that the type of fiduciary misconduct occurring in La Rue violated \"principal statutory duties\" imposed by ERISA that \"relate to the proper plan management, administration, and investment of fund assets.\" Conversely, in Russell , the fiduciary's breach ( i.e. , a delay in processing a benefit claim) fell outside of these principal duties.", "Second, the Court found that in Russell, the emphasis placed on protecting the \"entire plan\" from fiduciary breach under Section 409 applies to defined benefit plans, which were the norm at the time of the case. However, as the Supreme Court noted in LaRue , defined contribution plans are more popular today, and the \"entire plan\" language in Russell does not apply to these plans. The Court explained that for defined benefit plans, fiduciary misconduct would not affect an individual entitlement to a benefit unless the misconduct detrimentally affected the entire plan. By contrast, \"for defined contribution plans ... fiduciary misconduct need not threaten the solvency of the entire plan to reduce benefits below the amount that participants would otherwise receive.\" The Court went on to note that \"whether a fiduciary breach diminishes plan assets payable to all participants and beneficiaries, or only to persons tied to particular individual accounts, it creates the kinds of harms that concerned the draftsmen of \u00a7409.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "4.

Hewitt Associates . In this case, plan participants brought an action under Section 502(a)(3) seeking monetary relief after the plan actuary failed to make proper actuarial assumptions in calculating plan assets. Participants claimed that this error contributed to plan underfunding, and subsequently, to the plan's defaulting on promised retirement benefits. The Court found that the monetary relief the participants sought was nothing other than compensatory damages, and held, in a 5-4 decision, that ERISA Section 502(a)(3) did not authorize suits for compensatory damages against a non-fiduciary. In explaining why these damages were not available, the Court articulated that \"equitable relief\" with respect to Section 502(a)(3) is relief that was \"typically available in equity,\" such as injunction, mandamus, or restitution. While it had been argued that the relief petitioner sought was considered equitable under the common law of trusts, the Court rejected this argument. It explained that while \"legal\" remedies may have been available to plaintiffs in a court of equity, this idea did not \"define the reach\" of Section 502(a)(3), and that what was available under Section 502(a)(3) were the more \"traditional\" forms of equitable relief.", "The Supreme Court applied the reasoning of Mertens in another decision interpreting Section 502(a)(3), Great West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson . In this case, a group health plan sought reimbursement from a plan beneficiary for amounts the plan had paid after the beneficiary was severely injured in an automobile accident. After the accident, the beneficiary brought an action against the automobile manufacturer and others, and she received a settlement. The plan claimed it was entitled to the settlement amount based on a provision in the plan requiring plan participants to reimburse the plan for any amounts the beneficiary receives from a third party.", "In another 5-4 decision, the Court found for the beneficiary, holding that Section 502(a)(3) did not authorize the reimbursement sought by the plan. The health plan claimed the relief sought was restitution, which could be characterized as equitable relief. The Court refused to accept this reasoning, explaining that while restitution could be found traditionally in courts of equity, what mattered for purposes of Section 502(a)(3) was whether the restitution sought was to restore to the plaintiff particular funds or property in the defendant's possession.

First, under Section 514(a), ERISA preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan....\" The Supreme Court has examined the scope of this provision on several occasions. In one of the first key cases to address ERISA preemption, Shaw v. Delta Airlines , the Court interpreted the term \"relate to\" as applying to any state law that \"has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\" The Court has stated that \"[u]nder this 'broad common sense meaning,' a state law may 'relate to' a benefit plan, and thereby be pre-empted, even if the law is not specifically designed to affect such plans, or the effect is only indirect.\" While the Court's early decisions ( e.g., Shaw ) suggested that the application of ERISA's explicit preemption clause was virtually limitless, its decision in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Insurance Co. signaled a change in the Court's interpretation of Section 514(a).", "In Travelers , several commercial insurers challenged a state law that required them, but not Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to pay surcharges. The commercial insurers argued that the law was preempted by ERISA because it \"relate[d] to\" employer-sponsored health insurance plans. In addressing the issue of ERISA's preemption clause, the Court first noted that there is a \"presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law.\" The Court then turned to whether Congress intended to preempt state law by looking to \"the structure and purpose of the act.\" The Court concluded that \"nothing in the language of the act or the context of its passage indicates that Congress chose to displace general health care regulation, which historically has been a matter of local concern.\" In other cases, the Court has similarly recognized the states' ability to regulate matters of health and safety, and has concluded that state laws of general applicability are not necessarily preempted by ERISA. However, despite the Traveler s case arguably narrowing the scope of Section 514(a), this section still is considered to broadly preempt state law.", "The second important part is the \"savings clause\" under ERISA Section 514(b), which provides exemptions to ERISA preemption. The savings clause allows states to enforce any \"law ... which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\" The issue of which state laws \"regulate insurance\" under Section 514(b) has received considerable attention from the Supreme Court. An important case interpreting the savings clause is Kentucky Association of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, where the Supreme Court found that Kentucky's \"any willing provider\" (AWP) laws, which prohibited insurers from discriminating against a health care provider willing to meet the insurer's criteria for participation in the health plan, was saved from ERISA preemption. In finding that the AWP laws \"regulated insurance,\" the Court departed from reasoning it had used in earlier savings clause cases, and articulated a new two-part test. Under this test, a state law falls within the ambit of the savings clause if it is \"specifically directed toward\" the insurance industry and \"substantially affects the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and insured.\"", "In evaluating whether the law was specifically directed toward the practice of insurance, the Court explained that the savings clause regulates insurance , not insurers, and that insurers may only be regulated \"with respect to their insurance practices.

The Court disagreed and pointed out that it had never held that a state law must alter or control the terms of the insurance policies in order to \"regulate insurance.\" The Court found that AWP laws affected the risk pooling arrangement because they altered the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds, and restricted insurers' ability to offer lower premiums in exchange for acceptance of a closed network of providers.", "The third important part of ERISA preemption, known as the \"deemer clause,\" generally provides that an employee benefit plan governed by ERISA shall not be \"deemed\" an insurer, bank, trust company, investment company, or a company engaged in the insurance or banking business in order to be subject to state law (and accordingly, avoid ERISA preemption). In FMC v. Holliday , the Supreme Court found that a Pennsylvania law that prevented subrogation when applied to a self-funded health plan was preempted by ERISA by virtue of the deemer clause. In its decision, the Court held that although the statute did \"relate to\" an ERISA benefit plan, the law fell within the ambit of the savings clause because the law controlled the terms of insurance contracts by invalidating any subrogation provisions that they contain.
