USDA renewable energy programs have incentivized research, development, and adoption of renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, and anaerobic digesters. However, the primary focus of USDA renewable energy programs has been to promote U.S. biofuels production and use\u2014including corn starch-based ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, and soybean-based biodiesel.", "Cornstarch-based ethanol dominates the U.S. biofuels industry. The 2008 farm bill attempted to refocus U.S. biofuels policy initiatives in favor of non-corn feedstocks, especially the development of the cellulosic biofuels industry. The most critical programs to this end are the Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels, which pays producers for production of eligible advanced biofuels; the Biorefinery Assistance Program, which assists in the development of new and emerging technologies for advanced biofuels; the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP), which assists farmers in developing nontraditional crops for use as feedstocks for the eventual production of cellulosic ethanol or other second-generation biofuels; and the Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP), which has funded a variety of biofuels-related projects including the installation of blender pumps to help circumvent the emerging blend wall that could potentially circumscribe domestic ethanol consumption near current levels of about 13 billion gallons.", "The 2008 farm bill authorized slightly over $1 billion in mandatory funding for energy programs for FY2008 through FY2012, while discretionary funding in the 2008 farm bill totaled $1.7 billion. However, actual discretionary appropriations to Title IX energy programs have been substantially below authorized levels through FY2012.", "All of the major Title IX bioenergy programs expired at the end of FY2012 and lacked baseline funding going forward. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240) extends the 2008 farm bill through FY2013. However, all major bioenergy provisions of Title IX\u2014with the exception of the Feedstock Flexibility Program for Bioenergy Producers\u2014have no new mandatory funding in FY2013 under the ATRA farm bill extension. If policymakers want to continue these programs under either the 2008 farm bill extension or in the next farm bill, they will need to pay for the program with offsets.", "In the 113th Congress, both the Senate-passed (S. 954) and House-passed (H.R. 2642) bills would extend most of the renewable energy provisions of Title IX, with the exception of the Rural Energy Self-Sufficiency Initiative, the Forest Biomass for Energy Program, the Biofuels Infrastructure Study, and the Renewable Fertilizer Study, which are either omitted or explicitly repealed by both bills. In addition, S. 954 omits the Repowering Assistance Program, while H.R. 2642 adds a new reporting requirement on energy use and efficiency at USDA facilities. Otherwise, the primary difference between the House and Senate bills is in the source of funding. Over their five-year reauthorization period (FY2014-FY2018), the Senate bill contains a total of $900 million in new mandatory funding and authorizes $1.140 billion in appropriations for the various Title IX programs. In contrast, H.R. 2642 contains no mandatory funding for Title IX programs, while authorizing $1.405 billion over the five years, subject to annual appropriations. In addition, the House bill eliminates all support for the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation (CHST) component of BCAP, severely limiting its potential effectiveness as an incentive to produce cellulosic feedstocks."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Agriculture-based renewable energy can take several forms, including biofuels such as corn-based ethanol or soy-based biodiesel, wind-driven turbines located on farmland or in rural areas, anaerobic digesters that convert animal waste into methane and electric power, or biomass harvested for burning as a processing fuel or to generate heat as part of an industrial activity. ", "Since the late 1970s, U.S. policymakers at both the federal and state levels have adopted a variety of incentives, regulations, and programs to encourage the production and use of agriculture-based renewable energy (mostly biofuels). In particular, the two most widely used biofuels\u2014ethanol produced primarily from corn starch and biodiesel produced primarily from soybean oil\u2014have received significant federal support in the form of tax incentives, loans and grants, and regulatory programs. By early 2008, just prior to the 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008; P.L. 110-246 ), total direct federal biofuels subsidies were estimated at nearly $5.5 billion per year.

As a result, many of the federal programs that support renewable energy production in general, and agriculture-based energy production in particular, are outside the purview of USDA and have origins outside of omnibus farm bill legislation. For example, the three principal federal biofuels policies of the past decade were all established outside of farm bills as follows. ", "The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates an increasing volume of biofuels use and has its origins in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-58 ). The RFS was expanded in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA; P.L. 110-140 ) and divided into four distinct, but nested categories\u2014biodiesel, cellulosic, advanced, and total\u2014each with its own mandated volume. The volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC), originally established in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-357 ), provided a tax credit that varied in value over the years, but was last at $0.45 per gallon of pure ethanol blended with gasoline when it expired on December 31, 2011. The ethanol import tariff (a most-favored-nation duty of $0.54 per gallon) was intended to offset the blending tax credit and was originally established by the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-499 ). The ethanol import tariff also expired on December 31, 2011. ", "In addition to the RFS, VEETC, and import tariff, several other tax credits that originated outside of farm bills were available for biodiesel production as well as for small producers (less than 60 million gallons per year per plant) of ethanol and biodiesel. A substantial number of federal programs also support renewable energy sources other than biofuels. In addition to federal programs, many states offer additional support to biofuels producers, blenders, and consumers. ", "An awareness of the non-USDA federal programs is important for appreciating the role envisioned for the energy title of the 2008 farm bill, which is designed to provide incentives for the research and development of new agriculture-based renewable fuels, especially second-generation biofuels (based on non-food crop biomass such as cellulose and algae), and to expand their distribution and use.

The energy title authorized grants, loans, and loan guarantees to foster research on agriculture-based renewable energy, to share development risk and to promote the adoption of renewable energy systems. Since enactment of the 2002 farm bill, interest in renewable energy has grown rapidly, due in large part to a strong rise in domestic and international petroleum prices and a dramatic acceleration in domestic biofuels production (primarily corn-based ethanol).

Similarly, corn use for ethanol has grown from a 7% share of the U.S. corn crop in 2001, to an estimated 41% share of the 2011 corn crop. In 2007 (during the 2008 farm bill debate), about 23% of the U.S. corn crop was used for ethanol and projections had ethanol's corn-use share rising rapidly, sparking concerns about unintended consequences of the policy-driven expansion of U.S. corn ethanol production. Dedicating an increasing share of the U.S. corn harvest to ethanol production evoked fears of higher prices for all grains and oilseeds that compete for the same land, higher livestock feed costs, higher food costs, and lower U.S. agricultural exports. In addition, several environmental concerns emerged regarding the expansion of corn production onto non-traditional lands, including native grass and prairie land. As a result of these concerns, policymakers sought to refocus biofuels policy initiatives in the 2008 farm bill (the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, P.L. 110-246 ) in favor of non-corn feedstock, especially cellulosic-based feedstock. ", "Renewable energy policy in the 2008 farm bill became law six months after the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ). A key component of EISA was a significant expansion of the renewable fuels standard (RFS), which mandates the increasing use of \"advanced biofuels\" (i.e., non-corn starch biofuels), whose minimum use must grow from zero in 2008 to 21 million gallons by 2022. The energy provisions of the 2008 farm bill were intended to reinforce EISA's program goals via a further refocusing of federal incentives toward non-corn sources of renewable energy.

BCAP attempted to remove some of the risk for biomass growers by supporting the production of dedicated crop and forest cellulosic feedstocks and by providing incentives for harvest and post-production storage and transport. ", "Despite support from BCAP and other federal programs, the cellulosic ethanol sector has been slow to develop. Currently, only small volumes of cellulosic ethanol are produced on a commercial scale. Only a few small refineries (mostly pilot or demonstration in scope) are engaged in limited production. Due to the slow progress in cellulosic ethanol production, EPA has been compelled to substantially reduce the cellulosic biofuel RFS mandates set by Congress for the years 2010 through 2013\u2014from 100 million gallons (mgals) in 2010 to a mandate of 6.5 mgals, from 250 mgals for 2011 to 6.6 mgals, from 500 mgals for 2012 to 10.45 mgals, and from 1 billion gallons for 2013 to a preliminary 14 million gallons. The EPA waiver of the cellulosic biofuels RFS for four consecutive years, coupled with recent limitations imposed on BCAP funding (see \" Section 9011: Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) ,\" earlier in this report) and the increasing congressional climate of budget austerity, likely increase the uncertainty associated with the future investments needed to kick start this sector."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
