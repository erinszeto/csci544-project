It also found that 43.8% of noncitizens lacked any type of health insurance, compared with 12.7% of native-born and 17.6% of naturalized populations. Similarly, noncitizens had the lowest rate of private insurance coverage (42.5%), while native-born citizens had a slightly higher rate of private health insurance than naturalized citizens (69.9% and 63.9%, respectively). The noncitizen population also had the lowest rate of Medicare coverage in 2007, which was likely due to the relatively young age of noncitizens and the decreased likelihood that they would meet the eligibility requirements for Medicare. Noncitizens were slightly less likely to have Medicaid coverage (12.3%) than native-born citizens (13.4%), while naturalized citizens were the least likely to have Medicaid coverage (10.7%). Lastly, because noncitizens, in general, must be LPRs to join the armed forces, the noncitizen population had much lower rates of military/veterans coverage (0.8%) than the naturalized (2.3%) and native-born citizen (4%) populations in 2007.

They found that most unauthorized aliens who were adults (59%) had no health insurance in 2007, more than twice the uninsured share among legal immigrants who were adults (24%) and four times the uninsured share among U.S.-born adults (14%). They estimated that the children of unauthorized aliens were less likely than their parents to lack insurance, but that their uninsured rate was higher than that of U.S.-born children.

Social Security cards issued for this purpose bear the legend \"NOT VALID FOR EMPLOYMENT.\" It is possible that some naturalized U.S. citizens have Social Security cards with the inscription \"VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION\" if they originally obtained the SSN and card before they became an LPR and subsequently a U.S. citizen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) System", "paragraphs": ["As an alternative to relying on the inspection of documents to determine immigrant eligibility for federal benefits, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system provides federal, state, and local government agencies access to data on immigration status that are necessary to determine noncitizen eligibility for public benefits. The USCIS does not determine benefit eligibility; rather, SAVE enables the specific program administrators to ensure that only those noncitizens and naturalized citizens who meet their program's eligibility rules actually receive public benefits. According to USCIS, SAVE draws on the Verification Information System (VIS) database, which is a nationally accessible database of selected immigration and naturalization status information that contains over 60 million records.", "SAVE's statutory authority dates back to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). The IRCA, as amended, mandates the following programs and agencies to participate in the verification of an applicant's immigration status: the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) Program; the Medicaid Program; Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly the Food Stamp program); the Unemployment Compensation Program; Title IV Educational Assistance Programs; and certain Housing Assistance Programs. In 1996, PRWORA required the Attorney General to establish procedures for a person seeking benefits to provide citizenship information in a fair, nondiscriminatory manner.", "According to USCIS, state and local agencies may access SAVE through several different Web-based Internet technologies or by a manual verification (by submitting a formal document verification request). SAVE charges fees to the agencies using Web-based Internet access. These agencies must have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and a purchase order with the SAVE program contractor to pay the transaction fees.", "The SAVE system does not require a SSN. The key to SAVE is the immigration document number (e.g., number from the individual's permanent resident card, employment authorization document, or I-94 document) and the person's name, date of birth, and nationality. According to officials at USCIS, accessing SAVE through Web-based Internet technologies takes about 3-5 seconds. If the initial electronic search comes up \"no match,\" the next step is an additional verification that takes 3-5 days because a DHS staffer manually does electronic searches through the various DHS databases.

For individuals who do not claim to be U.S. citizens but claim to be lawfully present in the United States, the claim will be considered substantiated if the claim of lawful presence is consistent with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data.

Will health care providers be less likely to provide medical treatment to uninsured people whom they presume are likely to be unauthorized aliens? Will citizen children in mixed-status families be negatively affected in the premium subsidy calculations if their unauthorized parent is ineligible? Should the \"five-year bar\" on federal means-tested benefits include the premium subsidies for low- and moderate-income LPRs who would be otherwise eligible during their first five years in the United States? Should U.S. residents who sponsor immigrants to the United States be required to assume some financial responsibility for the health insurance coverage of newly arriving LPRs?

Deeming and Sponsorship", "For LPRs (but not refugees and asylees), the law links the income of the person who sponsored the alien to immigrate to the United States with the immigrant's income calculations when determining eligibility for most federal benefits. The basis of this policy is that the Immigration and Nationality Act excludes immigrants who appear \"likely at any time to become a public charge.\" This exclusion is implemented by provisions on deeming sponsors' income and binding affidavits of support. Not all prospective LPRs are required to have affidavits of support to demonstrate that they will not become a public charge, and most exceptions are statutory (e.g., refugees or employment-based LPRs).", "The affidavit of support is a legally binding contract that requires the sponsor to ensure that the new immigrant will not become a public charge and to make the sponsor financially responsible for the new immigrant, as codified in \u00a7213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Sponsors must demonstrate the ability to maintain an annual income of at least 125% of the federal poverty line (100% for sponsors who are on active duty in U.S. Armed Forces), or share liability with one or more joint sponsors, each of whom must independently meet the income requirement. Current law also directed the federal government to include \"appropriate information\" regarding affidavits of support in the SAVE system. Congress has required the establishment of an automated record of the sponsors' social security numbers (SSN) in order to implement this policy.

It also does not categorically prevent a noncitizen beneficiary from sponsoring a potential LPR.

The INA requires states to seek reimbursement of the costs of federal means-tested benefits from the sponsors. The sponsor's liability ends when the sponsored alien is no longer subject to deeming, either through naturalization or meeting a work test. CHIP was enacted after the list of programs meeting the PRWORA designation of federal means-tested programs was proposed.
