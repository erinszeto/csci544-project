They recommend that implementation of their plans largely begin in FY2012, with the goal of stabilizing the debt at 60% of GDP near the end of the decade. Over the longer-term, they all provide plans to reduce this ratio further. Some of the reports focus on specific policy options that are available, while others focus on issues of accountability and transparency in the budget process. Some plans also recommend implementing additional, immediate short-term stimulus that would increase the deficit before calling for deficit reduction. In addition, other groups, including the Senate \"Gang of Six\" and a new group comprised of Members of Congress and led by Vice President Biden, are formulating additional bipartisan deficit reduction proposals.", "President Obama created a bipartisan fiscal commission tasked with putting the nation on a sustainable fiscal path. The commission had two main goals: balancing the budget excluding net interest payments by FY2015 and examining ways to achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run. The Fiscal Commission's final report contained recommendations that would 1) reduce the deficit by a combined $4 trillion by FY2020; 2) lower the budget deficit to 2.3% of GDP by FY2015; 3) reduce tax rates and tax expenditures; 4) cap revenue collection at 21% of GDP; 5) ensure the solvency of Social Security; and 6) reduce the federal debt to 60% of GDP by FY2023 and 40% by FY2035. In order to achieve these savings, the plan includes cuts to both security and non-security discretionary programs, health care cost containment, additional mandatory savings through cutting agriculture subsidies and the civil service retirement system, Social Security reforms, comprehensive tax reform, and budget process changes.", "This report discusses why the federal government's fiscal path is unsustainable and provides an overview of proposals of selected groups that have published detailed recommendations on how to return the federal budget to a sustainable course."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The federal budget is on an unsustainable path as a result of projected federal debt levels that will continue to grow relative to the size of the economy.

Under baseline assumptions, deficit levels are expected to fall towards the middle part of the decade, as the economy recovers, before rising again by the end of the decade. If these baseline assumptions are altered to more closely match actual policy, the deficit shows the same pattern with less improvement in the near term.

If the budget deficit exceeds economic growth for a sustained period, a variety of problems could result.

Moreover, budget deficits add to the level of national debt, as additional borrowing is needed to finance the gap between spending and revenues. Doing nothing to combat the country's deficit and rising debt levels can lead to more severe problems over the long term, including the potential for the United States government to default on its obligations. As the debt grows, the nation relies on the willingness of investors to buy it. If investors lose confidence in the ability of the United States to bring its fiscal house under control, at some point they would no longer be willing to continue buying debt and financing the budget deficit except at very high interest rates.

Budget deficits will generally increase the level of total federal debt. If the budget is in surplus, total federal debt will generally fall. Temporary increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio are not necessarily problematic. However, if the debt-to-GDP ratio is persistently rising, it is considered unsustainable. If GDP growth equals or exceeds the annual budget deficit as a percentage of GDP, meaning that the debt-to-GDP ratio would generally remain constant or fall, then the budget is considered sustainable. ", "The issue of fiscal sustainability has gained prominence due to the significant increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the last several years as a result of the recession and financial crisis and the projected increases over the long term. In FY2007, the debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 36.2%. At the end of FY2010, the debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 62.1%, and is projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to rise to 87.4% by FY2021, under the President's proposed budget. While there is no level of debt-to-GDP that is universally regarded as optimal, some budget reform proposals recommended maintaining the debt-to-GDP ratio at 60% or less going forward.", "Two sets of policy issues currently affecting the size of the budget deficit and the federal debt: economic recovery and related policies in the short run and imbalances in retirement and healthcare programs in the long run."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Short-Run Issues", "paragraphs": ["The economy is still recovering from the most recent recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009.

Debt held by the public rose from 36.2% of GDP at the end of FY2007 to 62.1% of GDP at the end of FY2010. The budget deficit grew primarily for two reasons: 1) government actions taken to combat the economic downturn; and 2) significantly lower revenue and higher spending levels directly attributable to the economic conditions. ", "Generally, as debt rises, the portion of the federal budget devoted to interest payments on it also rises, leaving fewer resources to finance other priorities. As federal debt continues to accumulate, interest payments are generally expected to rise especially as the economic recovery continues and interest rates increase. Even if the current level of federal debt were to remain stable, interest payments, or the cost of holding that debt, would still need to be made on the debt that has already been issued. Even at a stable level of debt, interest payments could still increase if maturing debt is refinanced at higher interest rates. ", "In the short term, continued economic recovery will lead to decreases in the budget deficit relative to its current level. Revenues will automatically increase as unemployment falls and spending will automatically decrease due to less reliance on federal programs meant to provide assistance during economic downturns.

Most budget analysts agree that federal spending on healthcare is the largest contributor to the nation's long-term fiscal challenges.

This scenario would mean that, without increasing revenues or altering spending patterns, federal outlays other than for these programs would need to be deficit financed. In other words, if policy were simply allowed to continue on its current path after the economy recovers, there could be a significant structural deficit that would be difficult to overcome without programmatic reforms.", "In the absence of changes to correct this future imbalance between spending and revenue, there would likely be negative effects on future living standards and the economy and an increased likelihood of a financial crisis. If current policy is maintained and long-run deficits remain high, interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds would likely rise substantially, both as a result of the higher risk that the Treasury might ultimately default on the debt and as a result of the government's demand for borrowed funds. If the government financed its rising budget deficit by increasing the money supply, inflation and interest rates would also increase significantly. Higher interest rates, in turn, make investment more expensive, causing economic growth to slow and ultimately leading to lower U.S. living standards.

However, because spending on many of these programs, known as mandatory or direct spending, occurs automatically without explicit congressional action, mandatory spending is harder to control on an annual basis. Mandatory spending currently comprises roughly 60% of the federal budget. Because of the nature of mandatory programs, changes in spending levels can vary significantly with the economic cycle as more people come to temporarily rely on certain benefits. Spending on these \"automatic stabilizers\" is intended to counteract economic downturns by providing benefits, such as unemployment insurance and income support programs, to a greater segment of the population. This additional spending during these periods causes deficits to increase or surpluses to shrink. However, increases in outlays as a result of economic downturns may do more to alleviate the effects of an economic downturn than other types of spending. ", "Mandatory spending is projected to increase as a share of the total budget over time, mainly due to rising healthcare costs. These programs represent one of the largest burdens to future federal spending and will likely have to be curtailed to meaningfully address these budgetary issues. Cutting these federal benefits by means of curtailing mandatory spending may also result in harm to vulnerable members of society.", "Similar to the social effects of spending programs discussed above, tax policy also plays a role in reducing income inequality and affects the deficit. The distribution of the federal tax burden is a perennial topic of concern and debate. Economic theory does not provide an answer as to how the tax burden should be distributed among people with unequal incomes. A consensus seems to have evolved that the federal tax system should be progressive, a goal that, over time, has been achieved.", "During times of economic downturn, tax revenues tend to fall. When the economy is performing well, tax collections tend to increase. Given the current concerns with the level of federal debt, evaluating changes to tax policy may be necessary. Economists evaluate the relative merits of tax policies using the concepts of economic efficiency and equity. Tax systems that maximize economic efficiency oftentimes do not have desirable distributional (equity) consequences. Generally speaking, tax revenues can be enhanced by increasing tax rates or by eliminating various exemptions, deductions, and credits available under the current tax code (i.e., broaden the tax base). While making changes to the tax code may be desired to increase revenue collection, it may increase the tax burden on individual societal groups that may be less able to afford it. Others argue that certain changes to the tax code may increase the tax burden on groups that can afford it, but are also the source of economic activity and therefore should not have to bear the burden of a tax increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Effects", "paragraphs": ["Budget policy can play a strong role in determining long-run economic circumstances for individuals and the government. Every dollar of income can be either spent or saved to be spent later. National saving is measured by private saving (the saving of individuals) plus public saving (the budget surpluses or deficits). Because a budget deficit represents negative public saving, it lowers the national saving rate. In order to sustain large budget deficits, the economy requires some combination of higher private saving, lower investment, and higher borrowing from abroad. ", "A low or negative national saving rate has economic consequences. If private saving is inadequate, the government may be required to fill the gap where an individual did not adequately save for retirement, potentially increasing budgetary imbalances. If public saving is insufficient (i.e., there is a budget deficit), the government will have to sell Treasury securities to domestic and foreign investors to fill the gap. Some economists have argued that borrowing much more from abroad is unrealistic, and the already-heavy U.S. reliance on such borrowing makes the maintenance of a large deficit even less sustainable. However, negative public saving (i.e., budget deficits) is not necessarily a problem if, for example, spending is used to finance national investments. On the other hand, running sustained periods of negative saving, whether in the private or public sector, could harm long-term growth. It is difficult to find the optimal match between saving and investment.", "Generally economic theory indicates that higher levels of government borrowing will compete with other potential uses of the same capital, including private investment. If domestic public investment crowds out domestic private investment, fewer resources would be available to grow the capacity of the private sector. Higher levels of borrowing could lead to increases in interest rates, which would increase the costs of borrowing for everyone. An increase in interest rates could reduce investment over time. Diverting productive capital from private investment would reduce total economic output in the long run. If negative government saving leads the federal government to collect more from individuals and businesses, via higher taxes as a percentage of GDP in order to finance higher debt service costs, the government would control more of the country's resources, leaving a lower proportion available to the private individuals and businesses.

Generally, economic theory indicates that the reduction of output in the future constitutes the burden of the national debt, which is borne largely by future generations.", "Other imbalances in government spending can also have effects on future generations. As the retirement of the baby boom generation begins, an increasingly larger portion of the population will be over 65. For programs like Social Security and Medicare, the amount of benefits paid to older Americans will exceed the amount of revenue collected from current workers. The assets held in these programs' trust funds, which presently contain surpluses, will be drained in order to pay benefits. In order to correct this imbalance, future benefits will have to be reduced or other sources of funding will have to be used to pay full benefits.

These tools are being used to inform the public of the magnitude of the fiscal problem that the country faces as well as the types of sacrifices that may be required to achieve fiscal stability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform", "paragraphs": ["The Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform released a comprehensive proposal to achieve fiscal sustainability in November 2010 titled Getting Back in the Black . The key component of this proposal was to improve the nation's fiscal position by stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio at 60% by FY2018, and gradually reducing the debt as a share of GDP over the long term. Policy changes would be phased in beginning in FY2012. The Peterson-Pew Commission reforms focused on changing the budget process and strengthening rules and enforcement mechanisms within Congress to ensure that the benchmarks were met.", "First, the commission called on Congress to pass a \"Sustainable Debt Act\" (SDA), which would set a medium-term debt-to-GDP target along with annual fiscal debt targets in order to facilitate the path to reaching it. The annual targets would have some flexibility to respond to economic conditions and could be waived or adjusted under certain circumstances. However, it was also assumed that if the economy was performing well, the debt would be reduced at a faster rate. Once the medium-term targets were met, the commission recommended setting a new longer-term target that would allow for the continuation of the budgetary framework with programmatic caps and triggers focused on the programs that are driving increases in the federal debt at that time. Over the long term, the commission recommended that the debt-to-GDP ratio be continuously reduced below the 60% level.", "To achieve the benchmarks set in the SDA, the commission recommended several changes to the budget process and enforcement mechanisms. In order to adhere to the medium-term target set in the SDA, both the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution would be required to contain policies to achieve the goal. Congress would adopt a multi-year budget resolution that would remain in effect unless changes were required in order to meet SDA targets. Several enforcement mechanisms would also be put in place to help ensure that an annual budget remained on track to hit the SDA debt targets. These mechanisms included an automatic \"debt\" trigger that would put the budget back on track if enacted legislation fails to meet the act's targets, a strengthened PAYGO process with fewer programmatic exemptions, and the reestablishment of budget caps to cover discretionary spending as well as tax expenditure \"spending.\" Finally, the commission recommended an end to the use of the \"emergency\" designation to bypass enforcement rules in favor of the creation of an emergency reserve, which could be drawn upon in appropriate situations.", "In order to meet goals over the medium and long term, the Peterson-Pew Commission recommended several additional changes to increase transparency and accountability in the budget process. These changes include integrating long-term data into the President's budget and congressional budget documents; imposing annual reporting requirements on progress towards achieving sustainability; incorporating the presentation of tax expenditures into the budget process; and improving budgetary accounting for various other long-term expenditures. To increase accountability, the commission recommended changes to the way that the budget baseline is used in order to more appropriately illustrate the increases in spending levels from one year to the next, and requiring an annual Presidential address to Congress on the status of meeting fiscal targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NRC/NAPA Committee on the Fiscal Future of the United States", "paragraphs": ["Choosing the Nation's Fiscal Future , issued in January 2010 by the National Research Council (NRC) and the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), details four paths that would bring the federal budget back to a sustainable path. The committee recommended that action on deficit reduction begin around FY2012. Assessing the fiscal sustainability of future federal budgets would be measured by the government's public debt as a percentage of GDP, with the goal of maintaining a 60% ratio within a decade. In order to determine whether or not a proposed budget is successful at putting the country on the path to fiscal sustainability, the committee recommended that the budget be evaluated using the following criteria: Does the budget reduce the deficit in the near future?; Does the budget reduce the federal debt to achieve a sustainable debt-to-GDP ratio?; Does the budget align spending and revenue closely over the long term? When evaluating a proposed federal budget in this context, the committee suggests it is important to also consider whether spending on entitlement programs is being restrained, if resources are being use efficiently and effectively, and if the burdens placed on state and local governments are fully assessed.", "The four paths detailed in the report were expected to put the federal budget on a sustainable course. In choosing one of the four paths, the committee acknowledges that it would be necessary to evaluate how the proposed spending and revenue levels fit into the context of what type of government would be most consistent with the values and beliefs of the country. Table 4 details these four paths to achieving the 60% ratio of debt-to-GDP over the long term, with action to be taken within the next few years to lower the current budget deficit. Achieving fiscal sustainability under any of these options would depend on what combination of changes in spending and revenue policy were chosen.", "These four scenarios achieve the same ultimate goal of long-term sustainability, though they employ different methods of reaching it. The \"Low\" scenario maintains revenues at historical levels, while restricting federal spending to be more in line with this level of revenues. The \"High\" scenario combines a substantial increase in revenues with high levels of government spending. The two \"Intermediate\" scenarios entail levels of spending and revenues fall in between the \"Low\" and \"High\" scenarios. The \"Intermediate 1\" scenario focuses on a greater level of investment spending, which would bring relatively larger benefits to future generations. The \"Intermediate 2\" scenario necessitates more spending devoted to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Under each of these scenarios, spending levels represent a major reduction in health programs relative to current policy.", "Each of these scenarios depends on lower growth rates in the three major entitlement programs. Since restoring Social Security to long-term solvency is not as large a problem relative to the health programs, options are available without a change to the nature of the program. Regarding Medicare and Medicaid, the report recommended direct spending reductions in the near-term, followed by more fundamental reform of the programs over the longer term. Proposals for reducing spending in the short term included increasing the Medicare payroll tax or Medicare beneficiary cost sharing, or cutting provider reimbursement rates or the federal cost-sharing for Medicaid. Options for altering the healthcare system in the long term, with a focus on improving care quality and health outcomes, included instituting a single-payer health insurance system; a \"robust public option\" (a government insurance company which would compel healthcare providers to work at rates dictated by the government); a \"non-robust public option\" (a government insurance company which would not have power to set rates); impose price controls; provide individuals with funds to purchase their own insurance plans; and eliminating group health insurance. ", "Outside of spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, the committee focused on several reforms that could be undertaken on the discretionary side of the budget as well as in other mandatory programs. These options included various levels of spending, from cuts of 20% to increases of 16%. Increases in spending could be achieved, while still reaching fiscal sustainability the report stated, if corresponding cuts in other areas in the budget, revenue increases, or both matched the chosen level of spending in a category.", "In addition to these policy changes, the committee also recommended changes in the budget process, which would allow for forward-looking assessments rather than the current process, which focuses heavily on the present. These changes included setting both medium- and long-term fiscal goals and instituting mechanisms that would hold both Congress and the President accountable in meeting goals. Specific reforms included further integrating long-term budget projection data into the formulation of the federal budget; including information on the net present value of future costs for specific programs in the budget; and increasing the use of accrual accounting which would record the net present value of long-term contractual commitments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Debt Reduction Task Force", "paragraphs": ["The Debt Reduction Task Force (DRTF) was created by The Bipartisan Policy Center and co-chaired by former Senator Pete Domenici and former OMB and CBO director Alice Rivlin. The report produced as a result of their efforts, titled Restoring America's Future , contained a comprehensive path to restore the economy and achieve fiscal sustainability. Recommendations included spending reductions and tax increases to achieve a debt-to-GDP ratio of less than 60% of GDP by FY2020, a balanced primary budget by FY2014, and a strengthened economy.", "These results were achieved by incorporating changes to Social Security, controlling healthcare costs, and freezing discretionary spending. Other cuts to mandatory programs were also included. On the revenue side, the plan recommended a simplification of the tax code, lower corporate and individual tax rates, and a debt reduction sales tax. Along with these recommendations, the plan included a one-year payroll tax holiday in calendar year 2011 to help boost the economy and create jobs. This provision would increase the deficit in the short term. The DRTF estimated that the tax holiday would create 2.5 to 7 million new jobs over the next two years.", " Table 5 illustrates the how the recommendations in the report achieved debt reduction goals. Roughly half of the debt reduction was achieved through spending cuts, while the other half was achieved through revenue changes.", "Along with the changes in the tax code discussed above, the report also recommended raising revenue by capping the tax exclusion of employer provided health benefits. Beginning in 2018, the cap would begin to be phased out entirely over the next 10 years. Specifically relating to Medicare, premiums would be increased gradually with a transition to a \"premium support\" program beginning in 2018. Under this new structure, the traditional Medicare program would remain in place with increases in premiums linked to increased costs above certain levels. A new program will also be established to allow beneficiaries to purchase coverage on the new health insurance exchanges. Cost-control changes to the Medicaid program would also be instituted, including changes to the federal-state cost sharing arrangement. Other healthcare cost control measures were also included.", "Social Security reforms included combining increased revenue collection with adjustments to benefits. By raising the amount of wages subject to payroll taxes and incorporating newly hired state and local workers into the program, revenues would increase, especially in the near term. On the other side, using a modified cost-of-living adjustment, slightly reducing benefits for higher income beneficiaries, and indexing the benefit formula for increases in life expectancy, overall benefit payments would decline. Minimum benefit levels would also be increased for lower income wage earners. Combined, these changes would make the program solvent for the next 75\u00a0years.", "Other spending cuts include freezing discretionary spending and, thereafter, capping growth to GDP growth rates. This freeze would be enforced by statutory spending caps and automatic cuts in all programs. Domestic discretionary spending would be subject to this freeze for four years, while defense discretionary spending would be subject to the freeze for five years. Cuts would also be made to certain farm payments and the federal civilian retirement program. Other spending reduction proposals were also included.", "Additional revenue would be raised by making various changes to the tax code, with the goals of making it easier to file taxes and removing economic and consumption distortions. Ultimately, the task force said that the changes would create a more progressive tax system. Current individual tax rates would be replaced by a two-tiered tax rate system with rates of 15% and 27%. Corporate rates would decline from 35% to 27%. Most tax expenditures would also be eliminated. Specifically, the mortgage interest and charitable contribution deductions would be replaced by a flat 15% refundable credit for anyone who qualifies and the deduction for state and local taxes would be eliminated. Finally, additional revenue would be raised through a national Debt Reduction Sales Tax (DRST), beginning at 3% in 2012 and increasing to 6.5% in 2013. Primarily for low income earners, the deductions that are eliminated and the DRST would be offset by a higher earned income and child tax credit.", "The task force also included proposals to create additional budget enforcement mechanisms and reforms. These included the imposition of statutory spending caps, as mentioned earlier, the strengthening of statutory PAYGO, conversion to biennial budgeting, and enactment of specific long-term budgets for certain programs to be monitored by a new Fiscal Accountability Commission to make sure that that the programs are staying on target."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Groups", "paragraphs": ["The proposals described above do not represent a comprehensive list of all the groups or individuals that provided recommendations to stabilize or reduce the federal debt.
