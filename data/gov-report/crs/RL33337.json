In Congress, support for aid restrictions on foreign aid to ICC member countries that have not agreed to exempt U.S. citizens from the court's jurisdiction has diminished. This policy shift has occurred largely because of increasing concerns about the negative effects that ICC-related sanctions have had on U.S. relations with Latin America, particularly in the area of security cooperation.", "In July 2002, the Rome Statute that created the ICC, the first permanent world court created to judge cases involving serious human rights abuses, entered into force. The United States is not a party to the ICC and does not recognize its jurisdiction over U.S. citizens. Since 2002, the Bush Administration has sought bilateral agreements worldwide to exempt U.S. citizens from ICC prosecution, so-called \"Article 98 agreements.\"", "There has been strong bipartisan support in Congress for legislation aimed at protecting U.S. soldiers and civilian officials from the jurisdiction of the ICC. In 2002, Congress passed the American Servicemembers' Protection Act or ASPA (P.L. 107-206, title II), which prohibits military assistance to countries that are party to the ICC and that do not have Article 98 agreements. The Nethercutt Amendment to the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 4818/P.L. 108-447) and FY2006 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (H.R. 3057/P.L. 109-102) prohibited some economic assistance to the governments of those same countries. Nethercutt aid restrictions continued in the FY2007 Continuing Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 109-289, as amended) and are likely to be included in the FY2008 Foreign Operations Appropriation bill.", "The FY2007 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 5122/P.L. 109-364), which President Bush signed into law on October 17, 2006, modifies ASPA to end the ban on International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance to affected countries. Restrictions on Foreign Military Financing (FMF) remain in place. On November 28, 2006, pursuant to section 574 of P.L. 109-102, President Bush waived Nethercutt restrictions on FY2006 Economic Support Funds (ESF) to 14 countries, including Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru.", "While some Members of Congress advocate ending all ICC-related sanctions, others believe that some aid restrictions should remain in place in order to encourage other countries to sign Article 98 agreements.

Latin America has been at the forefront of that reassessment.", "In particular, some negative consequences for U.S. relations with Latin America have occurred as a result of ICC-related sanctions. Restrictions on military training aid have resulted in a dramatic decline in the number of Latin American military personnel receiving training in the United States. Similarly, restrictions on economic aid have hindered the ability of U.S. democracy and rule of law programs to work with governments in the region, especially in the Andean countries.", "Although most Members of Congress still support efforts to shield U.S. citizens serving abroad from ICC prosecution, many are beginning to oppose the use of sanctions to attempt to persuade countries to sign bilateral immunity (so-called \"Article 98\" agreements). Some Members of Congress advocate ending all ICC-related aid restrictions, while others believe that at least some restrictions should remain in place in order to encourage other countries to sign Article 98 agreements. The issue of whether to continue these aid restrictions is likely to be considered by the 110 th Congress.", "This paper discusses the evolving policy debate in the U.S. government concerning the use of ICC-related foreign aid restrictions.

As of March 1, 2007, 104 countries have ratified the Rome Statute and are currently members of the ICC. The United States is not a party to the court and does not recognize ICC jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers or civilians serving in other countries.", "The ICC, comprised of eighteen judges and based in The Hague, may hear cases referred to it by the U.N. Security Council or by the states that are parties to the court. The ICC's lead prosecutor may also initiate investigations. Before a case may be tried, the ICC must work with national law enforcement agencies that, with support from the international community, must make arrests and send defendants to The Hague. Since its creation, the ICC has received three referrals by state parties, and the U.N. Security Council also referred the situation of allegations of atrocities being committed in Darfur, Sudan to the prosecutor. The prosecutor has opened investigations into the cases involving the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Uganda, and Darfur, Sudan. In October 2005, the ICC issued its first arrest warrants to five individuals implicated in connection to the situation in Northern Uganda.", "Some analysts have recently asserted that the Bush Administration has begun to soften its once vocal opposition to the International Criminal Court (ICC). They argue that strong opposition to the ICC within the Administration has been gradually dissipating, particularly since the U.S. government allowed the U.N. Security Council to refer the Darfur, Sudan situation to the ICC in March 2005. According to State Department spokesman Sean McCormack, \"We [the U.S. government] fully support bringing to justice those responsible for crimes and atrocities that have occurred in Darfur. We are at a point in the process where we could call upon the Sudanese government to cooperate fully with the ICC.\" Other analysts remain skeptical about whether a fundamental shift in U.S. policy towards the ICC is occurring and believe that, regardless of the court's merits, the U.S. government is going to continue to do all that it can in order to protect its military and civilians serving abroad from ICC prosecution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Policy on ICC Immunity", "paragraphs": ["Although the United States initially supported the idea of establishing an international criminal court, fundamental objections to the proposed court's jurisdiction led the United States to vote against the Rome Statute.

Accordingly, the United States has sought immunity provisions through the U.N.

Supporters of the policy say that these agreements are not unlike the status of forces agreements (SOFAs) routinely negotiated to protect U.S. soldiers serving abroad from prosecution in foreign courts and are consistent with Article 98 of the Rome Statute.

The IMET program provides training on a grant basis to students from allied and friendly nations. FMF provides grants to foreign nations to purchase U.S. defense equipment, services, and training.

In addition, the Defense Department's Quadrennial Defense Review called for a possible de-linking of military training programs from ASPA.

One analyst asserted that the loss of IMET is severing \"an important linkage between future military leaders [from the region learning about]...the U.S. model of civilian control of the military.\" Reduced opportunities in the United States, he added, may lead countries in the region to look elsewhere, including China, Russia, or Venezuela for training. Similarly, ESF restrictions may hamstring both U.S. bilateral and regional efforts to push desperately needed structural reforms, especially in the Andean countries.

He stated that \"this loss of engagement prevents the development of long-term relationships with future [Latin American] military and civilian leaders.\" Senator John McCain agreed with General Craddock's concerns about ASPA sanctions. He asserted that the United States was paying \"a very heavy price\" in countries where military aid programs have been cut. His concerns about military aid cuts were echoed by Senators John Warner, Carl Levin, Hillary Clinton, and James Inhofe.", "On June 21, 2006, Representative Dan Burton, former chair of the House International Relations Committee's subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, publicly asked the Bush Administration to changes its policy regarding ASPA sanctions, citing congressional concerns about China's expanding influence in the region.", "By the fall of 2006, the Bush Administration was ready to use waivers to waive restrictions on FY2006 IMET and ESF funds.
