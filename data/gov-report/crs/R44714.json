The November 2016 death of Cuba's Fidel Castro may lead to further consideration of these issues. \"Normal\" immigration from Cuba to the United States has not existed since the Cuban Revolution of 1959 brought Fidel Castro to power. For more than 50 years, the majority of Cubans who have entered the United States have done so through special humanitarian provisions of federal law.", "U.S. policy on Cuban migration has been shaped by a 1966 law known as the Cuban Adjustment Act, as amended, and U.S.-Cuban migration agreements signed in the mid-1990s, operating in conjunction with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Among the special immigration policies presently in place is a so-called \"wet foot/dry foot\" policy toward Cuban migrants who try to reach the U.S. shore by sea. \"Wet foot\" refers to Cubans who do not reach the United States. They are returned to Cuba unless they cite a well-founded fear of persecution, in which case, they are considered for resettlement in third countries. \"Dry foot\" is a reference to Cubans who successfully reach the U.S. shore and are generally permitted to stay in the country. After one year, these individuals can apply to become U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) under the Cuban Adjustment Act.", "In addition to entering the United States under special policies and becoming LPRs through the Cuban Adjustment Act, Cubans can gain permanent admission to the United States through certain standard immigration pathways set forth in the INA. They can be sponsored for U.S. permanent residence by eligible U.S.-based relatives who are U.S. citizens or LPRs through the U.S. family-based immigration system. They can also apply for asylum from within the United States or at a U.S. port of entry, or they can be considered for refugee status abroad. Persons granted asylum or admitted to the United States as refugees can apply for LPR status after one year.", "Special provisions of law also make Cuban migrants in the United States eligible for federal assistance. The Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 defines the term \"Cuban and Haitian entrant\" for purposes of eligibility for federal assistance. It makes these entrants eligible for the same resettlement assistance as refugees. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, as amended, makes Cuban and Haitian entrants eligible for certain federal public benefits to the same extent as refugees.", "The steps taken by the Obama Administration to normalize relations with Cuba have raised questions about the possibility of future changes to U.S. policy toward Cuban migrants through either executive or congressional action. Regarding the latter, legislation was introduced in the 114th Congress to repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act and eliminate the special treatment that Cuban entrants receive with respect to federal refugee resettlement assistance and other federal assistance. It remains to be seen whether Congress will act on any such measures.", "For an overview of current issues in U.S.-Cuban relations, see CRS Report R43926, Cuba: Issues for the 114th Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Cuban migration to the United States is a topic of long-standing congressional interest.

Efforts by the Obama Administration to normalize relations with Cuba following President Obama's December 2014 announcement of a major policy shift toward that country focused increased attention on migration issues, leading some policymakers to reexamine the policies on immigration and federal assistance that apply to Cuban migrants. The November 2016 death of Cuba's Fidel Castro may spur a broader reexamination of these policies.

The INA parole provision authorizes the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) \"to parole into the United States temporarily under such conditions as he may prescribe only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit any alien applying for admission to the United States.\" Although the Cubans who arrived in the United States after the Cuban Revolution were paroled in, they were considered to be refugees fleeing persecution. At the time, the INA did not contain the current definition of a refugee or the provisions on refugee admissions and asylum; these were added by the Refugee Act of 1980. ", "In 1980, the INA parole provision was again used when a mass migration of asylum seekers\u2014known as the Mariel Boatlift\u2014brought approximately 125,000 Cubans (and 25,000 Haitians) to South Florida over a six-month period.

Unlike most other applicants for adjustment to LPR status, Cuban nationals do not have to be sponsored by an eligible family member or employer.

Among the agreement's key elements, Cuba agreed to try to prevent unsafe departures from the island, and the United States agreed that Cuban migrants rescued at sea would not be allowed to enter the United States and instead would be taken to safe-haven camps. With respect to legal migration, the United States agreed to admit no less than 20,000 Cuban immigrants annually, excluding the immediate relatives of U.S. citizens.

As shown in Figure 1 , since FY2013 (the year before the announced shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba), there have been notable increases in U.S. Coast Guard maritime interdictions, in U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions between U.S. ports of entry, and especially in numbers of unauthorized Cubans presenting themselves at official U.S. ports of entry (see Appendix for the yearly data in Figure 1 ). The terms \"unauthorized\" and \"inadmissible\" are used here to describe these Cuban migrants because they do not meet the INA requirements for admission to the United States (although policies may permit them to enter and remain in the country).", "The U.S. Coast Guard is charged with interdicting unauthorized migrants at sea prior to landfall in the United States. As shown in Figure 1 , the annual number of maritime interdictions of Cubans has fluctuated over the years (see Figure A-1 for yearly data). The trend, however, has been consistently upward since 2010. Between FY2013 (the year before the announced shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba) and FY2016, the number of maritime interdictions increased nearly fourfold, from 1,357 in FY2013 to 5,213 in FY2016. The number of maritime interdictions in FY2016 was higher than in any other year during the FY1995-FY2016 period. ", "The annual number of Cubans apprehended by the Border Patrol between U.S. ports of entry has likewise fluctuated over the years, generally tracking the interdiction data. These apprehensions have risen consistently since FY2012 (see Figure A-2 ). Between FY2013 and FY2016, Border Patrol apprehensions of Cubans increased more than threefold, from 624 to 1,930. The FY2016 figure was the highest since FY2008. Consistent with maritime travel, the vast majority of these encounters have occurred in U.S. coastal areas.", "Far greater than the number of Coast Guard interdictions and Border Patrol apprehensions of Cubans each year combined, at least since FY2004, is the number of Cubans encountered at official U.S. ports of entry (see Figure A-3 ). These data reflect a preference on the part of Cubans to travel to the United States mainly by land. Unlike migrants of other nationalities, Cubans who are not eligible for formal admission are nevertheless generally able to enter and live in the United States in accordance with special immigration policies, as discussed. The number of inadmissible Cubans arriving at ports of entry has grown annually since FY2009. The increases since FY2014 have been marked, with total numbers more than doubling between FY2014 (24,277) and FY2016 (46,590).
