There have been frequent calls for the United States to develop similar high-speed rail services, but none have been built. The financial challenge of building high-speed rail lines, which requires many billions of dollars to be spent over a lengthy period before service opens and revenues begin to be collected, makes government financial support unavoidable. Governments in other countries have provided such support, but over many years efforts to get federal support for the construction of high-speed rail lines have, with the partial exception of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, been unsuccessful. In fact, Congress provided little funding even for expansion of non-high-speed passenger rail service. Opponents of increased funding for intercity passenger rail have contended that it was economically inefficient compared to other modes of travel.", "For a brief period in 2008-2009, it appeared that the situation had changed. The 110th Congress authorized several programs to make grants to states for intercity passenger rail development in the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 (Division B of P.L. 110-432). The following year, in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) and the FY2010 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act (Division A, Title I, P.L. 111-117), the 111th Congress appropriated $10.6 billion to develop both high-speed and conventional intercity passenger rail services. The Federal Railroad Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation used this money to award 158 grants under the new High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail (HSIPR) Grant Program. Some 80% of the funding went to a relatively small number of large-scale projects. These included multi-billion-dollar grants to California and Florida for high-speed rail lines; Florida subsequently turned down its grant.", "This dramatic change in policy ended just as suddenly, as the 112th Congress rescinded $400 million of the $10.6 billion previously appropriated and rejected the Administration's requests for additional funding. Succeeding Congresses have also not responded to requests for HSIPR funding. In addition, several states declined significant grants for improvements to their intercity passenger rail lines. That funding was reallocated to other states. All but two of the HSIPR projects are expected to be complete by 2017, but the most ambitious and expensive, the California High-Speed Rail project, will not enter service for many years.", "Congress's creation, then abandonment, of the HSIPR program illustrates the challenges of funding major construction projects that take years to complete without a stable source of financing. At the beginning, the federal and state governments lacked the expertise and program framework to implement the program. Now that the expertise and program framework have been developed, they are at risk of disappearing due to the lack of continued funding. Also, such funding spurts make long-term project planning and implementation very difficult.", "A challenge facing the future of the HSIPR program is the large amount of funding required for high-speed rail development, combined with the lack of a dedicated funding source and the funding shortages facing other federal transportation programs even with their dedicated funding sources. Another challenge is contending with arguments against intercity passenger rail. Critics assert that it requires larger per-passenger subsidies than other travel modes, that it is not well-suited to the economic geography of the United States, and that near-term technologies may provide better alternatives."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Since 1971, when it created Amtrak to operate a skeletal network of passenger trains, which were being discontinued by freight railroads, Congress has provided funding to support intercity passenger rail service.

Amtrak's Northeast Corridor\u2014between Washington, DC, and Boston, with spurs to Harrisburg, PA, and Springfield, MA\u2014offers the fastest rail service in the United States; the route, laid out over a century ago, allows trains to hit 160 miles per hour (mph) for short distances, but the fastest service between major cities averages around 80 mph. This is far slower than many high-speed rail services in other countries.", "In 2008 and 2009, Congress took a different approach, appropriating significant amounts to finance development of higher-speed intercity passenger rail services by state governments.

PRIIA, which reauthorized Amtrak, included language authorizing the first federal grants to states to develop intercity passenger rail service. Two grant programs for helping states finance rail facilities, infrastructure, and equipment were authorized at a total of $2.225 billion over five years. This legislation was passed after a number of states expressed interest in expanding intercity passenger rail operations. ", "President Barack Obama, who took office in January 2009, proposed spending on high-speed rail projects as part of a larger economic stimulus program to address a deep recession. Congress approved the passenger rail program in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ), which appropriated $8 billion for grants to states to develop high-speed and intercity passenger rail services. ", "In April 2009, two months after the passage of ARRA, the President declared that development of high-speed rail (HSR) was a priority for his Administration and said he would ask Congress to appropriate an additional $1 billion annually for that purpose. This priority was reflected in the FY2010 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act (Division A, Title I, P.L. 111-117 ), in which Congress appropriated $2.5 billion for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants to states. ", "Since that time, Congress has not appropriated further amounts for the HSIPR program, although the Administration has repeatedly requested billions of dollars in additional funding for intercity passenger rail development. Indeed, the 112 th Congress rescinded $400 million previously appropriated for this purpose.", "In December 2015 Congress reauthorized federal surface transportation programs in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act ( P.L. 114-94 ). The act authorized $2.2 billion for grants to states and rail carriers for improving intercity passenger and freight rail transportation systems, in addition to funding for Amtrak. However, this funding was authorized from the general fund, not from dedicated funds, and whether any of the funding is actually appropriated will be determined by Congress through the annual Department of Transportation (DOT) appropriations acts. For FY2016, the FAST Act authorized $200 million for such grants, but Congress did not appropriate any funding for this purpose.

However, it is not clear that the projects are in fact taking a long time, relative to surface transportation projects of similar complexity. Although some planning and environmental clearance work had been done on several of the projects prior to their receipt of HSIPR grants, the grants themselves, which constituted the majority of the funding for these projects, were not awarded until 2010. An analysis in 2001 found that the average time required to complete surface transportation projects was 13 years after the beginning of the preliminary engineering phase, with some projects\u2014typically those that encounter significant community opposition or environmental, funding, or land acquisition issues\u2014taking much longer. ", "In addition to the complexities typically faced by major surface transportation projects, the HSIPR projects have faced two challenges not faced by highway projects\u2014the need for many grantee states to create rail planning and project management agencies, and the occasional and unpredictable availability of federal funding for HSIPR projects. Many states had no rail development programs prior to 2008, and had to hire engineering professionals, planners, and managers with experience in passenger rail project implementation in the United States before projects could advance. They then had to undertake environmental reviews, design, engineering, and, in some cases, land acquisition before construction could proceed. In some cases, project completion has required additional federal assistance beyond what was provided through the HSIPR program, and that assistance was uncertain. For example, construction of a new station in Raleigh, NC, as part of the Southeast High-Speed Rail Corridor project relies on two grants from DOT's Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program. These grants were approved in 2012 and 2013, well after North Carolina received a $520 million HSIPR grant. ", "The largest and most complex of the HSIPR projects, the California High-Speed Rail Corridor, illustrates the challenges involved. The project has been in development for many years. The initial environmental impact statement was completed in 2004, but no funding was then available to advance the project. A state referendum to approve borrowing funds for the project was postponed twice before being put before voters in November 2008. The referendum was approved, and a few months later Congress authorized the HSIPR grant program in ARRA. In 2010, FRA awarded the project an HSIPR grant. ", "Subsequently, as the project has proceeded through final design and more detailed environmental clearances, it has faced lawsuits by entities wishing to alter its route or stop its construction. These lawsuits, some of which are still in process, have limited the ability of the project to draw on state funding and have delayed activities such as land acquisition. The project, which involves crossing earthquake fault zones and mountain ranges, also faces significant environmental and engineering challenges. ", "It also faces questions about further funding. As additional engineering has brought the details of the project into focus, the cost estimate has increased, and the current estimate of around $64 billion for Phase 1 (in dollars reflecting inflation during the construction period) is several times greater than the amount of funding currently identified for the project. The project's business plan calls for a significant portion of the total cost to be covered by federal funding, but there is no obvious source of additional federal funds beyond the almost $4 billion of HSIPR grants already obligated. The state of California has dedicated some receipts from auctions of state carbon dioxide emissions permits to the project, but the rate at which these funds will be received is uncertain.

For example, the mandatory environmental impact analyses for some of the HSIPR projects had already been completed prior to the availability of HSIPR funding, but the projects had not progressed.
