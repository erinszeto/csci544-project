The report begins with an overview of the Social Security program, followed by a discussion of the marital requirements regarding eligibility for Social Security spousal benefits. The report concludes by analyzing how the recent Supreme Court cases have impacted Social Security eligibility for same-sex couples."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of Social Security", "paragraphs": ["Social Security is a federally administered, work-related entitlement program authorized by Title II of the Social Security Act. The program is financed primarily by payroll taxes paid by individuals who work in Social Security-covered employment and their employers. Employees and their employers each pay 6.2% of covered earnings, up to an annual limit on taxable earnings; self-employed individuals pay 12.4% of net self-employment income, up to an annual limit on taxable earnings. The program is also credited with federal income taxes that some beneficiaries pay on a portion of their benefits; reimbursements from the general fund of the Treasury for a variety of purposes; and interest income from the Treasury on the investment of Social Security revenues in special federal government obligations. ", "The program provides monthly cash benefits to eligible retired or disabled workers and their family members, and to the family members of deceased workers. To be eligible for a retired-worker benefit, a worker needs a minimum of 10 years of covered employment, among other requirements. Fewer years of covered employment are needed to qualify for a disabled-worker benefit, depending on the age of the worker when he or she becomes disabled. As of September 2015, there were nearly 60 million Social Security beneficiaries: 43 million retired workers and their family members (72%); 11 million disabled workers and their family members (18%); and 6 million survivors of deceased workers (10%).

To be eligible for a retired-worker benefit, a worker needs a minimum of 40 earnings credits (10 years of covered employment). Fewer credits are needed to qualify for a disabled-worker benefit if the worker is under age 62. The number of credits needed varies, depending on the age of the worker when he or she becomes disabled. For example, a worker who becomes disabled before age 24 needs six credits (1\u00bd years of covered employment) in the three years before the onset of the disability. For Social Security purposes, disability is defined as the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death. Generally, the worker must be unable to do any kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy, taking into account age, education, and work experience.", "A worker is eligible to receive a retirement benefit as early as age 62. However, if a worker begins receiving a retirement benefit before the full retirement age (FRA), his or her benefit is permanently reduced to take into account early retirement and the longer period of expected benefit receipt. The FRA ranges from age 65 to age 67, depending on the worker's year of birth.

Specifically, a worker's primary insurance amount (PIA) is his or her monthly benefit payable at the FRA. The PIA is determined based on the following steps: (1) the worker's annual earnings in covered employment are indexed to historical wage growth, to bring past earnings up to near-current wage levels; (2) the highest 35 years of indexed earnings are summed to get the total earnings; (3) the total earnings are divided by 420 months (35 years x 12 months) to get the amount of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over the worker's career in covered employment; and finally, (4) a progressive benefit formula is applied to the worker's AIME (the progressive benefit formula is designed to provide a higher replacement rate for lower-wage workers compared to higher-wage workers). ", "The monthly benefit that is payable to a worker may be less than or greater than his or her PIA, depending on circumstances. For example, a worker's benefit is permanently reduced if he or she claims retirement benefits before the full retirement age, to take into account the longer period of expected benefit receipt (based on average life expectancy). Similarly, a worker's benefit is permanently increased if he or she claims retirement benefits after the full retirement age (up to age 70), to take into account the shorter period of expected benefit receipt. In addition to benefit adjustments based on a worker's age at the time of entitlement, benefits may be adjusted for other reasons. For example, under the r etirement e arnings t est , benefits are temporarily reduced if a beneficiary is below the FRA and has earnings above specified thresholds.

Rather, under the dual entitlement rule , the person receives (1) his or her own benefit, plus (2) the benefit based on another person's work record (the auxiliary benefit) after it has been reduced by the amount of the person's own benefit (in some cases, the auxiliary benefit may be reduced to zero). In effect, the person receives the higher of the two benefit amounts. Other adjustments to auxiliary benefits may apply.

(As noted previously, the Number Holder is the worker on whose record benefits are claimed.) Section 216(h) of the Social Security Act ( Determination of Family Status ) references the use of state law in the determination of entitlement to Social Security benefits as a spouse, surviving spouse, child, or parent of the worker.

SSA has interpreted \"domiciled\" in this context to mean the \"true and fixed home (legal domicile) of a person ... to which a person intends to return whenever he or she is absent.\" The relationship requirement is met if the applicant and the Number Holder were validly married under state law as interpreted by the courts of that state at the time of application for spousal benefits, or at the time of the Number Holder's death in the case of an application for surviving spouse benefits.

Under the Social Security Act as discussed above, SSA looks to the laws of the state in which the Number Holder is domiciled to determine whether the applicant and Number Holder are married for the purposes of spousal benefit eligibility. Changes in the state laws and the Supreme Court decisions in U.S. v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges have impacted SSA's processing of spousal benefit claims for applicants in a same-sex relationship. The following sections analyze the changes in Social Security eligibility for individuals in same-sex marriages by tracking the recent Supreme Court cases and their impact on state marital laws.

Windsor , the Supreme Court held that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is unconstitutional, finding, in part, that it violated the Constitution's equal protection and substantive due process guarantees. Section 3 had required that marriage be defined as the union of one man and one woman for the purpose of federal enactments. According to the Court, federal statutes that refer to a marriage for federal purposes should be interpreted as applying equally to legally married same-sex couples. The Court did not address Section 2 of DOMA, which allows individual states to refuse recognition of same-sex marriages. ", "In response to the Windsor decision, SSA started processing Social Security (OASDI) applications for some claimants in same-sex marriages. Because eligibility for spousal Social Security benefits depends on the applicant meeting the relationship requirement to the Number Holder, as outlined in 216(h), some but not all applicants in a same-sex marriage were eligible for these benefits during the period between the Windsor and Obergefell decisions. As discussed in the previous section, the Social Security Act's Section 216(h) states that when determining family relationship for purposes of a person's application for benefits as a spouse or surviving spouse , SSA looks to the laws of the state\u2014as interpreted by the courts of that state\u2014where the Number Holder is domiciled at the time of the application, or at the time of the Number Holder's death. Thus, in order for SSA to have recognized a same-sex couple as married during this period of time, the couple must have had a valid marriage and the Number Holder must have been domiciled in a state that recognized such marriage at the time of the application. For example, an applicant in a same-sex marriage was eligible for spousal benefits if the couple married and lived in a state that recognized same-sex marriage. However, an applicant in a same-sex marriage was not eligible for spousal benefits if the couple legally married in one state and then, at the time the applicant filed the application, the Number Holder moved to another state that did not recognize same-sex marriage. ", "For applicants in a same-sex domestic partnership or civil union, SSA generally determined eligibility for spousal benefits by looking at whether the domicile state would grant inheritance rights to the applicant. When considering these types of relationships, SSA first determined whether the nonmarital legal relationship was valid in the place it was established and whether the relationship qualified as a marital relationship under the laws of the state of the Number Holder's domicile. SSA determined whether a nonmarital legal relationship qualified as a marital relationship using the intestate laws of the Number Holder's domicile. If under such a state's intestate laws, an applicant could inherit a spouse's share of the Number Holder's personal property if the Number Holder died without a will, then SSA would have considered the same-sex couple's relationship as a marital relationship for the purposes of determining entitlement to Social Security benefits. If the Number Holder's domicile-state at the time of application did not recognize the nonmarital legal relationship for same-sex couples or does not grant that type of relationship with the rights to inherit under intestate law, then SSA would not have considered that marriage as valid for the purposes of determining entitlement to benefits.
