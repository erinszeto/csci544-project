The report identifies and analyzes numerous types of strategies. Outsourcing is a controversial issue in many states. The students' research revealed that state governments develop a spectrum of outsourcing policies from balancing in-house projects with outsourced projects, to prohibiting outsourcing, to promoting outsourcing. Funding is an important e-government issue because IT projects are costly and their success is uncertain. Legislatures must choose between multiple programs during the budget process and, in many cases, e-government competes with other needs for funding. State politics and culture can impede or support e-government development. Public agencies are often averse to IT changes because they can alter employee and agency functions. However, IT enhancements do not typically cause agencies to be eliminated. Strong leadership can support e-government programs and drive IT improvements by encouraging and promoting new projects among civil servants and citizens.

The students at the LBJ School of Public Affairs created the survey by researching similar surveys, contacting e-government experts, and consulting with CRS specialists. They sent 51 surveys to all 50 states and the District of Columbia and received back 38 completed surveys. They conducted site visits in six case study states: California, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Texas, Utah, and Washington. A set of core questions was used for each case study interview, along with state-specific questions.", "The survey results also provide general understanding of e-government differences among the states. The survey trends indicate that most e-government leaders have access to the state governor as needed. Questions about outsourcing show that most states either outsource the majority of their projects (75\u2014100%) or outsource very little (0\u201425%). The most frequent leader in state e-government initiatives is the state Chief Information Officer (CIO). However, there are multiple departments involved in e-government, including Finance and Accounting Offices, IT Departments, and Information Resources Departments. States finance e-government from a variety of sources, including operating budgets, federal funds and grants, user fees, and capital funds. The majority of states use at least these four funding mechanisms in addition to secondary sources. Some states voice e-government security concerns for citizens and agency employees. Survey results show that many states are aware of legal restrictions on certain e-services, whereas other states are unaware. States use multiple performance measures to track programs; the most popular methods are customer satisfaction surveys and web tracking using specified metrics for evaluating site and service use online. The types of strategy documents used by states vary widely. Documents named in the survey include IT Plans, information management plans, and IT business plans, among others.", "The case study site visits elicited insightful information about interagency management strategies and decision-making processes. States vary in how they conduct e-government initiatives. Some governments, such as Texas, prefer to outsource software and applications development to consulting firms, while other states, such as Massachusetts, emphasize in-house development. Some states, such as Kentucky, encourage public-private partnerships and work closely with community leaders, while others use only intra-agency methods to create e-government programs. Each case study in the report includes state specific information on leadership, strategy documents, implementation, outsourcing, funding, centralization, and state politics and culture. In addition, this report contains a best practices section for each state case study that discusses successful program attributes such as effective communication on all levels, pilot projects for specific applications, and diversified methods of funding.", "The findings section of the report discusses the importance of strong leadership in furthering e-government initiatives. Devising a strategy is important, but not all states follow the same process. State e-government strategies vary significantly. Through the survey results and site visits, it was found that multiple entities are involved in the e-government implementation process, ranging from educational institutions to government agencies. In addition, survey respondents contend that there is a trend towards creating centralized systems and procedures for citizens to obtain information through state web portals and other forms of enterprise architecture. Survey evidence also found that funding sources in many states are diverse. While e-government is often implemented as a measure to provide efficiencies and to save costs (e.g., reducing the need for employees to perform some routine tasks such as customer service), actual dollar savings are not always realized by the states. However, e-government presents management challenges, and cost savings typically do not occur until the later phases of e-government implementation when at least a 30% adoption rate is realized.", "Identifying e-government planning and management concepts can facilitate a comparative analysis of state programs. In addition, strategies and management at the state level may provide important \"lessons learned\" for potential federal e-government initiatives.", "President George W. Bush has described new goals and policies for government reform that include citizen-centric online governance and the establishment of the E-Government Fund. This federal mandate proposes to \"shift power from a handful of leaders in Washington to individual citizens\" by increasing interagency cooperation and reducing redundant applications and procedures. Chief among the federal government changes is the establishment of USA.gov (formerly Firstgov.gov). This portal acts as the official gateway to federal government information and services, and facilitates citizen interaction with the federal government.", "Furthermore, e-government is one of the primary oversight jurisdictions of both the U.S. House Committee on Government Reform and the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.

The decision to outsource may depend on the complexity of a new program. Programs that are simple to develop can be administered in-house, or within the public agency. However, \"If the system is complex ... governments generally have to rely on expertise from the private and nonprofit sectors. This involves some loss of control and decline in autonomy on the part of the bureaucratic agency.\" Some public officials may choose outsourcing over in-house development because they believe outsourcing reduces the government payroll and improves accountability in the public sector. For some public officials the incentive to outsource is financial: since many technology tasks are now routinely administered, they are 'commoditized' and inexpensive. At times, outsourcing is necessary because governments may lack sufficient funding or expertise to complete projects in-house. Technology companies that have already developed software applications may be less expensive to use because they do not incur the initial research and development costs that an in-house IT department would incur. Also, agencies may lack jurisdiction to provide particular services that are deemed outside of their legal bounds.", "Additionally, there are no guarantees that outsourcing projects will lead to successful applications and programs. Although many observers believe e-government will yield high savings, \"the upfront investment costs of new technology are substantial and costs savings do not emerge until enough users start taking advantage of electronic delivery systems that government can save money through traditional bricks-and-mortar delivery systems [e.g., traditional office functions associated with service provision].\" Moreover, due to the immense costs of many e-government projects, the competitive bidding process, and competition among private vendors in the awarding of contracts, outsourcing has become highly politicized. Contracting problems associated with certain governors and public agencies, often revealed through critical media sources, can undermine the original goals of e-government programs and change the public's perception about the government's ability to administer and provide e-services.

In terms of cost measures, agencies can evaluate cost savings related to overhead and operating costs, such as paper use, postage, and transportation costs that are incurred through traditional modes of communication. They can also evaluate how employees manage caseloads through face-to-face interaction in contrast to e-government interaction.

Contracting agreements for e-government services can provide alternative methods for financing by reducing implementation costs and start-up costs. Some of these methods allow for revenue sharing in the implementation phase of the e-government process. Many respondents report that state budget or finance divisions have direct control over e-government day-to-day management. E-government oversight and management involves multiple entities, including budget and finance offices.", "While e-government is considered a cost-saving measure, reducing the need for employees to perform some customer service tasks, actual dollar savings or cuts are often not realized. However, e-government may allow a state to do more with the same amount of resources. Customers who do not take advantage of e-government services need the services of employees for their in-person or mail utilization of services. These customers still realize gains from e-government, as employees are better able to serve their needs. Some states find that e-government allows them to slow employment growth because workloads are shifted and reduced. Other states realize savings from reductions in staffing.", "As evidenced in various agencies in Texas, adoption rates that cross the 30% threshold often indicate cost savings from online service provision. As adoption rates increase, savings can occur in many areas such as more staff time for new projects, a decrease in transportation and postage costs, and a greater capacity to manage high caseloads. E-government web portals may not increase revenues, but they are increasingly viewed as a necessary mechanism of information delivery to respond to public and private sectors that demand information and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Centralized/Decentralized Technology Management", "paragraphs": ["The institutionalization of enterprise architecture planning seems to be the goal of many states, often leading to some form of centralization in terms of management of e-government programs and web portals that offer many services through one site. Centralization may be in the form of data sharing, application sharing, or even data consolidation. Moving toward a centralized structure works to benefit many states by avoiding overlap, allowing for cooperation and data sharing, and streamlining processes. In some large states, centralization is not always possible or desirable. In these states, enterprise orientation can still be part of the thinking and planning process. The \"silo mentality\" of agencies, a desire to be independent and to resist change, is a major obstacle for many states that desire greater centralization. Enterprise architecture planning is becoming more widespread and can be beneficial to e-government efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bibliography", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Val Oveson, CGI-AMS Consultant and Former CIO of the State of Utah, Presentation at the Government Technology Conference, Austin, TX.
