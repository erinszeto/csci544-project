This concern became acute after May 1998, when both India andPakistan tested nuclear explosive devices. Since that time, both countries have continued testingnuclear-capable ballistic missiles, and both have established command and control authorities tooversee their nuclear arsenals. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 and havesignificant unsettled territorial disputes. Although the status of weaponization is unclear, aslow-speed arms race appears to be underway on the Asian Subcontinent, and the proliferation ofmissile capabilities in South Asia has been identified as a potentially major threat to regional stabilityand to key U.S. foreign policy goals.", "A persistent aspect of U.S. engagement in the region has been the difficulty of maintaining a balanced approach toward two antagonistic countries while simultaneously promoting perceived U.S.interests. During the 1990s, U.S. security policy toward South Asia focused on preventing weaponsproliferation, but the Bush Administration shifted to a more \"pragmatic\" approach emphasizing\"restraint\" in this area. For perhaps the first period in history the United States currently enjoyssimultaneously positive relations with both countries.", "While relationships between the United States, India, and Pakistan have taken on a positive hue, potential for regional instability persists. The strategic capabilities of India and Pakistan couldprovide a ready catalyst for transforming disputes or terrorist incidents into potentially cataclysmicconfrontations. Both countries also are pursuing the development or acquisition of missile defensesystems. It is unknown at this early stage if missile defenses will offer a degree of stability to theregion or if they will create an imbalance, thus prompting the other country to build more missilesto compensate for the disparity.", "Key issues for Congress addressed in this report are the extent to which missile proliferation in South Asia enhances or upsets regional stability and the role of U.S. policy in promoting suchstability, as well as in tension reduction and nonproliferation. Levels of U.S. foreign assistance toIndia and Pakistan, the establishment of aid restrictions, the transfer of conventional weaponsplatforms (possibly including missile defense systems), the setting of export control parameters andnonproliferation goals, and the maintenance of policy and intelligence oversight of U.S. relationswith India and Pakistan constitute additional issues of concern to Congress.

In light ofthese goals, the Clinton Administration established five \"benchmarks\" for India and Pakistan basedon the contents of UN Security Council Res. 1172, which condemned the two countries' nuclear testsof May 1998. These were:", "signing and ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT); (2)", "halting all further production of fissile material and participating in FissileMaterial Cutoff Treaty (FMCT) negotiations;", "limiting development and deployment of WMD deliveryvehicles;", "implementing strict export controls on WMD materials and technologies;and", "establishing bilateral dialogue between New Delhi and Islamabad.", "Progress in each of these areas has been limited, and the Bush Administration makes no reference to the benchmark framework.

(9) In the face of congressionalquestioning about seeming \"contradictions\" in U.S. policy, Assistant Secretary of State for SouthAsia Christina Rocca stated in March 2003 that the United States is taking a \"pragmatic approach\"that seeks to have India and Pakistan \"exercise restraint\" with regard to the proliferation of strategicarsenals.

India's swift offer of full support for U.S. antiterrorismefforts was widely viewed as reflective of much improved U.S.-India relations. In 2003, and forperhaps the first period in history, the United States simultaneously enjoys positive relations withboth countries. (11) This circumstance may meanthat the ability of the United States to influence SouthAsian security dynamics is at an all-time high. At the same time, differences with Pakistan (overissues of terrorism, proliferation, and democratization) and with India (over definitions of terrorism,U.S. policy in the Middle East, and human rights) continue to cloud forecasts of future U.S.engagement with South Asia's two largest and nuclear-armed countries.

A bloody battle in the Kashmiri mountainsnear Kargil in 1999 cost thousands of lives and marked history's first significant direct clash betweenthe forces of two nuclear-armed countries. Most recently, a 10-month-long military standoff in 2002involving up to one million Indian and Pakistani soldiers was viewed as the closest the two countrieshad been to full-scale war since 1971, and caused the U.S. government to become \"deeply concerned... that a conventional war ... could escalate into a nuclear confrontation.\" (12)", "A persistent and oftentimes perplexing aspect of U.S. engagement in the region has been the difficulty of maintaining a more-or-less balanced approach toward two antagonistic countries whilesimultaneously promoting perceived U.S. interests in South Asia.

Two key results were the institutionalization of closeU.S.-Pakistan ties and the provision to Islamabad of large assistance packages.

However, the second India-Pakistan war over Kashmir in 1965 spurred the United Statesto end military assistance to both countries. Given Pakistan's 10 years of close cooperation with theUnited States, some in Islamabad felt betrayed by this move. However, when East Pakistan (nowBangladesh) fell into turmoil in 1971, leading to the forced partition of Pakistan after its defeat ina third war with India, President Nixon elected to \"tilt\" U.S. support toward Pakistan and, in sodoing, brought U.S.-India relations to a nadir.

And, second, doesprogress in the development of missile and nuclear capabilities promote or degrade regionalstability? Indian and Pakistani government officials express a desire to avoid engaging in a costlyand potentially disastrous arms race, while also asserting that no such race is afoot. (23) Yet a 2001Defense Department review of proliferation threats indicated that, \"Indian and Pakistani strategicprograms continue to be driven by the perception of the other's effort,\" and that the two countries\"are in a period of accelerated nuclear weapons and missile development\" that may be termed a\"slow-speed\" arms race. (24) In 2002, Director ofCentral Intelligence Tenet told the Senate SelectCommittee on Intelligence that,", "Both India and Pakistan are working on the doctrine and tactics for more advanced nuclear weapons, producing fissile material, and increasing their nuclearstockpiles. ... Both countries also continue development of long-range nuclear-capable ballisticmissiles, and plan to field cruise missiles with a land-attackcapability. (25)", "Apparent tit-for-tat ballistic missile tests in April 1999 and again in March 2003 have been viewed as evidence that an action-reaction dynamic is indeed at work. (26) Many analysts argue thatovert nuclear weaponization by either side -- most especially of their ballistic missiles -- could behighly destabilizing, especially if significant nuclear missile forces are deployed in the absence ofsecure command and control structures. If these forces are perceived as being vulnerable to attack,one or both sides might adopt a launch-on-warning status, making conflict escalation even moredifficult to govern. (27)", "Ever since the 1998 nuclear tests in South Asia, it has appeared that India's strategic decision-making is a key factor in shaping regional stability. According to the Pentagon, \"India'sdevelopment of [medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs)] ... is motivated by its desire to berecognized as a great power and strategic competitor with China.\" (28) China seems content with itsexisting deterrent against India, and Pakistan's limited resources appear to constrain its ability toinitiate an Indo-Pakistani arms race. (29) Thus, akey variable in the future evolution of South Asiannuclear proliferation is India's strategic intention in relation to China. One of the more dangerousscenarios is one in which India actively seeks to gain nuclear parity with China by building a largernuclear arsenal and long-range delivery force. In the middle-term, the deployment of Agni missilescapable of striking China's eastern population centers could spur Beijing to re-target more nuclearforces to the south and likewise move Islamabad to seek some form of parity in this arena, thuspotentially setting in motion a full-blown arms race on the Asian Subcontinent. (30) Moreover, someobservers suggest that U.S. sales of theater missile defense systems in Asia -- or the deployment ofa national system covering U.S. territory -- could spur further ballistic missile proliferation in SouthAsia (see below).

Put simply, mutual deterrence obtains when both sides believe thatthe costs of aggression or escalation are likely to outweigh the potential benefits of such action. (33) Proliferation pessimists , however, take the view that the spread of nuclear weapons capability isinherently destabilizing and dangerous, and that nuclear dynamics in the developing world areunlikely to re-create the Cold War pattern. Political and technological factors in conflict-prone areasare seen to create conditions where nuclear weapons will not produce stability and the introductionof more nuclear weapons will significantly increase the likelihood that these weapons will be used. (34) Many analysts have pointed to the brief, bloody Kargil conflict of 1999 as evidence that SouthAsia's strategic arsenals do not contribute to stability and may lead to the use of nuclear weapons. (35)", "Only seven months after the May 1998 tests, the main architect of the \"benchmark\" framework, then-Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, noted that the New Delhi and Islamabad governmentswere justifying their moves to overt capabilities with reference to the U.S.-Soviet experience,\"almost as if they see Cold War brinkmanship between the superpowers as something to beemulated.\" He warned that such a perspective misreads the reality of U.S.-Soviet interactions, andthat historic, geographic, and economic differences appear significant in the South Asian case. (36) Thisuse of the Cold War experience illustrates the general proliferation optimism of the Indian andPakistani governments in contrast with the proliferation pessimism expressed by some U.S.government officials, especially those in the State Department. As noted above, BushAdministration officials have been more muted in their criticism of South Asian strategic arsenals.", "Both India and Pakistan have claimed to be seeking only the nuclear weapons needed for minimum credible deterrence (MCD). (37) Most Indian and Pakistani planners have conceived of MCDas a significantly scaled-down form of the massive urban/industrial retaliation envisaged under theU.S. nuclear doctrine of the 1950s, based on the ability to launch a retaliatory strike that would inflict\"unacceptable damage\" upon an adversary. (38) Given the expressed positions of the Indian andPakistani governments and their observable behaviors as noted in the sections above, it would appearthat some form of strategic arms race is taking place on the Asian Subcontinent, albeit one in whichprogress is limited by economic and technological factors. There exists no consensus, however, onthe question of how such developments affect the level of regional stability. One's perspective onthis issue tends to be decisively colored by fundamental beliefs about the utility of nuclear deterrenceand the extent to which it obtains in South Asia.

(130) TheShaheen II is also believed to have a separating reentry vehicle and its accuracy may be enhancedthrough the use of GPS technology. The Shaheen II was first publically displayed in March 2000and it is not believed to have been flight tested to date. Some experts speculate that Pakistan mayhave produced from 5 to 10 Shaheen IIs.", "Ghauri I. The Ghauri-series of road-mobile, liquid propellant missiles are produced in Pakistan's Khan Research Laboratories. (131) Many analystsbelieve that the Ghauri I is based on North Korea's No Dong I and II missile. Reports that Iran'sShahab III missile appears to be very similar in design to the Ghauri I have led to widespreadspeculation by intelligence officials that Pakistan, North Korea, and Iran have collaborated in thedevelopment of these missiles. (132) The GhauriI is believed to have a range of 1,500 km, and accuracyof 2,500 m, and could deliver a 760 kg 15 to 35 KT nuclear warhead which Pakistan has alleged tohave tested in May 1998. The Ghauri I is believed to have been operationally deployed in late 1998by Pakistan's 47th Artillery Brigade with 5-10 missiles available for testing or operational use.", "Ghauri II. The Ghauri II is believed to be a lengthened and improved version of the Ghauri I, possibly employing new propellants and a motorassembly. The Ghauri II's accuracy is unknown but its range is believed to be between 1,800 to2,300 km and could also accommodate a 15 to 35 KT nuclear warhead as well as the full range ofwarheads available for the Ghauri I. A Ghauri III missile has been reported to be in developmentwith a possible 3,000 km range and motor tests for this missile were believed to have taken placein July and September 1999.", "Foreign Involvement in Pakistan's Missile Program. A February 2000 report from the Central Intelligence Agency citedChinese and North Korean assistance as \"critical for Islamabad's efforts to produce ballisticmissiles.\" (133) Some analysts suggest that Chinamay have been heavily involved in the developmentof the Shaheen I. A 1999 U.S. intelligence report alleges that China transferred designs for a missilefactory to Pakistan and this factory is currently being used to produce Shaheen I missiles. (134) A July2000 report from the U.S. intelligence community stated that China had stepped up its shipments ofspecialty steels, guidance systems, and technical expertise to Pakistan. (135) Press reports, citing aJanuary 2003 Central Intelligence Agency report to Congress on Weapons Technology, claim thatChina also assisted Pakistan in developing the Shaheen II and possibly nuclear weapons. (136)", "Pakistan is believed to have started development of the Ghauri I in 1993 with North Korean assistance. (137) Experts believe that the GhauriI is essentially a North Korean No Dong missile.India's interception in June, 1999 of a ship carrying a large amount of missile technology from NorthKorea to Pakistan has raised the issue that North Korean missile technology may be able to helpPakistan achieve ranges out to 8,000 km. (138) There is also evidence that Pakistan is reciprocating andassisting North Korea in its missile program. Pakistan has been accused of providing North Koreawith test data from Ghauri test flights for its use in improving its No Dong missiles despite NorthKorea's self-imposed 1999 moratorium on long range missile test flights. (139) Some experts have alsosuggested that Pakistan is providing valuable solid-fuel propulsion technology from itsChinese-based Shaheen missiles for North Korea's use in the Taepo Dong missile program. In 1993,Pakistani and Iranian specialists were alleged to have traveled to North Korea to observe the launchof a No Dong and three SCUD missiles. (140) Some suggest that Pakistani-Iranian missile cooperationhas deteriorated. Amin Tarzi, writing for the Monterey Institute of International Studies inCalifornia, claims that the relationship has lessened because of reported anti-Shiite activities inPakistan and Islamabad's policies towards Afghanistan related to the U.S. war on terror in theregion.
