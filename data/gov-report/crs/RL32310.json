(5) In addition,for nearly half a century Congress has forbidden the Department of Defense to obligate funds for anyproject or program until specific authorization is granted. (6) This explains why, for defense funds, both authorization andappropriations bills are required. The annual Military Construction Appropriations Act is dedicatedto military construction, and the annual National Defense Appropriations Act covers all otherDepartment of Defense appropriations. (7) Normally only one National Defense Authorization Act is passedeach year to authorize both of these appropriations.

However, the Korean War prompted a surge of military construction, followedby a steady increase in military construction appropriations. The strong and enduring security threatposed by the Soviet Union drove a relatively high and continuous level of spending on militaryinfrastructure. The congressional appropriations committees established military constructionsubcommittees and created a separate military construction bill.

The CBO, on the other hand, arguesthat the Department is engaging in a \"governmental activity\" by supplying familyhousing in whatever form, either government or privately owned, to militarypersonnel. (30) The CBO contends that the Department ofDefense exercises significant control over the operation of these housing projects andthat the government is the dominant or only source of project income, rendering thepartnered private-sector corporation effectively an instrument of thegovernment. (31) ", "The \"leveraging\" in the privatization initiative occurs when appropriatedfunds are used, either in the form of a loan guarantee, direct loan, or equity stake, toassist the private-sector corporation in securing the additional commercial financingnecessary to capitalize the project. Because the CBO regards privatization projectsas inherently governmental, it considers all such investments as borrowing authority,a form of budget authority, that should be recorded up front rather than scored overtime.", "For its part, the Department of Defense maintains that privatized housing iscontrolled by a private corporation, not the government, that military members arefree to use their housing allowance wherever they wish, and that the budget authorityrecorded is properly limited to the amount of financial liability incurred by theDepartment, as calculated by the OMB scoring rules.", "In awarding its 32 family housing projects, the Department of Defense hasused OMB's accounting methodology to record obligations of approximately $580million. The CBO, using the rationale explained above, contends that the full amountof the Department's commitments to date approximates $6 billion.", "The Office of Management and Budget devoted a significant portion of itsStatement of Administration Policy on S. 2674 , the Senate version ofthe Military Construction Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005, issued onSeptember 20, 2004, to an explanation of its position on the issue of the housingprivatization cap, stating:", "The President's Budget included arequest that would increase the military housing privatization cap from $850 millionto $1.85 billion. This increase will help improve the quality of life of our militaryfamilies by eliminating inadequate housing and allowing them the option to renthigh-quality homes at prices covered by housing allowances. Furthermore, withoutthis increase, the current limit would be reached by November 2004. OMB would notscore any additional cost to this provision, because it does not increase the amountof budget authority available to the Department of Defense (DOD). Moreover, DODdoes not need additional budget authority to cover the construction cost of theseprivate projects. These projects receive private sector funding and are controlled andmanaged by private owners, and DOD does not require service members to live inthe units and does not guarantee their occupancy. Any immediate costs to DODassociated with these contracts, such as credit subsidies or cash investments, are paidfor out of funds appropriated to the Department's housing accounts. Additional coststo the Department in the form of allowances paid to service members are offset byavoidance of costs associated with building and maintenance of government housing.The Administration urges the Senate to either eliminate the cap or raise the cap to therequested $1.85 billion, which is essential to meet the FY2007 DOD goal ofeliminating inadequate housing units.

Appropriations began to rise with FY1998as Congress sought to replace outdated facilities and improve the quality of life formilitary personnel at home and in the workplace. Administration requests for militaryconstruction funding (not including BRAC and family housing) continued to declineuntil FY2000, but have risen for FY2001 and FY2002. The request for FY2005 risesabove the level requested for FY2004, but falls short of projections made severalyears ago. In FY2001, DOD anticipated that its annual construction requests wouldapproximately triple between FY2003 and FY2007, which would have led anobserver to anticipate an FY2005 request approximately $1 billion higher than thatsubmitted (see Figure 1 ).", "Figure 1.

Among these were the inadequacy of Department requests forsustainment, restoration, and modernization funds and the inappropriate use ofunprogrammed minor construction funding.", "The House Appropriations Committee noted the long-standing tensionbetween funds needed for construction of new buildings and the funds that arededicated to the maintenance of existing facilities. The former is funded through themilitary construction appropriation, while the latter is supported by sustainment,restoration, and modernization (SRM) accounts in the national defense appropriation.The committee remarked that the majority of military installations are rated by theservices at the lowest two of four possible facility readiness grades (C-3 and C-4),while SRM appropriations are often diverted to support base operations. (33) ", "The Senate Appropriations Committee highlighted what it determined to bethe inappropriate use of minor construction funds for construction not authorized bycongressional committees. According to 10 U.S.C. 2805, the Secretary of Defenseis permitted to initiate construction projects that have not been either authorized orspecifically appropriated for using funds in what is referred to as the \"unspecifiedminor construction\" appropriation account. This authority is intended for use onlyunder circumstances where the need for construction could not have been foreseenin time to request an appropriation through the normal process and, in the case wheresuch construction would correct a deficiency that threatens life, health, or safety;authority is limited to projects that will cost $3 million or less. (34) Thecommittee observed that in the period since September 11, 2001, this authority hasbeen frequently used to justify projects, such as gates, inspection facilities, and evena firing range, that are primarily intended as anti-terrorism/force protection measures,all of which should by now be readily identifiable sufficiently far in advance toappear in the normal appropriation process.
