Under ESA, species of plants and animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate) can be listed as endangered or threatened according to assessments of their risk of extinction. Habitat loss is the primary cause for listing species. Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools are available to aid its recovery and protect its habitat. Accordingly, when certain resources are associated with listed species\u2014such as water in arid regions like California, old growth timber in national forests, or free-flowing rivers\u2014ESA is seen as an obstacle to continued or greater human use of these resources. ESA may also be controversial because dwindling species are usually harbingers of broader ecosystem decline or conflicts. As a result, ESA is considered a primary driver of large-scale ecosystem restoration issues.", "Major issues concerning ESA in recent years have included the role of science in decision making, critical habitat (CH) designation, incentives for property owners, and appropriate protection for listed species, among others.", "Although many bills were introduced, little legislation related to ESA was enacted by the 112th Congress. Committees conducted oversight of the implementation of various federal programs and laws that address threatened and endangered species. P.L. 112-10 (final appropriations for FY2011) included a legislative delisting of a portion of the reintroduced Rocky Mountain gray wolf population. P.L. 112-74 provided slightly more than $237 million for FWS endangered species and related programs; this FY2012 funding for FWS core ESA programs was 0.5% more than the FY2011 enacted amount and 3.5% less than the FY2012 Administration request. P.L. 112-270 amended P.L. 106-392 to maintain annual base funding for the Upper Colorado and San Juan fish recovery programs through FY2019.", "The authorization for spending under ESA expired on October 1, 1992. The prohibitions and requirements of ESA remain in force, even in the absence of an authorization, and funds have been appropriated to implement the administrative provisions of ESA in each subsequent fiscal year.

The most common cause of species' decline is habitat loss or alteration. Habitat loss occurs due to development, climate change, changes in land management practices, competition from invasive species, and other factors, nearly all related to economic, political, or social interests.", "ESA has been among the most contentious environmental laws because its substantive provisions can affect the use of both federal and nonfederal lands and resources. Congress faces the issue of how to balance these interests with the protection of endangered and threatened species and, as stated in ESA, \"the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend.\" Because of strong support and strong opposition, ESA has not been reauthorized since the last authorization expired in 1992. In the 109 th Congress, there were several unsuccessful attempts to enact comprehensive legislation that would have reauthorized ESA. Congressional efforts in the 110 th , 111 th , and 112 th Congresses focused on addressing specific controversial features of ESA and on oversight of concerns such as the science used for making decisions and designating critical habitat, but little legislation related to ESA was enacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["The 1973 ESA was a comprehensive attempt to protect species at risk of extinction and to consider habitat protection as an integral part of that effort. In addition, an express purpose of ESA is to \"provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved\" (16 U.S.C. \u00a71531(b)). Under ESA, species of plants and animals (both vertebrate and invertebrate) may be listed as either endangered or threatened according to assessments of the risk of their extinction. More flexible management can be provided for species listed as threatened, compared to those listed as endangered. Distinct population segments of vertebrate species may also be listed as threatened or endangered. Consequently, some populations of Chinook, coho, chum, and sockeye salmon in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California have been listed under ESA, even as other healthy populations of these same species in Alaska are not listed and may be commercially harvested. More limited protection is available for plant species under ESA. Once a species is listed, legal tools, including penalties and citizen suits, are available to aid species recovery and protect habitat. Use of these tools, or the failure to use them, has led to conflict.

The remaining species occur only in other countries. Of the 1,436 U.S. species, 1,143 (about 80%) are covered in active recovery plans. In the most recent data available, FY2011 federal and state expenditures on endangered and threatened species totaled about $1.59 billion, of which about $1.53 billion was reported by federal agencies and about $58 million was reported by the states. The top 10 species with the highest total FY2011 expenditures (excluding land acquisition costs) included 7 subpopulations of steelhead and Pacific salmon ($338 million altogether), pallid sturgeon ($42 million), bull trout ($37 million), and red-cockaded woodpecker ($27 million). ", "However, species do not exist in isolation, but evolve and fluctuate in abundance because of their relationships with other species and the physical environment. Conservationists increasingly are talking about not only species, but also ecosystems as the units of interest. At times, efforts to protect and recover listed species are controversial; declining species often function like the proverbial canary in the coal mine, by flagging larger issues of resource scarcity and altered ecosystems. Past resource debates in which ESA-listed species were part of larger issues include Tennessee's Tellico Dam (water storage and construction jobs versus farmland protection and tribal graves, as well as snail darters); Pacific Northwest timber harvest (protection of logging jobs and communities versus commercial and sport fishing, recreation, and ecosystem protection, including salmon and spotted owls); and the management of the Apalachicola Basin in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia (allocation of water among metropolitan, agricultural, and industrial users along with commercial and recreational fishing interests, as well as one listed fish and three listed mussel species).

CITES parallels ESA by dividing its listed species into groups according to the estimated risk of extinction, but uses three major categories (called appendices), rather than two. In contrast to ESA, CITES classifies species based solely on the risk that trade poses to their survival. Under ESA, violations of CITES are also violations of U.S. law if committed within U.S. jurisdiction (16 U.S.C. \u00a71538). ESA also regulates import and export of controlled products and provides some exceptions.", "Both ESA and CITES address illegal trade in wildlife.

Because a major goal of ESA is the recovery of species to the point at which ESA protection is no longer necessary, this may be a useful starting point. In the 39 years since ESA was enacted, 56 U.S. and foreign species or distinct population segments thereof have been delisted. The reasons cited by FWS are (a)\u00a0recovery (28 species); (b) extinction (10 species; however, some may have been extinct when listed); and (c) original data in error (18 species). Recovered species include the American alligator, bald eagle, brown pelican (two areas), peregrine falcon (two subspecies), gray wolf (four areas), gray whale (except the Western Pacific Ocean), and three species of kangaroo. Extinct species include the dusky seaside sparrow, Guam broadbill (a bird), and two small fish living in desert springs. However, it can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that or, in fact, are already extinct. For example, the endangered ivory-billed woodpecker, thought by many to be extinct, was thought to have been rediscovered in a remote area of Arkansas a few years ago. Rare species are, by definition, hard to find.", "Some have asserted that ESA is a failure since only 28 species have been delisted due to recovery; on the other hand, only 10 species have been delisted because of extinction. Others note that full recoveries are relatively few because the two principal causes of extinction\u2014habitat loss and invasive non-native species\u2014continue to increase. In addition, \"only those species whose situations are known to be the most desperate will receive priority,\" thereby making recovery difficult, as conservation intervention would occur in only the later phases of a species' decline .", "Another measure of \"success\" might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if the species are not actually delisted; for example, at least 35 species have been reclassified (downlisted) from endangered to threatened. Under this standard, ESA could be considered a success, since a large number of listed species (41%, according to one study) have improved or stabilized their population levels after listing. Other species (e.g., red wolves and California condors) might not exist at all without ESA protection, and this too might be considered a measure of success, although these species are still rare. One approach to gauge progress might be to look at what proportion of the recovery objectives identified in species recovery plans have been achieved. Table 1 indicates how the rate of achievement of recovery objectives changes with the increasing length of time after species are listed. In addition, one author concluded that the impact of species conservation efforts may be underestimated because measures do not account for species that (1) would have deteriorated further in the absence of conservation actions, or (2) have improved numerically, but not enough to change their status.", "An April 2005 study by GAO found that, although FWS spends almost half of its recovery funds on the highest-priority species, in practice, factors other than a species' priority ranking (e.g., regional office workload and opportunities for partnerships to maximize scarce recovery funds) determine how funding is allocated. GAO found that FWS does not have a process to assess funding decisions routinely to ensure that they are appropriate. On May 17, 2005, the majority staff of the House Committee on Resources released an oversight report entitled Implementation of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 . It reviewed and critiqued various ways that recovery might be measured. In 2006, GAO examined federal efforts to recover 31 selected species. GAO determined that, while many factors affected the recovery of species, recovery plans played an important role in the recovery of all but one of the species examined. Critics claimed the GAO study was biased to reflect positively on the recovery planning process by the selection of species examined.", "A December 2008 study by GAO found that, although FWS, NMFS, and other federal agencies had implemented a majority of recommendations to strengthen ESA implementation contained in 10 GAO reports released during the previous 10 years, almost one-third of these recommendations had not been implemented. For example:", "FWS had not clarified the role of critical habitat and how and when it should be designated; FWS had not periodically assessed expenditures on species in relation to their relative priority; and FWS and NMFS were not tracking the amount of time spent by federal agencies preparing for consultation before the process officially began.", "In August 2011, NMFS released its Biennial Report to the U.S. Congress on the Recovery Program for Threatened and Endangered Species, summarizing efforts to recover the 64 domestic species under NMFS's jurisdiction from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2010.

Examples of these controversies include the Florida panther, Klamath River Basin suckers and coho salmon, gray wolf, and Sonoran Desert bald eagles. Critics in some of these disputes suggest that the science supporting ESA action has been insufficiently rigorous or mishandled by the agencies.", "Many rare and endangered species are little studied because they are hard to find and it is difficult to locate enough of them to study. There may be little information on many species facing extinction, and only limited personnel or funds available to conduct studies on many of the less charismatic species, or those of little known economic import. Some question what should be done in such instances. In response, some suggest that considerations other than species conservation should prevail; others seek to change the current posture of the law by changing the role of science. These considerations are complicated by the cost and time required to acquire more complete data, particularly in connection with many lesser-known species.", "Courts, in considering the \"best data available\" language, have held that an agency is not obliged to conduct studies to obtain missing data, but cannot ignore available biological information, especially if the ignored information is the most current. Nor may an agency treat one species differently from other similarly situated species, or decline to list a dwindling species and wait until it is on the brink of extinction in relying on possible but uncertain future actions of an agency. \"Best scientific and commercial data available\" is not a standard of absolute certainty, reflecting Congress's intent that FWS take conservation measures before a species is conclusively headed for extinction. If FWS does not base its listings on speculation or surmise, or disregard superior data, the imperfections of the studies upon which it relies do not undermine those studies as the best scientific data available\u2014\"the Service must utilize the best scientific ... data available, not the best scientific data possible.\"", "Judicial review can also help ensure that agency decisions and their use of scientific data are not arbitrary or capricious and that regulations are rationally related to the problems causing the decline of a species, especially when other interests are adversely affected. In Arizona Cattle Growers Association v. United States Fish and Wildlife Service , the court stated that the evidentiary bar FWS must clear is very low, but it must at least clear it. In the context of issuing incidental take permits under Section 10(a), this ruling means the agency must demonstrate that a species is or could be in an area before regulating it, and must establish the causal connection between the land use being regulated and harm to the species in question. Mere speculation as to the potential for harm is not sufficient. An agency must consider the relevant facts and articulate a rational connection between these facts and the choices made.", "In July 2012, the Center for Biological Diversity published a study concluding that peer reviews of ESA critical habitat designations may not be adequately considered by federal agencies.", "In the 112 th Congress, the House Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight held a hearing on the nexus of science and policy under ESA on October 13, 2011.

However, years after the theory was proffered, no published court opinion has considered this issue.", "The idea is that once a species is listed, the argument could be made that sources of substantial greenhouse gas emissions, such as coal-fired power plants, cause an unlawful \"take\" of these species under ESA Section 9 by the effect such emissions have, via climate change, on the species' habitat. This could force negotiation of an incidental take permit for the source, with conditions to limit greenhouse gases.", "Case law, however, does not demonstrate that the ESA is used as an enforcement tool to make climate change arguments. In three cases where ESA challenges were directed at federal projects related to power plants, only one involved climate change allegations, Palm Beach County Environmental Coalition v. Florida , and it was not clear whether those claims were premised on the ESA or on another legal basis. In an Eighth Circuit case, Sierra Club v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , a claim was made that emissions harmed specific species near the power plant, and did not allege global harm. A similar claim was made in Palm Beach County . Neither court reviewed the ESA claims, finding procedural reasons. In the third case, United States v. Pacific Gas and Electric , the court held that the ESA had not been violated; also, the claims of harm to species related to a power plant were not based on GHGs.", "Despite the apparent lack of litigation premised on climate change taking species, some regulatory changes were made to limit lawsuits based on that cause of action. In December 2008, FWS changed the regulations that dictated how a Service considered impacts of federal projects on listed species. Those regulations were effective only from January 15, 2008, to May 5, 2008, after Congress acted to halt them in P.L. 111-8 . During that period of regulatory change, definitions related to the effects of an action were modified to \"reinforce the Services' current view that there is no requirement to consult on [greenhouse gas] emissions' contribution to global warming and its associated impacts on listed species.\" Despite the revocation of those changes, it does not appear that the scope of effects has expanded, likely due to the fact that the regulations already limited review to those effects with a reasonable certainty to occur. ", "Another regulatory change of the same time period is still in place. It restricts lawsuits claiming incidental takes of polar bears to instances where the agency action occurs in the state of Alaska. The polar bear was listed under the act primarily due to shrinking habitat caused by changing climate. The polar bear regulation prevents a lawsuit claiming that a power plant in any state other than Alaska harmed the polar bear by indirectly causing its ice floe habitat to diminish. The law that authorized revocation of the regulations discussed above, P.L. 111-8 , also authorized revocation of the polar bear rule, but the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce did not act to revoke that rule.

A court held in August 2010 that the Northern Rockies delisting violated the ESA, directing that the delisting be declared invalid. The Northern Rockies wolves were returned to their experimental population status, meaning they are treated as threatened in most circumstances. Meanwhile, scientists argue that allowing Congress to remove or add protections for particular species would set a dangerous precedent.", "However, Congress negated the effect of the August court decision when it approved the following language in P.L. 112-10 ( H.R. 1473 ):", "Sec. 1713.

While there may be attempts to point to the language of P.L. 112-10 as a precedent for delisting other species, two facts are unlikely to find parallels in other species controversies: (1) FWS had previously attempted to delist the species, meaning FWS believed the science supported delisting; and (2) the species had met and exceeded the numeric goals for delisting in the species' recovery plan, although the genetic connectivity was disputed.

The decline has been attributed to a combination of several factors, including entrainment (i.e., entrapment) in water export pumps, competition and predation from exotic fish species, warmer water temperatures, toxic contaminants, changes in habitat size and quality, and changes in food supply. The contribution of each factor in causing the species decline is controversial. Some contend that all causes might contribute to the observed decline.", "The delta smelt decline has significant consequences for the operation of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and the State Water Project (SWP), which supply water to much of Central and Southern California. Because entrainment and/or adverse modification of delta smelt critical habitat by water pumps is believed to contribute to the decline of delta smelt, changes in how these pumps are operated have triggered consultation under ESA. ESA requirements following consultation have contributed to reduced pumping and less water for users, which has been very controversial. ", "To address the impact of pumping changes on delta smelt, an ESA Section 7 consultation between FWS and the Bureau of Reclamation was initiated in 2004. FWS initially issued a no-jeopardy BiOp with regard to impacts on delta smelt by the operations of the CVP and SWP in 2004, and re-issued the BiOp in 2005 to address potential critical habitat issues of the delta smelt. In May 2007, the FWS BiOp was found not to comply with ESA with regard to delta smelt. The Bureau of Reclamation and FWS reinitiated consultation based on new information on the delta smelt in 2007. While the consultation process was underway, the Bureau of Reclamation implemented interim protective measures required by a court order issued in December 2007. A revised BiOp was issued December 15, 2008. FWS determined that the continued operation of water projects in the Bay-Delta, as described in the CVP Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP) biological assessment, was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the delta smelt and adversely modify its critical habitat. Along with the revised BiOp, FWS outlined reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) intended to protect each life-stage and critical habitat of the delta smelt, which resulted in reduction in water deliveries for many water users south of the Delta. These RPAs have been the subject of further litigation and much controversy. With more abundant water in the winter of 2011, the parties were able to agree on water flow levels through June 30, 2011, perhaps marking the first spring without litigation over water flow since the BiOp was issued.", "At issue during the 112 th Congress were congressional oversight of proposals to change operations and authorities for the Bureau of Reclamation's Central Valley Project and environmental and/or economic damages from federal water project operations. In the 112 th Congress, H.R. 1 (seeking to provide continuing appropriations for the remainder of FY2011) included language that would have prohibited funds from being used by NMFS and FWS for implementing certain actions described in BiOps for the operations of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project (\u00a71475, Division B, Title IV). On February 19, 2011, the House passed H.R. 1 (amended). However, the prohibition language was not included in P.L. 112-10 ( H.R. 1473 ), the Full-Year Appropriations Act of 2011. H.R. 1251 , Section 108 of H.R. 1837 , and Title V of S. 2365 would have provided congressional direction for ESA compliance as it related to operation of the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project; H.R. 1837 was reported (amended) by the House Committee on Natural Resources on February 27, 2012 ( H.Rept. 112-403 ) and passed by the House (amended) on February 29, 2012, but no further action was taken. Section 308 of H.R. 1287 , Section 4138 of S. 1720 , and S. 706 would have prohibited the Bureau of Reclamation and California state agencies from restricting operations for the Central Valley Project pursuant to any BiOp under certain conditions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Private Property and Fifth Amendment Takings", "paragraphs": ["The prohibitions in Section 9 (private actions) and Section 7 (federal nexus) at times frustrate the economic desires of owners of land or other property. This has long been a central issue for ESA's detractors, who assert that restrictions under ESA routinely \"take\" property in the constitutional sense of the term. Conflicts between ESA and property owners come about despite the existence of ESA mechanisms intended to soften its impact on property owners.", "Under the Fifth Amendment, property cannot be \"taken\" by the United States without just compensation. The Supreme Court has long tried, with limited success, to define which government actions affect private property so severely as to effect such a \"taking.\" In briefest outline, government actions usually are deemed a taking when they cause either a permanent physical occupation of private property or, through regulation, a total elimination of its economic use. When the government regulation removes only part, but not all, of the property's use or value, a three-factor balancing test is used to determine whether a taking has occurred. Although these factors remain amorphous, it is at least clear from lower court decisions that, for a taking to occur, the regulation's impact on the property generally must be severe; and with regard to the property as a whole, not just the regulated portion.", "Approximately 20 court decisions have addressed takings challenges to ESA restrictions on land or other property, with all but two finding no taking. These cases have involved restrictions on timber cutting, reductions in water delivery to preserve instream flows needed by listed species (a particularly active area now), restrictions on shooting animals that were responsible for loss of livestock, and prohibitions on the transport or sale of endangered species. In several of these cases, the taking claim failed because it was filed in the wrong court or was not \"ripe.\" Where takings claims were reached by the court, they were rejected principally because the economic impact was insufficient as to the property as a whole, or because of the long-standing principle that the government is not responsible for the actions of wild animals. Of the two decisions favoring the property owner, one, involving reduced water delivery to a water district owing to the need to maintain in-stream flows for listed fish, has been undermined by the judge who wrote it in a later decision. The other, however, instructs that when government requires water subject to appropriative water rights to be physically diverted to a fish ladder (here, for the use of a listed fish species), the diversion must be analyzed under a physical rather than regulatory taking theory. Under such a theory, as noted, the holder of water rights is generally likely to win its taking claim. In the present case, however, the trial court on remand held that the water diverted to the fish ladder had not been shown to encroach on the water actually needed by the plaintiff water district for its customers. The court therefore dismissed the case as not ripe, and it is on appeal again.", "In the 1990s, critics sought to amend ESA to afford compensation for a broader range of property impacts than the Constitution provides\u2014perhaps by specifying a fixed percentage of ESA-related property value loss, above which compensation must always be paid.
