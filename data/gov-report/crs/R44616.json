{"id": "R44616", "title": "FATCA Reporting on U.S. Accounts: Recent Legal Developments", "released_date": "2016-09-07T00:00:00", "summary": ["Enacted in 2010, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is intended to curb U.S. tax evasion occurring through the use of offshore accounts. Key among its provisions is the requirement that foreign financial institutions (FFIs), such as foreign banks and hedge funds, report information on their U.S. account holders to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). FFIs that fail to comply will have tax withheld at a rate of 30% on many payments made to them from U.S. sources, including interest and dividends.", "Since FATCA's passage, there has been international criticism of the FFI provisions, generally focused on whether the United States was correct to take FATCA's unilateral approach. Questions have arisen about whether FATCA's requirements are inconsistent with existing U.S. treaty obligations; how to handle potential conflict of law issues arising when an FFI is faced with complying with FATCA or its home country's domestic (e.g., banking and privacy) laws; and whether the United States has intruded into other countries' sovereignty.", "Recognizing that these concerns could affect the success of FATCA, the United States has entered into bilateral intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) with numerous countries in order to implement the FFI requirements. Under some of these agreements, FFIs report information on their U.S. account holders to their home country, which then provides the information to the IRS. In general, for those FFIs that are not covered by such an agreement, FATCA requires that they report the information directly to the IRS.", "As of August 1, 2016, there are 63 IGAs that are currently in force. Additionally, the United States treats certain countries as having an IGA in effect even though the country has not taken all the steps necessary to actually bring the agreement into force. In July 2016, the IRS made a significant announcement regarding these countries: they will stop being treated as having an IGA in effect in 2017 unless they comply with certain requirements by December 31, 2016. Among other things, the country must explain why the IGA is not yet in force and provide a step-by-step timeline for doing so. The Treasury Department and the IRS will then decide whether it is appropriate to continue to treat the country as having an IGA in effect.", "Some praise the FFI reporting requirements as an effective tool to combat tax evasion and argue that using the IGAs leads to positive outcomes, including reduced compliance costs for FFIs and avoidance of international conflict of law issues. Others, meanwhile, have expressed concerns about the privacy of information reported by FFIs and the appropriateness of the IGAs. These concerns are illustrated in an ongoing lawsuit, Crawford v. Department of the Treasury, in which the plaintiffs argue that the executive branch does not have the power to enter into IGAs and that the FFI reporting requirements violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable search and seizures by requiring FFIs to report information about U.S. account holders without any judicial oversight. In April 2016, a U.S. district court in Ohio dismissed the case after determining that the plaintiffs lacked standing. The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which has not yet issued a decision.", "Finally, legislation has been introduced in the 114th Congress that would repeal much of FATCA (S. 663); modify FATCA with the intent of \"strengthening\" it (Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, H.R. 297 and S. 174); or require that its effects on U.S. citizens living overseas be studied (Commission on Americans Living Abroad Act, H.R. 3078)."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["O ne of the more controversial tax laws enacted in recent years is the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). FATCA is intended to curb U.S. tax evasion occurring through the use of offshore accounts.

The law is now fully in effect.", "Key among FATCA's provisions is the requirement that foreign financial institutions (FFIs) report information on their U.S. account holders to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In order to implement this requirement, the United States has entered into bilateral agreements with numerous countries.

The requirements apply to the depository and custodial accounts maintained by the FFI, as well as equity and debt interests in the FFI (except publicly traded interests). ", "FFIs that fail to comply will have tax withheld at a rate of 30% on many payments made to them from U.S. sources, including interest and dividends.

These concerns, and the extent to which they may influence international views of FATCA, could be particularly important because it has been argued that FATCA's successful implementation will likely require the assistance of other countries.

In cases in which there is an existing tax treaty or TIEA, the model IGA generally uses the treaty or TIEA as the authority for the IGA's requirements and links its practices and procedures to those developed under the treaty or TIEA. If there is no existing treaty or TIEA, then the agreement creates its own practices and procedures based on FATCA's reporting requirements.", "Additionally, there are different versions of Model 1, depending on whether the agreement calls for the reciprocal exchange of information between the United States and the other country.

Department of Treasury", "paragraphs": ["The case in the United States is Crawford v. De partment of the Treasury . It was brought in 2015 by several U.S. citizens living abroad and Senator Rand Paul, who argue that IGAs are unconstitutional, among other claims. The plaintiffs characterize IGAs as sole executive agreements (in contrast to treaties submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent) that are only permissible if they \"fall within the President's independent constitutional authority to make international agreements.\" As such, the plaintiffs argue that the President is without such authority here because IGAs deal with tax issues and thus fall within the taxing power reserved to Congress under the Constitution. The plaintiffs further argue that IGAs are unconstitutional because they override the statutory provisions passed by Congress in FATCA. Their argument is that FATCA and IGAs are incompatible because (1) FATCA requires FFIs to report directly to the IRS, while IGAs allow FFIs to report to their home government; and (2) FATCA requires FFIs to get a waiver of local privacy laws from account holders, which IGAs circumvent by having foreign governments collect the information.", "In April 2016, a U.S. district court in Ohio dismissed the case after determining that the plaintiffs lacked standing. Standing is required by Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that federal courts may only decide actual cases or controversies.

The court in Crawford ruled that none of the plaintiffs had met all three requirements. For example, the court determined that injuries based on privacy concerns were insufficient because the reporting requirements were not \"an invasion of a legally protected interest,\" and that none of the plaintiffs had alleged a concrete, non-hypothetical injury because none had actually been subject to the 30% withholding or any other penalty.

Thus, FFIs and other entities would still be subject to FATCA, but would no longer be able to report information to their home country under the IGA or take advantage of other provisions in the IGAs.", "Possible implications for Congress of a ruling that IGAs are outside the President's authority could include passing legislation to authorize these types of agreements; potentially reexamining FATCA, particularly in light of compliance issues that might arise without the use of IGAs; or taking no action and letting the law continue without IGAs.

One possible outcome of such a ruling might be for the United States and Canada to attempt to find a mechanism that would be consistent with both countries' laws (e.g., amending the existing income tax treaty, which would require U.S. Senate approval).
