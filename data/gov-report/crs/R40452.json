The program provides payments to producers for crop revenue losses due to natural disaster or adverse weather incurred on or before September 30, 2011. Although program authority has expired, SURE is still making payments for losses that occurred prior to that date.", "SURE essentially compensates eligible producers for a portion of losses that are not eligible for an indemnity payment under a crop insurance policy. The program departs from both traditional disaster assistance and crop yield insurance by calculating and reimbursing losses using total crop revenue for the entire farm (i.e., summing revenue from all crops for an individual farmer). Under SURE, a farmer's revenue from all crops in all counties is compared with a guaranteed level that is computed mostly from expected or average yields and prices. As a result, the program considers the disaster's impact on a farmer's entire enterprise and not on just the crop(s) that were adversely affected. If the actual farm revenue (including farm program payments and insurance indemnities) is less than the farm's guaranteed level, the producer receives a payment, calculated as 60% of the difference between the two amounts. In contrast, if actual whole farm revenue does not fall below the guarantee, whereby losses for one crop are offset by revenue gains for another, no disaster payment is made. Payments are limited so that the guaranteed level cannot exceed 90% of expected farm income in the absence of a natural disaster. As of mid-December 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had issued $2.8 billion for 2008 and 2009 losses under the SURE program. Program signup for 2010 losses began November 14, 2011.", "USDA officials say that SURE is the most complex program USDA's Farm Service Agency has undertaken. It has faced a number of implementation challenges in terms of program administration, such as collecting and tabulating a significant amount of data for individual farmers, as well as crop price data that are not readily available. Another issue has been accounting for various insurance products when determining the farmer's guarantee level.", "Part of the motivation behind SURE was to provide a pre-designed program that farmers could incorporate in their risk management planning. Also, payments would be presumably more timely because legislation would already be in place when disaster strikes. However, disaster payments under SURE arrive well after the crop loss because some of the data needed to compute payment rates become available more than one year after harvest. Computing actual farm revenue requires season-average prices, which USDA publishes after the market year ends. Also, government commodity payments, which are also needed for the revenue calculation, can occur 1\u00bd years after the crop is harvested. Thus, SURE program payments have not been as timely as some farmers and policymakers would like.", "In the next farm bill debate, Congress will likely be interested in the effectiveness of SURE, and, if the program is continued, how it will be funded. SURE is one of 37 programs that does not have budgetary baseline. Major policy questions are likely to be (1) whether the SURE program can be modified to eliminate the call for ad-hoc crop disaster payments, and (2) how well this whole-farm approach helps manage farm-level risk.

In order to expedite program delivery and payments, USDA began accepting and processing applications in January 2010 using a manual process until software that incorporates all SURE program rules could be developed.

The \"farms\" used for commodity program payments by USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) are different tracts of land than units used for FSA's NAP program and the Risk Management Agency's crop insurance program.

The statutory language for the SURE calculation follows traditional yield-loss insurance in that a farmer selects a coverage level and price. However, some insurance products under the federal crop insurance program, such as adjusted gross revenue, do not fit within this structure because there are no yields or prices in the policy on which to base the guarantee. In this case, to determine a farmer's revenue guarantee (on a crop-by-crop basis), USDA uses a combination of data from the individual (planted acres and insurance coverage level elected by the producer) and substitute data (county average yields and NAP prices). For \"value loss\" crops such as ornamental nursery, which are also covered by non-yield-based insurance policies, SURE payment eligibility is determined by the inventory immediately before and after a disaster.

Based on CBO and USDA cost estimates, annual SURE payments over the four-year life of the program were expected to be less than the typical levels of ad-hoc disaster payments. However, relatively high first-year (2008) payments, plus the Administration's ad hoc disaster program for 2009 losses for certain crops, have raised the question of whether SURE, as it is currently designed, provides an acceptable (and cost-effective) level of disaster assistance. Moreover, SURE and the other disaster programs in the 2008 farm bill do not have \"baseline funding,\" which means that if Congress wants to reauthorize SURE, it will need to find either new funding or budget offsets to pay for it (see \" Funding SURE for Losses Beyond September 30, 2011 ,\" below). ", "A primary policy question is how well this whole-farm approach helps manage farm-level risk. Payment data from 2008 indicate that SURE payments have supplemented crop insurance indemnities as intended (see Figure 3 ), at least in certain parts of the country, including the Corn Belt and Great Plains. Nevertheless, some farmers have complained that the whole-farm approach typically does not result in disaster payments for diversified operations because aggregating revenue across a farmer's entire operation substantially reduces the likelihood of receiving assistance. For these farmers, the SURE whole farm approach runs counter to the historical custom of receiving disaster payments that are crop-specific. Also, producers in some regions such as the South say that SURE is less effective for them because they tend to purchase lower levels of crop insurance coverage, which limits the revenue guarantee under SURE. In contrast, where farmers have qualified for payments, the initial reaction has been generally favorable. For example, farmers in North Dakota are reportedly fairly satisfied with SURE, in combination with benefits provided under crop insurance.", "Another question is how much overlap exists in federal payments and farm risk reduction among the Average Crop Revenue Election program (ACRE), SURE disaster payments, and crop insurance indemnities. While it may be possible that the same price decline (resulting in revenue loss) may affect both ACRE and crop insurance indemnities, SURE payments account for these programs, thereby minimizing overlap with SURE."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Loss Trigger Differs Across Producers", "paragraphs": ["One outcome of the SURE program design is that the loss trigger differs across producers depending on whether or not they produce crops located in a secretarial-disaster-declared county (or a contiguous county).

Producers in all other counties must show a 50% yield loss. As a result, SURE may address the \"shallow loss\" problem only in certain counties.

The dichotomy raises concerns that the possibility of SURE payments depends too much on the designation process, and that the designation may or may not correspond with an individual farmer's disaster situation. In November 2010, USDA issued a proposed rule to modify the designation process to simplify and expedite it and to make other changes. ", "A related policy issue is that a disaster designation for a particular county can bring with it a \"lower bar\" (the 10% yield loss rather than the 50% yield loss) for a much larger amount of acreage, if farmers have substantial acreage outside of the disaster or adjacent county.

Putting the prices on the same level (by adjusting one or the other) would reduce additional payments inadvertently caused by program design.", "Also, some producers have relatively high Counter-Cyclical Program yields used by SURE because some factors such as irrigation pushed up yields in the 1980s (when those yields were determined).

For example, livestock death losses for individual producers immediately trigger Livestock Indemnity Program payments, while the weekly publication U.S. Drought Monitor is used to determine payments for grazing losses under the Livestock Forage Disaster Program. By its nature, disaster payments using a whole-farm approach like SURE can take more time to determine payment levels.

Because SURE is based on revenue (and not costs or margins), some farmers in this circumstance do not qualify for SURE payments.

Consequently, in order to take advantage of SURE, farmers might eliminate crops from their rotations.
