GI Bill benefits provide educational assistance payments to eligible veterans and servicemembers and their families enrolled in approved programs of education. The SAA role is intended to ensure that veterans and other GI Bill participants have access to a range of high-quality education and training programs at which to use their GI Bill benefits. In FY2017, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) is estimated to distribute over $14 billion in GI Bill benefits to over 1 million eligible participants.", "Statutory provisions provide for the establishment of SAAs and describe their role in administering GI Bill benefits. Each state is \"requested\" to create or designate a state department or agency as its SAA. The VA contracts (or enters into agreement) with each SAA annually to provide approval, oversight, training, and outreach activities by qualified personnel as specified in the contract to ensure the quality of programs of education and proper administration of GI Bill benefits. The VA oversees the processes for approving and reviewing approved programs of education, educating the entities and individuals involved in GI Bill claims processing, and increasing awareness among potential GI Bill participants. The VA and any other federal entity or individual is prohibited from exercising any supervision or control over SAAs except as specifically provided in statutory provisions. For example, 38 U.S.C. \u00a73674 requires the VA take into consideration an annual evaluation of each SAA's performance on its contractual standards when negotiating a new contract.", "One of the key SAA roles is to initially approve programs of education for GI Bill purposes. Each sponsoring facility (e.g., educational institutions and training establishments) must submit an application to its SAA. Approval is intended to ensure that each program of education and sponsoring facility meets all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, including proper benefit administration and program of education quality. The approval process and requirements vary depending on the program's educational objective (e.g., non-college degree or flight training) and existing government oversight. For example, some programs that are approved by other government programs or processes are \"deemed approved\" and require a less in-depth review. The remaining programs undergo more comprehensive approval processes that may include the SAA reviewing institutional policies, staff qualifications, and academic curriculum. The SAA may conduct a site visit. Once the SAA completes the initial approval review in accordance with the approval standards, the SAA issues an approval or disapproval letter to the facility. The VA maintains the compiled list of all approved programs of education.", "Another key SAA role is to conduct compliance surveys. Compliance surveys are designed to ensure that the facility and approved programs are in compliance with all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy provisions and the facility understands the provisions. Statutory provisions establish the number of institutions requiring annual compliance surveys. The VA conducts compliance surveys but also assigns some of the required compliance surveys to SAAs. During the onsite compliance survey visit, the SAA reviews student files to verify that GI Bill payments have been made properly, conducts student interviews, verifies institutional operations, and reviews additional documents and areas as outlined on the compliance survey checklist. Discrepancies uncovered during the compliance survey may be resolved immediately, may result in the creation of a GI Bill debt or payment, or may result in the suspension or disapproval of a program of education. The SAA may suspend a program of education from new enrollments for up to 60 days while the SAA provides assistance to help the facility resolve the issue. The SAA may disapprove the program of education such that no GI Bill payments may be made based on an individual's pursuit of the program of education."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA), previously named the Veterans Administration, has been providing veterans' educational assistance (GI Bill\u00ae) benefits since 1944.

In FY2017, the VA is estimated to distribute over $14 billion in GI Bill benefits to over 1 million eligible participants. ", "Since 1947, State Approving Agencies (SAAs) have been an important component in the administration of GI Bill benefits, along with the VA, educational institutions, and training establishments. SAAs are responsible for approving programs of education, conducting VA-assigned compliance visits, providing technical assistance, providing liaison assistance with related organizations and stakeholders and conducting outreach. The SAA role was originally intended to ascertain the quality of on-the-job training establishments and has now expanded to ensuring that veterans and other GI Bill participants have access to a range of high-quality education and training programs at which to use their GI Bill benefits.

The Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) had authority to approve programs that were outside the scope of state agency approval. In part, as a consequence of the large numbers of veterans using the GI Bill, newly created educational institutions, and possible abuses among on-the-job training providers, the state agencies were unable to establish adequate standards for the approval of programs of education. In addition, because the state agencies were unable to provide the resources necessary for approval and oversight activities, several well-publicized abuses occurred. Additionally, there was considerable variation in standards between states. As such, the state approving agencies (SAAs), as currently structured, were authorized as a means to provide consistency, guidance, and financial resources in the approval process from the federal government. ", "More recently, in response to publicized abuses of established educational institutions, the VA and Congress sought ways to improve the oversight of programs of education previously approved for GI Bill purposes. In addition, a 2007 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the VA coordinate with the Departments of Education and Labor to reduce duplicative approval activities and measure the spending, effectiveness, and performance of SAAs. Congress enacted the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-377 ) to, among other purposes, modify specific SAA responsibilities related to approval and oversight. Specifically, P.L. 111-377 was intended to provide additional resources and focus on program oversight (compliance surveys) in order to reduce \"the possible misuse of benefits and instances of fraud, misrepresentation, and abuse.\" The bill expected to accomplish this by reducing SAA approval activities (i.e., deeming some programs approved) and utilizing SAAs for program oversight.

The application contents differ depending on the type of program of education (e.g., licensing test, on-the-job training (OJT), etc.) (see Appendix for required content).", "There are a few practices that may direct a new program toward the initial approval process. First, a facility, such as one with approved programs of education, may initiate the approval process on its own by contacting its SAA. Alternatively, an individual who wants to use GI Bill benefits for a program of education offered by a facility that has never had a GI Bill approved program of education may alert the facility to the existence of GI Bill benefits so that the facility can contact its SAA and submit an application to have the program of education approved. If an individual applies to use GI Bill benefits for an unapproved program, the VA would send a \"Denial of Benefits\" letter, and the SAA would contact the facility in an attempt to encourage the submission of an application for approval, if appropriate. SAAs may receive new program applications daily. ", "Once the SAA or the VA completes the initial approval review in accordance with the program of education approval standards (see Appendix ), the SAA or VA issues an approval or disapproval letter to the facility naming the approved or disapproved programs of education and any specific requirements or limitations.

P.L. 111-377 granted the VA authority to utilize SAAs for compliance surveys and other oversight activities. SAAs assumed responsibility for VA-assigned compliance surveys in FY2012. The number of projected compliance surveys is established in each annual contract. To support the new responsibility, the VA and National Association of State Approving Agencies (NASAA) formed a joint Compliance Survey Redesign Work Group to improve the compliance survey process. NASAA is the voluntary organization of SAAs founded to coordinate their efforts. ", "Statutory provisions establish the nature and targeting of compliance surveys. Prior to passage of the Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 ( P.L. 114-315 ), the VA, with the assistance of SAAs as appropriate, was required to conduct annual compliance surveys of educational institutions enrolling at least 300 GI Bill or Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment program (VR&E) participants and institutions offering NCDs. The requirement was not contingent on whether programs of education are deemed approved or are approved by an SAA or the VA. The Secretary may waive the requirement based on an institution's demonstrated record of compliance. Statutory provisions also require one SAA or VA employee for each 40 compliance surveys. Some evidence suggests that the VA, with the assistance of SAAs, has insufficient resources to complete the requisite surveys. P.L. 114-315 changed the criteria for determining at which institutions to conduct annual compliance surveys and modified the nature of the survey. P.L. 114-315 requires annual compliance surveys at educational institutions and training establishments enrolling at least 20 GI Bill or VR&E participants. P.L. 114-315 further authorizes the Secretary, in consultation with SAAs, to revise the compliance survey parameters annually. ", "The VA determines the list of facilities to be reviewed for the year and assigns the reviews to either the VA or appropriate SAAs. On-site compliance surveys are preferable; however, some may be conducted remotely. Per statute, the compliance survey is intended to assure that each facility and each program of education meets all statutory requirements. VA policy indicates that the two primary purposes of compliance survey visits are", "to assist school or training establishment officials and veterans or potential GI Bill recipients in understanding the provisions and requirements of the law; and to verify and assure the propriety of VA educational benefit payments to veterans and other eligible persons.", "The policy of the VA is to establish annual priorities in order to conduct compliance surveys of higher risk programs, institutions, and establishments. For example, the FY2017 strategy will ensure compliance surveys of all IHLs with flight programs, and further prioritize private for-profit and nonaccredited institutions and federal on-the-job and federal non-registered apprenticeship establishments. The compliance survey follows procedures prescribed by the VA. The aspects reviewed and required standards are the same regardless of whether the program was deemed approved or approved by the VA or an SAA and regardless of whether the VA or SAA conducts the survey. ", "Besides selecting the facilities, the VA also determines the number of student files that will be reviewed at each facility during the compliance survey based on the GI Bill participant population. The scope of the review of student files and the number of files reviewed are the major differences between supervisory visits and compliance surveys. The SAAs review the VA database to select the requisite number of students and may select a representative sample that is not duplicative of prior year surveys. The recent certification history of each selected student's enrollment, entrance, reentrance, change in hours of credit or attendance, pursuit, and interruption and termination of attendance as recorded in the database are noted. The selected student names are provided to the facility's SCO when the compliance survey visit is scheduled by the VA or SAA and SCO. During the on-site visit, the SAA will compare the facility's student files to the students' VA enrollment and certification history to verify that GI Bill payments have been made properly and that the institution is following the approval standards and published policies. The facility's student files include, as appropriate, transcripts, prior credit evaluations, financial accounts of charges and refunds, courses taken, attendance records, circumstances for withdrawal, relevant VA forms, student aid received, academic progress, and other pertinent records.", "In addition to reviewing student records, compliance surveys also include student interviews (as applicable), various verifications, and a review of additional documents and areas outlined on the compliance survey checklist. The review may also include a classroom visit, if appropriate. As of FY2015, SAAs must also assess the number of complaints in the VA GI Bill Feedback System. The compliance survey will verify the SCO as named to the VA, the SCO's understanding of the job requirements, fund transfers, the school catalog, tuition and fees charges, relevant school policies, procedures for ensuring timely and accurate certifications, and other administrative actions. The areas of review on the checklist include, but are not limited to, establishing compliance with the 85-15 rule, independent study requirements, private pilot's license requirements, and nonaccredited school enrollment limitations. Some statutory standards such as those related to curriculum quality and faculty qualifications are not reflected on the compliance checklist.", "Finally, SCOs are given an opportunity to ask questions and address their problems/issues, and the SAA has the opportunity to provide training and technical assistance. Initial survey results, including discrepancies, are shared with the facility prior to the end of the visit, and any discrepancies that may be addressed easily are resolved immediately. ", "Following the compliance survey, the compliance survey report and any referrals are shared with the facility, SAA, and ELR. Referrals are discrepancies discovered during the review of student files that may create a student or school GI Bill debt or payment. Follow-up and corrective action will be initiated by the SAA if required.", "Although compliance surveys are more focused on proper administration and controls of federal funds than supervisory visits, there are concerns with their implementation. One concern suggested by the VA is that its capabilities in uncovering educational and financial noncompliance may not be strong. Another concern raised by the National Association of Veterans' Program Administrators (NAVPA), a professional organization of SCOs and their facilities, is that \"diverting [SAA] resources to [compliance surveys] has proven problematic, however, and leaves no one to fulfill the SAA's historic role of providing training and supervision to facilities on broader education issues.\" Compliance surveys have different foci compared to training and supervisory visits, but each serves an important purpose. The two approaches may also require different skill sets and training that are not currently optimized. In addition, NASAA has expressed concerns that many facilities are not reviewed regularly as it estimates that as of 2016 SAAs conduct compliance visits of approximately 15% of active institutions/establishments annually.

SAAs, or the VA acting in capacity of an SAA, may determine that the facility or program is not in compliance with the law or regulations during a compliance survey, supervisory visit, or other interaction. SAAs indicate that interactions other than compliance surveys are more likely to uncover compliance issues. The SAA may provide training and technical assistance to resolve the issue and then follow up to ensure compliance. Additionally, the SAA may suspend a program of education from new enrollments of GI Bill recipients for up to 60 days if it fails to meet any of the approval requirements. During the up to 60-day period, the SAA will provide assistance to help the facility resolve the issue and may provide outreach and technical assistance to GI Bill participants to mitigate any potential educational disruptions. If the institution/establishment fails to resolve the issue during the suspension, the SAA will disapprove the program(s) of education. Program disapproval affects GI Bill participants currently pursuing the program as well as prospective participants. Any suspension or disapproval by the SAA will be communicated through a registered or certified letter with return receipt to the facility and through written notice to the ELR. The ELR will review the action and supporting documentation to ensure the action is in accordance with statutory provisions.

Although statutory provisions do not require that the SAA permit an appeal, some SAAs allow facilities to appeal to their parent agency (e.g., a state department of education). Otherwise, the institution/establishment may write an informal letter to the SAA or its parent agency if it disagrees with the actions being taken by the SAA, and the SAA or parent agency may consider the letter. A testing organization may appeal a decision to the VA Education Service Director (or the VA Under Secretary of Benefits, if the VA disapproved the test). On occasion, the VA may reverse the SAA decision based on additional information. In addition, the facility may litigate against the SAA. For example, the California SAA was forced by court order to reverse its suspension of courses at ITT Educational Services, Inc. (ITT) in 2015.
