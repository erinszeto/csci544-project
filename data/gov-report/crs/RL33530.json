Milestones included the Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Declaration of Principles (DOP) of September 13, 1993, providing for Palestinian empowerment and some territorial control, the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty of October 26, 1994, and the Interim Self-Rule in the West Bank or Oslo II accord of September 28, 1995, which led to the formation of the Palestinian Authority (PA) to govern the West Bank and Gaza Strip. However, Israeli-Syrian negotiations were intermittent and difficult, and postponed indefinitely in 2000. Israeli-Lebanese negotiations also were unsuccessful, leading Israel to withdraw unilaterally from south Lebanon on May 24, 2000. President Clinton held a summit with Israeli and Palestinian leaders at Camp David on final status issues that July, but they did not produce an accord. A Palestinian uprising or intifadah began in September. On February 6, 2001, Ariel Sharon was elected Prime Minister of Israel, and rejected steps taken at Camp David and afterwards.", "On April 30, 2003, the United States, the U.N., European Union, and Russia (known as the \"Quartet\") presented a \"Road Map\" to Palestinian statehood. It has not been implemented. Israel unilaterally disengaged (withdrew) from the Gaza Strip and four small settlements in the West Bank in August 2005. On January 9, 2005, Mahmud Abbas had become President of the PA. The victory of Hamas, which Israel and the United States consider a terrorist group, in the January 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections complicated prospects for peace as the United States, Israel, and the Quartet would not deal with a Hamas-led government until it disavowed violence, recognized Israel, and accepted prior Israeli-Palestinian accords. President Abbas's dissolution of the Hamas-led government in response to the June 2007 Hamas forcible takeover of the Gaza Strip led to resumed international contacts with the PA. On November 27, at an international conference in Annapolis, MD, President Bush read a Joint Understanding in which Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert agreed to simultaneously resume bilateral negotiations on core issues and implement the Road Map. On May 21, 2008, Israel, Syria, and Turkey announced that Syria and Israel had begun indirect peace talks in Istanbul via Turkish mediators. Later in the year, Israeli and U.S. elections appeared to disrupt negotiations on all tracks and the end of the Israeli-Hamas cease-fire in December and the subsequent outbreak of violence in Gaza led to the official suspension of peace talks. President Obama has affirmed U.S. support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and named former Senator George Mitchell as his Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, but negotiations have not resumed.", "Congress is interested in issues related to Middle East peace because of its oversight role in the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, its support for Israel, and keen constituent interest. It is especially concerned about U.S. financial and other commitments to the parties, and the 111th Congress is engaged in these matters. Congress also has endorsed Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, although U.S. Administrations have consistently maintained that the fate of the city is the subject of final status negotiations.

He later said that Israel would \"revert to the policies of previous governments in relation to construction\" at the end of the ten months. Secretary Clinton said that the proposal \"helps move forward\" the peace process and that through \"good faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of a independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments and meet Israeli security requirements.\" ", "Special Middle East Envoy George Mitchell said that the Israeli step \"falls short of a full settlement freeze, but it is more than any Israeli government has done before\u2026\" He noted that \"the number of buildings under construction will decline since, as each new building is completed, there will be no new building started. So implementation of the moratorium could mean much less settlement construction than would occur if there is no moratorium.\" He also expressed a desire to get a \"resolution of the issue of borders, so that there will no longer be any question about settlement construction, so that Israelis will be able to build what they want in Israel, and the Palestinians will be able to build what they want in Palestine.\" The Palestinians criticized Israel for not freezing all settlement activity or including Jerusalem. President Abbas described it as \"insufficient\" and \"unacceptable.\"", "On December 28, Israel underscored that a \"unified\" Jerusalem is its capital and excluded from the freeze when it announced plans to build 692 news housing units in East Jerusalem. The White House Press Secretary responded, saying ", "The United States opposes new Israeli construction in East Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem is a permanent status issue that must be resolved by the parties through negotiations\u2026. Neither party should engage in efforts or take actions that could unilaterally preempt, or appear to preempt, negotiations. Rather, both parties should return to negotiations without preconditions as soon as possible\u2026. We believe that through good faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome that realizes the aspirations of both parties for Jerusalem, and safeguards its status for people around the world.", "In December, President Abbas pledged that, as long as he is in office, he \"will not allow anybody to start a new intifadah .\" At the same time, he called on the international community and on the United States to pressure the Israeli government. ", "The Obama Administration began 2010 with a renewed effort to restart negotiations. Media reports suggested that it was preparing \"letters of guarantee\" that would assure the Palestinians that the 1967 borders would form the basis of the negotiations and the Israelis that post-1967 demographic changes (some settlements) would be taken in to account. Secretary Clinton said that the Administration was working \"to take the steps needed to relaunch the negotiations as soon as possible and without preconditions.\" She again stated that a solution would reconcile \"the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders.\" Later, on January 8, she may have attempted to blur the 2009 U.S. focus on Israeli settlements, saying \"resolving borders resolves settlements, resolving Jerusalem resolves settlements\u2026.\"", "On January 6, Mitchell was interviewed on the Public Broadcasting System's Charlie Rose Show, and expressed hope for progress on three tracks: political negotiations, security, and Palestinian economic growth and institution building. (These tracks are identical to those suggested by Netanyahu in his March 31, 2009 address to the Knesset. ) Mitchell claimed that Netanyahu's 10-month moratorium is \"more significant than any action taken by any previous government of Israel for the 40 years that the settlement enterprise has existed.\" He stated that Israeli security and the establishment of a Palestinian state are \"mutually reinforcing\" in that \"Palestinians are not going to get a state until the people of Israel have a reasonable sense of sustainable security. The Israelis \u2026 are not going to get that reasonable sense of sustainable security until there is a Palestinian state.\" Mitchell also said that negotiations should last no more than two years and \"it can be done within that period of time\" or a shorter period of time.", "Mitchell also said that the United States is seeking a \"parallel process\" in which \"as the Israelis and Palestinians talk in negotiations, Israel, the Palestinians, and all the surrounding countries would meet to deal with regional issues, energy, water, trade, communications, transport\u2026.\" He seemed to discourage an Israeli-Hamas prisoner exchange because it \"will not build confidence in the Palestinian Authority because it will, in fact, be seen as a validation of Hamas's tactics, which is violent resistance.\" When Rose asked if the United States had any \"sticks,\" Mitchell responded, \"the United States can withhold support on loan guarantees to Israel.\" Some media outlets interpreted this as a threat; so the State Department later clarified that he was not signaling a course of action. Mitchell himself had added, \"we think the way to approach this is to try to persuade the parties what is in their self interests.\"", "On January 8, a Palestinian newspaper summarized Palestinian ideas about peace negotiations, reportedly formulated by Saeb Erekat, head of the PLO Negotiations Department and Umar Suleiman, Egypt's intelligence chief. First, the goal should be a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital based on the 1967 borders. This could include exchanges of land of similar value. Second, Israeli settlement activity, including natural growth and in Jerusalem, should stop completely for six months. Third, negotiations should resume from the point reached in December 2008 with former Israeli Prime Minister Olmert and include all final status issues. On January 12, President Abbas said for the first time that he might restart negotiations if Israel froze settlement expansions for \"a fixed period.\" He also said, \"We don't want (U.S.) guarantees. We want (the United States) to tell Israel to fully freeze settlements for a period of time and then we will resume negotiations.\"", "Prior to Mitchell's arrival in Israel, on January 20, Netanyahu asserted that in order \"to effectively stop the infiltration of rockets and other weaponry \u2026 will require an Israeli presence on the eastern side of the future state,\" i.e., in the Jordan Valley. An Abbas spokesman replied, \"We will not accept anything less than a completely sovereign Palestinian state on all the territories with its own borders, resources and airspace, and we will not accept any Israeli presence, either military or civilian, on our land.\" ", "Mitchell made his ninth visit to the region from January 21-25. The State Department issued a statement on January 27 that he had continued a \"two-pronged approach \u2026 (1) To encourage the parties to enter negotiations to reach an agreement on all permanent status issues; and (2) to help the Palestinians build the economy and institutions that will be necessary when a Palestinian state is established. The two objectives are mutually reinforcing. Each is essential. Neither can be attained without the other.\" Earlier, Netanyahu had said that Mitchell presented \"interesting ideas\" on how to restart negotiations. Reportedly, the ideas included confidence-building measures such as the withdrawal of Israel forces from more territory in the West Bank, release of prisoners, preliminary talks on a low level, and/or proximity talks, with Mitchell shuttling between Jerusalem and Ramallah to convey messages on core issues of borders, Jerusalem, security, and refugees. A Palestinian official said that Abbas did not favor resuming negotiations at any level before a complete cessation of settlement activity, including in east Jerusalem.", "After meeting the envoy, Netanyahu visited settlements. On January 24, at Etzyon, he proclaimed, \"This place will be an inseparable part of the state of Israel for eternity,\" and at Ma'ale Adumim, he affirmed, \"We are here, and we will stay here and build here as part of sovereign Jerusalem.\" On January 29, in Ari'el, he declared, \"Here is where our forefathers dwelled and here is where we will stay and build\u2026. Ari'el \u2026 will be an integral, inseparable part of the state of Israel in any future arrangement.\" While his statements appeared provocative, it has long been assumed that Israel would retain those large settlements in a final agreement in exchange for other land being given to the new Palestinian state.", "In a January interview with Time magazine, President Obama assessed the first year of his Administration's involvement in the Israel-Palestinian peace process. He said, \"This is as intractable problem as you get. Both sides \u2026 have found that the political environment, the nature of their coalitions or the divisions within their societies, were such that it was very hard for them to start engaging in a meaningful conversation. And I think that we overestimated our ability to persuade them to do so when their politics ran contrary to that\u2026. (I)f we had anticipated some of these problems \u2026 earlier, we might not have raised expectations as high.\"", "On January 28, President Abbas told Russian television that Jerusalem should not be divided and that there should be free passage for people of various faiths. He added that it must be made clear what belongs to the Palestinians and what belongs to Israel. Abbas also said that he could only recognize Israel as a Jewish state in the framework of a conclusive peace agreement that leads to the establishment of a Palestinian state. He could not resume negotiations as long as construction in West Bank settlements and East Jerusalem continues. \"If Israel says\u2026 that it will not accept the 1967 borders and that it is not prepared to discuss Jerusalem and the refugee situation, what is there to talk about?\" Abbas reported that the United States had asked Israel to make gestures to the Palestinians, including transferring additional territories in the West Bank to Palestinian control, halting Israeli military incursions, releasing prisoners, dismantling checkpoints and allowing building materials to enter the Gaza Strip.

It also led to a mass movement of Jewish citizens of Arab states to Israel. The 1967 war ended with Israel occupying territory of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. Egypt and Syria fought the 1973 war, in part, to regain their lands.

On April 14, Israel submitted 14 reservations on the Road Map. On April 30, the Quartet officially presented the Road Map. Abbas accepted it. On May 23, the Bush Administration stated that Israel had explained its concerns and that the United States shares the view \"that these are real concerns and will address them fully and seriously in the implementation of the Road Map,\" leading Sharon and his cabinet to accept \"steps defined\" in the Road Map \"with reservations\" on May 25. The next day, Sharon declared, \"to keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us and them,\" using the word occupation for the first time.", "On June 4, President Bush met Abbas and Sharon in Aqaba, Jordan. Abbas vowed to achieve the Palestinians' goals by peaceful means, while Sharon expressed understanding of \"the importance of territorial contiguity\" for a viable Palestinian state and promised to \"remove unauthorized outposts\" in the West Bank. Abbas said that he would use dialogue, not force, to convince Palestinian groups. On June 29, Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) suspended military operations against Israel for three months, while Fatah declared a six-month truce. Israel was not a party to the accord, but began withdrawing forces from Gaza. Abbas asked Sharon to release Palestinian prisoners, remove roadblocks, withdraw from more Palestinian cities, allow Arafat free movement, and end construction of a security barrier that Israeli is building in the West Bank. Israel demanded that the Palestinians dismantle terrorist infrastructures and act against terrorists. Neither fulfilled the other's request.", "On August 6, Israel released 339 prisoners. On August 19, a Hamas suicide bomber exploded in Jerusalem, killing 22, including 5 Americans, and injuring more than 130. Abbas cut contacts with Hamas and the PIJ, and unsuccessfully sought Arafat's support to act against terrorists. Israel suspended talks with the Palestinians, halted plans to transfer cities to their control, and resumed \"targeted killings\" of terrorist leaders, among other actions. On September 6, Abbas resigned because of what he charged was lack of support from Arafat, the United States, and Israel.", "On October 15, a bomb detonated under an official U.S. vehicle in Gaza, killing three U.S. security guards and wounding a fourth. Palestinian authorities arrested members of Popular Resistance Committees, who would be freed in April 2004.", "Sounds of discontent with government policy were heard in Israel, culminating in the signing of the Geneva Accord, a Draft Permanent Status Agreement by Israeli opposition politicians and prominent Palestinians on December 1. Perhaps partly to defuse these efforts, on December 18, Sharon declared that, \"to ensure a Jewish and democratic Israel,\" he would unilaterally disengage from the Palestinians by redeploying Israeli forces and relocating settlements in the Gaza Strip and intensifying construction of the security fence in the West Bank. On February 13, 2004, the White House said that an Israeli pullback \"could reduce friction,\" but that a final settlement \"must be achieved through negotiations.\" After an upsurge in violence, Israeli missiles killed Hamas leader Shaykh Ahmed Yassin on March 22.", "On April 14, President Bush and Sharon met and exchanged letters. The President welcomed Israel's plan to disengage from Gaza and restated the U.S. commitment to the Road Map. He noted the need to take into account changed \"realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers,\" (i.e., settlements), asserting \"it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949.\" The President stated that a solution to the refugee issue will be found by settling Palestinian refugees in a Palestinian state, \"rather than in Israel,\" thereby rejecting a \"right of return.\" He called for a Palestinian state that is \"viable, contiguous, sovereign, and independent.\" Sharon presented his disengagement plan as independent of but \"not inconsistent with the Road Map.\" He said that the \"temporary\" security fence that Israel is constructing in the West Bank would not prejudice final status issues including borders. A day before, he had identified five large West Bank settlements and an area in Hebron that Israel intends to retain and strengthen. Palestinians denounced the President's \"legitimization\" of settlements and prejudgment of final status. On April 18, Sharon's chief of staff Dov Weissglas gave National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice a written commitment to dismantle settlement outposts that Israel itself considers illegal. However, other outposts later sprang up and, as of 2010, Israel has not fulfilled this commitment.", "On June 6, 2004, Israel's cabinet approved a compromise disengagement plan whereby Israel would evacuate all 21 settlements in the Gaza Strip and 4 settlements in the northern West Bank. On June 30, the Israeli High Court of Justice upheld the government's right to build a security fence in the West Bank, but struck down some land confiscation orders for violating Palestinian rights and ordered the route to be changed. In subsequent rulings, the Israeli Court attempted to balance Israel's security needs and the humanitarian claims of Palestinians and sometimes required that the barrier be rerouted. On July 9, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued a non-binding, advisory opinion that the wall violates international law.", "On October 6, Weissglas claimed that disengagement was aimed at freezing the political process in order to \"prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state and a debate regarding refugees, borders, and Jerusalem.\"", "Yasir Arafat died on November 11.

On March 20, it was reported that Israel's defense minister had approved the building of 3,500 new housing units between the Ma'ale Adumim settlement and East Jerusalem, in the E-1 corridor. Critics charge that the construction would cut East Jerusalem off from Palestinian territory, impose a barrier between the northern and southern West Bank, and prevent a future contiguous Palestinian state. Secretary Rice asserted that the plan was \"at odds with American policy.\" On April 11, President Bush conveyed to Sharon his \"concern that Israel not undertake any activity that contravenes Road Map obligations or prejudices final status negotiations.\" Sharon responded, \"It is the position of Israel that the major Israeli population centers will remain in Israel's hands under any final status agreement,\" declared that Ma'ale Adumim is a major population center, and, therefore, Israel is interested in contiguity between it and Jerusalem.", "On May 26, President Bush met Abbas and said that \"changes to the 1949 armistice lines must be mutually agreed to.\" Bush reaffirmed, \"A viable two-state solution must ensure contiguity of the West Bank, and a state of scattered territories will not work. There must also be meaningful linkages between the West Bank and Gaza. This is the position of the United States today, it will be the position of the United States at the time of final status negotiations.\" He also said, \"The barrier being erected by Israel ... must be a security, rather than political, barrier.\" Abbas stated that the boundaries of a future state should be those of before the 1967 war and that \"there is no justification for the wall and it is illegitimate.\"", "Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Netanya on July 12, killing 5 and injuring more than 90.

Mofaz added that Israel would retain the Jordan Rift Valley to guarantee Israel's eastern border.", "Israel evacuated all settlements in the Gaza Strip and four small settlements in the northern West Bank between August 17 and August 23. On August 29, Sharon declared that there would be no further disengagements and that the next step must be negotiations under the Road Map. He noted that while large settlement blocs would remain in Israeli hands and linked territorially to Israel, not all West Bank settlements would remain. This would be decided in the final stage of negotiations.", "On September 27, Hamas claimed responsibility for kidnapping and killing an Israeli settler in the West Bank. Israel responded with air and artillery strikes, closure of charities linked to terror groups, mass arrests including likely Hamas candidates in Palestinian parliamentary elections, and targeted killings of terrorists. On October 20, President Bush pressed Abbas to \"confront the threat armed gangs pose to a genuinely democratic Palestine,\" but did not urge him to prevent Hamas from participating in parliamentary elections or to request that candidates renounce violence. Abbas said that they would be asked to renounce violence after election.", "On October 26, a PIJ suicide bomber killed 6 and wounded more than 20 in Hadera, on the Israeli coast. Sharon announced an offensive against terrorism. He ruled out talks with Abbas until Abbas takes \"serious action\" against armed groups.", "On November 14-15, Secretary Rice visited Israel and the PA. Sharon told her that Israel would not interfere if Hamas participated in the January 2006 Palestinian legislative elections, but warned that if an armed terrorist organization is a partner in the Palestinian administration it could lead to the end of the Road Map. Rice asserted that it would be easier to compel Hamas to disarm after the elections because the entire international community would then exert pressure. Rice vowed not to have contacts with an armed Hamas even if it were part of the Palestinian administration. On November 15, she announced that Israel and the PA had reached an Agreement on Movement and Access from the Gaza Strip. After PIJ perpetrated another suicide bombing in Netanya on December 5, Israel did not hold scheduled talks with the PA about West Bank-Gaza bus convoys foreseen in the agreement, which was not implemented.", "After Hamas's victories in December 2005 Palestinian municipal elections, speculation increased about possible effects on the peace process if Hamas were similarly successful in January 25, 2006, parliamentary elections.

Haniyah said that Hamas would not object to Abbas negotiating with Israel.

Mitchell said that U.S. policy on a two-state solution \"would have a Palestinian state living in peace along the Jewish state of Israel.\" Palestinians contend that recognition of Israel as a Jewish state would negate Palestinian refugees' \"right of return\" and be detrimental to the status of Israel's Arab citizens. On April 27, President Abbas said, \"It's not my job to give a description to the state.

The political track means the resumption of negotiations without delay and without preconditions. The security track means continued cooperation with the U.S. program to strengthen the Palestinian security apparatus. Finally, the economic track would lead to the removal of obstacles to the advancement of the Palestinian economy.

First, however, he said that the Palestinians must publicly recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people. This is because, he maintained, the root cause of the conflict is the refusal to recognize that right, and not Israel's presence in Judea and Samaria (as Israelis refer to the West Bank) and the Gaza Strip. The Prime Minister claimed that a solution would be based on the establishment of a demilitarized Palestinian state\u2014without an army, without control of its air space, and with effective measures to prevent weapons from being smuggled into its territory\u2014and he asked for international guarantees of this principle. He also declared that Jerusalem must remain undivided as the capital of Israel, and that the Palestinian refugee problem must be solved outside of Israel, thereby rejecting a \"right of return.\" Netanyahu insisted that \"the claim that territorial withdrawals will bring peace with the Palestinians ... simply does not square with the facts.\" He stated that he would not build new settlements or confiscate land for that purpose, but rejected a settlement freeze, insisting that settlers must be allowed to have \"normal lives.\" At the same time, Netanyahu called for the immediate resumption of peace talks without preconditions. He later summarized five principles to provide \"clear foundations for a successful completion of peace talks,\" but said they are not preconditions for those talks. They are recognition of the nation-state of the Jewish people, the problem of the refugees solved outside the State of Israel, effective demilitarization of the Palestinian state, the peace treaty must end the conflict, and be guaranteed by the international community led by the United States.", "President Obama welcomed Netanyahu's endorsement of the goal of a Palestinian state, saw \"some positive movement\" in the speech, and said that Netanyahu's conditions were \"what negotiations are supposed to be about.\" He added, \"What we are seeing is at least the possibility we can restart serious talks. Special Envoy Mitchell stated that since both Israel and the Palestinians are now both on the record in support of a two-state solution, \"There now is a common objective, which was not the case before the speech was made.\" However, Palestinian negotiator Erekat charged that Netanyahu \"systematically took nearly every permanent status issue off the table,\" referring to borders, Jerusalem, settlements, refugees, and resources. Egyptian President Mubarak said that Israel's demand that Palestinians recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people \"scuttles changes for peace.... You won't find anyone to answer that call in Egypt or in any other place\" in the region. Later, Hamas Political Bureau Chief Mish'al described Netanyahu's offer of a demilitarized state as \"a big prison, not a country fit for a great people....The minimum we accept is a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, full sovereignty, removal of settlements, and the refugees' right of return.\" Mish'al concluded that he saw no alternative to continued armed struggle. President Abbas would later reiterate his demand that Israel recognize the principle of a two-state solution and halt all settlement activities before negotiations on final status issues, including Jerusalem.", "On July 1, Senator Mitchell met Israeli Defense Minister Barak in New York. Their joint statement did not restate the U.S. demand for a freeze on Israeli settlement activity or provide an Israeli response. Barak told the New York Times , \"For us, it is very important that the Palestinians commit to seeking an end to the conflict and a finality of any claims. We should not isolate this issue of settlements and make it the most important one.\" He said that Israel was eager for a regional agreement that would lead to a state for the Palestinians and security for Israel. On July 6, Barak told Mitchell that Israel is committed to evacuating 23 illegal settlement outposts within weeks or months. (As of January 2010, it had not occurred.)", "Israel reportedly wants to link agreements to evacuate illegal outposts and a carefully defined, short-term settlement freeze to Arab moves toward normalization. The Obama Administration has worked to fulfill this request.

The Palestinians have the responsibility to improve and extend positive actions already taken on security, to act forcefully against incitement and to refrain from any action that would make meaningful negotiations less likely. And Arab states have a responsibility to support the Palestinian Authority with words and deeds, to take steps to improve relations with Israel, and to prepare their publics to embrace peace and accept Israel's place in the region. ", "Mitchell also reported that he is urging Arab leaders \"to take steps towards normalization as gestures of their own to demonstrate that everyone in the region shares the vision of comprehensive peace that we share.\" He said that Washington is not asking any Arab government to normalize ties immediately. ", "The Arab League Secretary General responded, \"There will be no Arab steps before Israel stops its policy of settlement building.\" On July 31, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal stated, \"The question is not what the Arab world will offer. The question really is: what will Israel give in exchange for this comprehensive offer (referring to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative).\" \"Incrementalism and the step-by-step approach have not, and we believe will not achieve peace. Temporary security, confidence-building measures, will also not bring peace.\" He called for a comprehensive approach that \"defines the final outcome at the outset and launches into negotiations over final status issues: borders, Jerusalem, water, refugees, and security.\" Saudi officials maintain that normalization should follow resolution of the major issues of the conflict and Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and Sheba'a Farms in Lebanon. Further, they say that gestures or \"concessions\" in return for a partial withdrawal would reward Israel for the return of land that does not belong to it. ", "The Administration is reaching out to Arab states which previously had low-level relations with Israel and reportedly requested Oman, Qatar, Morocco, and Tunisia to reopen their commercial interest offices in Israel and the Gulf States to permit Israeli commercial airliners' flyovers. President Obama sent a letter to Moroccan King Mohammed VI, asking him to \"be a leader in bridging gaps between Israel and the Arab world.\" Although none has responded, the Administration continued to favor this approach. On August 10, the Deputy State Department spokesman said, \"confidence-building measures are a critical element of getting the parties to the next step, which is negotiations.\" On August 18, President Mubarak told President Obama that the Arabs are unwilling to make gestures until Israel does something they believe merits such reciprocity, and a temporary settlement freeze would not suffice.", "The Netanyahu government says that it is proceeding with its \"bottom up\" approach of working to improve the living conditions for Palestinians in the West Bank as a foundation for future peace. To that end, it reports removing roadblocks, check points, and dirt barriers and expanding the hours that the Allenby Bridge crossing (between the West Bank and Jordan) is open for commercial goods. Abbas charged that Netanyahu is seeking \"to divert the world's attention by easing economic restrictions on the Palestinians as a substitute for political rights.\"", "In a speech to the Fatah General Congress on August 4, 2009, President Abbas reaffirmed that the Palestinians' main aim is the establishment of an independent state and solving all issues, especially refugees and settlements. He declared, \"Although peace is our choice, we reserve the right to resistance, legitimate under international law.\" The Fatah Congress adopted a political program affirming \"the continuation of the negotiations without achieving real progress within a defined time frame endangers our rights and becomes futile because it enables Israel to use the negotiations as a cover for continuing its settlement activity and entrenching the occupation.\" Its 11 principles for proceeding include:", "Linking negotiations to real progress on the ground, specifically a complete halt to settlement activity, especially in Jerusalem. In addition, Israel must stop incursions, lift the siege of Gaza, remove barriers in the West Bank, and withdraw to the borders of September 28, 2000 (before the outbreak of the second intifadah or uprising); Negotiations based on U.N. resolutions and the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative; Setting a clear agenda and a time cap for negotiations; Rejecting postponement of negotiations on any final status issue, particularly Jerusalem and refugees; Rejecting a state with temporary borders; Refusing to recognize Israel as a \"Jewish state\" in order to protect the rights of refugees and of Israeli Arabs; Insisting on international participation in negotiations and on a mechanism for binding arbitration of impasses; Insisting on international monitoring and peace-keeping to guarantee implementation of an agreement; Holding a referendum on a peace agreement. The program refers ambiguously to \"popular struggle,\" and does not explicitly endorse armed resistance. At the first meeting of the new Fatah Central Committee on August 6, Abbas stated that negotiations would only resume if Israel halted \"all forms of settlement activity without exception in Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied territories\" and he welcomed President Obama's efforts on this matter. On August 17, he told the PA cabinet, \"The main and the only path is the path of peace and negotiations. We don't have any other path and we do not wish to use any other path.\" ", "Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad announced a Palestine Document: Ending the Occupation, Establishing the State on August 25.

The State Department reported simply that they had \"made good progress\" and had \"agreed on the importance of restarting negotiations.\" The State Department signaled flexibility on Israeli settlements on August 27, when a spokesman said, \"We put forward our ideas ... about what it will take for negotiations to be restarted, but ultimately it'll be up to the parties themselves, with our help, to determine whether that threshold has been met.... Ultimately, this is not a process by which the United States will impose conditions\u2026..\"", "On September 6, Israeli Defense Minister Barak approved the construction of 455 pre-planned housing units, most to be built in major West Bank settlement blocs. Israel also plans to complete an additional 2,500 units under construction. Barak said that the action was part of a dialogue with the United States and was aimed at creating the foundation for an agreement that will include the suspension of construction in the West Bank. Most of the approvals were reapprovals of plans advanced during the prior Israeli government and the move was generally depicted as an attempt to placate domestic opponents in advance of a temporary freeze on settlement activity. Netanyahu later said that he was trying to balance the will to make a gesture to promote negotiations and \"the need to enable normal living for the residents of Judea and Samaria.\" Furthermore, he declared \"Jerusalem is not a settlement and construction will go on as planned.\" The White House regretted Israel's decision, saying \"The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement expansion, and we urge that it stop. We are working to create a climate in which negotiations can take place, and such actions make it harder to create such a climate.\" ", "President Obama, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and President Abbas met on September 22 on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly opening session, even though the two sides had not wavered in their views. The Palestinians argued that there was no point in starting negotiations without a settlement freeze and unless Israel agreed to negotiate on Jerusalem and refugees, while Netanyahu would not compromise on settlements and borders before negotiations. President Obama stated, \"Permanent negotiation must begin, and begin soon.\" He called on the Palestinians to build on progress in halting terrorism and to do more to stop incitement. He praised Israel's actions to improve the Palestinians' freedom of movement, and called on it to move beyond discussions of restraining settlement construction to action. Palestinians noted his use of the word \"restrain\" instead of \"freeze.\" ", "President Obama told the General Assembly that he would continue to seek a just and lasting peace between Israel, Palestine, and the Arab world. He said that he would continue to call on the Palestinians to end incitement against Israel and to emphasize that \"America does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.\" He declared, \"the time has come to re-launch negotiations without preconditions that address the permanent status issues: security for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem.

Secretary Clinton described \"what the prime minister has offered in specifics of a restraint on policy of settlements \u2026 no new starts, for example, is unprecedented (italics added) in the context of prior negotiations. It's also the fact that for 40 years, presidents of both parties have questioned the legitimacy of settlements\u2026.\" The Palestinians rejected Netanyahu's proposal and, after they and Arab governments expressed disappointment with her remarks, the Secretary conceded that \"it is nowhere near enough\" and reiterated that \"the United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements\" and wanted more from Netanyahu.

He stated that neither party should unilaterally pre-empt negotiations, and that the status of Jerusalem is an issue that \"must be resolved through negotiations.\" He added, \"The U.S. also objects to other Israeli practices in Jerusalem related to housing , including the continuing pattern of evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Israel-Syria", "paragraphs": ["Syria seeks to regain sovereignty over the Golan Heights, 450 square miles of land along the border that Israel seized in 1967.

In 1991, Syria referred to its goal in the peace conference as an end to the state of belligerency, not a peace treaty, preferred a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, and rejected separate agreements between Israel and Arab states. Israel emphasized peace, defined as open borders, diplomatic, cultural, and commercial relations, security, and access to water resources.", "In 1992, Israel agreed that U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 (after the 1967 war) applies to all fronts, meaning that \"land for peace\" includes the Golan. Syria submitted a draft declaration of principles, reportedly referring to a \"peace agreement,\" not simply an end to belligerency. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin accepted an undefined withdrawal on the Golan, pending Syria's definition of \"peace.\" On September 23, 1992, the Syrian Foreign Minister promised \"total peace in exchange for total withdrawal.\" Israel offered \"withdrawal.\" In 1993, Syrian President Hafez al Asad announced interest in peace and suggested that bilateral tracks might progress at different speeds.

Asad again told President Clinton on October 27 that he was committed to normal peaceful relations in return for full withdrawal. Asad never expressed his ideas publicly, leaving it to Clinton to convey them.", "On May 24, 1994, Israel and Syria announced terms of reference for military talks under U.S. auspices. Syria reportedly conceded that demilitarized and thinned-out zones may take topographical features into account and be unequal, if security arrangements were equal. Israel offered Syria an early-warning ground station in northern Israel in exchange for Israeli stations on the Golan Heights, but Syria insisted instead on aerial surveillance only and that each country monitor the other from its own territory and receive U.S. satellite photographs. It was proposed that Syria demilitarize 6 miles for every 3.6 miles Israel demilitarizes. Rabin insisted that Israeli troops stay on the Golan after its return to Syria. Syria said that this would infringe on its sovereignty, but Syrian government-controlled media accepted international or friendly forces in the stations. Talks resumed at the Wye Plantation in Maryland in December 1995, but were suspended when Israeli negotiators went home after terrorist attacks in February/March 1996.", "A new Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for negotiations, but said that the Golan is essential to Israel's security and water needs and that retaining Israeli sovereignty over the Golan would be the basis for an arrangement with Syria. Asad would not agree to talks unless Israel honored prior understandings, claiming that Rabin had promised total withdrawal to the June 4, 1967-border, which gives Syria access to the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee (also known as Lake Tiberias or Lake Kinneret). That border differs from the international border of 1923 and the armistice line of 1949, which Damascus views as the results of colonialist or imperialist decisions. Israeli negotiators say that Rabin had suggested possible full withdrawal if Syria met Israel's security and normalization needs, which Syria did not do. An Israeli law passed on January 26, 1999, requires a 61-member majority in the Knesset (parliament) and a national referendum to approve the return of any part of the Golan Heights. However, holding a referendum would depend on a passage of a Basic Law for Public Referenda, which has not been accomplished. (In July 2009, the Knesset began considering a referendum law, with the support of Prime Minister Netanyahu. In November, it approved the bill, but additional votes are required before it becomes law.)", "In June 1999, Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak and Asad exchanged compliments via a British writer. Israel and Syria later agreed to restart talks from \"the point where they left off,\" with each side defining the point to its satisfaction. Barak and the Syrian Foreign Minister met in Washington on December 15-16, 1999, and in Shepherdstown, WV, from January 3-10, 2000. President Clinton intervened. On January 7, a reported U.S. summary revealed Israeli success in delaying discussion of borders and winning concessions on normal relations and an early-warning station. Reportedly because of Syrian anger over this leak, talks scheduled to resume on January 19, 2000 were \"postponed indefinitely.\"", "On March 26, President Clinton met Asad in Geneva. A White House spokesman reported \"significant differences remain\" and that it would not be productive for talks to resume. Barak indicated that disagreements centered on Israel's reluctance to withdraw to the June 1967 border and cede access to the Sea of Galilee, on security arrangements, and on the early-warning station. Syria agreed that the border/Sea issue had been the main obstacle. Asad died on June 10; his son, Bashar, succeeded him. Ariel Sharon became Prime Minister of Israel in February 2001 and vowed to retain the Golan. In a December 1 New York Times interview, Bashar al Asad said that he was ready to resume negotiations from where they broke off. Sharon responded that Syria first must stop supporting Hezbollah and Palestinian terror organizations.", "On August 29, 2005, Sharon said that it was not the time to begin negotiations with Syria because it is collaborating with Iran, building up Hezbollah, and maintaining Palestinian terrorist organizations' headquarters in Damascus from which terrorist attacks against Israel are ordered.

On July 3, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al Muallem denied that Mish'al had a role in the attack and said that Syria would never force him to leave the country.", "In a speech on August 15 to mark the end of the war in Lebanon, President Asad declared that the peace process had failed since its inception and that he did not expect peace in the near future.

The priority, he said, must be liberation.", "Responding to speculation about reopening peace talks with Syria, Israeli Prime Minister Olmert said on August 21 that Syria must stop supporting terrorist organizations before negotiations resume. In September, he declared, \"As long as I am prime minister, the Golan Heights will remain in our hands because it is an integral part of the State of Israel.\" He also indicated that he did not want to differ from the Bush Administration, which viewed Syria as a supporter of terror that should not be rewarded. On November 28, U.S. National Security Advisor Hadley concurred that as long as Syria is \"a supporter of terror, is both provisioning and supporting Hezbollah and facilitating Iran in its efforts to support Hezbollah, and is supporting Hamas,\" then it is \"not on the agenda to bring peace and security to the region.\" Hadley agreed that you cannot talk about negotiating with that Syria.", "On December 6, the Iraq Study Group released a report that included recommendations for changing U.S. policy toward the Arab-Israeli conflict because \"Iraq cannot be addressed effectively in isolation from other major regional issues.\" It stated that the United States will not be able to achieve its goals in the Middle East unless it has a \"renewed and sustained commitment\" to a comprehensive, negotiated peace on all fronts, including \"direct talks with, by, and between Israel, Lebanon, Palestinians (those who accept Israel's right to exist), and particularly Syria....\" The report recommended that Israel return the Golan Heights, with a U.S. security guarantee that could include an international force on the border, including U.S. troops if requested by both parties, in exchange for Syria's taking actions regarding Lebanon and Palestinian groups.

Their statements deepened a debate in Israel over Syria's intentions. Olmert was skeptical of Asad's motives and demanded that Syria first end support for Hamas and Hezbollah and sever ties with Iran.

U.S. officials said that the meeting focused exclusively on Iraq. Some Israelis asked why they should not have contacts with Syrians if U.S. officials could do so. On June 8, Israeli officials confirmed that Israel had sent messages to Syria signaling willingness to engage in talks based on the principle of land for peace and attempting to discern whether Damascus might be willing to gradually end its relations with Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas in exchange.", "In a July 10 interview, Olmert said that he was willing to discuss peace with Asad, but complained that the Syrian only wants negotiations to be conducted via Americans, who do not want to talk to Asad. On July 17, Asad called on Israel to make an \"unambiguous and official announcement\" about its desire for peace and \"offer guarantees about the return of the land in full,\" opening \"channels via a third party, but not direct negotiations.\" This, he said, would lead to direct talks in the presence of an \"honest broker.\" Those talks would be on security arrangements and relations, and not land.

On September 12, a New York Times report alleged that the target may have been a nuclear weapons installation under construction with North Korean-supplied materials. Syrian and North Korean officials denied this allegation and, on October 1, President Asad claimed that an unoccupied military compound had been hit. On October 25, the International Institute for Science and International Security released satellite photos showing that a suspected reactor building had been razed and the site scraped, raising suspicions about its purpose. Syria has not retaliated for the air raid. On January 8, 2008, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed El Baradei initially told a pan-Arab newspaper that, \"Based on satellite photographs, experts believe it is unlikely that the targeted construction was a nuclear facility.\" On January 12, 2008, it was reported that new satellite photos show construction at the site resembling the former building, which would cover the remains of the old one and possibly conceal its past. Syria did not allow inspectors to visit the site until May. In November, the IAEA reported that it had features resembling a reactor and finding traces of uranium amid the ruins, but did not come to any conclusions. On February 24, 2009, a Syrian scientist told the IAEA that the site has been converted into a military installation for firing missiles. Syria has not allowed any further IAEA visits.

On October 1, President Asad responded that his government would not attend unless the Golan Heights were discussed. Syria's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs attended the conference and explained that his presence resulted from the inclusion of the return of the Golan on the agenda.

There were reports said that Olmert had first discussed the possibility of mediation with Erdogan in Turkey in February 2007. Asad also asserted that there would be no direct negotiations, only those through Turkey. He maintained that direct talks require a U.S. sponsor and that Syria might discuss them \"with the next U.S. administration because this one has no vision or a will for the peace process.\" U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey has said that neither party has formally requested the United States to become directly involved. \"If Syria and Israel came to us, we'd certainly consider the request.\"", "On May 21, Israel, Syria, and Turkey simultaneously announced that Israel and Syria had indeed launched peace talks mediated by Turkey.

Referring to Israel's demands concerning Syria's relations with Iran and Hezbollah, Asad asserted, \"We do not accept the imposition of conditions on us that are linked to countries that have nothing to do with peace....\" On July 7, Asad told the French newspaper Le Figaro that he would not begin direct talks with Israel while President Bush was in office.", "On September 4, President Asad disclosed that his representatives had transmitted proposals or principles for peace to serve as a basis for direct talks with Israel to Turkish mediators, but would wait for Israel's response before holding direct talks. He repeated that direct talks also await a new U.S. Administration and stressed that \"Syria has no interest in relinquishing its ties with Hezbollah.\" He added that future negotiations depend on the next Israeli prime minister's commitment to pursuing peace.

Israeli officials held the Lebanese government responsible for any firing done from its territory and Israeli forces responded with artillery fire against the Lebanese village from which the rockets were fired and by scrambling fighter jets across the border. There were no reports of injuries on either side. It was the first such incident since February. A group calling itself the Ziad al Jarrah division of the Abdallah Azzam Brigades later claimed responsibility on a website used by supporters of Al Qaeda. (Al Jarrah was one of the 9/11 hijackers and Azzam was close to Osama bin Laden.) The claim could not be verified. Israel reportedly believes that the perpetrators are a Palestinian-Sunni group with links to global jihadists backed by Al Qaeda.
