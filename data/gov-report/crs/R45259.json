It is important for both domestic and agricultural water needs, among other uses. Nearly half of the nation's population uses groundwater to meet daily needs; in 2015, about 149 million people (46% of the nation's population) relied on groundwater for their domestic indoor and outdoor water supply. The greatest volume of groundwater used every day is for agriculture, specifically for irrigation. In 2015, irrigation accounted for 69% of the total fresh groundwater withdrawals in the United States. For that year, California pumped the most groundwater for irrigation, followed by Arkansas, Nebraska, Idaho, Texas, and Kansas, in that order. Groundwater also is used as a supply for mining, oil and gas development, industrial processes, livestock, and thermoelectric power, among other uses.", "Congress generally has deferred management of U.S. groundwater resources to the states, and there is little indication that this practice will change. For example, several bills introduced in the 115th Congress contain provisions that would direct that the federal government recognizes that aspects of groundwater, such as the connection between surface water and groundwater, be consistent with state water laws (surface water includes streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, and is not groundwater or atmospheric water, such as rain or snow). Those same bills also would prohibit the federal government from requiring the transfer of water rights to the United States or obtaining a water right in the name of the United States as a condition for receiving, renewing, amending, or extending \"any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement.\" In addition, these bills contain language asserting that the legislation would not alter certain reserved rights associated with federal and tribal lands.", "Congress, various states, and other stakeholders recently have focused on the potential for using surface water to recharge aquifers and the ability to recover stored groundwater when needed. Some see aquifer recharge, storage, and recovery as a replacement or complement to surface water reservoirs, and there is interest in how federal agencies can support these efforts. In the congressional context, there is interest in the potential for federal efforts to facilitate state, local, and private groundwater management efforts (e.g., management of federal reservoir releases to allow for groundwater recharge by local utilities). The two primary federal water resources agencies are the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). No significant federal restrictions apply to Reclamation's authorities to deliver water for purposes of aquifer recharge, storage, and recovery. USACE authorities also do not contain restrictions on the nonfederal use for groundwater recharge of water stored or released from USACE reservoirs. Both agencies acknowledge that some state restrictions affect the use of the delivered or stored waters for groundwater activities. Some legislative proposals would provide the agencies with additional directives and mechanisms regarding their authority to support nonfederal groundwater recharge.", "Other federal agencies support activities that inform groundwater management. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey monitors and reports groundwater conditions across the country, develops groundwater models and software tools for characterizing aquifers, and provides long- and short-term forecasts of changing groundwater conditions as part of local and regional groundwater studies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also make observations and collect data that are relevant to groundwater monitoring and assessment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture collects groundwater data related to irrigation.", "Long-term changes to the climate affecting the United States, particularly rising temperatures and changes in the patterns, quantities, and type of precipitation (i.e., rain versus snow), could affect the availability of groundwater in the future.

Managing groundwater resources largely has been the purview of states rather than the federal government. How each state manages its groundwater resources differs and depends on a mix of common law emerging from the 19 th century, state law, court decisions, water settlements, and, to a lesser extent, federal law. The federal role in managing groundwater includes activities under federal trust responsibilities to Indian tribes and reservations. It also includes management responsibilities for certain federal reservations if the purposes of those reservations require water, such as some national monuments, national forests, military bases, and other federal land holdings.

Strictly speaking, an aquifer is sufficiently permeable (i.e., groundwater can move readily through the interconnected pores) to transmit economic quantities of water to wells or springs. In other words, if a farmer drills a well into a water-bearing layer of rock or sediments (sometimes called a formation ) and can pump sufficient quantities of groundwater to irrigate crops, water livestock, or use for drinking water and washing, then that formation can be considered an aquifer. If the same farmer drilled a well but could not pump enough water to satisfy any needs, then the formation would not be considered an aquifer."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Types of Aquifers", "paragraphs": ["There are two principal types of aquifers: unconfined and confined. An unconfined aquifer is one in which the water table moves up and down freely without an overlying confining layer (see Figure 2 ). ", "A confined aquifer , in contrast, is an aquifer overlain (and sometimes underlain) by an impermeable or confining layer that the water does not freely move above. The confining beds cause the aquifer to be under pressure. As a result, when a well penetrates a confined aquifer, the water will rise above the top of the aquifer, sometimes all the way to the land surface (the latter case is referred to as an artesian aquifer ), as shown in Figure 3 . ", "The distinction between unconfined and confined aquifers is important for this discussion, as the technique of groundwater recharge, storage, and recovery differs depending on what kind of aquifer is involved. Because a confining layer or layers separates a confined aquifer from surface water bodies, the degree of connection between surface water and groundwater is not as direct or distinct as it is for unconfined aquifers. Groundwater recharge can occur naturally in confined and unconfined aquifers as water moves downward from the land surface into the aquifer from rain and melting snow, lakes, river, and streams. For unconfined aquifers, other sources of recharge water can include built impoundments, such as reservoirs; unlined irrigation ditches and canals; and applied irrigation water not consumed by crops. In a system of managed artificial recharge , water can be added deliberately to a confined or unconfined aquifer by using an injection well; by spreading water across the land surface, where it can trickle down into an unconfined aquifer; or by building an impoundment to temporarily store water and allow it to leak through the bottom down to an unconfined aquifer. ", "The distinction between an unconfined and a confined aquifer also is important for understanding the connection between surface water and groundwater. In Figure 3 , the confined aquifer is separated from the river by a confining layer, so that changes in river flow will not directly affect groundwater in the confined aquifer and flow from the artesian wells will not directly affect flow in the river. In Figure 4 , by contrast, the unconfined aquifer is connected directly to the stream. Under natural conditions, the groundwater will flow toward and feed the stream (top panel) because the slope of the water table is toward the top of the stream level. However, sometimes when aquifers are subject to excessive pumping\u2014during drought conditions, for example, or because of a lack of surface water availability\u2014they are said to be under stress. Under stressed conditions (bottom panel of Figure 4 ), pumping from a well will cause the water table to slope away from the top of the stream. In that case, the water in the stream will leak through the stream bottom and flow into the aquifer, toward the pumping well. ", "Consistently stressed conditions can have dramatic long-term effects on groundwater. If pumping continues in excess of recharge, increasing stress on the aquifer, the water table may drop tens to hundreds of feet ( Figure 5 ). This situation has occurred in many regions of the United States, including the Ogallala aquifer (also called the High Plains aquifer) in the Midwest and in California's Central Valley. In the Central Valley, historical levels of pumping caused the water table to drop so far in some areas that it caused the land surface to drop, or subside, nearly 30 feet ( Figure 6 ).

In addition, if demand for water supplies increases and additional surface water is not available, consumers may turn to groundwater. Along the coastline, groundwater extraction and the lowering of the water table sometimes have resulted in saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. Groundwater recharge may be used in those cases to replenish the aquifer and create a freshwater barrier to prevent seawater encroachment. Groundwater recharge, storage, and recovery also may be part of a conjunctive water management strategy in which both surface and groundwater are used, recharging groundwater in times of surface water surplus and extracting groundwater when surface water is in short supply. ", "Typically, groundwater recharge, storage, and recovery involves either injecting water into the aquifer from a well or allowing water to recharge from an impoundment (e.g., a pond) or a spreading basin (water is spread on the ground to percolate down to the aquifer). The water is stored in the aquifer until it is recovered by a pumping well for freshwater supply.

However, the amount of natural recharge is just one variable (albeit an important one) influencing groundwater supply\u2014its amount and availability. In some important aquifers, such as the Central Valley aquifer in California, the largest portion of recharge comes from irrigation return flow: excess water applied to the crops that is not lost to evapotranspiration or runoff. Changes in irrigation practices and technology could significantly alter irrigation return flow in the Central Valley. For example, more efficient irrigation would use less water for the same yield yet conversely would contribute less return flow as recharge to the aquifer.

Two broad review studies published in 2016 and 2017 are summarized below. ", "One study (by Meixner et al., 2016) synthesized the results of several other studies in an attempt to gauge the impacts of future climate change on the western United States (states west of the 100 th meridian). The study focused at the scale of major aquifers (specifically, eight aquifers), because the study authors considered that global-scale studies are too broad to inform policymaking and local-scale studies do little to illuminate potential changes across larger regions, such as states, which are important for setting water policy. The western United States was selected because of the importance of groundwater in that area relative to the more humid east, with its more abundant supplies of surface water. ", "A conclusion from the study is that a \"wet gets wetter, dry gets drier\" scenario may prevail in the West, meaning generally that the already arid southwest is predicted to become drier, reducing the availability of precipitation for recharge, and the northern portion of the western United States may get wetter, increasing the availability of water for recharge. However, even for regions experiencing wetter conditions, higher average temperatures in the future could cancel out some of the gains, because of higher evaporation and other effects. Mountain systems, in which snowpack plays an important role in water supply and recharge, are likely to provide less water because of lower precipitation (in the south, particularly) and because of a transition to less snow and more rain in the northern ranges. However, the study notes that the impacts of expected snow-to-rain shifts on groundwater are uncertain due to a lack of robust knowledge about mountain system aquifers. ", "A finding in the Meixner et al. study was that knowledge gaps in forecasting changes in the frequency and intensity of future precipitation events will translate into uncertainty in predicting changes to recharge. Figure 10 captures possible broad changes indicated in the study between current conditions and potential future climate conditions for the western United States under a greenhouse gas-induced global warming scenario.", "Another study (Smerdon, 2017) essentially provides a broad synopsis of the published science. It summarized six review articles published between 2011 and 2016 on groundwater and climate change, noting common conclusions on aspects related to predicting changes in groundwater recharge. The study noted that varying predictions of future recharge result from uncertainty inherent in the distribution and trend of future precipitation as predicted in climate change models (also called g eneral c irculation m odels , or GCMs). The study reported additional uncertainty in groundwater recharge forecasts because of uncertainties in downscaling GCM results from the global to the regional scale, similar to the findings in the paper discussed above. ", "One of the articles reviewed suggests \"the role of vegetation is shown to be paramount for the recharge process, where change in precipitation could be accommodated by natural adjustment in evapotranspiration in some cases.\" The finding implies that making predictions of recharge could be difficult because the water consumed by vegetation would not be available to recharge an aquifer. Other articles reviewed in the Smerdon study pointed out that GCMs do not directly incorporate changes in groundwater; in other words, groundwater recharge was not directly modeled in the GCM approach, so changes to groundwater can only be inferred from other model results. ", "One conclusion from the study is that forecasting future groundwater supplies requires better long-term groundwater observations to match the long-term changes in climate in order to investigate their relationship. The Smerdon study notes that given all the uncertainties, several of the articles reviewed indicate that even the direction and magnitude of change to groundwater recharge is difficult to predict; some GCM modeling results suggest recharge could decrease, whereas other GCM results suggest the opposite for similar regions.

Alternatively, regions experiencing wetter conditions could see reduced demand for groundwater if surface water supplies become more abundant.

Severe and widespread droughts over the last 10 years in California, the Midwest, and Texas and a longer period of drier-than-normal conditions in the Southwest have contributed to increasing congressional attention to the effects of drought on increased groundwater pumping and the depletion of groundwater supplies. This has led to legislation in the 115 th and earlier Congresses that would support augmentation of water supplies by enhanced aquifer recharge and the ability to store groundwater in an aquifer for later recovery when surface water supplies are curtailed by drought. Existing authorities for Reclamation and USACE allow for federal projects to be involved in aquifer recharge, storage, and recovery in some way, and proposed legislation (such as S. 2563 and other bills) would augment those authorities.

More recently, California enacted three groundwater laws known collectively as the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA), which directed the California Department of Water Resources to identify water available for replenishing groundwater in the state. Because the Central Valley Project is integral to the water supply and delivery infrastructure of the state, it also recognized as part of the surface water resources potentially available for recharging aquifers as the SGMA is implemented. Other western states with significant Reclamation water infrastructure also may look to enhance their sources of water for aquifer recharge by tapping the federal projects.", "Further technological developments in desalinating brackish or saline groundwater could help make those water supplies available for domestic, agricultural, or other uses. Congress authorized an assessment of brackish groundwater in Section 9507(c) of P.L. 111-11 in 2009, and USGS released its assessment report in 2017.

Seventy percent of wells between 1,500 feet and 3,000 feet below the surface were brackish or highly saline, whereas less than 20% of wells 50 feet deep or shallower were brackish.

For greater use of this potential resource, more detailed evaluations of specific aquifers likely are required.
