In developing the legislation, however, Congress also addressed issues not directly related to the financial crisis. In particular, the Madoff and Stanford Ponzi schemes, discovered in late 2008 and early 2009, raised questions about the quality of regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As a result, numerous provisions in Title IX address the SEC's performance and resources. Other key provisions deal with the duty of care that investment industry professionals owe to their clients and mechanisms by which shareholders can exert more effective control over corporate management.", "This report provides brief summaries of selected provisions in Title IX.
