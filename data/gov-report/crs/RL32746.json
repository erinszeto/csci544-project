Nonetheless, over several decades Congress has authorized a wide range of programs\u2014especially crop insurance and marketing orders\u2014intended to facilitate the growth and benefit the economic health of the specialty crop sector. Relatedly, when Congress gave commodity program producers planting flexibility in the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-127 , the 1996 farm act), it included a provision prohibiting them from planting fruit and vegetable crops on program acres.

About 50 specialty crops currently are covered, but availability of coverage varies by region. Eligible producers can receive catastrophic insurance, which is basically free except for an administrative fee. Producers can buy up their level of coverage beyond the catastrophic level and pay a premium that is subsidized by the federal government. Revenue insurance, which makes indemnity payments for income lost either from poor production or low market prices, also is available to producers of certain crops in some areas. Such insurance provides an indemnity payment when actual revenue falls below a target level of revenue. The 2000 farm law set the subsidy rate for revenue insurance at the same level as for traditional crop insurance.", "USDA decides which crops in which geographical areas will be covered by which types of insurance. The decision is made on a crop-by-crop and county-by-county basis, based on farmer demand for coverage and the level of risk associated with the crop in the region, among other factors. The RMA frequently offers pilot programs offering various types of coverage for new crops (particularly specialty crops) or new geographical areas. It uses the performance of these programs to inform its decision on whether to extend coverage permanently.

Specialty crops currently eligible for the NAP include mushrooms, flowers, ornamental nursery crops, Christmas trees, turfgrass sod, and ginseng. An individual producer is ineligible if his gross revenues from the qualifying crop exceed $2 million. NAP is not subject to annual appropriations, but rather is a mandatory program that receives such sums as necessary through USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), which has a line of credit with the U.S. Treasury.

In FY2005, AMS graded or supervised the grading of approximately 17 billion pounds of processed fruits and vegetables and 65 billion pounds of fresh produce.

The Qualified Through Verification program is similar in approach to the preventive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system used since 1996 by USDA's meat and poultry regulatory agency, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Advisory Committee for Microbiological Criteria for Foods are encouraging the fresh and processed produce industries to adopt this preventive approach to potential food contamination throughout the marketing chain. Although the AMS pilot program relates to the safety of fruits and vegetables from a public health standpoint, it is not a regulatory program.

TASC is targeted specifically to support exports of all cultivated plants and their products except wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco. FAS awards TASC funds on a competitive basis to eligible public and private organizations (i.e., federal and state agencies, trade associations, universities, cooperatives, and private companies), which use them to conduct projects that address trade barriers. Grants may cover seminars, study tours, field surveys, and pre-export clearance programs, among other activities. Eighteen grants were awarded in FY2002 and 19 grants in FY2003, primarily for projects to improve fruit exports.

CCC funds guarantee the payments due from approved foreign banks to U.S. exporters or financial institutions. Because payment is guaranteed, financial institutions in the United States can offer competitive credit terms to the foreign banks, which makes importing from the United States more attractive to potential purchasers. The CCC determines which countries and banks are eligible and at what level of debt, and also selects which commodities and products will be eligible (depending upon market potential).", "Very short-term guarantees (up to 180 days, or more than 180 days but fewer than 360 days) under the Supplier Credit Guarantee Program (SCGP); short-term guarantees (up to three years under GSM-102); and intermediate-term guarantees (3 to 10 years under GSM-103), are available. Long-term guarantees are offered infrequently in general for all commodities, and for perishable commodities, effectively never.

Congress has appropriated about $27 million annually for the APHIS AQI program over the last few years (covering all U.S. agriculture).", "Many of the AQI program activities of importance to the specialty crop sector involve operations at APHIS's National Germplasm and Biotechnology Laboratory located on the large USDA research campus in Beltsville, Maryland. Of particular importance to U.S. specialty crop trade is the lab's work on pre-export testing. A plant disease outbreak in a particular crop in a discrete geographical area can close the export market for that crop no matter where in the United States it may be grown. Following outbreaks in the recent past of diseases affecting potatoes, stone fruit, and nursery products, the APHIS lab's certification of products from disease-free areas permitted the reopening of overseas markets of importance to growers and processors of these crops nationwide.", "Also under the pest and disease exclusion mission area, APHIS conducts a major program to protect the U.S. citrus industry from infestations of Mediterranean fruit flies (Medflies). This pest is capable of causing economic devastation to the industry from quarantine-related trade restrictions as well as from crop losses and control costs. The success of the exclusion effort depends partly upon intercepting the pest on incoming cargo (now DHS's responsibility), and partly upon a program to eradicate Medflies in an area stretching as far south as possible from the U.S.-Mexico border (with the hope of eradicating it eventually throughout Central America). This program involves raising billions of live, sterile fruit flies in labs and releasing them into areas of known infestation. The sterile flies mate with the wild population, thus gradually decreasing the latter's reproductive success until they disappear (a process that takes many months, as a rule).", "APHIS also uses this technique preventively in certain areas of California, Florida, and Texas to keep smaller outbreaks from reaching economic proportions and triggering costly eradication programs. Wide-scale Medfly eradications in the 1980s and '90s cost an average $33 million annually in market losses and treatment costs, according to APHIS.

APHIS budget documents indicate that the agency is taking a number of steps to increase its pest detection capabilities. Among these are hiring additional pest survey specialists and emergency response coordinators; developing a network among private individuals such as farmers, crop consultants, and gardeners for reporting new or unusual infestations to CAPS; and increasing the presence of APHIS employees in foreign countries. Having APHIS personnel stationed in countries that export agricultural commodities to the United States helps the agency set import policy by providing field surveillance and timely warning of changing pest situations, and helps DHS set priorities for border inspections. Conversely, the NAPIS database is an important resource for major foreign importers of U.S. agricultural products. According to APHIS, more than 75 countries access the website each month to view maps and other information to ensure that U.S. agricultural goods destined for their countries are disease and pest free.

However, when a particularly harmful disease or pest emerges suddenly, state resources for immediate response can be quickly overwhelmed. In such emergency situations, the Secretary has broad authority to tap CCC funds to implement federal eradication programs. Many APHIS control and eradication programs over the years have been financed in whole or in part using this authority. In FY2005, $231.2 million in total was transferred to APHIS for emergency programs for plant and animal pest and disease management, on top of $343 million in funds appropriated for that purpose.
