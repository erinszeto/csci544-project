NERC has established reliability guidelines but has noenforcement authority. Before enactment of P.L. 109-58 , the Federal Power Act (1) gave FERC jurisdiction overunbundled transmission and authority to regulate wholesale rates; however, no authority wasprovided to regulate reliability. Under this section, the ERO will develop and enforce reliabilitystandards for the bulk power system, including cybersecurity protection. All ERO standards will beapproved by FERC. Under this title, the ERO can impose penalties on a user, owner, or operator ofa bulk power system that violates any FERC-approved reliability standard. In addition, FERC canorder compliance with a reliability standard and can impose a penalty if FERC finds that a user,owner, or operator of a bulk power system has engaged in or is about to engage in a violation of areliability standard.

This process must be completed within three yearsof enactment. Net metering service is defined as service to an electric consumer under which electricenergy generated by that electric consumer from an eligible on-site generating facility (e.g., solar orsmall generator) and delivered to local distribution facilities may be used to offset electric energyprovided by the electric utility to the electric consumer during the applicable billing period. Duringthe same time frame, states must consider whether to implement a standard to require electricutilities to develop a plan to minimize dependence on one fuel source.

Ownership limitations under PURPA are repealed.", "Background and Analysis. The oil embargoes of the1970s created concerns about the security of the nation's electricity supply and led to enactment ofthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. For the first time, utilities were required topurchase power from outside sources, or \"qualifying facilities.\" The purchase price was set at theutilities' avoided cost. PURPA was established in part to augment electric utility generation withmore efficiently produced electricity and to provide equitable rates to electric consumers.", "In addition to PURPA, the Fuel Use Act of 1978 (FUA) helped qualifying facilities (QFs)become established. (7) Under FUA, utilities were not permitted to use natural gas to fuel new generating facilities. QFs,which are by definition not utilities, were able to take advantage of then-abundant natural gas as wellas new generating technology, such as combined-cycle plants that use hot gases from combustionturbines to generate additional power. These technologies lowered the financial threshold forentrance into the electricity generation business and shortened the lead time for constructing newplants. FUA was repealed in 1987, but by that time, QFs and small power producers had gained aportion of the total electricity supply.", "This influx of QF power challenged the cost-based rates that previously guided wholesaletransactions. Before implementation of PURPA, FERC approved wholesale interstate electricitytransactions based on the seller's costs to generate and transmit the power. Because nonutilitygenerators typically do not have enough market power to influence the rates they charge, FERCbegan approving certain wholesale transactions whose rates were a result of a competitive biddingprocess. These rates are called market-based rates.", "This first incremental change to traditional electricity regulation started a movement towarda market-oriented approach to electricity supply. Following the enactment of PURPA, two basicissues stimulated calls for further change: whether to encourage nonutility generation and whetherto permit utilities to diversify into nonregulated activities.", "The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) (8) removed several regulatory barriers for entry into electricitygeneration to increase competition of electricity supply. However, EPACT does not permit FERCto mandate that utilities transmit exempt wholesale generator (EWG) power to retail consumers(commonly called \"retail wheeling\" or \"retail competition\"), an activity that remains under thejurisdiction of state public utility commissions. PURPA began to shift more regulatoryresponsibilities to the federal government, and EPACT continued that shift away from the states bycreating new options for utilities and regulators to meet electricity demand.", "Proponents of the PURPA repeal -- primarily investor-owned utilities (IOUs) located in theNortheast and in California -- argued that their state regulators' \"misguided\" implementation ofPURPA in the early 1980s had forced them to pay contractually high prices for power they did notneed. They argued that, given the current environment for cost-conscious competition, PURPA wasoutdated. Investor-owned utility interests strongly supported the repeal of Section 210 of PURPA,contending that PURPA's mandatory purchase obligation was anticompetitive andanticonsumer. (9) ", "Opponents of mandatory purchase requirement repeal (independent power producers,industrial power customers, most segments of the natural gas industry, the renewable energyindustry, and environmental groups) had many reasons to support PURPA as it stood. Mainly, theirargument was that PURPA introduced competition in the electric generating sector and, at the sametime, helped promote wider use of cleaner, alternative fuels to generate electricity. Since theelectric-generating sector is not yet fully competitive, they argued, repealing PURPA would decreasecompetition and impede the development of the renewable energy industry. Additionally, opponentsof the PURPA repeal argued that it would result in less competition and greater utility monopolycontrol over the electric industry. Some state regulators had expressed concern that repealingSection 210 would prevent them from deciding matters currently under their jurisdiction.", "Interconnection (Sec. 1254).

In general, PUHCA setforth the structure of holding companies by prohibiting all holding companies that were more thantwice removed from the operating subsidiaries. It also federally regulated holding companies ofinvestor-owned utilities and provided for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulationof mergers and diversification proposals. Registered holding companies of subsidiaries wererequired to have SEC approval prior to issuing securities; all loans in intercompany financialtransactions were regulated by the SEC. A holding company could have been exempt from PUHCAif its business operations and those of its subsidiaries occurred within one state or with a contiguousstate.", "Historically, electricity service was defined as a natural monopoly, meaning that the industryhas (1) an inherent tendency toward declining long-term costs, (2) high threshold investment, and(3) technological conditions that limit the number of potential entrants. In addition, many regulatorshave considered unified control of generation, transmission, and distribution as the most efficientmeans of providing service. As a result, most people (about 75%) are currently served by a verticallyintegrated, investor-owned utility.", "As the electric utility industry has evolved, however, there has been a growing belief that thehistoric classification of electric utilities as natural monopolies has been overtaken by events and thatmarket forces can and should replace some of the traditional economic regulatory structure. Forexample, the existence of utilities that do not own all of their generating facilities, primarilycooperatives and publicly owned utilities, has provided evidence that vertical integration has notbeen necessary for providing efficient electric service. Moreover, recent changes in electric utilityregulation and improved technologies have allowed additional generating capacity to be providedby independent firms rather than utilities.", "The Public Utility Holding Company Act and the Federal Power Act of 1935 (Title I andTitle II of the Public Utility Act) established a regime of regulating electric utilities that gave specificand separate powers to the states and the federal government. A regulatory bargain was madebetween the government and utilities. In exchange for an exclusive franchise service territory,utilities must provide electricity to all users at reasonable, regulated rates.", "State regulatory commissions address intrastate utility activities, including wholesale andretail rate-making. State authority currently tends to be as broad and as varied as the states arediverse. At the least, a state public utility commission will have authority over retail rates, and oftenover investment and debt. At the other end of the spectrum, the state regulatory body will overseemany facets of utility operation. Despite this diversity, the essential mission of the state regulatorin states that have not restructured is the establishment of retail electric prices. This is accomplishedthrough an adversarial hearing process. The central issues in such cases are the total amount ofmoney the utility will be permitted to collect and how the burden of the revenue requirement willbe distributed among the various customer classes (residential, commercial, and industrial).", "Under the FPA, federal economic regulation addresses wholesale transactions and rates forelectric power flowing in interstate commerce. Federal regulation follows state regulation and ispremised on the need to fill the regulatory vacuum resulting from the constitutional inability of statesto regulate interstate commerce. In this bifurcation of regulatory jurisdiction, federal regulation islimited and conceived to supplement state regulation. FERC has the principal functions at thefederal level for the economic regulation of the electric utility industry, including financialtransactions, wholesale rate regulation, transactions involving transmission of unbundled retailelectricity, interconnection and wheeling of wholesale electricity, and ensuring adequate and reliableservice. Before enactment of P.L. 109-58 , in order to prevent a recurrence of the abusive practicesof the 1920s (e.g., cross-subsidization, self-dealing, pyramiding), SEC regulated utilities' corporatestructure and business ventures under PUHCA.", "The electric utility industry has been in the process of transformation. During the past twodecades, there has been a major change in direction concerning generation. First, improvedtechnologies have reduced the cost of generating electricity as well as the size of generating facilities. Prior preference for large-scale -- often nuclear or coal-fired -- powerplants has been supplanted bya preference for small-scale production facilities that can be brought on-line more quickly andcheaply, with fewer regulatory impediments. Second, technological advances have lowered the entrybarrier to electricity generation and permitted nonutility entities to build profitable facilities.", "One argument for additional PUHCA change was made by electric utilities that wanted tofurther diversify their assets. Under PUHCA, a holding company could acquire securities or utilityassets only if the SEC found that such a purchase would improve the economic efficiency andservice of an integrated public utility system. It was argued that reform to allow diversification wouldimprove the risk profile of electric utilities in much the same way as in other businesses: the risk ofany one investment is diluted by the risk associated with all investments. Utilities also argued thatdiversification would lead to better use of underutilized resources (due to the seasonal nature ofelectric demand). Utility holding companies that were exempt from SEC regulation argued thatPUHCA discouraged diversification because the SEC could have repealed their exempt status ifexemption would be \"detrimental to the public interest.\" (11) ", "State regulators expressed concerns that increased diversification could lead to abuses,including cross-subsidization -- a regulated company subsidizing an unregulated affiliate. Cross-subsidization was a major argument against the creation of exempt wholesale generators(EWGs) and reemerged as an argument against further PUHCA change. In the case of electric andgas companies, nonutility ventures that are undertaken as a result of diversification may benefit fromthe regulated utilities' allowed rate of return. Moneymaking nonutility enterprises would contributeto the overall financial health of a holding company. However, unsuccessful ventures could harmthe entire holding company, including utility subsidiaries. In this situation, opponents feared thatutilities would not be penalized for failure in terms of reduced access to new capital, because theycould increase retail rates.", "Several consumer and environmental public interest groups, as well as state legislators,expressed concerns about the PUHCA repeal.
