It was established in 2007, when the Detroit 3 automakers\u2014General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler\u2014faced declining sales in a weakening economy at the same time that U.S. fuel economy standards were raised. It provides direct loans to automakers and parts suppliers to construct new U.S. factories or retrofit existing factories to produce vehicles that achieve at least 25% higher fuel economy than model year 2005 vehicles of similar size and performance.", "The ATVM program is authorized to award up to $25 billion in loans; there is no deadline for completing such loan commitments. Congress funded the program in 2009, when it appropriated $7.5 billion to cover the subsidy cost for the $25 billion in loans, as well as $10 million for program implementation. Since the start of the program, DOE has awarded $8.4 billion in loans to five companies (Fisker, Ford, Nissan, Tesla, and the Vehicle Production Group). As of January 2015, ATVM has $16.6 billion in remaining loan authority. No new loans have been made since 2011. Two companies\u2014Fisker and the Vehicle Production Group\u2014were unable to make payments on their loans, and DOE auctioned the loans off in the fall of 2013. Tesla paid off all of its loan in 2013, nine years ahead of schedule.", "Of the final loan agreements, DOE has estimated that the projects would create or save 38,700 jobs at facilities in nine states. DOE estimated that annually the projects would displace 282 million gallons of gasoline (roughly 18,000 barrels per day, or about 0.2% of U.S. consumption) and would avoid about 2.4 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions (about 0.04% of total U.S. emissions).", "In April 2014, DOE announced a number of changes that appear designed to refocus the program to assist vehicle component manufacturers, rather than the vehicle assemblers that have received prior ATVM loans. As of January 8, 2015, however, no new loans have been made.", "Appropriations for the program do not cover the entire value of the loans but instead cover the \"subsidy cost\" (i.e., the risk of default). For the original appropriation, Congress assumed a subsidy rate of 30%, meaning that $7.5 billion would be sufficient to fund $25 billion in total loan value. A report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that a total of $3.3 billion in subsidy costs has been paid to date, with approximately $4.2 billion unobligated.", "The unobligated funds remaining for the program have been a point of contention in recent appropriations debates. The House has voted several times to transfer some of the unused appropriation for the ATVM subsidy costs to other purposes. None of these transfers were enacted. Other legislators have sought to expand the program. Two recent federal reports call for rescinding the program's unobligated balance: the FY2015 budget resolution reported by the House Budget Committee calls for outright rescission, and an April 2014 GAO report recommends Congress consider taking the same step unless DOE can generate new demand for the program."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress established the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) program in 2007 as a way to help raise U.S. fuel economy standards for vehicles and to encourage domestic production of more fuel-efficient cars and light trucks.

When proposing new, more stringent CAFE standards [in 2007], NHTSA estimated that the Detroit 3 would face significantly higher costs to meet revised standards than the major Japanese automakers.", "The ATVM program is neither unique nor without precedent. The federal government has supported a wide range of research, development, and production incentives for new domestic energy sources for several decades, as part of an overall commitment to reduce petroleum imports and, in the case of automobiles, raise fuel-efficiency levels. Efforts to spur energy innovation in vehicles go back at least to the Ford Administration, when the first efforts to promote research and development of electric vehicles were enacted. Since those initial efforts in the 1970s, the Department of Energy (DOE) has continuously supported research initiatives on new types of electric batteries, fuel cells, and other vehicles and technologies as possible alternatives to vehicles fueled by petroleum. During these years, federal support has also extended to various interagency initiatives such as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) and the Freedom Cooperative Automotive Research (FreedomCAR) Initiative.

Since a low point of 44% market share in 2009 during the recession, the Detroit 3 have gained some ground, as their sales accounted for nearly 47% of all U.S. sales in 2011 and about 45% each year since 2012."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recession Adversely Affects the U.S. Motor Vehicle Industry", "paragraphs": ["At the time the ATVM program was enacted in late 2007, it was apparent that the U.S. economy and the domestic motor vehicle industry were slowing.

The U.S. unemployment rate doubled, from 4.6% in 2007 to 9.3% in 2009, causing consumers to pull back even more from major purchases like vehicles. Collapsing world credit markets and a slowing global economy combined to create the worst market in decades for production and sale of motor vehicles in the United States and other industrial countries. U.S. light vehicle production fell by more than 34% in 2009 compared to 2008 levels. A similar pattern was reflected in U.S. light vehicle sales , which fell from just over 16.5 million vehicles in 2007 to 13.5 million in 2008 and then to 10.6 million vehicles in 2009.", "The production and sales slides were serious business challenges for all automakers, and they rippled through the large and interconnected motor vehicle industry supply chain, touching suppliers, auto dealers, and the communities where auto-making is a major industry. GM and Chrysler were in especially precarious financial positions. The immediate crisis that brought these two companies to bankruptcy was a loss of financial liquidity as the banking system's credit sources froze and neither company had enough internal reserves to weather the economic storm. As a result, they turned to the U.S. government for assistance in November 2008.", "During this time, ATVM resurfaced as a possible source of federal bridge loans for GM and Chrysler. While Congress had passed the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) in the fall of 2008 to shore up the U.S. financial system, the George W. Bush Administration initially indicated it would not use these funds for anything other than the rescue of financial institutions. Instead, it encouraged Congress to amend the already funded ATVM program so it could provide bridge loans to keep GM and Chrysler afloat. In light of the worsening economy and possible failure of both automakers, the House passed legislation that would have allowed ATVM funds to be used as bridge loans for GM and Chrysler, but the Senate did not bring it up for a vote.", "In light of congressional inaction on the reprogramming of ATVM funding, late in December 2008 and in the first days of 2009 the Bush Administration reversed course and provided Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) assistance to both automakers and two auto-financing companies. The incoming Obama Administration built on this commitment. That funding enabled GM and Chrysler to begin restructuring their operations, a process that was ultimately completed in bankruptcy court.
