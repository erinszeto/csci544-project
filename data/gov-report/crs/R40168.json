However, by 2014 (or perhaps earlier), the RFS mandates will exceed this \"blend wall.\" To meet the requirements of the RFS, gasoline suppliers will need to blend ethanol above 10%, or will need to use other avenues for supplying renewable fuels (e.g., using significantly more E85\u201485% ethanol and 15% gasoline\u2014in vehicles designed for its use; increasing the use of biodiesel and renewable diesel in diesel fuel).

The application requested an increase in the maximum concentration to 15% (E15). In September 2010, EPA approved the use of E15 in model year (MY) 2007 and newer passenger vehicles, but deferred a decision on MY2001-MY2006 vehicles. In January 2011, EPA expanded the waiver to include MY2001 and later vehicles. Because EPA determined there was insufficient data to alleviate concerns over emissions performance in older vehicles, as well as motorcycles, heavy trucks, and non-road engines, the agency denied a waiver for the use of E15 in those vehicles and engines.", "To grant the waiver, the petitioner must establish to EPA that the increased ethanol content will not \"cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system\" to meet emissions standards. EPA is to consider short- and long-term (full useful life) effects on evaporative and exhaust emissions from various vehicles and engines, including cars, light trucks, and non-road engines. ", "In addition to the emissions control concerns, other factors affecting consideration of the blend wall include vehicle and engine warranties and the effects on infrastructure. Currently, few automakers warrant their vehicles to use gasoline with higher than 10% ethanol. Small engine manufacturers similarly limit the allowable level of ethanol. Because of concerns over potential equipment damage, a group of vehicle and engine manufacturers challenged in court EPA's initial decision to allow E15 in newer vehicles. Potential concerns with older, \"legacy\" vehicles and equipment include the potential for higher ethanol concentrations to lead to corrosion of seals and other components, corrosion of fuel tanks, higher operating temperatures for some engines (e.g., smaller non-road engines), and higher emissions of some pollutants. ", "The waiver also has implications for fueling infrastructure. For example, most gasoline distribution systems (e.g., gas pumps, storage tanks) are designed to dispense up to E10. While some of these systems may be able to operate effectively on E15 or higher, their warranties/certifications would likely need to be updated. Further, many current state laws prohibit the use of blends higher than E10.", "In EPA granting a waiver only for newer vehicles, a key question is how fuel pumps might be labeled to keep owners from using E15 in older vehicles and other equipment. Along with the waiver decision, EPA proposed new pump labeling rules to indicate which gasoline pumps dispense E15, which the agency finalized June 23, 2011.

Starches (such as corn) and sugars (such as cane sugar) are relatively easily fermented into alcohol, while cellulose must be broken down into sugars or starches through enzymatic or thermochemical processes before fermentation.

As the RINs are essentially numbers in a computerized account, there have been errors and opportunities for fraud. Because of concerns over transposed digits, invalid characters, allegations of double-counting (intentional or unintentional) and other errors and inaccuracies, when EPA finalized rules for the RFS2, EPA also established a new in-house trading system in an effort to address these concerns. All RIN transactions must be cleared through this in-house system, called the EPA Moderated Transaction System (EMTS). From the beginning of the RFS2 EPA has maintained that all due diligence remains the duty of obligated parties.

Two of those cases have led to criminal convictions. Because of these RIN fraud cases, EPA is looking at establishing a system whereby RINs can be certified by third parties registered with EPA. In January EPA proposed a Quality Assurance Plan program, including providing obligated parties\u2014in some cases\u2014with an \"affirmative defense\" if RINs are later found to be fraudulent. Under that affirmative defense, obligated parties would not be liable for civil penalties under the Clean Air Act for the use of such RINs. However, invalid RINs would need to be replaced with valid RINs by either the original generator of the RINs, the third-party certifier, or the current RIN holder.

Since, then prices have dropped somewhat, averaging between about $0.60 and $0.70 per gallon in the last week of March. It is unclear what is driving the increase. The sudden escalation may be due to concerns over the blend wall, a reduction in output from U.S. ethanol producers in the first quarter, and that the RFS mandates will be binding in 2013 or 2014 possibly leading to a scarcity of RINs.

This added duty effectively negated the tax incentive for covered imports and had been a significant barrier to fuel ethanol imports. However, the added duty expired with the tax incentive, and the prospects for reinstating either policy seem unlikely.", "Before the duty expired, under certain conditions imports of ethanol from Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries were granted duty-free status. This was true even if the ethanol was produced in a non-CBI country. In this scenario, the ethanol was produced in another country (historically Brazil or a European country), dehydrated in a CBI country, then shipped to the United States. In prior years these imports reached as high as 5% of the U.S. ethanol market. This avenue for imported ethanol to avoid the tariff was criticized by some stakeholders, including some Members of Congress. With the establishment of a renewable fuel standard, as well as high U.S. gasoline and ethanol prices, there may be more interest in importing ethanol, either through CBI countries or directly from ethanol producers. ", "The likelihood of increased ethanol imports from Brazil may grow in coming years as the RFS requires the use of more advanced biofuels, which would include Brazilian sugarcane ethanol. If targets in the RFS for cellulosic biofuels are not met (see \" Cellulosic Biofuels \"), the mandate for other advanced biofuels could further expand. Also, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard established in California could further increase demand for sugarcane ethanol and other low-carbon biofuels.", "On December 20, 2006, President Bush signed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 ( P.L. 109-432 ). Among other provisions, the act extended the duty on imported ethanol through December 31, 2008, but did not address the CBI preference. The 2008 Farm Bill further extended the duty through December 31, 2010, and the 2010 tax package ( P.L. 111-312 ) extended it through December 31, 2011. The added duty on imported ethanol has since expired."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vehicle Purchase Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established mandatory alternative fuel vehicle purchase requirements for various vehicle fleets. Under the law, 75% of the passenger vehicles purchased by federal and state vehicle fleets must be capable of operating on alternative fuels; 90% of the vehicles purchased by alternative fuel providers must be alternative fuel vehicles.", "The alternative fuel vehicle provisions of EPAct 1992 have been criticized as ineffective because, while EPAct 1992 requires the purchase of vehicles capable of operating on alternative fuels, it did not mandate the use of alternative fuels. In most cases, the vehicles purchased to meet the requirement are dual-fuel vehicles (i.e., they can operate on either a conventional fuel or an alternative fuel). Those vehicles are primarily fueled using gasoline, because gasoline tends to be less expensive and more widely available than alternative fuels because the infrastructure to provide alternative fuels is limited compared with the existing infrastructure for gasoline and diesel fuel.", "In addition, despite the vehicle purchase mandate, in previous years many agencies failed to meet their statutory obligation. As a result, in 2002 the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. In July 2002, the court ruled that several federal agencies failed to meet their quotas and ordered those agencies to prepare reports on their compliance with EPAct, which those agencies have completed. Since that time, most agencies have complied with the requirement; in FY2007, the most recent year data are available, all covered federal fleets met the requirement.", "The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Section 701) modified the requirements for EPAct 1992 compliance. All dual-fuel vehicles purchased to meet the EPAct quotas are required to operate on alternative fuels, unless an agency is granted a waiver by the Secretary of Energy. However, it is unclear whether this requirement will significantly affect federal agency alternative fuel use. The Secretary of Energy is required under the law to conduct a study of the effectiveness of the EPAct requirements. Further, Section 703 of EPAct 2005 allows state and fuel provider fleets to petition the Department of Energy (DOE) to waive the vehicle purchase requirement if the fleet certifies other fuel-saving measures (e.g., using higher-efficiency conventional vehicles or hybrids).", "On January 28, 2008, President Bush signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 ( P.L. 110-181 ). Among other provisions, the law amends the definition of \"alternative fuel vehicle.\" Under the new definition, fleets covered by EPAct 1992 will be granted credits for the purchase of hybrid, advanced diesel, and fuel cell vehicles, in addition to those alternative fuel vehicles already allowed.", "In addition to the requirements for federal, state, and fuel provider fleets, EPAct 1992 grants the DOE the authority to extend the requirements to local government and private fleets. However, as of 2002, DOE had not made a determination on requirements for local and private fleets. As part of the above lawsuit, the Center for Biological Diversity also asked the court to force DOE to promulgate new rules. In ruling on the above case, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ordered DOE to establish a timeline for a new rulemaking. DOE compiled a timeline and, on March 4, 2003, it issued a rulemaking determining that such a program would not promote the goals of EPAct, neither reducing dependence on foreign oil nor leading to greater use of alternative fuel vehicles.", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( H.R. 1 ) appropriated $300 million to the General Services Administration for the purchase of vehicles with high fuel economy, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and pure electric vehicles.", "On January 24, 2007, President Bush signed Executive Order 13423.

In addition to the mandatory purchase requirements, EPAct 1992 established tax incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles and \"clean-fuel vehicles,\" including alternative fuel and hybrid vehicles. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Section 1341) significantly expanded and extended the vehicle purchase incentives, establishing tax credits for the purchase of fuel cell, hybrid, alternative fuel, and advanced diesel vehicles. For passenger vehicles, the credit was worth as much as $3,400 for hybrids and advanced diesels, and as much as $4,000 for alternative fuel vehicles, depending on vehicle attributes. The expiration date for the incentives also varied depending on the technology, with only the fuel cell vehicle tax credit currently available.", "The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established a tax credit for the purchase of plug-in vehicles, both pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids (i.e., gasoline/electric hybrid vehicles that can fuel on gasoline or be recharged from the electric grid.) For passenger vehicles, the credit is a maximum of $7,500, depending on the vehicle's battery capacity. ", "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ) significantly modified the plug-in credits: the law eliminated the credit for vehicles above 14,000 pounds after 2009; established a credit of up to $2,500 for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and low-speed four-wheeled plug-in vehicles; and established a credit of up to $4,000 for the conversion of existing vehicles to run on battery power (the credit for conversion kits has since expired). The law also allows purchasers to claim the plug-in, alternative fuel vehicle, and hybrid tax credits even if they are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)\u2014previously, taxpayers subject to the AMT could not claim these credits. Eligibility for the tax credit for plug-in passenger vehicles phases out once a manufacturer has produced 200,000 vehicles eligible for the credit; for two-wheeled, three-wheeled, and low-speed vehicles the credit expires at the end of 2013.

They can be blended with conventional diesel fuel and used in diesel engines with few or no modifications. Further, with some engine modifications, they can be used in a nearly pure form. Because biodiesel can displace conventional diesel without the use of new (and in many cases costly) vehicles, there is growing interest in its use. Further, because it can be produced from agricultural products, farmers (especially soybean and canola farmers) and some environmentalists have a keen interest in its development as a way to promote rural economies, reduce agricultural wastes, and limit greenhouse gas emissions. However, biodiesel production is currently expensive: wholesale biodiesel from virgin oils can cost up to two times more than conventional No. 2 diesel; biodiesel from recycled grease is less expensive but still costs considerably more than conventional diesel.", "The cost barriers for biodiesel and renewable diesel production have generated interest in providing tax incentives, in the form of either production tax credits or excise tax exemptions, or both. Further there is interest in developing new technologies to help reduce production costs. However, the organic oils used as raw materials are one of the largest costs in production. Therefore, to significantly reduce production costs, the costs of soybean oil and other oils would need to decrease substantially, or less costly feedstocks would need to be developed.", "As was stated above, the American Jobs Creation Act, as amended, provided a tax credit of up to $1.00 per gallon for the sale and use of biodiesel. In addition, the law provided an excise tax credit for biodiesel blends (i.e., biodiesel and conventional diesel).

However, hydrogen fuel production is currently very expensive, as are fuel cells. In addition, depending on the original fuel source, overall fuel-cycle emissions can be a key concern.", "Because of the potential benefits from hydrogen and fuel cells, and because of the existing technical and cost barriers to their commercialization, the Bush Administration strongly supported research and development (R&D). In January 2002, the Bush Administration announced the FreedomCAR initiative, which promoted cooperative R&D between the \"Big Three\" American auto manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors) and the federal government. While the partnership conducted research on many automotive technologies, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles were a key focus. Further, in his January 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush announced the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative, which increased federal spending on hydrogen fuel and stationary fuel cell R&D. Overall, the President requested $1.8 billion between FY2004 and FY2008 for both initiatives, including a $720 million increase in funding from earlier appropriations. Over that time, Congress appropriated a total of $1.4 billion for the initiatives.
