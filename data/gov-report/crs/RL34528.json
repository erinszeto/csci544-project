While Korea committed in the FTA to reduce its 40% tariff on imported U.S. beef over a 15-year period, its limits on such imports for human health reasons threatened to undercut this preferential benefit for U.S. exporters. In 2003, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exports, prior to the ban its government imposed after the first U.S. cow infected with mad cow disease, or BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), was discovered. U.S. efforts to regain full access became intertwined with the subsequent KORUS negotiations, but did not yield results by the time those talks concluded in April 2007. In reaction, some Members of Congress stated their consideration of, and support for, KORUS depends on South Korea fully opening its market to U.S. beef.", "On April 18, 2008, U.S. and South Korean negotiators signed a protocol, or agreement, on sanitary rules that Korea will apply to beef imports from the United States. It allows for imports of all cuts of U.S. boneless and bone-in beef and certain beef products from cattle, irrespective of age, as long as specified risk materials known to transmit mad cow disease are removed and other conditions are met. Though the U.S. beef industry and U.S. policymakers welcomed this deal, Korean TV coverage and Internet-spread rumors that questioned the safety of U.S. beef resulted in escalating protests and calls for the beef agreement to be renegotiated or scrapped. U.S. officials countered that measures already in place to prevent the introduction of BSE in U.S. cattle herds meet international scientific standards. To address rising public pressure, the Korean government twice pursued talks with the United States to find ways to defuse these concerns without \"renegotiating\" the beef protocol. This culminated in the June 21, 2008, confirmation by both governments of a \"voluntary private sector\" arrangement that allows Korean firms to import U.S. beef produced from cattle only under 30 months of age. Both governments view this as a transitional step until Korean consumer confidence in the safety of U.S. beef improves.", "Since the resumption of U.S. beef exports in July 2008, U.S. exporters have worked to recapture this key overseas market. Beef exports to South Korea in 2010 totaled $518 million, about two-thirds of the record 2003 level. In 2011's first five months, exports (at $331 million) were twice the level recorded in the same period the year before. Promotional efforts to rebuild consumer confidence in U.S. beef, aggressive marketing efforts by large store chains, and much lower retail prices for imported beef than for Korean beef account for the continued growth in U.S. beef sales.", "Following President Obama's mid-2010 decision to present the KORUS FTA to Congress in 2011, Administration officials worked to resolve the beef and auto issues with South Korea. By the time bilateral talks concluded on December 3, 2010, the beef issue reportedly had received little discussion as both sides focused on revising the auto provisions. Korea's position was shaped by the memory of the size and intensity of the 2008 anti-beef agreement protests. President Obama, in discussing this outcome, stated that the United States will continue to work toward \"ensuring full access for U.S. beef to the Korean market.\" To address lingering congressional concerns, the Administration in early May 2011 committed to request consultations with South Korea on the \"full implementation\" of the protocol as soon as KORUS takes effect, and to provide additional funds for U.S. beef promotion activities in the Korean market.

In response, South Korea's animal health regulatory agency began an eight-step process to assess the BSE risks of the U.S. beef sector in light of the OIE finding, with the intent to negotiate a revised bilateral agreement that would lay out import rules applicable to U.S. beef. Against this backdrop, U.S. boneless beef exports resumed in late April 2007, with occasional breaks when Korean inspectors refused entry to some shipments that contained bones or did not meet other requirements laid out in the January 2006 agreement.

In the second and third quarters of 2009, U.S. beef exports to South Korea stabilized at a lower level, in part due to household decisions to tighten spending (i.e., less restaurant dining, where U.S. beef would frequently be consumed) in response to the uncertainty caused by Korea's economic recession ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). The availability of cheaper Australian beef because of the Australian dollar's more favorable exchange rate against the Korean won also reduced the price-competitiveness of U.S. beef during this period. USDA reported that imports were slowed by the difficulties that importers experienced in securing credit due to the financial squeeze and the weak won relative to the U.S. dollar, and by \"ample\" inventories of U.S. beef sitting in cold storage.

At the same time, U.S. negotiators faced pressure to balance this objective with similar negotiating initiatives to expand upon or regain market access for U.S. beef in such important Asian markets as Japan, Taiwan, and China.", "Administration officials continued to state that their objective is \"to eventually secure full market access for U.S. beef \" that reflects South Korea's recognition that the United States meets OIE standards. However, public statements made by U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and then-USDA Under Secretary Jim Miller raised the possibility that the Administration might not require achieving this objective before the KORUS FTA is sent to Congress, and instead might seek to secure commitments from South Korea to move in steps toward that goal.", "Senator Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee (which will consider the Administration's bill to approve and implement the KORUS FTA) stated that he wanted access for all U.S. beef and cuts from cattle of any age as a condition for considering and ratifying the KORUS FTA. His statements stressed that the OIE has determined that U.S. beef from cattle irrespective of age can be safely imported, and that 60 countries now recognize this in accepting U.S. beef. Baucus has continued to reiterate that his objective is to see that U.S. beef access in all markets be based on internationally accepted rules, arguing that allowing an FTA partner such as Korea not to follow OIE guidelines would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Another approach laid out by Senator Grassley, then ranking Member of the Finance Committee, would be to pursue efforts to secure additional beef access \"in parallel to the FTA approval process.\" ", "Much of the U.S. cattle and beef industry wants to see the KORUS FTA take effect soon in order to realize the benefit of the reduction in South Korea's 40% tariff on beef muscle cut imports. The industry points to the fact that U.S. beef exports continue to grow, and that the U.S. market share of Korea's beef import market is increasing. Industry spokesmen expressed some apprehension about losing these gains, if U.S. negotiators push South Korea too quickly for full beef access. Their stance likely reflected a desire to avoid a repeat of the street protests that occurred in May 2008, to preclude a public and official perception that the United States is again pressuring South Korea for a policy change. The U.S. beef sector would view such a scenario as undercutting the aggressive market promotion efforts made since late 2008 to assure Korean consumers of the safety of U.S. beef, which it views as having contributed to the increase in U.S. beef exports. Others also have mentioned that securing tariff reductions for U.S. beef would provide a price advantage with respect to beef supplied by Australia and New Zealand, which are seeking similar tariff cuts as both countries negotiate FTAs with South Korea."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Change on Beef Issue After Talks", "paragraphs": ["In the negotiations on the supplemental agreement concluded on December 3, 2010, the beef issue reportedly received little discussion as both sides focused on revising the auto provisions. President Obama, in discussing this outcome the next day, indicated that the United States will continue to work toward \"ensuring full access for U.S. beef to the Korean market.\"", "Congressional reaction to this outcome was mixed. Senator Baucus expressed \"deep disappointment\" that the supplemental deal \"fails to address Korea's significant barriers to American beef exports.\" He stated his commitment to \"right this wrong\" and to work with the Administration to ensure that ranchers \"are not left behind.\" Two months later, Senator Baucus said he will not support the KORUS FTA until South Korea opens up its beef market. A few other Senators, though concerned with the lack of progress on beef, viewed the deal positively and welcomed the prospect for considering the KORUS FTA in 2011. Meat industry groups again expressed support for this trade agreement that they expect over time will significantly increase their exports to South Korea, and urged Congress to move quickly to ratify it. Beef interests, also supportive, called for continued efforts to secure full market access.", "Memories of the size and intensity of the 2008 anti-beef agreement protests in South Korea appear to have directly influenced the position taken on the beef issue by Korean negotiators. Reflecting this political sensitivity, they reportedly rejected any discussion on this matter in the negotiations held in early November leading up to the summit between Presidents Obama and Lee and in the final talks leading to the supplemental agreement. Their position was that this issue \"did not fall under\" the FTA concluded in 2007. Since then, South Korea's trade minister has confirmed that there will be no more discussions on ending the age limits of U.S. cattle slaughtered for beef. This stance was affirmed by South Korea's ambassador to Washington in late January 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Administration's Subsequent Commitment", "paragraphs": ["Seeking to move closer toward submitting the KORUS FTA to Congress for consideration, the Administration on May 4, 2011, announced two measures it will take on the U.S. beef access issue. In a letter to Senator Baucus, USTR's Ron Kirk committed to request consultations with South Korea on the \"full implementation\" of the protocol (e.g., opening Korea's market \"to all ages and all cuts of U.S. beef\") as soon as this trade agreement takes effect. The letter referenced one specific provision stipulating that bilateral consultations on the interpretation or application of the protocol's terms \"shall be held within seven days\" of a request. USDA also announced a $1 million award to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) to be used in 2011 to promote U.S. beef sales in South Korea, and its intent to consider future funding requests from the USMEF to implement its planned five-year market beef promotion strategy in this key market. Senator Baucus welcomed both steps, stating that he will support the KORUS FTA and will work with the Administration on a package of trade measures that includes all three FTAs and renewing trade adjustment assistance and trade preference programs."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
