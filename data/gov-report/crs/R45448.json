Since then, more than 800 U.S. food and agricultural products have been subject to retaliatory tariffs from China, the European Union (EU), Turkey, Canada, and Mexico. U.S. exports of those products to the retaliating countries totaled $26.9 billion in 2017, according to USDA export data. The choice of agricultural and food products for retaliatory tariffs likely reflects the large volume of agricultural trade involved and that many of these products can be sourced from non-U.S. trading partners. Such tariff hikes threaten to reduce U.S. agricultural exports.", "China, which is subject to both the U.S. Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and separate Section 301 tariffs aimed as punishment for its handling of U.S. intellectual property rights, has placed retaliatory tariffs on the largest number and highest value of U.S. agricultural and food products. More than 800 products\u2014including soybeans, pork, dairy products, fruits and nuts, seafood, and processed products\u2014accounting for almost all U.S. agricultural and food exports to China in value terms in 2017 (the last full year without retaliatory tariffs) are now subject to additional tariffs of 5%, 10%, 15%, 25%, or a combination of those amounts. U.S. exports to China of those products that are subject to retaliatory tariffs were worth about $20.6 billion in 2017. China has fallen from the leading export market for U.S. agricultural products in FY2017 to the third-leading export market in FY2018 due to the retaliatory tariffs, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA forecasts that China will fall to the fifth-leading market for those products in FY2019.", "Canada and Mexico are each targeting about 20 U.S. food and agricultural products, which accounted for approximately $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion in exports to each respective country in 2017. The EU and Turkey have each put retaliatory tariffs on about 40 U.S. agricultural and food products that were valued at about $1 billion and $250 million, respectively, in 2017. India has threatened to impose tariffs on seven U.S. agricultural and food products, which accounted for about $857 million in exports in 2017. U.S. agricultural exports account for about 20% of U.S. farm income, according to USDA. Thus any loss in exports could have negative economic consequences for U.S. farmers.", "Commodities that are highly dependent on exports to the retaliating markets may be more severely affected than others by any loss of markets from the tariffs. For instance, commodities for which U.S. exports to the retaliating countries represent 30% or more of its total exports include soybeans, sorghum, pork, cheese, apples, cherries, seafood, ginseng, whiskey, and some processed foods. U.S. soybean exports to China for January through October 2018 are 63% lower than during the same time period in 2017\u2014a change due in large part to the tariffs.", "USDA is attempting to ease the downside effects of the retaliatory tariffs on farmers and ranchers through a $12 billion trade aid package. Under this initiative, USDA has committed to making direct payments to farmers of selected commodities subject to the tariffs, as well as buying up surplus quantities of some commodities and providing funding for additional trade promotion efforts.

The study uses 2014 data as the base case and assumes the long-term continuation of all of the retaliatory tariffs but does not include time frames for losses. The study also projects that the reduction in U.S. agricultural exports could also lower agricultural land prices and result in the reallocation of 45,000 farm, ranch, and processing workers.

Those programs provide money to eligible groups to help develop foreign markets for various commodity and food products. For details on the amounts for the payments and purchases under the trade aid package, see CRS Report R45310, Farm Policy: USDA's Trade Aid Package ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agriculture's Concerns and Government Response", "paragraphs": ["Many agricultural groups have expressed concerns about the retaliatory tariffs. Exports account for about 20% of U.S. farm income, according to USDA, so U.S. farmers and ranchers have an interest in both maintaining and expanding export markets. Farm groups are concerned about the immediate loss of export sales and the prospect of losing access to markets, or losing market share, over the long term. Over time, importers may identify new suppliers for a given product, as China has done for soybeans. Compounding that problem are new trade deals that are being discussed by the countries retaliating against the United States. The EU-Canada free trade agreement (FTA) went into force in 2017, and the EU has finalized an FTA with Mexico. Mexico and Canada are signatories to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. If this FTA goes into force, Mexico and Canada would have improved access to nine other Pacific Rim markets. This means U.S. agricultural exports could face stiffer competition on its exports to Mexico and Canada. ", "The ASA has expressed \"extreme disappointment\" over USTR's escalating tariffs on China that have led to retaliation on soybeans. The NPPC has stated that the retaliatory tariffs are \"threatening the livelihoods of thousands of U.S. pig farmers.\" The U.S. Dairy Export Council has warned that the retaliatory tariffs that China and Mexico have imposed could result in billions of dollars of lost sales for U.S. dairy producers. Farmers for Free Trade\u2014a coalition led by former Senators Max Baucus and Richard Lugar that advocates for free trade and opposes tariffs that injure farmers, ranchers, and rural communities\u2014has run radio, print, and television ads in key markets across the country expressing concern about the Administration's trade policies and the potential economic fallout they may have on U.S. agriculture.", "While President Trump and members of his Administration have met with officials from many of the retaliating markets, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and European Commission President Jean-Claude Junker, USDA's trade aid package is the Trump Administration's short-term effort to ease the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural products. A number of producer groups have indicated that the trade aid package is inadequate to compensate growers for lost export sales. For example, Western Growers, an association that represents specialty crop producers, has stated that the $12 billion plan falls \"substantially short\" of what many producers affected by the retaliatory tariffs need. The American Farm Bureau Federation, the largest general farm organization, concluded that the package provides \"some breathing room\" for farmers and ranchers but added that it will likely only help producers through a few months. In general, numerous farmer and rancher organizations have urged the Administration to resolve the trade concerns that have led to tariff retaliation against U.S. agriculture and food products in order to facilitate the removal of these tariffs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Interest", "paragraphs": ["Because of the broad scope of farm products subject to the retaliatory tariffs and the importance of some of the markets involved, many farmers and ranchers are likely to experience some negative effects, such as lower prices or potentially lost market opportunities for their products. The trade aid package that USDA has introduced to help producers mitigate the potential loss of exports due to the tariffs is a limited set of initiatives that are not designed to address potential longer-term downside consequences that may arise, such as lower commodity prices and reduced farm income from lower export sales. Some agriculture industry stakeholders have suggested that the potential effects of the retaliatory tariffs could be longer lasting, because they have created uncertainty about U.S. trade policy behavior and because U.S. actions have called into question the reliability of the United States as a trading partner.", "Several bills introduced in the 115 th Congress in both the House and the Senate would have provided more export promotion money and additional adjustment assistance to farmers affected by the retaliatory tariffs, though none passed. Legislation that sought to address the effects of the retaliatory tariffs on agriculture included the following : ", "S. 3258 (Heitkamp) and H.R. 6483 (Blunt/Rochester) would have provided trade adjustment assistance to farmers adversely affected by reduced exports resulting from retaliatory tariffs. S. 3407 (Heitkamp) and H.R. 6699 (Bustos) would have required that any duties collected as part of the Section 232 or Section 301 tariffs on U.S. imports be provided to the Foreign Market Development Program, the Market Access Program, and the Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops program.", "As U.S. farmers and ranchers look to regain or expand existing markets and establish new ones, Members of Congress may consider engaging the Administration through their oversight activities to identify actions that would facilitate additional sales of agricultural products in domestic and export markets and enhance the long-term economic vitality of U.S. food and agricultural interests."], "subsections": []}]}}
