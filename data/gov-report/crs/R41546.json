In an effort to ensure public participation in the informal rulemaking process, agencies are required to provide the public with adequate notice of a proposed rule followed by a meaningful opportunity to comment on the rule's content. Although the APA sets the minimum degree of public participation the agency must permit, the legislative history of the APA suggests that \"[matters] of great importance, or those where the public submission of facts will be either useful to the agency or a protection to the public, should naturally be accorded more elaborate public procedures.\"", "The requirement under \u00a7 553 to provide the public with adequate notice of a proposed rule is generally achieved through the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register . The APA requires that the notice of proposed rulemaking include \"(1) the time, place, and nature of public rulemaking proceedings; (2) reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and (3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.\" Generally speaking, the notice requirement of \u00a7 553 is satisfied when the agency \"affords interested persons a reasonable and meaningful opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.\"", "Once adequate notice is provided, the agency must provide interested persons with a meaningful opportunity to comment on the proposed rule through the submission of written \"data, views, or arguments.\" The comment period may result in a vast rulemaking record as persons are permitted to submit nearly any piece of information for consideration by the agency. While there is no minimum period of time for which the agency is required to accept comments, in reviewing an agency rulemaking, courts have focused on whether the agency provided an \"adequate\" opportunity to comment\u2014of which the length of the comment period represents only one factor for consideration.

The general statement of basis and purpose should \"enable the public to obtain a general idea of the purpose of, and a statement of the basic justification for, the rules.\" The agency is not required to include in the final rule a response to every comment received.

If even a single adverse comment is received, the proposed rule is withdrawn, and the agency may issue its proposed rule under the APA's informal notice-and-comment requirements. In this manner, the agency can efficiently finalize unobjectionable rules while avoiding many of the procedural delays of the traditional notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements.

However, the determination has significant consequences for both the procedures the agency is required to follow in issuing the rule and the deference with which a reviewing court will accord the rule. In categorizing a rule, an agency must determine whether the action in question simply interprets existing law or results in a substantive change to existing law. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit) has suggested: \"an agency can declare its understanding of what a statute requires without providing notice-and-comment, but an agency cannot go beyond the text of a statute and exercise its delegated powers without first providing adequate notice-and-comment.\" ", "Still, even non-legislative rules must comply with certain aspects of the APA's procedural requirements. For example, the agency must comply with the APA's petition requirements as well as publication and public availability provisions.

In addition, the agency must give supporting reasons for invoking the good cause exception. Whether the agency's use of the good cause exception is proper is a fact-specific inquiry that generally includes an evaluation of whether immediate action is necessary, the consequences of inaction, and whether advance notice would defeat the regulatory objective. Courts, however, have traditionally held that these exceptions will be \"narrowly construed and reluctantly countenanced.\" For example, the D.C. Circuit has stated that \"[b]ald assertions that the agency does not believe comments would be useful cannot create good cause to forgo notice-and-comment procedures.\"", "A common use of the good cause exception is in the issuance of interim final rules. Interim final rules are used by agencies to promulgate rules without providing the public with notice and an opportunity to comment before publication of the final rule. In issuing the rule, the agency generally reserves the right to modify the rule through a post-promulgation comment period.

That requirement, however, is subject to various exceptions, including when an agency finds that there is \"good cause\" for the rule to take immediate effect, or where the rule \"grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.\" It would therefore appear that although an agency is generally required to comply with the notice-and-comment requirements of \u00a7 553 in repealing a rule, to the extent the repeal removes a previously existing requirement on regulated entities, the rule could be given immediate effect upon publication of the final repeal.", "Policy statements, interpretive rules, agency rules of procedure, and other informal agency pronouncements that were not subject to notice-and-comment during their initial promulgation and that lack the force and effect of law may be altered immediately and without public participation.

These delays frequently occur during the early days of a new presidential Administration and have generally been implemented without providing the public with notice or an opportunity to comment. For example, the last three Presidents have directed agencies to delay the effective dates of all finalized but not yet effective rules by 60 days in order to provide the new Administration with time to review the rule.", "Whether agencies may postpone the effective date of a finalized rule that has not yet taken effect without first engaging in notice-and-comment is a legal question that has not been definitively resolved. Despite the uncertainty associated with agency authority in this area, and perhaps because such delays are typically short in duration, agencies have generally been successful in implementing these delays without notice-and-comment. Nevertheless, some federal courts have suggested that such a delay could amount to a substantive amendment to the rule and thus cannot be implemented without first engaging in the notice-and-comment process. These cases have similarly rejected claims that a delay created as a result of a presidential transition qualifies for the good cause exception. It should be noted that courts have been more willing to permit agencies to delay, without notice-and-comment, the effective date of a rule that is subject to a pending legal challenge.
