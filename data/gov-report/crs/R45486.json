On September 30, 2015, some of the authorities created by the HHFKA expired.

Under current law, children must consume summer meals on-site. This is known as the \"congregate feeding\" requirement. Starting in 2010, Congress funded demonstration projects, including the Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) demonstration, to test alternatives to congregate feeding in summer meals. Congress has increased funding for Summer EBT in recent appropriations cycles and there have been discussions about whether to continue or expand the program.", "Implementation of the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). The HHFKA created CEP, an option for qualifying schools, groups of schools, and school districts to offer free meals to all students.

Also operating in schools, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program provides funding for fruit and vegetable snacks in participating elementary schools, and the Special Milk Program provides support for milk in schools that do not participate in NSLP or SBP. Other child nutrition programs include the Child and Adult Care Food Program, which provides meals and snacks in child care and after-school settings, and the Summer Food Service Program, which provides food during the summer months.

These nutrition standards were last updated following the enactment of the HHFKA, which required USDA to update the standards for school meals and create new nutrition standards for \"competitive\" foods (e.g., foods sold in vending machines, a la carte lines, and snack bars) within a specified timeframe. Specifically, the law required USDA to issue proposed regulations for competitive foods nutrition standards within one year after enactment and for school meals nutrition standards within 18 months after enactment. The law also provided increased federal subsidies (6 cents per lunch) for schools meeting the new requirements and funding for technical assistance. The nutrition standards in the HHFKA were championed by a variety of organizations and stakeholders, including nutrition and public health advocacy organizations, food and beverage companies, school nutrition officials, retired military leaders, and then-First Lady Michelle Obama.", "The precise nutritional requirements were largely written in the subsequent regulations, not the HHFKA. USDA-FNS published the final rule for school meals in January 2012 and the final rule for competitive foods in July 2016. As required by law, the nutrition standards were based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (now the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies). For school meals, the updated standards increased the amount of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in school lunches and breakfasts. They also instituted limits on calories, sodium, whole grains, and proteins in meals and restricted milk to low-fat (unflavored) and fat-free (flavored or unflavored) varieties. Other requirements included a provision that senior high school students must select a half-serving of fruits or vegetables with a reimbursable meal. Similarly, the nutrition standards for competitive foods limited calories, sodium, and fat in foods sold outside of meals, among other requirements. The standards applied only to non-meal foods and beverages sold during the school day (defined as midnight until 30 minutes after dismissal) and include some exceptions for fundraisers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation and Changes", "paragraphs": ["The meal standards began phasing in during school year (SY) 2012-2013, and the competitive foods standards took effect in SY2014-2015. However, sodium limits and certain whole grain requirements for school meals were scheduled to phase in over multiple school years. Some schools experienced challenges implementing the changes, reporting difficulty obtaining whole grain and low-sodium products, issues with student acceptance of foods, reduced participation, increased costs, and increased food waste. These accounts were shared in news stories and by the School Nutrition Association (SNA), a national, nonprofit professional and advocacy organization representing school nutrition professionals. Studies by the U.S. Government Accountability Office and USDA confirmed that many of these issues were present in SY2012-2013 and SY2013-2014, the first two years of implementation. SNA advocated for certain changes to the standards, while other groups called for maintaining the standards, arguing that they were necessary for children's health and that implementation challenges were easing with time. ", "In January 2014, USDA removed weekly limits on grains and protein. Then, in the FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017 appropriations laws, Congress enacted provisions that loosened the milk, whole grain, and/or sodium requirements from SY2015-2016 through SY2017-2018. USDA implemented similar changes for SY2018-2019 in an interim final rule. In December 2018, USDA published a final rule that indefinitely changes these three aspects of the standards starting in SY2019-2020. Specifically, the rule", "allows all SFAs to offer flavored, low-fat (1%) milk as part of school meals and as beverages sold in schools, and requires unflavored milk to be offered alongside flavored milk in school meals; requires SFAs to adhere to a 50% whole grain-rich requirement (the original regulations required 100% whole grain-rich starting in SY2014-2015); states may make exemptions to allow SFAs to offer nonwhole grain-rich products; and maintains Target 1 sodium limits from SY2019-2020 through SY2023-2024, implements Target 2 limits starting in SY2024-2025 and thereafter, and eliminates Target 3 limits (the strictest target).", " Table 2 provides a timeline from the 2012 final rule to the 2018 final rule, showing the ways in which milk, whole grain, and sodium requirements have been modified over time.

For example, the House-passed version of 2018 farm bill (one version of H.R. 2 ) would have required USDA to review and revise the nutrition standards for school meals and competitive foods. According to the bill, the revisions would have had to ensure that the standards, particularly those related to milk, \"(1) are based on research based on school-age children; (2) do not add costs in addition to the reimbursements required to carry out the school lunch program \u2026 and (3) maintain healthy meals for students.\" This provision was not included in the enacted bill. ", "Child nutrition reauthorization proposals in the House and Senate during the 114 th Congress also would have altered the nutrition standards. The House committee's proposal ( H.R. 5003 ) would have required USDA to review the school meal standards at least once every three years and revise them as necessary, following certain criteria. In addition, under the proposal, fundraisers by student groups/organizations would no longer have had to meet the competitive food standards and any foods served as part of a federally reimbursable meal would have been allowed to be sold a la carte. The Senate committee's proposal ( S. 3136 ) would have required USDA to revise the whole grain and sodium requirements for school meals within 90 days after enactment. Although not included in the proposal itself, negotiations between the Senate committee, the White House, USDA, and the School Nutrition Association resulted in an agreement that these revisions, if enacted, would have reduced the 100% whole grain-rich requirement to 80% and delayed the Target 2 sodium requirement for two years.

Stakeholders on both sides include agricultural producers and processors. ", "The 2014 farm bill (Section 4214 of P.L. 113-79 ) funded a pilot project that incorporated canned, dried, and frozen (CDF) fruits and vegetables in FFVP in a limited number of states. USDA selected schools in four states (Alaska, Delaware, Kansas, and Maine) that reported difficulty obtaining, storing, and/or preparing fresh fruits and vegetables. According to the final (2017) evaluation, 56% of the pilot schools chose to incorporate CDF fruits and vegetables during an average week of the demonstration. Schools most often introduced dried and canned fruits, which resulted in decreased vegetable offerings and increased fruit offerings in the FFVP. However, there was no significant impact on students' vegetable consumption, while fruit consumption declined on FFVP snack days (likely because students consumed a smaller quantity of fruit when it was dried or canned). There was also no significant impact on student participation. Student satisfaction with FFVP decreased slightly during the pilot, parents' responses to the pilot were mixed, and school administrators (who opted into the pilot) generally favored the changes.", "Legislative proposals to change FFVP offerings on a more permanent basis have also been considered. For example, in the 115 th Congress, the House version of H.R. 2 would have allowed CDF and pur\u00e9ed forms of fruits and vegetables in FFVP and removed \"fresh\" from the program name. This provision was not included in the enacted bill. In the 114 th Congress, child nutrition reauthorization legislation in the House ( H.R. 5003 ) included a similar proposal to allow participating schools to serve \"all forms\" of fruits and vegetables as well as tree nuts. The Senate committee's proposal ( S. 3136 ) would have provided temporary hardship exemptions for schools with limited storage and preparation facilities or limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables that would have allowed them to serve CDF fruits and vegetables in FFVP.

Accompanying conference report language elaborated that \"processed substantially\" means the product is processed in the United States and contains over 51% domestically grown ingredients, and this definition is also included in USDA guidance (discussed below). USDA regulations essentially restate the statutory requirement. ", "USDA has issued guidance on how SFAs and state agencies should implement the Buy American requirements. The most recent guidance (as of the date of this report) was published in a June 2017 memorandum. According to USDA-FNS guidance, the Buy American requirements apply to any foods purchased with funds from the nonprofit school food service account, whether or not they are federal funds (children's paid lunch fees, for example, also go into the nonprofit school food service account). The guidance encourages SFAs to integrate Buy American into their procurement processes; for example, by monitoring the USDA catalog for appropriate products and placing Buy American language in solicitations, contracts, and other procurement documents. The guidance explains that SFAs are permitted to make exceptions to the Buy American requirements on a limited basis when a product \"is not produced or manufactured in the U.S. in sufficient and reasonably available quantities of a satisfactory quality\" or when \"competitive bids reveal the costs of a U.S. product are significantly higher than the non-domestic product.\" SFAs must interpret when this is the case and document any exceptions they make. SFAs may also request a waiver from the requirements for a product that does not meet these criteria. State agencies must review SFAs' compliance with the Buy American requirements, including any exceptions an SFA has made, and take corrective action when necessary. ", "The enacted 2018 farm bill (Section 4207 of P.L. 115-334 ) included a provision requiring USDA to \"enforce full compliance\" with the Buy American requirements and \"ensure that States and school food authorities fully understand their responsibilities\" within 180 days of enactment. In addition, the bill requires USDA to submit a report to Congress by the 180-day deadline on actions taken and plans to comply with the provision. The provision clarifies the definition of domestic products for the purposes of USDA's enforcement, stating that domestic products are those that are \"processed in the United States and substantially contain \u2026 meats, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural commodities\" produced in the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States, or \"fish harvested\" in the Exclusive Economic Zone or by a U.S.-flagged vessel.

Some of these alternatives focus on rural areas, which may face particular barriers to onsite consumption of summer meals.

The project provides electronic food benefits to households with children eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Depending on the site and year, either $30 or $60 per month is provided on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Participants in jurisdictions providing benefits through SNAP can redeem benefits for SNAP-eligible foods at any SNAP-authorized retailer, while participants in the WIC EBT jurisdictions are limited to the smaller set of WIC-eligible foods at WIC-authorized retailers.", "An evaluation of Summer EBT was conducted from FY2011 through FY2013. The study, which used a random assignment design, found a significant decline in the prevalence of very low food security among participants (9.5% of control group children experienced very low food security compared to 6.4% in the Summer EBT group). It also showed improvements in children's consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Both the WIC and SNAP models showed increased consumption, but increases were greater at sites operating the WIC model.

Most recently, the third FY2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 116-6 ) provided $28 million for the Summer EBT demonstration. Awardees for summer 2017 were Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, Oregon, Virginia, and the Chickasaw and Cherokee nations.

In other cases, schools respond with what some have called \"lunch shaming\" practices\u2014most commonly, taking or throwing away a student's selected hot foods and providing an alternative cold meal or, less commonly, barring children from participation in school events until debt is repaid or having children wear a visual indicator of meal debt (e.g., a stamp or sticker). Lunch shaming instances have largely been reported in news articles from different states, and there are limited national data available on the prevalence of such practices (available data are discussed in the text box below).", "Many school districts report that unpaid meal costs create a financial burden on their meal programs (see text box below for more detail). In addition to federal funds, student payments for full and reduced-price meals are a primary source of revenue for school food programs. Schools have an interest in collecting this revenue to help fund operations. Also, according to federal regulations, if schools are unable to recover unpaid meal funds, the money becomes \"bad debt\" and the school or school district must use other nonfederal funding sources to cover the costs.", "Starting in 2010, Congress and USDA have taken actions to address the issue of unpaid meal costs. Section 143 of the HHFKA required USDA to examine states' and school districts' policies and practices regarding unpaid meal charges. As part of the review, the law required USDA to \"prepare a report on the feasibility of establishing national standards for meal charges and the provision of alternate meals\" and, if applicable, make recommendations related to the implementation of the standards. The law also permitted USDA to take follow-up actions based on the findings from the report. ", "USDA's subsequent Report to Congress in June 2016 ultimately did not recommend national standards, but instead recommended \"clarifying and updating policy guidance on specific national policies impacting unpaid meal charges and facilitating the development and distribution of best practices to support decision making by States and localities.\" USDA-FNS followed up with a memorandum requiring SFAs to institute and communicate, by July 1, 2017, a written meal charge policy, which was to include instructions on how to address situations in which a child does not pay for a meal. USDA-FNS also provided clarification through webinars, other memoranda, and a best practice guide.", "In the Report to Congress, USDA stated that its recommendation was based on findings from a study published by USDA-FNS in March 2014 and a Request for Information (RFI) on \"Unpaid Meal Charges\" published by USDA-FNS in October 2014. The findings from both the study and the RFI\u2014which garnered 462 comments\u2014showed that meal charge policies were largely determined at the school and school district levels rather than the state level. The responses to the RFI also indicated that such policies ranged in formality, with varying degrees of review (e.g., some required school board approval while others did not) and enforcement. In the RFI comments, school and district officials generally expressed a preference for local control of meal charge policies, while national advocacy groups generally favored national standards.", "The topics of lunch shaming and unpaid meal costs also surfaced in the 115 th Congress. For example, a provision in the FY2018 appropriations law stated that funds appropriated in the law could not be used in ways that result in discrimination against children eligible for free or reduced-price meals, including the practices of segregating children and overtly identifying children by special tokens or tickets (note that this does not pertain to children paying for full-price meals). Legislative proposals in the 115 th Congress included the Anti-Lunch Shaming Act of 2017 ( H.R. 2401 / S. 1064 ), which sought to establish national standards for how schools treat children unable to pay for a meal.

The law also gave SFAs the option to meet the requirements with specified nonfederal funding sources instead of raising prices. ", "According to the Senate committee report on the HHFKA, the requirements were intended \"to ensure that children receiving free and reduced price lunches receive the full value of federal funds.\" Prior to the paid lunch equity requirements, a USDA study found that federal subsidies for free and reduced-price lunches were cross-subsidizing other aspects of the meals programs, likely including paid lunches. This can occur because federal reimbursements for free, reduced-price, and paid lunches are all mixed into the same SFA-run \"nonprofit school food service account\" (NSFSA). Some observers argue, however, that raising prices may reduce participation in paid lunches.", "Under the paid lunch equity formula, the price per paid lunch must eventually match or exceed the difference between the federal reimbursements for free and paid lunches. If this is not the case, schools must increase prices over time until they make up the difference. For example, the federal reimbursement was $3.37 for free lunches and $0.37 for paid lunches SY2018-2019 for some schools. Under the requirements, if schools were not charging at least $3.00 per paid lunch, they would be required to increase the price of a paid lunch gradually, based on a formula, until they closed the gap (see Figure 1 ). Schools cannot be required to raise the price by more than 10 cents annually, but they may choose to do so.", "The HHFKA also included related requirements for revenue from \"nonprogram\" (i.e., competitive) foods. The law required that any revenue from nonprogram foods accrue to the SFA-run NSFSA. In practice, this prevents revenue from competitive foods from being used for other school purposes outside of food service. The law also required that, broadly speaking, revenue from nonprogram foods equal or exceed the costs of obtaining nonprogram foods (see the regulations for a specific formula). ", "In June 2011, USDA-FNS published an interim final rule implementing the requirements starting in SY2011-2012, offering some flexibility for that first year. USDA subsequently provided certain exemptions through agency guidance for SY2013-2014 through SY2017-2018 for SFAs \"in strong financial standing,\" as determined by state agencies based on different criteria. For SY2018-2019, the enacted FY2018 appropriation (Section 775 of P.L. 115-141 ) expanded the exemptions, requiring only SFAs with a negative balance in the NSFSA as of January 31, 2018, potentially to have to raise prices for paid meals.", "Other legislative proposals related to the paid lunch equity requirements were considered in recent Congresses. For example, the House committee's child nutrition reauthorization proposal in the 114 th Congress would have eliminated the requirements. The Senate committee's proposal would have replaced the requirements with a broader \"non-federal revenue target,\" which could have come from household payments for full-price lunches or other state and local contributions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
