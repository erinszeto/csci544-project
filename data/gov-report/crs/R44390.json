Some aspects of these proposals were included as part of the omnibus farm bill in 2014 and may be included in future farm bill reauthorizations. Despite gains in federal support for local food systems in recent years, some Members of Congress, as well as many community and farm advocacy groups, continue to argue that such food systems should play a larger role in U.S. farm policy and that the laws supporting agriculture should be revised to reflect broader, more equitable policies across a range of production systems, including local food systems. Those supporting the expansion of such policies often advocate for the creation of programs specifically targeting support for local food systems, as well as increasing funding for federal farm programs that support local foods. However, others in Congress oppose extending farm support programs to local food systems, which traditionally have not been a major constituency among other long-standing U.S. agricultural interests.

(For more information, see text box below.) In the late 1990s, the USDA-appointed National Commission on Small Farms, among other recommendations, emphasized the need to strengthen the \"local farm economy\" through policy changes within the department's federal programs as a way to better meet the needs of small farmers and ranchers. Although consumer interest in local foods has some of its roots in the late 1960s and concerns about the environment, growth in mainstream consumer demand has increased sharply in the past decade, along with consumer willingness to pay more for such products. ", "Despite the growing popularity of the local foods market, there is no established definition of what constitutes a \"local food.\" There is also no consensus about what primary factors would need to be considered if one were to construct a definition of what constitutes a \"local food.\" ", "In most cases, local foods refer to foods produced near where they are consumed, based on a certain geographic proximity (between farmer and consumer) or the number of miles the food travels from where it is grown to where it is ultimately purchased or consumed by the end user. Local foods may also refer to the types of marketing channels used between farmers and consumers. In other cases, however, local foods may invoke certain attributes desired by the consumers who purchase them, involving certain social or supply-chain characteristics in producing food, such as supporting small family farms, urban gardens, or farms using sustainable agriculture practices. The latter case also raises questions about how the local food movement may be used to address a perceived need, such as increasing access to fresh, nutritious foods for underserved communities or contributing to rural economic development. The lack of a universally agreed-upon definition, however, does raise questions about what a local food is and may also provide opportunities for fraud in the marketplace with the sale of foods that are marketed as \"local\" when they cannot be determined to be local.

The single statutory definition for \"locally or regionally produced agricultural food product\" in the United States applies to products transported less than 400 miles or within the state in which they are produced. In Canada, fresh fruits and vegetables cannot be labeled as \"local\" unless produced within about 31 miles (50 kilometers) of where they are sold. Most state definitions view \"local\" to mean grown within state borders; however, in some cases \"local\" may be defined as food grown within a certain geographic region that might cross state lines. Definitions based on geographic distance vary depending on the state or region and on whether the food is fresh or processed, among other factors.", "Most consumers, when they purchase local foods, have been shown to generally believe that their local purchases are sourced within a much smaller distance from where it is produced\u2014generally under 100 miles\u2014even though this may not actually be the case. Generally, consumers believe that locally marketed foods are produced on nearby small farms. ", "Two existing U.S. federal laws provide different definitions of local food production based on the geographic distance between food production and sales. These definitions differ in terms of the number of miles the food may be transported, but both require that food be sold within the state where it is produced to be considered local. The 2008 farm bill (as noted above) defined the term \"locally or regionally produced agricultural food product,\" as it pertains to eligibility under a USDA loan program, to mean \"any agricultural food product that is raised, produced, and distributed in ... the locality or region in which the final product is marketed, so that the total distance that the product is transported is less than 400 miles from the origin of the product \"; or \"any agricultural food product that is raised, produced, and distributed in ... the State in which the product is produced .\" Alternatively, food safety legislation enacted in 2010 defined a \"qualified enduser\"\u2014for the purposes of exempting smaller, local producers from regulation\u2014as ''the consumer of the food; or ... a restaurant or retail food establishment ... that is located ... in the same State as the farm that produced the food; or ... not more than 275 miles from such farm. \" ", "A 2013 European Commission report defines \"local farming\" as \"the production of agricultural products and foodstuffs with the aim of selling them in an area reasonably close to the farm of production\" and defines \"local food systems\" to mean \"production, processing, trading and consumption of food occur in a relatively small geographical area,\" but acknowledges that there is no uniform definition of the term \"local area.\" The report confirms that the term \"local area\" is intended to refer to a \"relatively small geographical area, there is no agreement on the distance, varying between 20 and 100 km [12 and 62 miles] from the point of production\" and that \"it is essentially the consumer who decides whether a product comes from a 'local area' or not.\"", "A 2013 survey of buyers of local foods indicates that most consumers (64%) consider food \"local\" if produced within a 100-mile radius of the store, while other consumers (37%) consider products from the same state to be local. Other information indicates that most consumers (more than 75%) consider \"local\" as produced within 50 miles, while more than 20% consider \"local\" as produced within 100 miles (with the remainder willing to consider distances of more than 100 miles as \"local\").", "Elsewhere within USDA and other federal agencies, many examples exist of very specific statutory definitions for \"farms\" and \"food facilities\" that govern a range of programs and policies.

Compared to 2007, the number of farms selling directly to consumers increased 6%, and total direct sales to consumers increased 8%. The average value of direct consumer sales per farm was $9,063. Four states\u2014California, New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan\u2014accounted for one-third of all direct consumer sales.

The remaining products are marketed through intermediated marketing outlets only or through both direct-to-consumer and intermediate marketing outlets ( Table 1 ).", "The majority of farms selling food products directly to consumers are considered small farms. USDA reports that three-fourth of farms selling directly to consumers had annual sales of less than $5,000 in 2012, accounting for 11% of total sales. Farms with annual sales of more than $50,000 accounted for only 3% of farms but the majority of total sales (58%). Previous analysis by USDA using 2007 Census data provides additional information. At small-sized farms (defined as farms with sales of less than $50,000), 78% of all local sales were through direct-to-consumer channels, with 22% of sales made through intermediated market channels, including grocers, restaurants, and regional distributors ( Figure 2 ). This compared with larger farms (sales of more than $250,000), where 40% of all sales were through intermediated channels.", "Most indications are that support for agriculture and the local economy appear to be perhaps the most important motivator to consumers for buying local food products, although other factors also rank highly ( Figure 3 ).

Among other study findings: about 30% of those surveyed said they would switch stores if their preferred store did not carry local foods and indicated that their main source for local food is local farmers' markets and farm stores.", "Consumer support could potentially help small businesses address some of the perceived challenges for marketing locally sourced foods. USDA and others report that business barriers to market entry and expansion in local food markets include capacity constraints for small farms; lack of distribution systems for moving local food into mainstream markets; lack of resources for capital and infrastructure investments; and limited research, education, and training for marketing local food. Other challenges facing producers include access to processing and packaging services; delivery procedures; consistency (volume and quality); uncertainties related to regulations that may affect local food production, such as food safety requirements; and the need for traceback of foods to their origin.

Other attributes may include perceived higher product quality and freshness of local food; a desire to provide social and political support for local farmers and the local economy; farmland preservation; concerns about environmental impacts, energy use, and the perception that local foods are more environmentally friendly (limited use of chemicals, energy-based fertilizers, and pesticides); perceived better food safety given shorter supply chains; sense of social justice (perceived fairer labor prices and fair price for farmers); knowing the source of the product; a commitment to establishing closer connections between consumers and agricultural producers; and, generally, a response to concerns about industrialized commercial agriculture.

Often it is important to consumers that they know that production and distribution occur within a specific region, or that consumers are informed about the local nature of products, in some cases through personal communication with the farmers. Regardless of the distance the food travels from the production area to the consumer, many of these factors inherently influence consumer demand for products marketed and perceived to be \"local.\" The desire to support nearby small and medium-sized farms is also a motivation for consumers. USDA reports that small farms rely more on direct-to-consumer marketing channels (farmers' markets, on-farm sales, roadside stands, CSAs, etc.) as compared to larger farms. ", "Support for farms using sustainable agriculture practices is often claimed as a motivation driving demand for local foods. However, just as there is no single definition of \"local\" foods, much debate exists about what constitutes \"sustainable agriculture.\" USDA's Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education (SARE) program has identified three pillars of sustainability. These include profit over the long term; stewardship of the nation's land, air, and water; and quality of life for farmers, ranchers, and their communities. Another widely used definition also integrates three main goals\u2014environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic equity.

Other reported benefits claim that buying directly from farmers allows producers to retain a greater portion of the value-added costs often captured by other businesses in the supply chain or middlemen, and also increases the likelihood that money spent remains in the local community; also, eating locally grown foods is correlated with improved nutrition and the increased likelihood of making healthier food choices. Some of these claimed benefits have been disputed. In addition to raising questions about the general assumption that \"local\" is inherently good, other criticisms cite reduced productivity and inefficient use of resources in food production; questions about ecological sustainability and community effects; and concerns about food quality and food safety.

However, few academic studies have quantified how local food markets may affect the economic development, health, or environmental quality of communities. USDA also claims there are economic gains to the U.S. farm economy from programs that support increasing the number of farmers' markets nationwide and programs promoting the use of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) at farmers' markets, as well as programs to increase purchases of local foods by school districts and institutions. Results from the limited number of available economic studies suggest that expanding local food systems in a community can increase employment and income in that community; however, evidence is insufficient to determine whether local food availability improves diet quality or food security and whether localized production results in a reduction of overall energy use or in greenhouse gas emissions. ", "Most available economic studies rely on input-output analysis to generate \"economic multipliers\" that estimate changes in the economy (e.g., number of jobs) from a change in economic activity. For example, USDA reports that operators of fruit and vegetable farms with local food sales generate an estimated 13 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs per $1 million in sales (which is estimated as greater than the number of jobs created by fruit and vegetable farms not engaged in local food sales). Other studies have shown estimated gains in both farm sector output and gross state product from farmers' markets and also gains in output and employment from food hub development.

Previously, in March 2012, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry held a hearing addressing these and other related issues regarding local food systems. Other House and Senate farm bill briefings have been conducted over the years on a variety of topics related to local and regional food systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Laws", "paragraphs": ["A number of states and cities have enacted a variety of laws and policies affecting local food systems, including requirements regarding licensing, permitting, zoning, and public health, as well as initiatives regarding urban farming, housing of animals, and also nuisance ordinances. A number of cities and localities have convened urban agriculture workgroups that have issued a series of recommendations specific to different regions and production areas, which are available through online searches. A compilation of these state laws, rules, and requirements is beyond the scope of this report that focuses on federal programs, which are designed to support the development of local and regional food systems. ", "In addition, most states have enacted laws regarding \"cottage foods\" generally regarded as non-potentially hazardous foods (such as baked goods, jams, and jellies). Many states allow producers to make these goods in their homes, rather than in a commercial kitchen, and intend to reduce the barriers to entry for small-scale food producers. Cottage food laws vary among states, with some being more restrictive than others.

Despite these gains, many community and farm advocacy groups continue to argue that such food systems should play a larger policy role within the farm bill, and that the laws should be revised to reflect broader, more equitable policies across a range of production systems, including local food systems. ", "Many in Congress have historically defended the existing farm support programs as a means to ensure that the United States has continued access to the \"most abundant, safest, and most affordable food supplies in the world.\" However, there are long-standing criticisms of the traditional farm subsidy programs administered by USDA. Some criticize the fact that the core farm bill programs are focused on selected commodities\u2014corn, wheat, cotton, rice, soybeans, dairy, and sugar\u2014and there have been calls from both inside and outside Congress to revamp U.S. farm programs. Among other program criticisms are concerns about the overall effectiveness of farm programs and the cost to taxpayers and consumers, as well as questions about whether continued farm support is even necessary, given that many support programs were established many decades ago and are considered by some to be no longer compatible with current national economic objectives, global trading rules, and federal budgetary or regulatory policies. ", "In addition to calls for increased equity among all U.S. food producers\u2014regardless of farm size, type of food, or how it is produced\u2014various programmatic changes have been proposed, some of which dovetail with efforts by supporters of local food systems. Some researchers recommend that the most appropriate role for public policy is to reduce market barriers to local food production through policies that provide support for supply chain development and marketing, and also assistance with regulatory compliance.", "Some in Congress continue to express the need to change farm policies in ways that might further enhance support for local food systems and rural communities, arguing that U.S. farm policy should be modified to reflect broader, more equitable treatment across a range of production systems, including local food systems. Supporters often cite the increasing popularity of local foods and a general belief that purchasing local foods helps support local farm economies and/or farmers that use certain production practices that some consider more environmentally sustainable. Rising popularity is attributed to both increasing consumer demand and a desire among agricultural producers to take advantage of market opportunities within local and regional markets. Others contend that subsidizing the more traditional agriculture producers creates a competitive disadvantage to other producers who do not receive such support. ", "Others in Congress oppose extending farm bill support to explicitly support local food producers, who are already eligible for many farm bill programs. Some may be opposed to extending farm bill support to local and regional food systems, which traditionally have not been a major constituency among other long-standing U.S. agricultural interests. Those opposed to extending farm bill benefits to local food systems cite concerns about overall limited financial resources to support U.S. agricultural producers as well as concerns that the most efficient and productive use of natural resources be employed for producing food. As shown by challenges from some in Congress to USDA's \"Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food\" initiative, concerns have been expressed about the perceived priorities of USDA and fear that a shift in priorities may result in fewer resources for \"conventional farmers who produce the vast majority of our nation's food supply.\" (For more information, see accompanying discussion in the section titled \" Administration Initiatives .\") Other criticisms highlight the lack of an established definition of what constitutes a \"local food\" and also perception that USDA's support of local foods is mostly targeted to affluent consumers in urban areas, rather than farmers in rural communities."], "subsections": []}]}}
