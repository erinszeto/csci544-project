Congress generally controls spending on mandatory programs by setting rules for eligibility, benefit formulas, and other parameters rather than approving specific dollar amounts for these programs each year. Eligibility for mandatory programs is usually written into authorizing law, and any individual or entity that meets the eligibility requirements is entitled to the benefits authorized by the law. Spending for discretionary programs is controlled by annual appropriations acts. The subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees originate bills each year that decide how much funding to devote to continuing current activities as well as any new discretionary programs.", "Approximately 80% of total spending within the USDA is classified as mandatory, which by definition occurs outside of annual appropriations. The vast majority of USDA's mandatory spending is for the following programs: the food stamp program and most child nutrition programs; the farm commodity price and income support programs (including ongoing programs authorized by the 2002 farm bill and emergency programs authorized by various appropriations acts); the federal crop insurance program; and various agricultural conservation and trade programs.", "Although these programs have mandatory status, many of these accounts ultimately receive funds in the annual agriculture appropriations act. For example, the food stamp and child nutrition programs are funded by an annual appropriation based on projected spending needs. Supplemental appropriations generally are made if these estimates fall short of required spending. An annual appropriation also is made to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for losses in financing the commodity support programs and the various other programs it finances.", "The other 20% of the USDA budget is for discretionary programs, which with the exception of the Forest Service are funded in the Agriculture appropriations act (Forest Service programs are funded in the Interior appropriations act).

The CCC is a wholly owned government corporation. It has the legal authority to borrow up to $30 billion at any one time from the U.S. Treasury. These borrowed funds are used to finance spending for ongoing programs such as farm commodity price and income support activities and various conservation, trade, and rural development programs. Emergency supplemental spending also has been paid from the CCC over the years, particularly for ad hoc farm disaster payments, and direct market loss payments to growers of various commodities in response to low farm commodity prices.", "The CCC eventually must repay the funds it borrows from the Treasury. Because the CCC never earns more than it spends, its losses must be replenished periodically through a congressional appropriation so that its $30 billion borrowing authority (debt limit) is not depleted. Congress generally provides this infusion through the annual USDA appropriation law. Because most of this spending rises or falls automatically on economic or weather conditions, funding needs are sometimes difficult to estimate. In recent years, the CCC has received a \"current indefinite appropriation,\" which provides \"such sums as are necessary\" during the fiscal year.", "P.L. 109-97 provides the CCC with an indefinite appropriation (\"such sums as necessary\") for FY2006 estimated at $25.690 billion. This concurs with both the House and Senate bills and the Administration's request. The recommended FY2006 appropriation is about $9.2 billion (+56%) above the estimated FY2005 appropriation of $16.452 billion.

It does not reflect any changes in programs enacted in the appropriations act.", "The estimated CCC appropriation is not a reflection of expected outlays. Outlays in FY2006 are funded initially through the borrowing authority of the CCC, and later reimbursed through a future appropriation.

Final action is expected shortly after the 109 th Congress returns for its second session.", "Most of the reduction in farm programs comes from changing the timing of direct payments without reducing the overall level of payments to farmers. Prior to reconciliation, up to 50% of direct payments were paid in advance of the crop year. The conference agreement reduces the advance payment rate to 40% in the 2006 crop year and to 22% in 2007. Not included in the conference agreement is an across-the board cut in farm commodity payments, which was recommended at different levels in the House-and Senate-passed bills.

It offers basically free catastrophic insurance to producers who grow an insurable crop. Producers who opt for this coverage have the opportunity to purchase additional insurance coverage at a subsidized rate. Policies are sold and completely serviced through approved private insurance companies that have their program losses reinsured by USDA. The annual agriculture appropriations bill traditionally makes two separate appropriations for the federal crop insurance program. It provides discretionary funding for the salaries and expenses of the RMA. It also provides \"such sums as are necessary\" for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund, which pays all other expenses of the program, including premium subsidies, indemnity payments, and reimbursements to the private insurance companies.", "P.L. 109-97 concurs with the Administration request for such sums as are necessary for the mandatory-funded Federal Crop Insurance Fund (Fund), which the Administration estimates to be $3.159 billion for FY2006, compared with $4.095 billion that was estimated for FY2005 at the time of enactment of the FY2005 appropriations bill. Annual spending on the crop insurance program is difficult to predict in advance and is dependent on weather and crop growing conditions and farmer participation rates. Hence, both the FY2005 and FY2006 estimates for the Fund are subject to significant revision over the course of the year.", "For the discretionary component of the crop insurance program, P.L. 109-97 provides $77.05 million for FY2006 RMA salaries and expenses, lower than the House-passed level of $77.8 million, but above the Senate-passed level of $73.45 million. The final FY2006 level is above the enacted FY2005 level of $71.47 million, but below the Administration's FY2006 request of $87.8 million. Included in the conference level is $3.6 million requested by the Administration to support RMA's ongoing efforts to reduce waste and abuse within the crop insurance program. For the last several years, mandatory funds from the Fund have been used for this purpose. However, the legislative authority to tap these funds expired at the end of FY2005. As in the past three years, most of the increase requested by the Administration was for various new information technology (IT) initiatives. Over the past couple of years, appropriators have not funded this request. Of the $12 million requested increase for various IT initiatives, P.L. 109-97 concurs with the Senate and provides $1 million, compared with $1.5 million in the House-passed bill.", "P.L. 109-97 also adopts a modified version of a House provision that prohibits RMA from using funds to implement the premium discount plan (PDP). The Senate-passed version was silent on this issue. Appropriators prohibit USDA from using any FY2006 funds to implement or administer the PDP for the 2007 reinsurance year. Conferees also specifically prohibit the issuance of any regulations, bulletins, or policy or agency guidance. The version in the House-passed bill would have prohibited implementing or administering the PDP for the 2006 reinsurance year (which began on July 1, 2005). The PDP allows crop insurance companies that can demonstrate cost savings in their delivery of insurance to sell policies to their customers at a discount. For example, one participating company has reduced its costs by selling its policies directly to customers online. Independent insurance agents, which sell crop insurance on behalf of the crop insurance companies, are concerned that the PDP reduces their total commissions and damages their profitability. Some farm groups contend that the PDP encourages cherry-picking of the best customers and might leave smaller farmers uninsured.", "The Administration's FY2006 budget request contained legislative proposals affecting the crop insurance program that, if they had been adopted by Congress, would have saved $140 million annually, beginning in FY2007. Neither chamber addressed these modifications to the crop insurance program during the FY2006 agriculture appropriations debate. Also, the conference agreement on the FY2006 omnibus budget reconciliation act ( H.Rept. 109-362 , S. 1932 ) did not contain any legislative changes to the crop insurance program.

This language is stronger than in past appropriations reports because of the negative reaction to the \"FSA Tomorrow\" plan in which USDA planned to close several hundred county offices but did not notify or consult with Congress before press reports revealed the plans. The FY2006 House report reiterates concern expressed in prior years' appropriations reports instructing USDA not to shut down or consolidate any FSA county offices unless rigorous analysis proves such action to be cost-effective.

The loan subsidy is 3.4% below FY2005, while the loan authority rises by 1.8%. The overall loan authority can rise while the loan subsidy falls because (1) the guaranteed loan program grows more than the direct loan program, and (2) the multiplier (loan authority divided by loan subsidy) rises for most programs as a result of USDA factoring in low interest rates and a history of fewer defaults by borrowers.", "Most of the growth in loan authority over FY2005 levels is a $59 million increase in unsubsidized guaranteed farm operating loans (an increase of about 5.4%, to $1.15 billion in FY2006).
