Congress has not enacted a comprehensive foreign aid authorization bill since 1985, leaving most foreign assistance programs without regular authorizations originating from the legislative oversight committees. As a result, Foreign Operations spending measures developed by the appropriations committees increasingly have expanded their scope beyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guiding both executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It has been largely through Foreign Operations appropriations that the United States has modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the Cold War.

Other security assistance activities provided defense equipment and training to American allies and friendly states, some of which faced Soviet or Soviet-proxy threats. Aid programs also were used to help the United States gain access to military bases around the world in order to forward deploy American forces. Diplomacy emphasized strengthening alliances and building coalitions to isolate and confront the Soviet threat.", "Foreign aid and diplomatic programs also supported a number of secondary U.S. policy goals in the developing world, such as reducing high rates of population growth, promoting wider access to health care, expanding the availability of basic education, advancing U.S. trade interests, and protecting the environment.

Since the Vietnam War, American embassies have increasingly been the targets of hostile action. Terrorist attacks grew in number in the 1970s, the decade ending with the taking of American hostages in Tehran in 1979. Similarly, in the early 1980s, the State Department recognized a greater need to tighten security after the 1983 bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, and the bombing of the embassy annex in Beirut in 1984. In 1985, a report by the Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, headed by Admiral Bobby Inman, set new standards for security measures at U.S. facilities around the world. In 1986 Congress provided an embassy supplemental appropriation to meet those standards. Again in August 1998, another major attack occurred on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Later that year, Congress passed an emergency supplemental that sharply increased total State Department spending.

Congress appropriated $670 million for the peacekeeping supplemental in 1994, more than doubling the international peacekeeping account that year.", "During this same period, both Congress and the Administration struggled to reduce the Federal deficit. Some Members contended that, with the end of the Cold War, a peace dividend could be derived, and believed that foreign policy agency funding could be trimmed to help meet growing budget pressures.

However, the $57.5 billion House SSJC Subcommittee allocation was 5.2% less than the Administration's request.

The Senate version approved $242 million, as requested, but added an additional $320 million in food assistance, some of which could be used in Darfur, and $90 million that could have been transferred to meet humanitarian and peacekeeping needs. Sudan peace implementation aid\u2014$37 million, as had been included in the House measure. Conferees deleted $63 million in rehabilitation and reconstruction funding. The Senate bill had included the entire $100 million request. Palestinian aid\u2014$200 million, as requested and passed in earlier House and Senate votes. The conference measure set aside $50 million, similar to the Senate version, for Israel to help facilitate the movement of Palestinian people and goods in and out of Israel. None of the funds can be used for direct aid to the Palestinian Authority. Pakistan military aid\u2014$150 million, as requested. Jordan economic and military aid\u2014$200 million, as requested. Iraq embassy\u2014$592 million, $66 million below the request. This is the same level as in the Senate bill, while the House measure included an amendment barring the use of the funds for construction of the embassy. Peacekeeping\u2014$680 million, $100 million below the request. The conference amount is higher than both the House ($580 million) and Senate ($442 million). Tsunami relief and prevention\u2014$656 million for relief and $25.4 million for prevention, the same as in the Senate bill. The House-passed amount was slightly higher. The conference agreement provided authority (but not the $45 million requested) to defer and reschedule debt owed by tsunami-affected countries. The House bill had not granted such authority. Partners Fund and Solidarity Fund\u2014No funds were provided for the Partners Fund ($200 million proposed), while the full $200 million request for the Solidarity Fund was included. In addition, the conference agreements added $30 million for other Global War on Terror security assistance, as determined by the President. The House had denied all funding for these purposes, while the Senate approved $225.5 million for the two contingency funds. Ukraine aid\u2014$60 million, as requested and including in the Senate measure. The House had approved $33.7 million. In addition, similar to the Senate, the conference agreement provided $10 million for other regional aid requirements in Belarus and the North Caucasus. Haiti assistance\u2014$20 million, of which $2.5 million for criminal case management, case tracking, and the reduction of pre-trial detention in Haiti, similar to the Senate position. The $20 million had not been requested or included by the House. Iraqi families and communities affected by military operations\u2014$20 million for civilians who have suffered losses due to military activities, similar to a Senate-added provision. These funds will be drawn from the $18.44 billion appropriated in P.L. 108-106 , the FY2004 emergency supplemental for Iraq reconstruction.", " Table 14 (below) summarizes the spending request and
