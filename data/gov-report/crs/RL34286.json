{"id": "RL34286", "title": "Insurance Regulation: Federal Charter Legislation", "released_date": "2011-02-03T00:00:00", "summary": ["Insurance is one of three primary sectors of the financial services industry. Unlike the other two, banks and securities, insurance is primarily regulated at the state, rather than federal, level. The primacy of state regulation dates back to 1868 when the Supreme Court found in Paul v. Virginia (75 U.S. (8 Wall.) 168 (1868)) that insurance did not constitute interstate commerce, and thus did not fall under the powers granted the federal government in the Constitution. In 1944, however, the Court cast doubt on this finding in United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)). Preferring to leave the state regulatory system intact in the aftermath of this decision, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 (P.L. 79-15, 59 Stat. 33), which reaffirmed the states as principal regulators of insurance. Over the years since 1945, congressional interest in the possibility of repealing McCarran-Ferguson and reclaiming authority over insurance regulation has waxed and waned.", "Particularly since the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-102, 113 Stat. 1338), the financial services industry has seen increased competition among U.S. banks, insurers, and securities firms and on a global scale. Some have complained that the state regulatory system puts insurers at a competitive disadvantage. Whereas the insurance industry had previously been united in preferring the state system, it has now splintered, with larger insurers tending to argue for a federal system and smaller insurers tending to favor the state system.", "Some members of Congress have responded with different proposals ranging from a complete federalization of the interstate insurance industry, to leaving the state system intact with limited federal standards and preemptions. A common proposal in the past has been for an Optional Federal Charter (OFC) for the insurance industry. This idea borrows the idea of a dual regulatory system from the banking system. Both the states and the federal government would offer a chartering system for insurers, with the insurers having the choice between the two. OFC legislation was offered in the 107th, 109th, and 110th Congresses.", "Proponents of OFC legislation typically have cited the efficiencies that could be gained from a uniform system, along with the ability of a federal regulator to better address the complexities of the current insurance market and ongoing financial crisis as well as the need for a single federal voice for the insurance industry in international negotiations. Opponents of OFC legislation have been typically concerned with the inability of a federal regulator to take into account local conditions, the lack of consumer service that could result from a nonlocal administrator in Washington, DC, and the overall deregulation contained in some of the OFC proposals.", "The recent financial crisis gave greater urgency to calls for federal oversight of insurance and has changed the tenor of the debate. The National Insurance Consumer Protection Act of 2009 (H.R. 1880) was introduced in the 111th Congress by two previous sponsors of OFC legislation. This bill differed significantly from previous OFC bills as it included the creation of a new systemic risk regulator with the power to mandate the adoption of a federal charter by some insurers. The broad Dodd-Frank Act (P.L. 111-203) that was enacted to reform the financial system included some insurance aspects, but did not include a federal charter for insurance. Such legislation has not been introduced in the 112th Congress.", "This report offers a brief analysis of the forces prompting federal chartering legislation, followed by a discussion of the arguments for and against a federal charter, and summaries of previous legislation. It will be updated as legislative events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Insurance is one of three primary sectors of the financial services industry.

Over the years since 1945, congressional interest in the possibility of repealing or amending McCarran-Ferguson and reclaiming authority over insurance regulation has waxed and waned.", "In 1974, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) preempting state laws governing many health benefit plans offered by employers, thus essentially federalizing much of the regulation of health insurance. In 1980, Congress curtailed the authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate the insurance industry, reducing a small avenue of federal oversight on insurance. In the early 1990s, a bill to repeal the limited antitrust exemption granted insurers in McCarran-Ferguson, and thus expand federal oversight of insurance, was reported out of committee in the House, but never reached the House floor. In 1999, Congress passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which specifically reaffirmed the states as the functional regulators of insurance.", "GLBA may have statutorily reaffirmed the primacy of state regulation of insurance, but it also unleashed market forces that were already encouraging a greater federal role. GLBA removed legal barriers between securities firms, banks, and insurers, which, along with improved technology, have been an important factor in creating more direct competition among the three groups. Many financial products have converged, so that products with similar economic outcomes may be available from different financial services firms with dramatically different regulators. Insurers face 50 different state regulators and state laws, many of which differ on some particulars of insurance regulation. This has led to industry complaints of overlapping, and sometimes contradictory, regulatory edicts driving up the cost of compliance and increasing the time necessary to bring new products to market. These complaints existed prior to GLBA, but the insurance industry generally resisted federalization of insurance regulation at the time. Facing a new world of competition, however, the industry split, with larger insurers tending to favor some form of federal regulation, and smaller insurers tending to favor a continuation of the state regulatory system. Life insurers tend to more directly compete with banks and securities firms, so they have tended to favor some form of federal charter more than property/casualty insurers.", "Some members of Congress have responded to the changing environment in the financial services industry with a variety of legislation. In the 108 th Congress, Senator Ernest Hollings introduced S. 1373 to create a mandatory federal charter for insurance. In the 108 th and 109 th Congresses, Representative Richard Baker drafted, but never introduced, the SMART Act that would have left the states the primary regulators, but harmonized the system through various federal preemptions. The most consistent response has been the introduction of legislation calling for an Optional Federal Charter (OFC) for insurance.", "OFC legislation was first introduced in the 107 th Congress, with bills being introduced in the 109 th and 110 th Congresses as well. Specifics of OFC legislation can vary widely, but the common thread is the creation of a dual regulatory system, inspired by the current banking regulatory system. OFC bills generally would create a federal insurance regulator that would operate concurrently with the present state system. Insurers would be able to choose whether to take out a federal charter, which would exempt them from most state insurance regulations, or to continue under a state charter and the 50 state system of insurance regulation. Given the greater uniformity of life insurance products and the greater competition faced by life insurers, some have suggested the possibility of OFC legislation that would apply only to life insurers, but no such bills have been introduced.", "The recent financial crisis affected the debate over federal chartering for insurers in a variety of ways. Some aspects of the crisis gave additional arguments for federal chartering, whereas other aspects have given additional arguments against federal chartering. One specific concern that many have advanced in the crisis has been the negative aspects of allowing financial institutions to choose their regulators. The broad federal charter bill in the 111 th Congress, H.R. 1880 , addressed this by adding some mandatory aspects to a framework similar to the previous OFC bills.", "During the December 2, 2009, House Financial Services Committee markup of H.R. 2609 , a bill to create a Federal Office of Insurance, two amendments were offered to create federal licenses and regulation of specific lines of insurance. Representative Dennis Moore offered an amendment (no. 3) that would have created an optional federal license for reinsurers, while Representatives Ed Royce and Melissa Bean offered an amendment (no. 7) that would have created an optional federal license for financial guarantee insurers. Both were withdrawn before votes were taken on the amendments. H.R. 2609 was incorporated into H.R. 4173 , which was ultimately enacted as the Dodd-Frank Act and included some insurance provisions, but did not include a federal charter for insurance. Representative Moore introduced his amendment creating a federal license for reinsurers as a standalone bill, H.R. 6529 , on December 16, 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Debate on Federal Chartering for Insurers", "paragraphs": ["Many different arguments have been advanced for and against a dual regulatory system for insurance.

A federal insurance regulator could be a knowledgeable voice and an insurance advocate in Washington, DC. (The Dodd-Frank Act addressed this to some degree through the creation of a \"Federal Insurance Office,\" though this office has no regulatory powers.) The Comptroller of the Currency has successfully promoted the expansion of bank products through preemption of state laws, providing a model for the insurance sector. The increase of \"speed to market\" for product approval so insurers will not be at a disadvantage in product creation and delivery. The creation of a regulatory environment more accommodating of growth and innovation as a result of competition between federal and state regulators. The ability to achieve national treatment, so that a single charter would allow insurers to do business in all states and avoid higher costs of state regulation due to the need to comply with up to 50 state regulators. Potential difficulty insurers face in international trade without a regulator at the national level. Greater supply of insurance and lower cost to consumers as insurance companies are forced to compete on a national scale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments Against a Dual System and for State Regulation", "paragraphs": ["The arguments of those who oppose federal regulation of insurance companies, preferring that the state insurance regulatory system be maintained, have included the following:", "State regulated insurers have performed relatively well through the financial crisis, underscoring the quality of state regulation. State insurance regulators have a better understanding of local markets and conditions that would a federal regulator. State regulation is more flexible and adaptable to local conditions. The diversity of state regulation reduces the impact of any poor regulation and promotes innovation and good regulation. There are strong incentives, such as those provided by direct election, for state regulators to do the job effectively at the state level. The risk that the new federal bureaucracy would end up being redundant and costly. Fiscal damage to the states should state premium taxes be reduced by a federal system. The fragmentation of the overall insurance regulatory system that could result from dual chartering and state/federal oversight. The possibility of a \"race to the bottom\" as state and federal regulators compete to give insurers more favorable treatment and thus secure greater oversight authority and budget.", "In the abstract, the federal chartering question could be simply about the \"who\" of regulation. Should it be the federal government, the states, or some combination of the two? In practice, however, federal chartering legislation has had much to say about the \"how\" of regulation. Should the government continue the same fine degree of industry oversight that states have practiced in the past? Aside from Senator Hollings' bill in the 108 th Congress, the federal chartering bills that have been introduced to this point have tended to answer the latter question negatively\u2014the federal regulator to be created would exercise less regulatory oversight than would most state regulators.

The bill was referred to the House Financial Services Committee, House Judiciary Committee, and House Energy and Commerce Committee. No hearings or markups were held on this bill.", "H.R. 1880 would have created a federal chartering and regulatory apparatus for the insurance industry, including insurers, insurance agencies, and independent insurance producers. The Office of National Insurance (ONI) and a National Insurance Commissioner (NIC) would have been established in the Department of the Treasury, but with significant independence; the Secretary of the Treasury would have been forbidden from interfering in specific matters before the commissioner; the ONI's budget would have been funded by fees and assessments on insurers; and the commissioner would have been appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. These terms are similar to those of other financial regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.", "The federal regulatory system in H.R. 1880 would have applied to property/casualty and life insurance and reinsurance, with the exception of title insurance. Federally licensed insurance producers were specifically allowed to sell surplus lines insurance. Holders of a national charter or license would have been exempt from most state insurance laws, including \"any form of licensing, examination, reporting, regulation, or supervision by a State relating to the insurance operations of such insurer.\" Thus, nationally licensed insurers, agencies, and producers would have been able to operate in the entire United States without fulfilling the requirements of the 50 states' insurance laws. This exemption, however, did not extend to state premium tax laws, so national insurers would have continued to pay these taxes. The bill would have affected state taxes with regard to surplus lines insurance, forbidding states that are not the home state of the insured from collecting these taxes.", "In terms of the substance of regulation, the most significant specific change in H.R. 1880 compared with the way most states currently regulate insurance involves regulation of insurance rates and forms. Currently every state has some measure of rate and form regulation. In some states, insurers must get specific prior approval for changes to rates and forms, whereas in others insurers may have some freedom to change rates and forms with the possibility that the state insurance commissioner could disallow the change after the fact. This bill, however, would have specifically disallowed the NIC from regulating insurance rates. With regard to form regulation, the commissioner would have had the power to set general form requirements and insurers would have been required to file insurance forms with the commissioner along with a certification that the forms met the established requirements.", "H.R. 1880 would have specifically addressed the issue of systemic risk brought to the fore in the recent financial crisis in two ways. It would have required that a financial regulator other than the ONI be designated a systemic risk regulator for insurance with power over both national insurers and state insurers. This regulator would have had broad oversight powers, including the ability, in consultation with the NIC, to require an insurer be federally chartered. H.R. 1880 would also have created a \"Coordinating National Council for Financial Regulators\" made up of the heads of the various federal financial regulators along with the Secretary of the Treasury. This council would have been responsible for monitoring the financial system for systemic risk with the specific power to determine when the systemic risk regulator could issue a rule or direct order covering an insurer that presented systemic risk.", "H.R. 1880 shared many aspects with previous optional federal chartering bills, including legislation introduced by Representatives Bean and Royce. Under H.R. 1880 , many insurers would have had the option to choose whether to operate under a federal or state system. The system to be put in place by the bill, however, has two specific non-optional aspects: (1) The NIC had the specific authority to deny an application from a national insurer to convert to a state charter; and (2) the systemic risk regulator had the specific authority to require an insurer to become federally chartered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal License for Reinsurers Act of 2010 (H.R. 6529)", "paragraphs": ["Representative Dennis Moore introduced H.R. 6529 on December 16, 2010.

Both would have created the option of a federal charter for the insurance industry, including insurers, insurance agencies, and independent insurance producers.

Rate regulation would not have been applicable to national insurers. Form regulation, the ability of the regulator to control what will and will not be included in an insurance policy, would have been reduced substantially compared with most states. Fees covering the cost of the system would have been assessed on those operating under the federal system. National insurers would have continued to pay state premium taxes, so there should be no loss of premium tax revenue to the states.

Reform of the state regulation of surplus lines insurance\u2014only the state in which the insured resides or does business would be allowed to tax surplus lines insurance.

H.R. 3200 would have broadened slightly and clarify antifraud language.", "Beyond the general aspects inherent in the OFC concept, such as the dual, competing regulatory structures and uniform regulation across the country, the most striking specific aspect of S. 40 and H.R. 3200 was the lessening of the rate and form regulation under these bills as compared to the current system. Currently every state has some measure of rate and form regulation. In some states, insurers must get specific prior approval for changes to rates and forms, while in others insurers may have some freedom to change rates and forms with the possibility that the state insurance commissioner could disallow the change after the fact.
