In 2004, the state issued regulations to reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles. At least 14 other states have indicated that they plan to implement California's new vehicle requirements. In 2006, California passed two climate change statutes. The first establishes a statewide cap on GHG emissions. The second, once it becomes applicable, effectively limits the use of coal-generated electricity in California. The state has also taken action to reduce the carbon intensity in its transportation fuels.", "The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a partnership of10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, sets up a cap-and-trade system aimed at limiting carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The cap is scheduled to take effect in January 2009 and cap carbon dioxide emissions at 188 million short tons through the end of 2014. In 2015, the cap would begin to decrease, so that by 2018, emissions would be capped at 10% below the initial level. Because some observers see RGGI as a possible model for a federal cap-and-trade program, several of RGGI's design elements are generating interest and debate.", "Predicting the precise consequences of these state-led climate change actions is difficult. The actions may affect energy markets to some degree by encouraging the use of fewer carbon-intensive fuels. Many observers suggest that the range of state actions will catalyze federal activity.

This prospect is causing some industry leaders to call for a federal climate change program. If Congress seeks to establish a federal program, the experiences and lessons learned in the states may be instructive.", "The RGGI and climate change activities in California are aggressive, but the resulting emission reductions may be offset by increased emissions in states without such requirements.

This emissions performance standard will apply to both in-state power plants and out-of-state facilities that seek to export electricity to California. The law directs the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to issue standards for investor-owned facilities, which in 2003 accounted for 68% of the electricity consumed in California. The PUC issued interim performance standards January 25, 2007. To address the electricity consumption from publicly owned utilities, the statute directs the California Energy Commission to issue comparable regulations by June 30, 2007. As of the date of this report, these regulations are still under development.", "The new performance standards complement the statewide GHG reduction program. The implementation of AB 32 is several years away (irrespective of legal challenges). The performance standards act as a stop-gap measure, preventing further utility investment in carbon-intensive fuels while the state is crafting an economy-wide reduction regime.", "As previous power commitments expire and are exchanged with contracts that meet the new GHG performance standard, California's portfolio of energy sources will change. The statute and its accompanying regulations, once in full effect, would appear to prohibit California consumers from using electricity generated by conventional coal-fired power plants. Compared with a combined-cycle natural gas plant, a conventional coal-fired power plant emits more than twice the amount of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. Using current technologies, coal-fired generators would fail to meet the new emissions standard.", "From 2002 through 2005, approximately 20% of California's electricity was generated from coal ( Figure 2 ). As the law takes effect, California will likely need to reduce/conserve a comparable amount of energy or replace the coal-generated electricity with alternative sources of power.", "The new performance standards will affect not only California, but also other states in the West. Although California's electricity imports generally fall between 22% and 32% of the state's total electricity consumption, its imports are responsible for 39% to 57% of the total GHG emissions linked with its electricity. This is because most of California's in-state electricity is produced from sources other than coal, whereas most of the state's imported electricity is generated through coal combustion ( Figure 2 ). Once the standard takes effect (and former power contracts expire), the coal-fired plants in neighboring states, which previously provided electricity to California, will need to look elsewhere for customers. The same goes for coal-fired power plants still in development in western states, which may have been designed, at least in part, to serve California consumers. Arguably, the GHG performance standards disproportionately affect the neighboring states that have historically exported coal-generated electricity to California consumers. This possible consequence may raise legal issues, such as a state's general inability to regulate interstate commerce.

EPA ) provided clarification on this issue. The Court found no doubt that the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to regulate GHG emissions (in this case, from new motor vehicles).

RGGI has been under development since 2003, when states from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions began to discuss setting up a cooperative effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

Starting in January 2009, RGGI states have agreed to implement a cap of 188 million short tons of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. The cap is intended to stabilize emissions through the end of 2014. In 2015 and each subsequent year, the emissions cap would be lowered incrementally, so that by 2018, the cap would be 10% below the initial level.", "In a cap-and-trade system, regulators set a cap (or limit) on the overall emissions of a given gas from a specified group of sources, such as power plants. The emissions allowed under the new cap are then allocated in the form of credits (or permits) to individual sources. Sources that emit more than their allowance must buy credits from those who emit less than their allowance, thus creating a financial incentive for sources to reduce their own emissions.", "The RGGI cap-and-trade program is to be implemented by the individual states. Each RGGI state will need to establish its own law and/or regulation to administer and enforce the emissions reduction program. However, each state will base its law/regulation on a detailed model rule that was developed by the participant states. To facilitate administration of the trading program, the MOU calls for the states to create a non-profit, regional organization. This organization is to provide technical assistance to the RGGI states and help maintain consistent implementation across state lines.", "Depending on various design details, cap-and-trade systems can vary significantly. The cap level and cap applicability (i.e., when the cap takes effect and which sources are affected) are perhaps the primary variables regarding the impact of the program. Other details, such as emission allocation and whether to include a safety valve, can further alter the character of a cap-and-trade program.

In both RGGI's Memorandum of Understanding and its Model Rule, states agreed that at least 25% of emission allowances will be allocated for a \"consumer benefit or strategic energy purpose.\" This action would require power plants to purchase the set-aside allowances, most likely through an auction, instead of receiving them at no charge. Several states have indicated that they intend to allocate 100% of their states' allowances through an auction process. In other emission trading programs, auctions have been used, but to a much lesser extent.", "Stakeholders have raised various issues regarding this format. For example, power companies may not be able to share part of the allowance costs with their customer base if the companies have a long-term, fixed-price contract. On the other hand, if utilities are able to pass along the additional costs, consumers worry that their electricity bills may increase. Policymakers have some flexibility to address these issues, because they can decide how best to use the revenues generated from the allowance auction. For instance, states could use the auction revenues to provide tax cuts to the affected industries, or to assist low-income families with paying for increases in energy bills. Largely due to this flexibility, the auction approach is considered more cost-effective than distributing allowances (for free) based on past or predicted emission rates.

A traditional safety valve would allow affected sources (e.g., power plants) to purchase credits at a fixed price ($X/ton of carbon dioxide) instead of reducing emissions. The price cap could be set high enough above market value so that facilities would consider it only during extreme circumstances or unforeseen events. Thus, the incentive to reduce emissions would remain, but the price cap (or safety valve) would assure the industry that it will not have runaway compliance costs. The main disadvantage of a safety valve is that its inclusion may limit the desired emission reductions, especially if the safety valve is set too close to market value. In addition, a price cap may keep costs low enough that this would reduce the economic incentive to invest in new technologies.", "RGGI does not have a safety valve in this traditional sense. However, RGGI does allow for compliance flexibility if the carbon dioxide allowance price reaches a certain level. For example, if certain price thresholds are breached, facilities receive an additional year to demonstrate emissions reductions. Also, in these cases, companies may cover a greater proportion of their emissions by purchasing credits from other facilities or other allowable emission offsets, instead of reducing emissions internally.", "If a national cap-and-trade regime were adopted, a traditional safety valve might become an important bargaining chip. Reportedly, the lack of a price cap, which could control costs to industry and consumers, was a central factor behind former Massachusetts Governor Romney's decision to withdraw his state from RGGI participation in 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Emissions Cap", "paragraphs": ["The level and timing of the emissions cap in a cap-and-trade program are important considerations for policymakers. In general, a carbon dioxide cap level and start date represent a balance between the benefits of climate change mitigation and the economic burden imposed on the affected sources. Political feasibility is often a factor when setting an emissions cap. The RGGI 2009 cap was not based entirely on past emission levels (or expected levels), but was developed through a negotiation among the states.", "One emissions cap strategy is to establish a cap that would take effect relatively quickly but only require stabilization or modest reduction in emissions. The RGGI cap resembles this approach. An advantage to this strategy is that it allows market forces to affect behavior at an earlier date\u2014for example, encouraging technological development or influencing investment decisions in less carbon-intensive energy sources.", "It is uncertain whether RGGI's initial cap\u2014188 million short tons of carbon dioxide\u2014will be higher than actual emissions when it takes effect in 2009 ( Figure 3 ). The cap is slightly above (about 4%) the average emission levels observed between 2000 and 2002. RGGI designers anticipated that emissions would gradually increase, so that actual levels would approximately match the cap in 2009. However, Figure 3 indicates this may not occur. Emissions were relatively stable between 2001 and 2004; they increased in 2005 but dropped substantially in 2006. Figure 3 shows the 2006 emissions are 13% below the 2009 cap.", "If actual emissions are below the cap when it goes into effect, the effectiveness of the RGGI program may be impacted. The allowance price might drop to such a low level that facilities would have no financial incentive to make reductions beyond their required allocation. This potential problem may be alleviated by the opportunity for affected sources to bank emission reductions for future use, when the cap will likely be lower than expected emissions. The RGGI program allows unlimited banking. The ability to bank reductions effectively spreads the costs of emission reduction over time. Banking emissions would reduce compliance costs in the future, but also increase the value of current allowances (because they can be sold later). The incentive to make additional reductions would remain.", "Another tool that RGGI states may use to address the possibility of over-allocation is an emissions auction reserve price. Several states have stated they intend to distribute 100% of their states' allowances through an auction process. If the supply of allowances exceeds demand (as Figure 3 indicates may occur), the price of allowances will be very low. With an auction system, states could set a reserve price, or price floor, below which allowances would not be sold. States could remove the unsold allowances from the market entirely, effectively lowering the state's emission cap, or states could retain the unsold allowances and sell them in future auctions. This second option would distribute costs over more years, and likely help control price volatility.

For example, if an RGGI state lowers its emissions by importing more power from a non-RGGI state, the emissions reductions in the RGGI state would likely be negated by an emission increase (or leakage) in the exporting state. The opportunities for leakage are partially related to the price difference between high-carbon fuels and low-carbon fuels. For instance, if the price of natural gas rises in comparison to coal, there will be more of an incentive to import the cheaper electricity from non-RGGI states.

It in uncertain what role the Massachusetts decision may play in these proceedings, because some of the arguments in these cases (e.g., the relationship between conflicting federal and state policing concerning climate change) were not addressed in the Massachusetts case.", "Further litigation confronting the more recent state actions is anticipated. Many expect a legal challenge to the RGGI program when the first state's rule is officially issued. In addition, some observers question whether California's recently enacted GHG performance standards are constitutional. They argue that the performance standards disproportionately affect the neighboring states that have historically exported coal-generated electricity to California consumers, raising the question of whether the California standard, in effect, regulates interstate commerce.", "The degree to which a state can influence interstate commerce is central to the debate regarding state-led climate change activities. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce. U.S. courts interpret this as a limitation on the states' ability to regulate interstate commerce.", "The legal arguments in these cases (and expected cases) are complicated and beyond the scope of this report. Moreover, many of the legal and constitutional issues chart new ground. For these reasons, many observers have concluded that it is difficult to predict how the courts will interpret and decide these issues. Regardless of the ultimate strength and outcome of the legal arguments opposing state-led climate change policies, affected stakeholders will almost certainly challenge the implementation of emission reduction programs. It is uncertain how long these anticipated legal challenges might delay GHG reductions in the states."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
