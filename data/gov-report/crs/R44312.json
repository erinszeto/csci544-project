BOEM anticipated an 11% ($4.5 million) decline in its offsetting rental receipts for FY2017, as compared with FY2016. BOEM attributed the anticipated decline to multiple factors, including a reduction in the number of leases being sold in the Gulf of Mexico because the area is maturing and because of the decline in world oil prices, as well as changes in lease terms and a resulting increase in lease relinquishments. Because \"this decline in rental receipts is not meaningfully correlated to BOEM's workload,\" the agency requested that Congress provide direct appropriations of $4.1\u00a0million to offset the reduced rental receipts. BOEM further stated that \"the projected decline in offsetting rental receipts is expected to continue to present a significant fiscal challenge in the coming years.\" In addition to requesting direct appropriations from Congress to make up for the projected reduction, the Obama Administration proposed to change the proportion of offsetting rental receipts that go to BOEM and BSEE. Whereas in earlier years BOEM received 65% of the offsetting rental receipts and BSEE 35%, the proposal for FY2017 was for BOEM to receive 70% and BSEE 30%.", "Separately, BOEM also anticipated a net reduction of $99,000 in its existing cost recovery fees for FY2017. However, BOEM proposed a new cost recovery fee for costs associated with the agency's Risk Management Program. BOEM estimated that this new fee would bring in revenues of $2.9 million for FY2017, so that the agency would have an overall gain of $2.8\u00a0million in cost recovery fees. The monies from the new fee would be used to fund continued implementation of the Risk Management Program, including adding staff with specializations in risk assessment and management.", "Both the House-passed and the Senate committee-reported bills reflected BOEM's anticipated changes to its offsetting collections, including BOEM's estimated reductions in rental receipts and cost recovery fees, its proposed new fee associated with the Risk Management Program, and the change in the proportion of offsetting rental receipts that would go to BOEM and BSEE. However, neither bill provided the level of direct appropriations that the agency had requested to make up for the reduction in offsetting collections.

The pay rates would accord with special salary rate tables issued for these positions by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). An increase of $0.9 million across two budget activities (Conventional Energy and Environmental Assessment) for additional staffing. The agency stated that staffing increase was needed to accommodate a growth in the number of deepwater drilling plans BOEM must review and regulatory changes that add to the workload of the plan review process. An increase of $0.2 million across all activities for fixed costs, which are non-programmatic, mandatory costs such as those for employee pay and benefits, workers' compensation, and rent to the General Services Administration.
