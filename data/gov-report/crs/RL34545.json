Congressional employees are retained to perform public duties that include assisting Members in official responsibilities in personal, committee, leadership, or administrative office settings.

These might include the law, business, medicine, political campaigns, engineering, the social sciences, or fine arts. Nevertheless, congressional staff are seen by some as a professional cohort. Congressional career tracks generally mirror common stages of other professional careers, but with adaptations to the congressional workplace. These adaptations include relatively short career ladders on which staff may acquire substantial responsibilities in a relatively short period of time, and close support of a Member's legislative and representational responsibilities.", "This report focuses on positions in House and Senate personal offices, and provides sample position descriptions for 14 positions with similar job titles in each chamber. Identifying congressional staff duties and job descriptions is complicated by the highly decentralized nature of congressional employment practices. The House of Representatives is composed of as many as 500 entities that set job criteria and employ staff; in the Senate, there are about 135 such entities. Congressional staff may work in a Member, committee, or leadership office; in positions under the authority of chamber officers; or in chamber support entities with specialized duties. Additional challenges of the congressional personnel environment may include different approaches to some practices common in many professional environments. Some congressional employing entities may not use formal position descriptions; others may not implement formal personnel practices and guidelines, or clearly establish lines of authority for personnel issues in their offices. In offices where personnel practices and guidelines are developed, practices could vary from office to office.", "All decisions regarding activities and operations in a Member's office are within the discretion of the Member, subject to chamber rules and relevant statute. As with all congressional entities with employing authority, individual Members of Congress have wide discretion in setting many workplace policies, including procedures for establishing the duties and functions of staff positions. Staffing decisions may be determined by the priorities and goals of a congressional office, and the preferences and needs of a Member's constituents."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sources of Position Descriptions", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, two salary and employment surveys, the 2006 House Compensation Study: Guide for the 110 th Congress (House study), and the 2006 U.S. Senate Employment, Compensation, Hiring and Benefits Study (Senate study), were conducted for the House and Senate, respectively. The studies focused on staff in the personal offices in each chamber, and provided data on salary, work experience, and position duties and functions. Data in the surveys were organized by position titles. Of 18 positions in the House study and 25 positions in the Senate study, there are 14 positions that have roughly congruent position titles and descriptions in both chambers. Those positions are summarized in Table 1 .", "Summaries of those positions' functions and duties as proffered by the House and Senate studies' administrators are provided below. This material should be interpreted with care. Using data from the House and Senate studies raises concerns for several reasons related to data collection, and the potential consequences of organizing data by position title."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Issues", "paragraphs": ["Electronic versions of the chamber-appropriate survey were sent to 440 House Member offices and 100 Senate personal offices. The House study indicated that its data were based on the responses of 141 (32.0%) Member offices, while the Senate study indicated that 81 Senate personal offices replied. The House study asserts that its information \"allows for stable conclusions to be drawn about the policies and practices of the current Member offices.\" The potential precision of that assertion is not clear, since the report provides none of the supporting evaluations or qualifications of how well its data sample might represent the whole population of House personal offices. Similarly, the Senate study provides no explanation of how representative its data are. With an 81% response rate, differences between the survey results and actual practice are likely to be smaller than differences in the House report. Nevertheless, Senate data could be affected by the challenges of surveying samples of relatively small populations and the potential diversity of employment and compensation practices in Senate offices. As with any survey based on a sample of self-selected respondents, there is a risk that the resulting data may not be representative of the population as a whole.", "Finally, a survey of the type conducted for the House and Senate requires reliance on respondents. Some problems may arise due to lack of timely responses to the questions, and in having to rely on the survey respondents to be forthcoming in responses, knowledgeable about the choices from which they select, and in possession of complete information about their offices' practices. Questions concerning who in each Member office responded to the survey, and how potential differences among individual respondents might affect the final data, are not addressed in either report. Neither report provided any information regarding the characteristics of survey respondents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organizing Data by Position Titles", "paragraphs": ["Categorizing congressional staff positions by position title relies on an assumption that similarly titled positions in House and Senate personal offices carry out the same tasks under essentially similar circumstances. While personal offices may carry out similar activities, the assumption might be questionable given the differences in staff resources in House and Senate offices, as well as potential differences within offices of each chamber.", "For example, a House office that supports an At Large Representative (a Representative from a state with one seat in the House) attends to the same constituency as that of a Senate office from the same state, but the Senator would have at his or her disposal a budget that could potentially support up to twice as many staff as would the Representative. At the other end of the spectrum, there may be differences in the nature of operations in the offices of Senators from states with large populations, with staffs as much as five times larger than those of their House colleagues who represent districts of considerably smaller populations within those states. Since an element of staff position responsibilities might be based on organizational size and complexity, the differences between House and Senate Member offices could result in differences in job duties between incumbents in similarly named positions. Within the Senate, there might be differences in the nature of position duties in the offices of Senators from states with larger or smaller populations. Within either chamber, there may be differences in staffing approaches due to varied approaches to the work of a congressional office, or because Members have a wide range of priorities that particular staff positions serve. Acknowledging the imprecision inherent in congressional job titles, an older edition of the Senate Handbook states, \"Throughout the Senate, individuals with the same job title perform vastly different duties.\"", "Other concerns regarding the organization of data according to job title are related to the unique congressional employment environment, as well as the aggregation of position data in the surveys. These factors might have an effect on the validity and reliability of any of the congressional duties and functions presented for any position in either chamber's studies. The analytic reliability of information contained in the surveys may be questionable, due in part to the following:", "differences between the surveys' position descriptions and what incumbents in those positions actually do. Of concern in both surveys is the question of how well position descriptions proffered by the survey administrators matched day-to-day activities performed by incumbents in those positions. Table 2 summarizes responses to questions that attempted to distinguish differences between the proffered position descriptions and the activities respondents actually carry out. imprecision and lack of consistency of job titles in Congress. The House and Senate surveys identified several alternate titles for each of the 14 positions. The lists were created by asking respondent offices for alternate titles. In the Senate, respondents identified 118 alternative titles to the 14 titles offered by the survey administrators and appearing in both surveys. In the House, similar questions identified 69 unique titles applicable to the sample job descriptions provided by the survey administrator. similarity of tasks carried out by staff with similar or dissimilar titles. It may be the case that congressional staff in some positions with vastly different job titles perform similar duties. In several instances, alternate titles match one or more of the 14 titles evaluated here, as well as several of the positions that were identified in only one chamber. Cross listed job titles are presented with each position's duties and functions. breadth of roles carried out by incumbents in addition to their primary position title. In the House study, respondents were asked to identify any roles they carried out in addition to their primary duties.
