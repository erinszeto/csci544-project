President Nixon delegated this presidential authority to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. In 1973, EPA issued Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) regulations that require certain facilities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to oil discharges that may reach navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines.", "In general, a facility must prepare an SPCC plan if the facility has an aboveground aggregate oil storage capacity greater than 1,320 gallons or a completely buried oil storage capacity greater than 42,000 gallons. Among other obligations, SPCC regulations require secondary containment (e.g., dikes or berms) for certain oil-storage units. A licensed professional engineer must certify the plan, although some facilities\u2014depending on storage capacity and spill history\u2014may be able to self-certify.", "In recent years, the SPCC regulations have received considerable interest from Congress. Most of this interest has involved the applicability of SPCC regulations to farms, which may be subject to the SPCC regulations for oil stored onsite for agricultural equipment use. Farms account for approximately 25% of SPCC regulated entities, second only to oil and gas production facilities.", "In 2002, EPA issued a final rule that made changes and clarifications to its SPCC regulations. For most types of facilities subject to SPCC requirements, the compliance deadline was November 10, 2011. However, EPA extended this compliance date for farms to May 10, 2013.", "The 2013 compliance date generated considerable attention in the 113th Congress. On June 10, 2014, the President signed the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 (P.L. 113-121). The act altered the applicability of the SPCC regulations to farms. Two key changes include", "1. farms with an aggregate aboveground oil storage capacity less than 2,500 gallons are not subject to SPCC regulations; and 2. farms with an aggregate aboveground oil storage capacity less than 6,000 gallons (or an alternate threshold determined by EPA) and no reportable discharge history are not subject to SPCC regulations.", "WRRDA directed EPA to conduct a study to determine whether the interim 6,000 gallon threshold should be decreased (to not less than 2,500 gallons) based on a significant risk of an oil discharge to water. In June 2015, EPA concluded that the appropriate threshold should be 2,500 gallons instead of 6,000 gallons. According to the regulatory agenda, EPA was scheduled to release a proposed rule regarding this change in August 2016, with a final rule scheduled for December 2016. As of the date of this report, EPA has not published a proposed rule.", "On December 16, 2016, the President signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN, P.L. 114-322). WIIN provisions build upon the changes made in WRRDA. In particular, the SPCC regulations would not apply to farm containers on separate parcels with (1) an individual storage capacity of 1,000 gallons or less, and (2) an aggregate storage capacity of 2,500 gallons or less.", "Under WRRDA, smaller containers (i.e., 1,000 gallons or less) would not be counted toward an aggregate storage capacity, but these containers were still subject to any relevant SPCC regulations. Pursuant to the WIIN provision, smaller containers would not be counted toward a farm's aggregate storage capacity or covered by SPCC regulations even if the farm's aggregate storage capacity breached regulatory thresholds."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) regulations include requirements for certain facilities to prevent, prepare for, and respond to discharges of oil and oil products\u2014defined broadly\u2014that may reach U.S. navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. Requirements include secondary containment (e.g., dikes or berms) for certain storage units and the need for a licensed professional engineer to certify a facility's SPCC plan. ", "In recent years, the SPCC program has received considerable interest from Congress. Most of this interest has involved the SPCC program's applicability to farms. Because farms may store oil onsite for agricultural equipment use, they may be subject to the SPCC regulations if the oil storage capacity exceeds regulatory thresholds. Legislation from the 113 th and 114 th Congresses altered the applicability of the SPCC regulations for farms. ", "Stakeholder arguments in support of such legislation often involve the financial impact of the SPCC regulations, particularly for farms. For example, a 2012 House report stated that the \"mandated infrastructure improvements\u2014along with the necessary inspection and certification by a specially licensed Professional Engineer will cost many farmers tens of thousands of dollars.\" However, some Members have argued that EPA has considered the costs and benefits of its SPCC regulations during multiple rulemaking processes and determined that the benefits outweigh the costs. EPA contends that the SPCC compliance costs that help prevent oil spills are much less than the costs of oil spill cleanup and potential civil penalties. In addition, a 2015 EPA study stated: ", "EPA concluded that there was insufficient evidence to provide an exemption specific to farms or make changes to regulatory thresholds since the types of tanks and oil storage conditions at farms were generally similar to those of other facilities, with similar potential for discharge.", "The first section of this report provides background information on EPA's SPCC program, including the program's statutory authority and regulatory developments and requirements.

The relevant provision from the 1972 CWA remains the same today and reads as follows:", "Consistent with the National Contingency Plan \u2026 the President shall issue regulations consistent with maritime safety and with marine and navigation laws \u2026 establishing procedures, methods, and equipment and other requirements for equipment to prevent discharges of oil and hazardous substances from vessels and from onshore facilities and offshore facilities, and to contain such discharges.", "In 1970, President Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and reorganized the executive branch delegations of various presidential authorities. Subsequent executive orders and interagency agreements altered the implementation authority framework. In the context of oil discharge regulations, the Coast Guard has jurisdiction over vessels, and several agencies have jurisdiction over facilities. ", "As of a 1994 interagency agreement, EPA has jurisdiction over non-transportation-related onshore and offshore facilities, which includes facilities located \"landward of the coast line.\" Pursuant to the 1994 agreement, the Department of Transportation has jurisdiction over transportation-related onshore facilities, deepwater ports, and transportation-related facilities located landward of coast line. The Department of the Interior has jurisdiction over offshore facilities, including associated pipelines, located seaward of the coast line.

Among other obligations, SPCC regulations require secondary containment (e.g., dikes or berms) for certain oil-storage units. In addition, SPCC plans must be certified by a licensed professional engineer unless a facility owner/operator meets the conditions that allow for self-certification. In general, facilities with no reportable discharge history that store 10,000 gallons or less, in aggregate, can self-certify their SPCC plans. For farms, this particular threshold is 20,000 gallons.

In a 1975 Federal Register notice, EPA clarified that its 1973 SPCC regulations apply to oils from animal and vegetable sources. EPA's SPCC regulatory definition (40 C.F.R. \u00a7112.2) states:", "Oil means oil of any kind or in any form, including, but not limited to: fats, oils, or greases of animal, fish, or marine mammal origin; vegetable oils, including oils from seeds, nuts, fruits, or kernels; and, other oils and greases, including petroleum, fuel oil, sludge, synthetic oils, mineral oils, oil refuse, or oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.", "Except for farms, which are discussed below, facilities are subject to the rule if they meet at least one of the following capacity thresholds: ", "an aboveground aggregate oil storage capacity greater than 1,320 gallons, or a completely buried oil storage capacity greater than 42,000 gallons.", "In 2009, EPA estimated that approximately 640,000 facilities are subject to the SPCC requirements.
