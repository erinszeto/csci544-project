They also have implications for U.S. geopolitical interests. Conversely, geopolitical tensions, risks, and opportunities can have major impacts on U.S. trade flows. These issues are complex and at times controversial, and developments in the global economy often make policymaking more challenging, as it involves balancing many competing interests.

World economic growth rose from 3.3% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017. Advanced economies grew 2.3%, while emerging market and developing economies grew 4.7%\u2014partly due to the moderate slowdown in China's GDP growth over the past few years (from 10.6% in 2010 to 6.7% in 2017).

In addition, world merchandise trade recorded its largest increase since 2011. In nominal terms, world merchandise exports expanded 10.6% in 2017, after two years of declines, reaching $17.5 trillion. World merchandise imports also grew considerably in 2017, up 11.3%, after declining 3.2% in 2016.

U.S. imports increased more than U.S. exports, leading to a $56.4 billion (7.5%) increase in the U.S. merchandise trade deficit, which reached $807.5 billion in 2017. In 2017, the European Union (EU) was the United States' top trading partner in terms of two-way (exports plus imports) merchandise trade (accounting for 22.5% of total U.S. merchandise trade), while China was the largest single-country trading partner (accounting for 16.3% of total U.S. merchandise trade).", "U.S. Services Trade.

The United States maintained a services trade surplus with every major services trading partner except Hong Kong, India, and France in 2017. The overall services trade surplus increased 2.5% ($6.1 billion) to $255.2 billion.

A number of questions regarding recent and future trends in U.S exports and imports could arise as the Trump Administration renegotiates U.S. free trade agreements (FTAs) and pursues news ones, and takes a more forceful stance to reduce U.S. bilateral trade deficits, enforce U.S. trade laws and agreements, and promote what it considers to be \"free,\" \"fair,\" and \"reciprocal\" trade. One question pertains to the impact of renegotiating or pursuing new FTAs on the U.S. economy. As with any trade liberalizing measure, an FTA can have net positive overall effects on some sectors and adverse effects on others. An FTA may create export and import opportunities in one sector of the U.S. economy but divert trade away from others. Members of Congress weigh these effects on various industries and on their constituencies, while also considering the overall impact on the United States and other trading partners. Because trade relations can differ significantly from one trade partner to another, the evaluation will likely differ in each case. Furthermore, Members may take into account not only the immediate static effects of greater global economic integration efforts, but also the long-term, dynamic effects, which could play an important role in evaluating their contribution to the U.S. economy. Finally, other issues for Congress raised by the changing patterns in U.S. trade and the global landscape could include contemplating the future direction of the global trading system, as well as assessing the quality and availability of data on trade and what, if any, additional resources should be devoted to collecting trade data and analyzing the role of trade in the U.S. economy."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Overview", "The United States is the world's biggest economy (in nominal dollars), leading trading nation (goods and services), and largest source of and destination for foreign direct investment.

In addition, questions affecting U.S. trade trends could also arise as the Trump Administration renegotiates FTAs and pursues new ones, and Congress debates and potentially ratifies them.", "Recent Developments in International Trade", "International trade is an important engine not only of the U.S. economy, but of the global economy. Total trade (exports plus imports) as a share of global GDP has risen from 25% in 1960 to 56% in 2017 ( Figure 1 ). Greater openness to trade and trade reforms worldwide have been linked to higher growth in productivity and real incomes, as well as to reduced poverty worldwide. \u00a0For decades since World War II, annual real global trade growth outpaced GDP growth, growing on average 1.5 times faster. This trend has not held in recent years as the global economy recovered from the global financial and economic crisis. Real growth in the volume of world merchandise trade slowed to 2.0% in 2016\u2014the slowest pace of growth since 2009. Trade growth has seen some rebound, increasing to 5.4% in 2017\u2014the strongest growth rate since 2011, driven mainly by cyclical factors, particularly higher investment and consumption expenditure. ", "Overall, analysts attribute the trend of weakened international trade growth in previous years to several factors, including weak import demand, exchange rate fluctuations, and falling commodity prices. \u00a0The slowdown in world investment and China's rebalancing toward a consumption-driven economy are seen by some as major structural factors, while others consider growing trade protectionism to be equally important. \u00a0With the improving global economic outlook, a rebound in trade growth had been projected for 2018 and 2019 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). However, amid several downside risks, including rising trade tensions between major economies like the United States and China, and heightened trade policy uncertainty, the IMF and WTO now expect global trade growth to slow. Recently introduced restrictive trade policy measures by the United States and some of its major trading partners may already be affecting trade flows and prices in targeted sectors. Analysts claim that some recent policy announcements have also harmed business outlooks and investment plans, due to concern about possible disruption to supply chains as well as the risk that the restrictions may intensify. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects that a further rise in trade tensions may have additional adverse effects on global investment and jobs.", "U.S. world trade has grown steadily over the past decade. In 2017, the United States exported $2.4 trillion in goods and services and imported $2.9 trillion. \u00a0Since 2009, when trade flows declined sharply in the midst of the international financial and economic crisis, U.S. exports grew 48.5%, while U.S. imports grew 47.6% in nominal terms. More broadly, since 1960, trade relative to GDP has risen markedly. U.S. exports as a percentage of GDP expanded from 5% in 1960 to over 12% of GDP in 2017, while U.S. imports expanded from 4% to over 15% of GDP. ", "Changing Patterns in U.S. Trade", "Over the past several decades, the process of globalization has introduced fundamental changes to the U.S. economy. The growing economic weight of emerging market and developing economies is contributing to a realignment of the distribution of power within the global economy and to changes in the direction and composition of U.S trade. Traditionally, the United States and other advanced economies, such as European Union members and Japan, have been the primary sources of world trade flows. While most of the United States' largest trading partners remain advanced economies, U.S. trade with emerging market and developing economies\u2014although comparatively low\u2014accounts for a growing share of total U.S. trade ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 ). ", "The share of U.S. exports to the Middle East and North Africa increased from 3.1% in 2000 to 5.3% in 2017, while the share to South Asia increased from 0.6% to 1.8% during the same time period. The share of U.S. imports from East Asia and the Pacific also grew significantly, from 32.9% in 2000 to 38.9% in 2017. Among the emerging economies, U.S. trade with China has grown the fastest. In 2000, China accounted for about 2.1% of U.S. merchandise exports and 8.1% of U.S. merchandise imports. By 2017, China represented 8.4% of U.S. merchandise exports and 21.4% of merchandise imports. The growing importance of emerging economies is also reflected in U.S. trade in services. Between 2000 and 2017, the share of U.S. services exports to the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Mexico all decreased, while that of China and India increased. During the same time period, the share of U.S. services imports from India grew from 0.9% to 5.2%. In addition, the composition of U.S. trade has also changed since 2000. U.S. exports of petroleum and coal products, oil and gas, and aerospace products and parts have increased, while exports of semiconductors, computer equipment, and motor vehicle parts have decreased significantly ( Table 1 ).", "Global Value Chains", "International trade has become increasingly complex, and the changing dynamics of U.S. trade pose both opportunities and challenges for the United States. In the past, U.S. firms tended to source most or all of their production in the United States, using inputs that were largely made domestically. U.S. production, trade, and investments are increasingly organized within so-called global value chains (GVCs) where the different stages of the production process are located across different countries. GVCs mean that products are often traded across borders multiple times. This international fragmentation of U.S. and other countries' production has raised the level of trade associated with a particular final product, as well as trade with both developing and developed countries. ", "Lower global trade barriers and technological advances help to facilitate the growth of GVCs, making international transport faster and accelerating the flow of information across borders. These linkages have blurred the distinction between exports and imports as strictly domestic or foreign activities. This in turn has made it increasingly difficult to understand who benefits and loses from global trade. It also complicates the interpretation of bilateral trade balances. Trade in intermediates means that imports have become essential inputs into the production of exports. As a result, policies that affect a nation's imports ultimately affect its exports and vice versa.", "More than half of global manufacturing imports are intermediate goods traveling within supply chains, while over 75% of global services imports are intermediate services. The latest data from the OECD suggests that, on average, over 25% of the value of national exports included foreign content in the form of imported inputs. For the United States, the foreign value-added share in U.S. exports has increased in most industries, particularly since the mid-1990s.", "The Limitations of Trade Data", "The growth in global production chains, intra-firm trade, and trade in intermediate goods means that traditional accounting methods may distort trade data and not fully reflect the source of resources that are used in producing goods and services. This makes it increasingly difficult to understand and interpret the implications of trade data for the U.S. economy. Thus, it is important to note that the conventional trade data that drives policy discussions, and that is used throughout this report, may underestimate U.S. trade, particularly in services, as the data are not measured on a value-added basis and do not attribute any portion of the traded value of manufactured and agricultural products to services inputs. Intermediate services embedded within a value chain as inputs include not only transportation and distribution to help move goods along, but also research and development (R&D), design and engineering, and business services. ", "China is an example of this phenomenon. Since initiating free market reforms in 1979 and opening up its economy to global trade and investment, China has emerged as a major center for global supply chains. Because of China's large pool of low-cost labor, many export-oriented multinational corporations have moved production from other countries (primarily in Asia) to China. In many cases, products that are \"made in China\" are actually products that are \"assembled in China,\" using imported inputs (such as components) that are designed and produced globally. The value added that occurs in China is often quite small relative to the total value of the finished product when it is imported into the United States and elsewhere, and a significant level of the profits from the sale of the product is estimated to accrue to the multinational company that owns the brand.", "To illustrate, when the United States imports such products as iPhones and iPads, it attributes the full value of those imports as occurring in China, even though the value added that occurred there is quite small. Apple Inc., the U.S. firm that developed these products, is the largest beneficiary in terms of the profits generated by the sale of its products, and most of its product design, software development, product management, marketing, and other high-wage functions and employment occur in the United States. In other words, U.S. trade data may show where products are being imported from, but they often do not reflect who ultimately benefits from that trade. In many instances, U.S. imports from China are really imports from many countries. Yet, the full value of the final imported product is attributed to China, which results in what one might consider to be an inflated trade deficit figure. A joint study by the OECD and the WTO estimated that the U.S trade deficit with China in 2009 would have been reduced by 25% if bilateral trade flows were measured according to the value-added that occurred in each country before it was exported. Additionally, another study estimated that 24.7% of U.S. imports from Canada, and 39.8% of U.S. final merchandise imports from Mexico, consist of value added from the United States.", "Sources", "This report relies heavily on resources from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, and from the U.S. International Trade Commission\u2014the main sources of U.S. trade data\u2014for information and statistics presented throughout the report.

U.S. import data are reported on a customs basis with insurance and freight charges counted in U.S. services trade. Other countries, however, commonly report merchandise import figures that include insurance and freight charges. This tends to overstate their imports and understate their trade surpluses with the United States.", "For analysis of specific industries or sectors, the classification system used is also important. The U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) identifies products by a 10-digit number in order to assign duty rates. Each additional digit adds to the specificity of the classification. For example, the 2-digit level includes broad categories such as aircraft (88), electrical machinery (85), and meat (02). For the purpose of examining trade trends, the broader 2- or 4-digit classification is typically sufficient. There are a number of other classification systems that are also useful for different types of analysis.
