Counties containing National Forest System lands and certain Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands historically have received payments based on the revenue generated from those lands. Revenue-generating activities include recreation, grazing permits, and land use rentals, among other activities. Starting in the 1990s, federal timber sales began to decline substantially\u2014by more than 90% in some areas\u2014which led to substantially reduced payments to the counties. Thus, Congress enacted the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS; P.L. 106-393) as a temporary, optional program of payments. SRS provided payments to counties based on historic rather than current revenues from land use activities, thus minimizing the effect of reduced revenue streams on those counties.", "The last authorized SRS payment was distributed in FY2016. Authorization for SRS payments originally expired at the end of FY2006, but Congress extended the program through FY2015 with several reauthorizations, starting with a one-year reauthorization for FY2007 (P.L. 110-28). In 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (P.L. 110-343) enacted a four-year extension to SRS authorization through FY2011, with declining payments, a modified formula, and transition payments for certain areas. In 2012, Congress enacted a one-year extension through FY2012 and amended the program to slow the decline in payment levels and to tighten requirements that counties select a payment option promptly (P.L. 112-141). In 2013, Congress again enacted a one-year extension through FY2013 (P.L. 113-40). In 2014, the 114th Congress enacted a two-year extension through FY2015 (P.L. 114-10). SRS payments are disbursed after the fiscal year ends, so the FY2015 SRS payment\u2014the last authorized payment\u2014was made in FY2016.", "With the expiration of SRS, county payments returned to a revenue-based system and are significantly lower than previous years' payments. The 115th Congress may consider several options to address county payments, including reauthorizing SRS (with or without modifications), implementing other legislative proposals to address the county payments, and taking no action, among others.", "Congressional debates over reauthorization have considered the basis and level of compensation to counties (historical, tax equivalency, etc.); the source of funds (receipts, a new tax or other revenue source, etc.); the authorized and required uses of the payments; interaction with other compensation programs (notably Payments in Lieu of Taxes); and the duration of any changes (temporary or permanent). In addition, legislation with mandatory spending, such as SRS, raises policy questions about congressional control of appropriations. Current budget rules to restrain deficit spending typically impose a procedural barrier to such legislation, generally requiring offsets by additional receipts or reductions in other spending."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["U nder federal law, local governments are compensated through various programs due to the presence of federal lands within their borders. Federally owned lands cannot be taxed by state or local governments but may create demand for services from state or local entities, such as fire protection, police cooperation, or longer roads to skirt the property. Counties with national forest lands or certain Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands have historically received a percentage of agency revenues, primarily from timber sales. In the 1990s, timber sales declined substantially from the historic levels in the late 1980s\u2014by more than 90% in some areas\u2014which had led to substantially reduced payments to the counties. Congress enacted the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (SRS) to provide a temporary, optional system to supplant the revenue-sharing programs for the national forests managed by the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture and for certain public lands administered by the BLM in the Department of the Interior.

After FS and BLM distributed the revenue-sharing payment for FY2014, the 114 th Congress reauthorized SRS for two years (through FY2015) and required the agencies to issue the FY2014 SRS payment within 45 days of enactment. SRS expired at the end of FY2015; payments were disbursed after the fiscal year ended, so the FY2015 payment was made in FY2016.

Receipts come from sales, leases, rentals, or other fees for using national forest lands or resources (e.g., timber sales, recreation fees, and communication site leases). This mandatory spending program was enacted to compensate local governments for the tax-exempt status of the national forests, but the statutory compensation rate (10% of gross receipts in 1906 and 1907; 25% of gross receipts since) was not discussed in the 1906-1908 debates. This revenue- or receipt-sharing program is called Forest Service Payments to States (also referred to as the 1908 payment, or the 25% payment). The states have no discretion in assigning the funds to the county. FS determines the amount to be allocated to each county based on the national forest acreage in each county and provides that amount to the state. The states cannot retain any of the funds; they must be passed through to local governmental entities for use at the county level (but not necessarily to county governments themselves). Each state must spend the funds on road and school programs, and state law sets forth how the payments are to be allocated between road and school projects. The state laws differ widely, generally ranging from 30% to 100% for school programs, with a few states providing substantial local discretion on the split. ", "Congress has also enacted numerous programs to share receipts from BLM lands for various types of resource use and from various classes of land. One program\u2014the Oregon and California (O&C) payments\u2014accounts for more than 95% of BLM receipt-sharing. The O&C payments are made to the counties in western Oregon containing the revested Oregon and California grant lands that were returned to federal ownership for failure of the states to fulfill the terms of the grant. The O&C counties receive 50% of the receipts from these lands. These mandatory payments go directly to the counties for any local governmental purposes. Concerns about, and proposals to alter, FS revenue-sharing payments also typically include the O&C payments, because both are substantial payments derived largely from timber receipts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Declining Revenue-Sharing Payments Leads to Enactment of SRS", "paragraphs": ["Timber sale revenue\u2014and, consequently, revenue-sharing payments\u2014peaked in the late 1980s. The FY1989 FS 25% payments totaled $362 million, while O&C payments totaled $110 million. FS and O&C receipts have declined substantially since FY1989, largely because of declines in federal timber sales (see Figure 1 ) and other factors. The decline began in the Pacific Northwest, owing to a combination of forest management policies and practices, efforts to protect northern spotted owl habitat, increased planning and procedural requirements, changing public preferences, economic and industry factors, and other developments. Provisions in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 authorized FS and BLM to make so-called owl payments to several counties in Washington, Oregon, and California. These payments were set at a declining percentage of the average revenue-sharing payments made to those counties between FY1986 and FY1990. ", "As federal timber sales\u2014and revenue-sharing payments\u2014began to decline nationwide, Congress replaced the regional owl payments with the nationwide SRS program in 2000. Similar to the owl payments for the Pacific Northwest, the SRS program was an optional payment that counties could elect to receive instead of receiving the 25% receipt-sharing payment. As originally enacted, the SRS payment was calculated as an average of the three highest payments made to counties between FY1986 and FY1999. With the program extension in FY2008, the SRS payment calculation was modified to also consider county population and per capita income, and it established an annually declining payment level.", "Payments under SRS (see Table 1 ) were substantial and significantly greater than the receipt-sharing payments. The FS payment rose from $194 million in FY2000 (all figures in nominal dollars) to a $346 million SRS payment in FY2001. For the initial six years SRS was authorized, the average FS SRS payment was $360 million annually, more than $130 million above the average annual FS payment for the six years prior to the enactment of SRS (FY1995-FY2000). Over the life of the program, the FS SRS payments have averaged $337 million and the BLM SRS payments have averaged $78 million per year. ", " Figure 2 shows a comparison of the FS actual payments to estimates of what the payments would have been had SRS not been enacted. To illustrate, FS receipts (for revenue-sharing purposes) in FY2012 totaled $230 million. Without SRS, the revenue-sharing payment would have been around $58 million. With SRS, the payments totaled $274 million. Similarly, BLM timber receipts from western Oregon (which includes some non-O&C lands) totaled $28 million in FY2012. Without SRS, the 50% revenue-sharing payment would have been approximately $14 million, compared to the $34 million payment under SRS. ", "SRS expired\u2014temporarily\u2014on October 1, 2014. With the expiration of SRS, the FY2014 payments were again to be based on a percentage of agency receipts (the rolling seven-year average of 25% for national forest lands and of 50% for O&C lands). As nonexempt, nondefense mandatory spending, the payments were subject to the annual sequestration of budgetary authority. The post-sequester revenue-sharing payment for FS was $50 million and $18 million for BLM. These payments were distributed in February 2015.", "P.L. 114-10 was enacted on April 16, 2015. It included provisions for a \"make-up\" FY2014 SRS payment, and it authorized an FY2015 SRS payment. The FY2014 payment was set at 95% of the FY2013 payment level, but for counties that opted to receive an SRS payment, the FY2014 payment was offset by the revenue-sharing payment already distributed. In effect, the counties received their FY2014 SRS payment in two installments. The total FS SRS payment for FY2014 was $274 million; for BLM it was $38 million. Because the payments were authorized after the sequestration amount was calculated for both FY2015 and FY2016, the payments were not subject to sequestration either year.", "SRS expired on October 1, 2016, without congressional reauthorization. Thus, counties received revenue-sharing payments for FY2016 (issued in early 2017). The post-sequester revenue-sharing payment was $54 million for the Forest Service and $19 million for BLM (see Figure 2 ). If SRS payments had been authorized, the FS payment to counties would have been approximately $248 million and the BLM payment would have been approximately $34 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SRS and PILT", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the FS and BLM receipt-sharing programs, Congress has enacted other programs to compensate for the presence of federal land. The most widely applicable program, administered by the Department of the Interior, is the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program. PILT payments to counties are calculated in dollars per acre of federal land and are based on eligible federal lands, as specified in statute. The eligible lands include national forests and O&C lands in each county (but total amounts are restricted in counties with very low populations). PILT payments are reduced (to a minimum payment per acre) by other payment programs\u2014including FS Payments to States but not including BLM's O&C payments\u2014so increases in FS payments may decrease a county's payments under PILT (and vice versa). This helps to explain why FY2012 PILT payments to Colorado were double the PILT payments to Oregon, even though there is more federal land in Oregon (32.6 million acres) than in Colorado (23.8 million acres).", "Before 2008, annual appropriations were necessary to fund PILT. When the appropriations were less than the authorized total payments, each county received its calculated pro rata share of the appropriation. However, the 2008 and 2012 SRS amendments also made PILT payments mandatory spending for FY2008-FY2013, and the Agricultural Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-79 ) extended mandatory spending to FY2014. Thus, for those fiscal years, each county received 100% of its authorized PILT payment. For FY2015 , Congress provided $439.5 million for PILT payments, 97% of the total authorized payment of $451.5 million. The FY2015 payment was provided through both mandatory spending and discretionary appropriations. For FY2016, Congress provided $452 million in discretionary appropriations ( P.L. 114-113 ) for PILT payments, 98% of the total authorized payment. For FY2017, Congress provided $465 million in discretionary appropriations ( P.L. 115-31 ) for PILT payments, which are expected to be paid in June 2017.

In FY2015, national forest receipts totaled $254.5 million. In some local areas, the decline was steeper; for example, payments to the eastern Oregon counties containing the Ochoco National Forest fell from $10 million in FY1991 to $309,000 in FY1998\u2014a decline of 97% in seven years.

Such wide annual fluctuations imposed serious budgeting uncertainties on the counties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Linkage", "paragraphs": ["A third, longer-term concern is referred to as linkage. Some observers have noted that, because the counties receive a portion of receipts, they are rewarded for advocating receipt-generating activities (principally timber sales) and for opposing management decisions that might reduce or constrain such activities (e.g., designating wilderness areas or protecting commercial, tribal, or sport fish harvests). County governments have often been allied with the timber industry, and opposed to efforts of environmental and other interest groups to reduce timber harvests, in debates over FS management and budget decisions. ", "Timber sales as the source of funds was deemed appropriate in 1906 when the FS program was created (albeit, prior to creation of federal income taxes). Some interests support retaining the linkage between county compensation and agency receipts; local support for receipt-generating activities is seen as appropriate by these constituencies, because such activities usually also provide local employment and income, especially in rural areas where unemployment is often high.

For the FS payments, estimated at $800 million, the FS would have sold approximately 300,000 acres of national forest land. This would have required legislation, as the FS currently has only very narrow authority to sell any lands. The Administration offered draft legislation to authorize these land sales, but no bill to authorize that level of national forest land sales was introduced in the 109 th Congress. Instead, Congress again included a reserve fund for SRS payments in the budget resolution. In 2007, the Bush Administration again proposed selling national forest lands to fund a phase-out of SRS payments, with half of the land sale revenues to be used for other programs (including land acquisition and conservation education).

With a total SRS payment of approximately $94 million, Oregon received nearly one-third of the total SRS payments made in FY2015. The next-largest SRS payments are in California and Idaho, which both received just under 10% of the total payment that year.

The easiest comparison is with the counties that contain national grasslands, which receive 25% of net receipts and were excluded from SRS. Both forests and grasslands are part of the National Forest System, although the laws authorizing their establishment differ. However, it is unclear why national forest counties are compensated with 25% of gross receipts and were protected from declines in receipts under SRS, whereas national grassland counties are compensated with 25% of net receipts and did not receive the option of receiving SRS payments. ", "More significantly, many other tax-exempt federal lands provide little compensation to local governments. The BLM has numerous compensation programs, but generally the payments are quite small. (The O&C payments account for about 95% of BLM compensation payments, but O&C lands are only about 1% of BLM lands.) The National Park Service has two small compensation programs related to public schooling of park employees' children at two parks. PILT provides some compensation for most federal lands, but many lands\u2014inactive military bases, Indian trust lands, and certain wildlife refuge lands, for example\u2014are excluded, and the national forests and O&C lands get PILT payments in addition to other compensation. In 1992, the Office of Technology Assessment recommended \"fair and consistent compensation for the tax exempt status of national forest lands and activities.\" Congress could consider several options related to extending a compensation program to all tax-exempt federal lands, although determining a fair and consistent compensation level likely would generate significant debate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Basis for Compensation", "paragraphs": ["The legislative histories of the agriculture appropriations acts establishing the FS payments to states (the last of which, enacted on May 23, 1908, made the payments permanent) indicate that the intent was to substitute receipt-sharing for local property taxation, but no rationale was discussed for the level chosen (10% in 1906 and 1907; 25% in 1908 and since). Similarly, the rationale was not clearly explained or discussed for the Reagan tax-equivalency proposal, for the owl payments (a declining percent of the historical average), or for the legislation debated and enacted by the 106 th Congress (generally the average of the three highest payments during a specified historical period). The proposals' intents were generally to reduce (Reagan Administration) or increase (more recently) the payments.", "The geographic basis has been raised as a potential problem for FS payments.

SRS directed payments first from receipts, then from the General Treasury. Figure 4 shows the breakdown of FS SRS funding between receipts and the General Treasury. The amount of funding that came from the Treasury fluctuated in part due to the declining full funding level but also due to fluctuations in the level offset by receipts. Critics are concerned about the continued availability of General Treasury funds, given the current fiscal climate and some Members' desire to reduce government spending. On the other hand, recipients of these funds argue that continuing Treasury funding is fair compensation for the presence of FS lands in their jurisdiction. Another concern for some is that retaining the linkage between agency receipts (e.g., from timber sales) and county payments (albeit less directly than for the 25% payments) still encourages counties to support timber sales over other FS uses.

Use of the funds for federal land projects has been touted as \"reinvesting\" agency receipts in federal land management, but opponents argue that this \"re-links\" county benefits with agency receipt-generating activities and reduces funding for local schools and roads. The Forest Counties Payments Committee recommended granting local governments more flexibility in their use of the payments.

The result was a change in the payments and the allocation of total payments in the modified formula. These changes are shown in Table 2 . Note, however, that the change in the payment formula led some counties that had chosen 25% payments for FY2006 to opt for SRS payments for FY2009, and vice versa. Some of the increase in SRS payments in FY2009 is due to more counties opting for SRS payments in some states, such as Michigan, New Hampshire, Ohio, Puerto Rico, and Wisconsin. In at least one state\u2014Pennsylvania\u2014a portion of the decline is due to some counties opting for 25% payments in FY2009.", "Appendix B. Historical Proposals to Change the Revenue-Sharing System", "Concerns about the FS and BLM programs have led to various proposals over the years to alter the compensation system. Most have focused on some form of tax equivalency \u2014compensating the states and counties at roughly the same level as if the lands were privately owned and managed. Many consider this to be a valid approach for fairly and consistently compensating state and county governments. However, most also note the difficulty in developing a tax equivalency compensation system, because counties and states use a wide variety of mechanisms to tax individuals and corporations\u2014property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes, excise taxes, severance taxes, and more. Thus, developing a single federal compensation system for the tax-exempt status of federal lands may be very difficult if not impossible.", "In his 1984 budget request, President Reagan proposed replacing the receipt-sharing programs with a tax equivalency system, with a guaranteed minimum payment. The counties argued that the proposal was clearly intended to reduce payments, noting that the budget request projected savings of $40.5 million (12%) under the proposal. The change was not enacted. The FY1986 FS budget request included a proposal to change the payments to 25% of net receipts (after deducting administrative costs). Legislation to effect this change was not offered.", "In 1993, President Clinton proposed a 10-year payment program to offset the decline in FS and O&C timber sales, and thus payments, resulting from efforts to protect various resources and values including northern spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest. Congress enacted this program in Section 13982 of the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( P.L. 103-66 ). These \"owl\" payments began in 1994 at 85% of the FY1986-FY1990 average payments, declining by 3 percentage points annually, to 58% in 2003, but with payments after FY1999 at the higher of either this formula or the standard payment.", "In his FY1999 budget request, President Clinton announced that he would propose legislation \"to stabilize the payments\" by extending the owl payments formula to all national forests. The proposal would have directed annual payments from \"any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated,\" at the higher of (1) the FY1997 payment, or (2) 76% of the FY1986-FY1990 average payment. This approach would have increased payments in areas with large payment declines while decreasing payments in other areas, as well as eliminating annual fluctuations in payments and de-linking the payments from receipts. The Administration's proposed legislation was not introduced in Congress. The FY2000 and FY2001 FS budget requests contained similar programs, but no legislative proposals were offered.", "The National Association of Counties (NACo) proposed an alternative in 1999. The NACo proposal would have provided the counties with the higher of (1) the standard payment, or (2) a replacement payment determined by the three highest consecutive annual payments for each county between FY1986 and FY1995, indexed for inflation. NACo also proposed \"a long-term solution ... to allow for the appropriate, sustainable, and environmentally sensitive removal of timber from the National Forests\" by establishing local advisory councils.

Within each half, the reductions were further allocated between discretionary appropriations and direct spending. Discretionary appropriations are defined in the BCA as budgetary resources provided in annual appropriations acts. In contrast, direct spending was defined to include budget authority provided by laws other than appropriations acts. The BCA further required OMB to calculate a uniform percentage reduction to be applied to each program, project, or activity within the direct spending category. For the direct spending category, OMB determined this percentage to be 5.1% for FY2013.", "Section 102(d)(3)(e) of SRS directed that payments for a fiscal year were to be made to the state as soon as practicable after the end of that fiscal year, meaning that the FY2012 payment was made in FY2013. Because the authority to make these payments is not provided in an annual appropriations act, such payments are not discretionary spending for purposes of the BCA. These payments were classified as non-defense, direct spending for purposes of sequestration. The BCA exempts a number of programs from sequestration; however, the payments under SRS were not identified in the legislation as exempt. Consequently, these payments were subject to sequestration as non-defense, direct spending. However, BLM and FS managed the sequestration of the FY2013 payments in different ways.", "BLM Sequestration of SRS Funds", "BLM issues SRS payments only for the O&C lands in Oregon. In February 2013, BLM distributed $36 million to the 18 O&C counties in Oregon for FY2012 SRS payments. However, DOI had held back 10% of the scheduled payments across all three titles in anticipation of the possibility of sequestration. The reduction to DOI's SRS program required by sequestration was 5.1% of the total payment, or $2.0 million. Since the sequestered amount was less than the amount withheld, DOI-BLM owed an additional SRS payment for the difference. In May 2013, BLM distributed the remaining 4.9% of the payment, resulting in a total of $38 million for the SRS payment to the O&C counties for FY2012.

In letters sent to each affected governor, the Forest Service outlined two repayment options and asked for the states to respond by April 19, 2013, with how they planned to repay. Invoices for repayment were not included. In addition to repaying the 5.1%, the FS offered the states the option of having the full sequestered amount taken out of Title II funds (for those states with enough Title II money). Three states\u2014Alaska, Washington, and Wyoming\u2014publicly indicated their intention not to repay the SRS funds.
