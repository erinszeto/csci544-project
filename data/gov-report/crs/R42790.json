The varied demographic factors of each of these populations likely contribute to variations in employment outcomes, though their degree of influence is unclear.", "There are a number of federal programs to assist veterans in developing job skills and securing civilian employment.

These transition programs cover a variety of topics, including information on identifying occupations that align with military skills and specializations, conducting job searches, applying for employment, and navigating veterans' benefits. One of the most common veterans' benefits is educational funding through the GI Bill. The GI Bill programs typically provide funding for tuition, fees, books, housing, and other educational costs while the veteran is enrolled.", "Veterans who are seeking employment without obtaining additional education receive priority of service at local federally funded American Job Center (AJC) locations and may receive assistance from dedicated state personnel. Veterans who wish to pursue employment in the federal government are assisted by several policies that give them preference in the competitive hiring process or, in some cases, allow them to forgo the competitive process and be appointed directly. Veterans who wish to start a small business may receive loans and technical assistance from the Small Business Administration (SBA).", "Veterans with service-connected disabilities who have obstacles to employment may be assisted by the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) program. This program provides assistance in identifying an occupation that is consistent with the veteran's skills and interests and providing services (including educational services) to achieve that outcome. Disabled veterans and other veterans with substantial barriers to employment can receive assistance from the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP), which funds personnel positions that provide assistance in local labor markets as part of the AJC network.", "In addition to these nationwide programs, the federal government also funds competitive grant programs for state, local, and private entities to provide employment-oriented services to veterans.

", "This section will divide workers into three groups: (1) Gulf War Era II (GWII) veterans who served at any point after September 2001, (2) veterans from prior service periods, and (3) nonveterans. Since these populations vary in many characteristics other than veteran status, comparisons of employment outcomes between these groups should be conducted with caution.", "Recent employment outcomes for veterans and nonveterans are presented in Table 1 . As the table shows, the unemployment rate for GWII veterans is higher than the unemployment rates of both veterans from other service periods and nonveterans. GWII veterans, however, constitute less than one-quarter of the veteran labor force (about 2.5 million of just about 10.7 million).", "Several factors that are not observable in Table 1 should also be considered when interpreting the employment data in the table.", "The GWII veteran labor force is younger than the nonveteran labor force. About 55% of GWII veterans in the labor force are under the age of 35, compared to about 36% of nonveterans in the labor force. Since younger workers generally have higher unemployment rates than older workers, GWII veterans' relative youth may influence their unemployment rate. Veterans have a different educational distribution than nonveterans. Among those in the labor force, 1% of GWII veterans and 3% of other veterans have less than a high school education, compared to 8% of nonveterans. Conversely, the proportions of college graduates among the labor forces of GWII veterans (33%) and other veterans (31%) are slightly lower than nonveterans (38%). The effect of this different educational distribution on veterans' employment outcomes is unclear. Disability issues. Approximately 16% of all veterans and 29% of GWII veterans reported service-connected disabilities. Among veterans of all service periods, there was little difference between veterans with service-connected disabilities and veterans without service-connected disabilities in their respective labor force participation rates (45% v. 50%) and unemployment rates (5.9% for each group). Among GWII veterans, veterans with service-connected disabilities were less likely to participate in the labor force (75% v. 87%), though GWII veterans with service-connected disabilities had a lower unemployment rate than veterans from the same era who did not report service-connected disabilities (5.9% v. 6.6%). Comparable data on employment outcomes for nonveterans with disabilities were not available. Categorization of post-military transition period . Recent veterans who have not yet secured post-service employment are categorized as unemployed and entitled to unemployment insurance. The classification of this transition period may influence GWII veterans' unemployment rate.", " Figure 1 presents recent historical data on unemployment rates for GWII veterans, other veterans, and nonveterans. Several trends emerge over the six-year reference period:", "The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is typically above that of nonveterans, while the unemployment rate for other veterans is below that of nonveterans . The average unemployment rate for the period in the graph was 9.8% among GWII veterans, 6.9% among veterans from other periods of service, and 8.0% among nonveterans. As noted previously, differences in the characteristics of each population may influence their respective unemployment rates. The unemployment rate for GWII veterans is more dynamic than the unemployment rate for other populations . While using a 12-month moving average somewhat controls for large variations in monthly estimates, changes in GWII veterans' unemployment rate is still more dynamic than the changes for other populations. This dynamism is likely due to small sample sizes of GWII veterans in the surveys rather than abrupt changes in this population's unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for each group trends similarly over the reference period. While the dynamic nature of the GWII veterans' unemployment rate somewhat masks this trend, each group's unemployment rate followed a generally upward trend early in the period covered by the graph and then declined during the later period.

Class sizes are smaller than under the previous curriculum to provide individual attention. The required individual transition plan is standardized and tied to the servicemember's personal goals. Successful completion is based on achieving \"career readiness standards,\" not simply attendance.
