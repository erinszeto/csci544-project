Action to recognize, support, honor, or acknowledge certain days, weeks, and months, however, requires only a simple resolution agreed to by the House or Senate, or a concurrent resolution agreed to by both chambers.", "While historically common for Congress to recognize a day, week, or month, this practice has become rarer since the adoption of House Rule XII, clause 5, in the 104th Congress (1995-1996).
