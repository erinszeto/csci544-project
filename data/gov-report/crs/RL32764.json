Bush Administration with regard to mandatory constraints on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.", "The court cases, decided and pending, arise in eight contexts. The first is the Clean Air Act (CAA). In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that as to mobile sources of emissions (cars, trucks), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority under the act to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This decision puts pressure on EPA to move forward as well with regulation of GHGs from stationary sources (power plants, factories).", "Second, litigation under wildlife statutes, particularly the Endangered Species Act, raises the possibility that the impacts of climate change on wildlife may constrain private activities that emit GHGs.", "Third, energy statutes have been invoked. It has been held, for example, that under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the United States must monetize the benefits of reduced carbon emissions as part of setting light-truck fuel economy standards.", "Fourth, various statutes requiring federal government analysis and information dissemination\u2014the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Global Change Research Act (GCRA), and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\u2014have generated climate-change litigation. NEPA suits make up the most numerous subset of this category. Courts agree that if a plaintiff can establish standing, NEPA can be used to compel agency consideration of the climate change effects of its actions.", "Fifth, common law tort theories such as nuisance have been invoked, not yet successfully, to force cutbacks in GHG emissions, or payment of damages. Several cases are on appeal.", "Sixth are the preemption suits. These challenge state regulation of GHG emissions from motor vehicles as preempted by the federal corporate average fuel economy standards or federal authority over foreign policy. The two rulings thus far have rejected these challenges, but are on appeal. California's suit attacking EPA's denial of its request for a waiver of federal preemption under the Clean Air Act has now been stayed, pending EPA reconsideration of the denial.", "Seventh, chiefly with respect to coal-fired power plants, are suits under state utilities laws.", "And eighth, one case asks whether existing general liability insurance policies cover climate-change-related liability.", "Finally, the report discusses international law aspects of a nation's contributions to climate change, and offers some overview comments."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The scientific, economic, and political questions surrounding climate change have long been with us. This report focuses instead on a relative newcomer: the legal debate.

One observer counts 118 lawsuits and petitions for government action filed on climate change issues through the end of 2008\u201441 lawsuits filed in 2007 alone. Representatives of some suing organizations and states acknowledge that a prime cause for this litigation surge is the inaction of Congress and the executive branch during the George W. Bush Administration with regard to mandatory constraints on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and their perception that litigation might help to prompt such action. Early signs are that the pace of new filings during the Obama Administration may be tapering off.", "The principal court cases, decided and pending, arise in eight contexts\u2014a number that continues to grow. First and most important is the Clean Air Act (CAA). In April, 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority under the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.", "The second context for climate change litigation is the federal wildlife statutes, raising the issue of whether statutes like the Endangered Species Act can be used to limit GHG emissions based on their contribution to climate-climate-related alterations of wildlife habitat. Third is the federal energy statutes, such as the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which also raise questions as to whether climate change impacts must be considered in their spheres. The fourth context for litigation is federal information statutes such as the National Environmental Policy Act, exploring the extent to which they can be used to compel government analysis of and dissemination of information about climate change. Fifth is common law tort theories such as nuisance and whether they be used successfully by state and private plaintiffs to force cutbacks in GHG emissions, or payment of damages? Sixth is federal preemption of state regulation of GHG emissions. This category breaks down into efforts by states and environmentalists to reverse EPA's refusal to waive Clean Air Act preemption, and auto industry efforts to impose preemption under non-Clean Air Act theories, such as the \"CAFE standards\" under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Seventh, chiefly with respect to coal-fired power plants, is state utilities laws. And eighth is whether general liability insurance policies cover harms and liabilities caused by climate change.", "Sections I through VIII of this report address these eight areas of litigation in turn. Most known cases, decided and pending, are mentioned\u2014omitted cases are those that raise climate change issues in only the most marginal way or only implicitly, and some state cases. Looking beyond the domestic lawsuits, Section IX surveys international law arguments that might be used to induce GHG emission reductions from the United States and other countries that are major GHG emitters, and the few international law claims filed against the United States to date.

One authority would derive from an argument that even prior to ratification, the Protocol provided some sort of legal basis for emissions restrictions, perhaps citing past treaties signed by the United States that were provisionally implemented prior to going into effect. This possibility provoked a series of enactments barring EPA's use of appropriated funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol in the absence of approval and ratification.", "The rest of this section deals with the second claim of possible authority: regulating GHG emissions independently of the Protocol, under the CAA. This authority has now been confirmed by the Supreme Court, at least as to mobile sources; nonetheless, this report retains from earlier versions the historical evolution of the issue.", "In 1998, an EPA General Counsel memorandum concluded that CO 2 satisfies the CAA definition of \"air pollutant,\" but that this conclusion is only the first step. Before EPA can regulate CO 2 emissions, the memorandum went on, it must further conclude that CO 2 meets criteria in other CAA provisions requiring the agency to determine that the substance poses harm to public health, welfare, or the environment. This next step EPA declined to take. At a House hearing in 1999, a panel of legal experts argued the question of EPA's authority to regulate CO 2 under the CAA. A new EPA General Counsel endorsed his predecessor's analysis in the 1998 memorandum, but just as his predecessor, stressed that the EPA's legal analysis was \"largely theoretical\" since \"EPA currently has no plans to regulate carbon dioxide....\" This hands-off position was prompted in part by strong congressional opposition based on uncertainties as to the economic impact of regulating a pollutant as widespread as CO 2 . In addition, some in Congress argued that CAA implementation of a CO 2 standard was barred by the aforementioned enactments (appropriation riders) prohibiting implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.", "The EPA General Counsel opinion that \"air pollutant\" includes GHGs held sway until 2003, when that office reversed itself in the context of a petition asking the agency to regulate GHG emissions from mobile sources. This story picks up below (\"Mobile Sources of GHG Emissions\")."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Suits Seeking General CAA Rulemaking by EPA", "paragraphs": ["The earliest lawsuit in this category, now dismissed, sought to have EPA promulgate national ambient air quality standards for CO 2 . In Massachusetts v. Whitman , filed in 2003, three Northeast states (MA, CT, ME) sought to force EPA to list CO 2 as a \"criteria pollutant\" under the CAA. They argued that on various occasions, EPA had indicated its belief that CO 2 emissions contribute to climate change. These EPA statements constituted, in the words of CAA section 108, a \"judgment [that GHG emissions] cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare\" and \"result[] from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" These prerequisites being satisfied, the suit argued, section 108 requires EPA to add CO 2 to its list of \"criteria pollutants,\" then proceed under section 109 to develop national ambient air quality standards for CO 2 . On September 3, 2003, a few days after EPA's denial of a petition asking the agency to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles, the plaintiff states voluntarily dismissed this suit, reportedly so as to transfer their energies to a suit challenging the petition denial (leading to the Supreme Court's Massachusetts v. EPA decision).", "The remaining suits in this category are all active today. Each one seeks EPA regulation of GHG emissions through new source performance standards (NSPSs) under the CAA. In most of these cases, regulation of GHGs is not the primary issue. Nonetheless, it should be noted that they will be litigated in the shadow of the Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA holding that EPA has authority under the CAA to regulate GHGs from mobile sources. The burning question is how that ruling will affect EPA regulation of stationary-source GHG emissions.", "The first NSPS suit was New York v. EPA , an effort to compel EPA to issue a NSPS for CO 2 from steam generating units. New York began with an EPA proposal to revise its NSPSs for electric utility and other steam-generating units. Some commenters on the proposed rule argued that EPA must, in addition to the revisions proposed, set NSPSs for GHGs emitted from steam generating units. The commenters pointed to CAA section 111's command that EPA promulgate NSPSs to address emissions from new stationary sources that \"cause[], or contribute[] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" In promulgating its final rule in February, 2006, however, EPA rejected this demand, saying (it being pre- Massachusetts v. EPA ) that the agency lacked authority to set NSPSs for GHGs. Review of the final rule was sought in the D.C. Circuit. In 2006, the court severed the portion of the case dealing with regulation of GHGs, titling it New York v. EPA . In 2007, a few months after the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , this severed case was remanded to EPA for further proceedings in light of that decision (this section infra ) .", "Two other NSPS suits concern oil and natural gas\u2014the production side in one suit; the refining side in the other. As to production, plaintiffs in WildEarth Guardians v. Johnson , No. 1:09 CV 00089 (D.D.C. filed January 14, 2009), invoke the CAA citizen suit provision to force EPA performance of alleged nondiscretionary duties under both the NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants provisions of the act. The complaint notes CO 2 , and particularly methane, as GHG pollutants of concern. Since neither of these pollutants is listed as a hazardous air pollutant, it may be surmised that the sole portion of the lawsuit pertinent to climate change is the NSPS claim. That claim alleges EPA's failure to review and revise the NSPS for the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production category since 1985, despite the CAA requirement that NSPSs be reviewed, and if appropriate revised, every eight years.", "As for oil and gas refining, New York and 11 other states (CA, CT, DE, ME, MA, NH, NM, OR, RI, VT, and WA) filed a petition for review in 2008 challenging EPA's revisions that year of its existing NSPS for petroleum refineries. Petitioners' argument in New York v. EPA , No. 08-1279 (D.C. Cir. filed August 25, 2008), is that EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to determine whether GHGs from petroleum refineries endanger public health and welfare and by failing to promulgate NSPSs for GHG emissions in the refinery rule. Petitioners cite CAA section 111(b)'s requirement that EPA make an endangerment determination, establish NSPS for a source category that contributes significantly to such endangerment, and revise the NSPS at least every eight years. This lawsuit has been consolidated with several others, including Environmental Integrity Project v. EPA (No. 08-1281), and is now styled American Petroleum Institute v. EPA (No. 08-1277). On December 15, 2008, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion to hold the case in abeyance while EPA considers various petitions for administrative reconsideration of the rule.", "The most recent NSPS suit, Environmental Integrity Project v. U.S. EPA , No. 1:09-CV 00218 (D.D.C. filed February 4, 2009), seeks to compel EPA to perform its nondiscretionary duty to review, and if necessary revise, its NSPS for nitric acid plants, including for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a powerful GHG.. The standard, plaintiffs allege, has not been reviewed since 1984, notwithstanding the CAA requirement that NSPSs be reviewed and if appropriate revised every eight years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Suits and Administrative Petitions Enforcing the CAA Against Specific Stationary Sources", "paragraphs": ["Rather than seeking general rulemaking directly, as above, the following legal efforts seek to impose CO 2 emission limits in actions against specific proposed facilities\u2014mostly coal-fired power plants. Plainly, of course, the effect of rulings in actions against specific sources can signify a de facto general rule as well. The efforts described here are part of a broader campaign by certain environmental groups to block, or at least limit the GHG emissions of, new coal-fired power plants generally.", "In Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Owens Corning Corp ., environmental groups invoke the CAA citizen suit provision to enforce the act's \"new source review\" requirement as to GHG emissions. They contend that Owens Corning is constructing a manufacturing plant in Oregon with the potential to emit more than 250 tons per year of harmful gases, without having obtained the required CAA permit. The principal such gas is HCFC-142b, which plaintiffs contend is a potent GHG. In a preliminary ruling, the court held that plaintiffs have standing, notwithstanding that the climate change impacts of the plant's GHG emissions would be \"indirect.\" Anticipating the Supreme Court's rationale for granting standing in Massachusetts v. EPA , the court found that standing was not precluded by the fact that the injury to plaintiffs would be shared with many others, nor because the relief sought would not lead to a complete elimination of climate change impacts. ", "Several proceedings, chiefly brought by the Sierra Club, have involved administrative appeals to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board of \"new source review\" permits in Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) areas. In each case, the issue has been whether a permit issued for construction of a new \"major emitting facility\" (or major modification of an existing facility) in a PSD area must require \"best available control technology\" (BACT) for CO 2 emissions from that source. The CAA requires such new facilities (or major modifications) to install BACT for \"each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act.\" Thus, the pivotal question has been when \u2014upon the occurrence of what event\u2014do CO 2 and other GHG emissions become \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA.", "In the first proceeding, In re Christian County Generation, LLC, PSD Appeal No. 07-01, 13 E.A.D. ____ (January 28, 2008), Sierra Club objected to the issuance of a PSD permit by a state agency for construction of a coal-fired electric power plant. The Board denied the petition because Sierra Club had not raised its argument during the public comment period on the draft permit. ", "The second and most publicized case, In re Deseret Power Electric Cooperative , PSD Appeal No. 07-03, 14 E.A.D. _____ (November 13, 2008), involved a PSD permit issued by EPA Region 8 to allow construction of a new waste-coal-fired utility generating unit at an existing power plant located near Bonanza, Utah. The Board rejected Sierra Club's contention that \"subject to regulation\" has a plain meaning compelling Region 8 to impose a CO 2 BACT limit in the PSD permit. Sierra Club had pointed to EPA's 1993 amendment of its regulations requiring monitoring and reporting of CO 2 emissions, as directed by section 821 of the 1990 CAA Amendments. At the same time, the Board rejected the Region's argument that it was limited by an historical agency interpretation to read \"subject to regulation\" as meaning \"subject to a statutory or regulatory provision that requires actual control of emissions of that pollutant.\" Since EPA has yet to issue a CAA regulation requiring actual control of CO 2 emissions, Region 8 argued, BACT for CO 2 is not required. Hence, the Board remanded the permit to the Region for it to reconsider whether to impose a CO 2 BACT limit. The Board recognized, however, that given the significance of the issue, it would be best if the Agency, rather than one of its regional offices, defined \"subject to regulation under this Act.\"", "This the EPA Administrator did a month later. In a memorandum issued December 18, 2008, he declared EPA's \"definitive interpretation\" of its regulation defining which pollutants trigger new source review in PSD areas. Reprising Region 8's argument in Deseret Power , the Administrator said that this regulation \"exclude[s] pollutants for which EPA regulations only require monitoring or reporting but ... include[s] each pollutant subject to either a provision in the Clean Air Act or regulation adopted by EPA under the Clean Air Act that requires actual control of emissions of that pollutant.\" To reiterate, this position excludes CO 2 until EPA promulgates a regulation covering CO 2 emissions. Sierra Club petitioned for review of the December 18 memorandum, which was granted by the newly arrived Obama Administration on February 17, 2009.", "In the third EAB appeal, In re Northern Michigan University (Ripley Heating Plant) , PSD Appeal No. 08-02, 14 E.A.D. ______ (February 18, 2009), Sierra Club challenges a permit issued by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to the university, allowing it to construct a new circulating fluidized bed boiler at the heating plant. Sierra Club's argument was the same as in Deseret , and the Board ruled identically\u2014that is, it directed the Michigan agency, guided by Deseret , to consider whether \"pollutant subject to regulation\" requires application of a BACT limit to CO 2 emissions. The Board's decision makes no mention of the Administrator's December, 2008 memo or EPA's grant of review thereof in 2009.", "In yet another EAB appeal of a PSD permit, In re Desert Rock Energy Co., LLC , PSD Appeal No. 08-03 (consolidated with others), challenge was brought by several environmental groups and New Mexico. The EPA Region 9 permit allows construction of a new 1,500-megawatt coal-fired power plant within the Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico. In January, 2009, however, Region 9 withdrew for additional analysis the portion of its permit decision on whether to impose CO 2 limitations, leading the EAB on January 22, 2009, to stay further consideration of the issue.", "Turning from administrative appeals, at least two state courts have been called on to decide whether BACT must be applied to CO 2 in PSD areas. One has ruled. In Friends of the Chattahoochee, Inc. v. Couch , No. 2008CV146398 (Ga. Super. Ct. June 30, 2008), the court vacated and remanded a state ALJ decision upholding a state-issued PSD permit for construction of a 1,200-megawatt coal-fired power plant, proposed by Longleaf Energy Associates, LLC. Even putting aside the argument that after Massachusetts v. EPA , CO 2 is \"subject to regulation\" because it falls within the CAA's definition of \"air pollutant,\" the court had no doubt that CO 2 was \"subject to regulation\" based on the act's mandating of CO 2 monitoring and \"many other examples of Clean Air Act regulations that address CO 2 .\" The BACT requirement, said the court, is not limited to pollutants for which there is a separate, general numerical limitation, such as a national ambient air quality standard under the CAA.", "The other state court action is pending. In Montana Environmental Information Center v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality , No. DDV 08-820 (Mont. D. Ct. filed June 27, 2008), challenge is made to a state-issued PSD permit for a proposed 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant to be known as the Highwood Generating Station. Consistent with the federal CAA, Montana's PSD regulations require that any new major stationary source apply BACT for each pollutant \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA (and the state CAA). Petitioners argue that the permit should have applied BACT to the proposed plant's CO 2 emissions, since in light of Massachusetts v. EPA and CAA requirements for monitoring and reporting of CO 2 emissions, CO 2 is \"subject to regulation\" under the federal and state acts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mobile Sources of GHG Emissions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Section 202 Petition Denial and the Second EPA General Counsel Memorandum", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, 19 organizations petitioned EPA to regulate emissions of GHGs (CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons) from new motor vehicles.

That section directs the EPA Administrator to prescribe emission standards for \"any air pollutant\" from new motor vehicles \"which, in his judgment cause[s], or contribute[s] to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\"", "In 2003, EPA denied the section 202 petition. Much of the agency's rationale followed a new General Counsel memorandum, issued the same day. Contrary to its Clinton Administration precursor, this new OGC memorandum concluded that the CAA does not grant EPA authority to regulate CO 2 and other GHG emissions for their climate change impacts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Massachusetts v. EPA: The Challenge to EPA's Petition Denial", "paragraphs": ["EPA's denial of the section 202 petition prompted a suit in the D.C. Circuit by twelve states (CA, CT, IL, MA, ME, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA) and others. Opposing the challenge, besides EPA, were ten state intervenors (AK, ID, KS, MI, ND, NE, OH, SD, TX, UT), plus several automobile- and truck-related trade groups. In 2005, a split panel in Massachusetts v. EPA rejected the suit, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.", "In Massachusetts v. EPA , the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for petitioners on all three issues in the case. First, Massachusetts, the majority held, had standing to bring the claim. Second, EPA has authority to regulate motor vehicle GHGs under section 202, since \"air pollutant\" includes GHG emissions. And third, the phrase \"in his judgment\" in section 202 does not allow EPA to exercise discretion against regulating based on policy considerations. The ruling in favor of petitioners was forecast early in the majority opinion by its opening sentences: \"A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related.\" (Nor did the dissenters dispute this.)", "Most of the decision is devoted to the first issue, standing. The Court found that petitioners had two factors in their favor. First, the CAA specifically authorizes challenges to agency action unlawfully withheld, such as here. A litigant to whom Congress has accorded such a procedural right, said the Court, \"can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy\" \u2014two prerequisites of the standing test. Second, the Court found it \"of considerable relevance\" that the petitioner injury on which it focused\u2014Massachusetts's loss of shore land from global-warming-induced sea level rise\u2014was that of a sovereign state. States are \"not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\" said the Court, noting their quasi-sovereign duty to preserve their territory.", "Having described petitioners' favored position in establishing standing, it was surprising that the Court then undertook a traditional standing analysis. As to the first prong of the standing test\u2014whether plaintiff has demonstrated actual or imminent \"injury in fact\" of a concrete and particularized nature\u2014the Court homed in on Massachusetts's status as owner of much of the shore land being lost to sea level rise. That this injury may be widely shared with other coastal states does not disqualify this injury, said the Court; it is nonetheless concrete.", "The second prong of the standing test is causation, requiring that the injury of which the plaintiff complains is fairly traceable to the defendant. EPA did not dispute the existence of a causal relationship between GHG emissions and climate change. It did argue, however, that any reduction in GHG emissions achieved through the current litigation would be too small a portion of worldwide GHG emissions to make a cognizable difference in climate change. In a ruling that may be of benefit to environmental plaintiffs in many contexts, the Court held that even an agency's refusal to take a \"small incremental step\" that would result in only a modest reduction in worldwide GHG emissions, is enough for standing purposes.", "The third and final prong of the standing test is redressability, demanding that the remedy sought by the plaintiff is one that is likely to redress his/her injury. Here, the remedy sought was EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. The Court found that this remedy satisfied redressability because while it would not by itself reverse climate change, it would nonetheless slow or reduce such change. Nor, given the \"enormity\" of the potential effects of climate change, was it relevant to the Court that the full effectiveness of the remedy would be delayed until existing cars and trucks on the road were largely replaced by new ones.", "In contrast with the Court's lengthy discourse on standing, its handling of the CAA issues in the case is quite brief. On the authority question, the Court said that the CAA's broad definition of \"air pollutant\" simply cannot be squared with EPA's view that GHGs are not included. The Court rejected EPA's argument that federal laws enacted following enactment of this definition\u2014laws emphasizing interagency collaboration and research\u2014suggest that Congress meant to curtail EPA's power to use mandatory regulations in addressing air pollutants. Nor was the Court impressed with EPA's argument that \"air pollutant\" in the CAA could not include vehicle GHG emissions because EPA standards for such emissions could be satisfied only by improving fuel economy, a goal assigned to the Department of Transportation under a different statute (the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ).", "Finally, on the discretion issue, the majority concluded that \"in his judgment\" refers only to whether an air pollutant \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" Thus, said the Court, EPA can avoid taking further action in response to the section 202 petition \"only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion.\" It rejected EPA's stated policy reasons for refusing to regulate GHG emissions, such as its claim that voluntary executive branch programs already provide an effective response to climate change and that unilateral EPA regulation of vehicle GHG emissions could weaken U.S. efforts to persuade developing countries to reduce the GHG intensity of their economies. Such reasons \"have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change.\" In short, said the Court, the only question is whether sufficient information exists to make an endangerment finding under section 202.", "Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit opinion and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. On September 14, 2007, the D.C. Circuit vacated EPA's denial of the section 202 petition and remanded the matter to the agency. (Further developments are described in the following \"Aftermath\" section.)", "A four-justice dissent by Chief Justice Roberts in Massachusetts v. EPA disputed the majority's holding of standing. A dissent by Justice Scalia for the same four justices argued that agency policy preferences may appropriately be considered as part of EPA's decision whether to issue a \"judgment,\" conceding that the judgment, if made , must be limited to whether vehicle GHG emissions cause endangerment. Justice Scalia also disputed the majority's holding that \"air pollutant\" in section 202 includes GHGs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aftermath of Supreme Court Decision", "paragraphs": ["The Court's decision left EPA with three options: make a finding that motor vehicle GHG emissions may \"endanger public health or welfare\" and issue emissions standards; make a finding that such emissions do not satisfy that prerequisite; or decide that climate change science is so uncertain as to preclude making a finding either way (or cite some other \"reasonable explanation\" why it will not exercise its discretion either way). As to the state of climate change science, the Court's focus on the policy reasons EPA gave as part of exercising its \"judgment\" obscures the fact that the agency's rejection of the petition stemmed in part from expressions of scientific uncertainty in a 2001 National Research Council report on the science of climate change. Whether scientific reports since the petition rejection in 2003 have foreclosed the scientific-uncertainty rationale is beyond the scope of this report.", "The EPA Administrator did say after the decision that although it bars EPA use of policy considerations as a basis for denying the petition, it left open whether the agency can invoke them when actually writing the regulations, should the agency make an endangerment finding. CAA section 202 does not impose any stringency or other criteria on GHG emission standards promulgated under the section. Given the wide latitude EPA has in setting section 202 standards for GHGs, the possibility exists that EPA, following an endangerment finding, could set voluntary standards, or standards pegged to the CAFE standards for fuel economy, or standards that must be complied with only after the President certifies that developing nations have put adequate GHG emission limits into effect. ", "In May, 2007, President Bush, in response to Massachusetts v. EPA , asked EPA to have CAA regulations limiting vehicle GHG emissions in place by the end of 2008 and to use the President's 2007 State of the Union proposal for raising the CAFE standards as a guide. As late as early December, 2007, EPA was consistently stating that it intended to issue proposed regulations by the end of 2007. However, the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act in December, 2007, with its increase in CAFE standards, led EPA to back off from any firm deadline for issuance of mobile-source GHG emission standards. In early 2008, EPA proposed instead to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) addressing the full range of Massachusetts v. EPA 's ramifications throughout the CAA, not just on section 202 standards. In response, the Massachusetts v. EPA petitioners in April, 2008 requested the D.C. Circuit to order EPA to comply with the Supreme Court's remand and the Circuit's mandate within 60 days (by choosing one of the three options noted earlier). The court denied the request in June, 2008. The following month, EPA issued a lengthy ANPR that, it said, \"reflects the complexity and magnitude of the question of whether and how greenhouse gases could be effectively controlled under the Clean Air Act\" \u2014extending well beyond the narrow section 202 endangerment issue in the case. It warned that regulating GHGs under any provision of the CAA \"could result in an unprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy....\" Apparently undaunted, the Obama Administration EPA issued a proposed endangerment finding on April 24, 2009, to be followed by a 60-day comment period after which the agency will decide whether to finalize the finding. If the finding is finalized, emission \"standards\" for GHGs must follow, though section 202 says nothing about what form these standards must take and how stringent they must be.", "As the ANPR asserts, the Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA has many implications beyond its four corners.", "On the substantive (non-standing) side, the Court's ruling upholding CAA coverage of GHG emissions from mobile sources improves the prospects of litigation seeking to have EPA restrict GHG emissions from stationary sources as well. The stationary-source provisions of the CAA use terms similar to that of section 202\u2014in particular, \"air pollutant,\" \"in his judgment,\" and \"endanger.\" As the earlier subsection on suits seeking general CAA rulemaking indicated, such an effort to compel EPA regulation of stationary source GHGs is already underway as to NSPSs. Further, if EPA sets a national ambient air quality standard for CO 2 , GHGs would be covered under the CAA's new source review permitting program for major emitting facilities and modifications in Prevention of Significant Deterioration areas. Presumably, best available control technology for CO 2 emissions would then have to be installed on such facilities.", "On the mobile-source side, Massachusetts v.

The first, in which climate change was only a contributing factor, was NMFS' listing of the staghorn coral and elkhorn coral as threatened in 2006. The second, garnering considerably more attention, was the May 15, 2008 listing of the polar bear as threatened, under pressure of a court-imposed deadline requiring a decision for or against listing by that date. The polar bear listing was based largely on the many studies as to the disproportionately large impact of climate change on the Arctic and the resulting loss of sea ice required by polar bears as habitat. The third, again with climate change but a contributing factor, is NMFS' listing of the black abalone as endangered in 2009. In addition to the coral, polar bear, and abalone, CBD has petitioned the FWS to list as either endangered or threatened Kittlitz's murrelet, a seabird (2001), 12 species of penguins (2006), the American pika, an alpine mammal (2007), the ashy storm-petrel, another seabird (2007), the ribbon seal (2007), the Pacific walrus (2008), and the ringed, bearded, and spotted seals (2008). In each instance, the Center asserts global warming to be a cause, principal or otherwise, of the species' plight.

", "With the listing of the corals and polar bear\u2014particularly the latter where the climate change nexus is so clear\u2014the question moves to the fore whether operating a fossil-fuel-fired power plant or other major GHG source violates section 9\u2014causes a prohibited \"take\"\u2014through the effects of its GHG emissions, via climate change, on polar bear habitat. Notable here is that \"take\" is statutorily defined to include \"harm\" to a member of a listed species, and \"harm,\" in turn, is defined by regulation to include certain \"significant habitat modification[s] or degradation[s].\" The crux, presumably, is whether the causal link between the power plant's GHG emissions and the effect on the species habitat is sufficiently direct and substantial to constitute a \"take,\" a question beyond the scope of this report. If a take is found, the power plant would require an incidental take permit to operate, such permit likely containing restrictions on the amount of GHGs that could be emitted. Likewise, the argument runs, a federal agency issuing a permit for power plant construction might have to initiate section 7 consultation.", "In 2008, under the George W. Bush Administration, the FWS repeatedly asserted that its listing of the polar bear would not implicate the ESA \u2013 neither section 9 nor section 7 \u2013 based on the GHG emissions from an activity. The FWS sought to ensure the irrelevance of GHG emissions to the ESA in several ways. One way was by issuing a \"special rule\" for the polar bear under ESA section 4(d) stating that section 9 \"take\" prohibitions do not apply to \"any taking of polar bears that is incidental to, but not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity\" occurring anywhere in the United States except Alaska. A half-dozen or more lawsuits challenging the polar bear listing and the accompanying \"special rule\"\u2014most including grounds related to climate change\u2014were consolidated on December 3, 2008 in the D.C. federal district court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. ", "Another way used by FWS (and NMFS) in 2008 to keep the ESA and GHG emissions separate was by amending the section 7 consultation regulations to say, for example, that no consultation is required when a federal agency action is not anticipated to result in \"take\" and the action's effects are \"manifested through global processes\" and either (a) cannot be reliably predicted at the scale of the species' range, or (b) will have insignificant impact on the species or its habitat. With the arrival of the Obama Administration, Congress in 2009 allowed the relevant Secretary (of the Interior, with regard to FWS; of Commerce, with regard to NMFS) 60 days in which to withdraw the polar bear special rule and/or the 2008 amendments to the consultation regulations \"without regard to any provision of statute or regulation that establishes a requirement for such withdrawal.\" This streamlined withdrawal authority was exercised on May 4, 2009, solely with regard to the amendments of the consultation regulations, reinstating the prior version.

Possible plaintiffs include property owners (farmers dealing with reduced rainfall, owners of oceanfront homes dealing with rising sea level or increased storm activity), nonowner users of natural resources (ski resort operators, commercial fishermen), and state attorneys general bringing private or public nuisance claims (the former for injury to state-owned land, the latter on behalf of the state's citizenry to protect public health and well-being). Possible defendants include the companies that produce the fossil fuels whose combustion produces GHG emissions, entities that emit GHGs (chiefly fossil-fuel-fired powerplants, but many other sources also), and companies that manufacture or market products whose use creates GHG emissions (chiefly the automakers).", "Several of these potential plaintiff and defendant categories are represented in the five climate-change-related tort cases known to be filed thus far (four discussed in the following text, one in footnote 130 ).

Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co. , Civ. No. 04 CV 05669 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 21, 2004). These defendants were chosen as allegedly the five largest CO 2 emitters in the United States, through their fossil-fuel-fired electric powerplants. Invoking the federal and state common law of public nuisance, plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring defendants to abate their contribution to the nuisance of climate change by capping CO 2 emissions and then reducing them. Plaintiffs sue both on their own behalf to protect state-owned property (e.g., the hardwood forests of the Adirondack Park in New York), and as parens patriae on behalf of their citizens and residents to protect public health and well-being.", "On the same day, three land trusts filed a similar suit against the same defendants, in the same court, adding a private nuisance claim. Open Space Institute v. American Electric Power Co. , No. 04 CV 05670 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 21, 2004). They seek to protect land owned and preserved by them in the state of New York, which they claim to be threatened by climate change. This suit was consolidated with the state suit.", "In a series of motions, defendants sought to have these actions dismissed on a wide spectrum of threshold grounds. Though the case has now been decided by the trial court on a single threshold issue, it is worth reviewing some of the grounds advanced in these motions because they may reappear later, in this or other private GHG litigation. To reiterate, many of these grounds typify the difficulties encountered when one seeks to address through private litigation a ubiquitous, long-term environmental problem to which countless parties contribute.", "In a dismissal motion, some defendants argued there is no federal common law cause of action for climate change. Creating such federal common law, they argued, runs afoul of Supreme Court directives that federal courts do so only in limited areas\u2014especially where, as with climate change, the problem at issue has sweeping implications. Even assuming a viable federal common-law nuisance theory, they continued, Congress's enactment of a comprehensive scheme of air pollution regulation in the CAA displaces federal court authority in this area. Defendants also challenge plaintiffs' standing to sue. Plaintiffs, they argued, have not demonstrated the \"injury in fact\" requisite of standing because they allege only injuries from climate change in the indefinite future. Nor, said these defendants, have plaintiffs shown \"causation\" because they do not allege that defendants' conduct will directly cause the consequences of climate change\u2014especially since defendants' collective emissions are admitted to be less than 2-1/2% of the global total from human activities. As mentioned, the viability of these federal common law of nuisance and no-standing arguments by defendants may be significantly affected\u2014the displacement argument helped, the others hurt\u2014by Massachusetts v. EPA .", "Another motion to dismiss asserted that to the limited extent a federal common law claim to abate an interstate nuisance has been recognized, it has been limited to actions brought by state entities. Nor, said defendants, can plaintiffs assert public nuisance, because they have not alleged special injury to their properties, or private nuisance, because they have not alleged substantial harm.", "As indicated, the dismissal motions in Connecticut and Open Space Institute have now been ruled on by the district court, which dismissed the cases on political question grounds. This judicial doctrine requires a court to look into \"the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments [i.e., the legislative and executive branches] and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination....\" One situation judicially recognized as pointing to a political question, hence dismissal of the action, is \"the impossibility of deciding [the case] without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\" This situation, said the court, perfectly fit the GHG cases, touching as they do on so many areas of national and international policy. As a political question, the court believed the climate change issue in these suits to be for the legislature, not the courts, to resolve. Very possibly, the amorphousness of nuisance law, giving the court little guidance in resolving these cases, may have hurt the plaintiffs' cause. These cases are now on appeal to the Second Circuit.", "A second nuisance action was filed in 2006 by California against several automobile manufacturers based on the alleged contributions of their vehicles to climate change impacts in the state. The suit asserts that these impacts constitute a public nuisance under federal or state common law, and seeks monetary damages (plaintiffs in Connecticut seek injunctive relief). The district court dismissed the suit on the same political-question rationale as in Connecticut \u2014namely, \"the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\" California v. General Motors Corp ., 2007 Westlaw 2726871 (N.D. Cal. September 17, 2007). The need for an \"initial policy determination\" by the political branches was supported, in the court's view, by the complexity of the climate change issue, the need for political guidance in divining what is an \"unreasonable\" interference with the public's rights (the definition of a public nuisance), and the global warming debate in the political branches. Ironically, the environmental \"win\" in Massachusetts v. EPA was cited by the court against the state, both because that decision found authority over GHG emissions to lie with the federal government and because it recognized a state's standing to press its grievances at the federal level.

Thus, CAA preemption of state regulation of car and truck GHG emissions is clear, whether or not EPA proceeds to regulate a particular mobile-source GHG. It would seem, then, that states are preempted from setting emission standards for CO 2 , methane, and hydrofluorocarbons\u2014three substances said to enhance climate change\u2014even though EPA has not set mobile-source emission standards for them.", "An exception to the general CAA rule preempting state mobile-source emission regulation is that EPA may waive CAA preemption for one particular state, California, if that state requests a waiver. Further, when EPA does grant California a waiver, the act automatically extends it to almost all states with mobile-source emission limits identical to California's.", "Under this \"California waiver\" authority, California requested a preemption waiver for its GHG emissions regulations on December 21, 2005. These regulations had been promulgated under a 2002 California enactment that was the first in the nation to call for limits on GHG emissions from mobile sources. Assembly Bill 1493 instructs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt regulations that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The CARB adopted the required regulations in 2004. The regulations target CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbon emissions, setting \"fleet average greenhouse gas exhaust mass emission requirements for passenger car, light-duty truck, and medium-duty passenger vehicle weight classes.\" The first model year to which the fleet averages apply is 2009. The averages are reduced for each subsequent model year through 2016.", "On December 19, 2007, almost two years after California requested the waiver, the EPA Administrator wrote the California governor that he intended to deny the state's request. On January 3, 2008, two petitions for review of this letter, arguing that it constituted final agency action on the waiver request, were filed in the Ninth Circuit. However, with the issuance of EPA's March 6 decision document, these suits based on the EPA letter were dismissed and replaced by a suit in the D.C. Circuit challenging that document.

EPCA is the authority under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) establishes corporate average fuel economy standards (\"CAFE standards\"). As recently amended, EPCA requires NHTSA to prescribe separate fuel economy standards for passenger and non-passenger automobiles beginning with model year 2011, to achieve a combined fuel economy average for model year 2020 of at least 35 miles per gallon. More pertinent here, EPCA preempts states from adopting laws \"related to\" the federal fuel economy standards. The auto industry argues that the only known way to reduce GHG emissions is to improve gas mileage, so that a state regulation of auto GHG emissions is a law \"related to\" the federal emission standard, hence invalid.", "Non-CAA preemption suits, brought by auto interests, are pending in four of the federal judicial circuits containing a state that has adopted GHG controls on vehicles.

Both reject the preemption theories presented.", "In the first to be decided, Green Mountain Chrysler Plymouth Dodge v. Crombie , 508 F. Supp. 2d 295 (D. Vt. 2007), the court ruled that the relationship between Vermont's California-identical GHG standards and EPCA was better analyzed as an interplay between two federal statutes (EPCA and the CAA) rather than as a federal preemption question. So viewing the matter, the court pointed out that NHTSA has consistently treated EPA-approved California mobile source emissions standards as constituting \"other motor vehicle standards of the Government,\" which EPCA says NHTSA must consider when setting CAFE standards. This suggests that EPCA was meant to coexist with the CAA, rather than supersede it. Moreover, noted the court, in a related context the Supreme Court's Massachusetts v. EPA decision saw the EPCA CAFE provisions as harmonious with the CAA. Thus, the court found the relationship between the CAA waiver authority and the EPCA CAFE provisions to be one of overlap, but not conflict. Despite its conclusion that preemption doctrine did not apply, the court did a preemption analysis anyway, finding that Vermont's GHG standards were preempted neither by EPCA nor as an intrusion upon the foreign policy authority of the United States.

Recently, the district court held that the claims of the auto manufacturers and trade associations in this case were barred by collateral estoppel, a legal doctrine that prohibits parties from relitigating issues they have already adjudicated, as these plaintiffs had done in Crombie and Goldstene . The Rhode Island auto dealers, by contrast, had themselves never raised the issues in the case and thus were held to be viable plaintiffs, allowing the case to proceed.

This case involved a state law requiring the state's public utilities commission to determine environmental cost values for each method of energy generation, and to use those values in proceedings before the commission. The commission set values for six pollutants, including CO 2 . Petitioners' challenge to the CO 2 value was rejected on the grounds that (a) notwithstanding the speculative nature of some of the data, the ALJ conducted a careful review based on sufficient evidence in the record, (b) the determination that CO 2 negatively affects the environment was proper, and (c) the determination as to CO 2 value otherwise comported with the governing statute.", "In 2000, the City of Seattle adopted a goal of meeting its electricity needs with \"no net greenhouse gas emissions.\" To achieve this goal, the city ordered the city-owned electric utility to offset its GHG emissions by paying others to reduce their GHG emissions. The utility did so, largely through agreements paying other entities to use cleaner fuels. This made the utility (according to its press release) \"the first large electric utility in the country to effectively eliminate its contribution of harmful greenhouse gas emissions.\" In Okeson v. City of Seattle , 150 P.3d 556 (Wash. 2007) (en banc), however, the utility's ratepayers argued that this offset arrangement was not authorized by the state's utility enabling act.

In In re Otter Tail Power Co ., 744 N.W.2d 594 (S.D. 2008), environmental intervenors urged the South Dakota public utilities commission to deny a permit to build a coal-fired energy conversion facility, in light of the substantial CO 2 it would emit. Notwithstanding, the commission granted the permit, and the state supreme court sustained. The commission, it held, was not clearly erroneous in finding that the added CO 2 threatened no \"serious\" injury to the environment, the state's statutory standard. Deference to the commission was particularly appropriate, it said, because the CO 2 from the facility would increase national CO 2 emissions by only .07%, and neither Congress nor the state had chosen to regulate CO 2 emissions.", "By contrast, the permit was initially denied in Kansas. After applying for a PSD construction permit for two 700-megawatt coal-fired power plants, the Sunflower Electric Power Corp. initially received a favorable response from the state agency, which asserted it would not consider CO 2 in connection with the application owing to the national and international character of climate change. Later, however, the agency invoked a state law providing it with emergency powers when emissions present a substantial endangerment to the health of persons or the environment. Using this authority, and specifically citing the large volume of CO 2 from the proposed plants, the agency denied the permit in 2007. Three times in 2008 and once in 2009 the Kansas legislature passed laws that would have required Sunflower's application to be evaluated without taking CO 2 emissions into account, but each was vetoed by Governor Sebelius. In response to the 2008 vetoes, Sunflower filed several suits now pending in state and federal court. In federal court, in Sunflower Electric Power Corp. v. Sebelius , No. 08-2575 (D. Kan. filed November 17, 2008), Sunflower alleged first that the permit denial violates equal protection because it prohibits CO 2 emissions from the proposed plants when the state has authorized, and continues to authorize, other CO 2 sources in Kansas. Second, Sunflower claims a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause in that the permit denial was allegedly motivated by the fact that much of the electricity to be generated by the proposed plants would be sold out of state. With the arrival of a new governor, however, a deal was struck on May 4, 2009, allowing one 895-megawatt coal-fired power plant to be built.

The article suggests that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) might be one forum for resolution of climate change claims, with jurisdiction established through treaties that specifically provide for dispute resolution before the court. A problem with the ICJ approach is that the treaties most likely to be invoked are Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation or similar treaties, which focus on how each party within its own country treats the other country's nationals and property. A climate change suit, by contrast, likely would have an extraterritorial focus. Another ICJ possibility would be for the court to render an advisory opinion, at the request of a body authorized under the U.N.

Lawmakers of yesteryear encountered this same redistributive conundrum in tackling the problem of acid rain, where pollution cause and effect are separated by hundreds of miles and weeks or months. Imposing liability for harm from exposure to toxic chemicals is of the same ilk: exposure to contamination from multiple sources may result in ill effects manifested only a decade or two later.", "Perhaps because of these hurdles under existing law, and the resistance of the George W. Bush Administration to regulatory approaches to climate change, new directions have been explored. Within the United States, several states have adopted their own GHG emission controls, citing, among other things, inaction at the federal level. Twenty-three states have joined one of the three regional GHG reduction initiatives (Western Climate Initiative, Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, and in the northeastern states, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative). Some states have explored the idea of emissions trading with Europe. At least 40 states and multiple Canadian provinces have partnered to form a Climate Registry to support voluntary and mandatory schemes for reporting GHG emissions in those states and provinces. California and the United Kingdom signed an agreement on July 31, 2006, committing both parties to implement market-based mechanisms, to share results from studies to quantify the economic impacts of climate change, collaborate on research, etc. Also internationally, this report noted the unsuccessful Inuit petition filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the pending petitions before the World Heritage Committee. Reportedly, the low-lying Pacific nation of Tuvalu threatened to sue the United States and Australia years ago in the ICJ, but held off for unspecified reasons.
