Although it is not certain that Iran has made the decision to develop a nuclear weapon, it is taking steps to drastically reduce the time needed to obtain nuclear weapons should a decision be made to do so. It is the prospect of an Iranian nuclear weapon mated to an effective missile delivery capability that is especially worrisome to most.", "Congress has long been interested in these matters. Congress has held numerous hearings on Iran, passed various resolutions regarding Iran and approved a range of sanctions against Iran over the past several decades.", "According to the U.S. government, Iran has the largest number of ballistic missiles in the Middle East; it is developing missiles and space launch vehicles for multiple purposes. Iran is pursuing its missile and space programs with development and testing facilities that are scattered throughout the country. Assessing Iran's ballistic missile programs is challenging for many reasons, including the lack of specificity in official public sources, the secretive nature of Iran's regime and the regime's frequent exaggerations of its ballistic missile capabilities, and the overwhelming amount of and often conflicting information found in non-official sources.", "The vast majority of Iran's heavy artillery rockets and ballistic missiles are short-range of less than about 500 kilometers. Most of Iran's ballistic missiles in fact are Scud-B and Scud-Cs, with a majority likely being Scud Cs, which are 500 km range capable. Iran views its short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) capability as necessary for battlefield and tactical military purposes. These missiles could not strike U.S. or allied bases in the region unless they were moved far from their operating base and launched from vulnerable positions along Iran's Persian Gulf coastline. This is not likely because of logistical and operational security reasons. Although these SRBMs are not very accurate, they could be fired against economic or civilian targets. Also, any such missile attacks against U.S. bases, while not militarily decisive, could disrupt or complicate (but not halt) base operations.", "Iran has grown increasingly self-sufficient in the production of SRBMs, but it still probably relies on others for some key components. Gaining access to these kinds of critical components and materials has grown increasingly difficult for Iran. Stricter international enforcement of export controls and broadening sanctions have reportedly slowed down Iran's efforts and forced Iran to find less reliable alternative sources of rocket and missile technology.", "Iran is developing and producing medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) capabilities with ranges estimated up to about 2,000 kilometers (with some non-U.S. government sources citing slightly higher ranges), sufficient to strike targets throughout the Middle East. U.S. intelligence assessments state such missiles are inherently capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Although the number of Iran's MRBMs is thought to be relatively small by official U.S. estimates, it is expected to continue to build more capable MRBMs. Iran views these missiles as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against U.S. and other forces in the region in the event of war. Iran has also constructed an underground network of bunkers and underground silo-like missile launch facilities, and is seeking improved air defenses presumably to enhance the survivability of their MRBMs against preemptive attack.", "Currently Iran must rely on others for certain key missile components and materials in its MRBM program. Export controls and sanctions have made it increasingly difficult, but certainly not impossible, for Iran to acquire the best of such items. On the other hand, these export control measures and sanctions have forced Iran to try to exploit weaknesses in existing export and nonproliferation regimes, including by trying to find foreign sellers willing to circumvent those laws.", "Iran also has a genuine and ambitious space launch program, which seeks to enhance Iran's national pride, and perhaps more importantly, its international reputation as a growing advanced industrial power. Iran also sees itself as a potential leader in the Middle East offering space launch and satellite services. Iran has stated it plans to use future launchers for placing intelligence gathering satellites into orbit, although such a capability is a decade or so in the future. Many believe Iran's space launch program could mask the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) \u2013 with ranges in excess of 5,500 km that could threaten targets throughout Europe, and even the United States if Iran achieved an ICBM capability of at least 10,000 km. ICBMs share many similar technologies and processes inherent in a space launch program, but it seems clear that Iran has a dedicated space launch effort and it is not simply a cover for ICBM development. Since 1999, the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) has assessed that Iran could test an ICBM by 2015 with sufficient foreign assistance, especially from a country such as China or Russia (whose support has reportedly diminished over the past decade). It is increasingly uncertain whether Iran will be able to achieve an ICBM capability by 2015 for several reasons: Iran does not appear to be receiving the degree of foreign support many believe would be necessary, Iran has found it increasingly difficult to acquire certain critical components and materials because of sanctions, and Iran has not demonstrated the kind of flight test program many view as necessary to produce an ICBM.", "This report will be updated regularly."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Congressional Interest", "paragraphs": ["Why does Iranian acquisition of ballistic missiles or Iran's pursuit of a space launch capability matter, especially to the Congress?

Congress has held numerous hearings on Iran, passed various resolutions regarding Iran and approved a range of sanctions against Iran over the past several decades. Congress has established a broad number of reporting requirements of the Executive Branch that encompass the range of its concerns regarding Iranian WMD and ballistic missile programs. These reporting requirements are detailed in Appendix B , \"Reporting Requirements Relevant to Iranian Ballistic Missile Programs.\" Congress has also supported funding BMD programs aimed at countering ballistic missiles especially those from Iran, including cooperative programs with friendly and allied nations such as Israel. Iran's current and prospective capabilities challenge U.S. national security interests in many ways and are raised briefly below. ", "In response to the Iranian ballistic missile and space program, Congress is considering the deployment of an ballistic missile defense site on the East coast to defend against possible Iranian ICBMs. The House included a provision in the FY2013 defense authorization bill ( H.R. 4310 ) providing $103 million to begin developing a plan and a supporting environmental impact statement to establish by the end of 2015 such a missile defense site on the East Coast to defend against a possible Iranian ICBM attack. That plan would evaluate the effectiveness, from an East Coast site, of various long-range BMD interceptor missiles. The Senate version of the authorization bill does not include such a provision.

Bush labeled Iran as part of the \"Axis of Evil\" along with Iraq and North Korea. More recently, the Obama Administration expressed its view of Iran as \"a major threat to U.S. national security interests, a perception generated not only by Iran's nuclear programs but also by its military assistance to armed groups in Iraq and Afghanistan, to Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups, and to Lebanese Hezbollah.\" To varying degrees these views are shared by many across the political spectrum and around the world. Yet there are considerable differences as to how to respond to Iran.", "U.S. decision makers largely agree that Iran represents a threat to U.S. regional security interests. The 2010 National Security Strategy states that \"for decades, the Islamic Republic of Iran has endangered the security of the region and the United States and failed to live up to its international responsibilities.\" The United States \"has long seen a threat to U.S. interests posed by Iran's support for militant groups\" throughout the Middle East, Iran's support of the Syrian regime against growing popular opposition, and especially Iran's nuclear program, which \"has emerged as a top priority for the Obama Administration.\" Thus, Iran has been subject to a wide range of U.S. and international sanctions.", "When coupled with its nuclear program, Iran's ballistic missile programs are a focus of major concern for a number of countries around the world. While discussing the implications of a February 2, 2009 Iranian satellite launch and addressing growing concerns over the threat posed by Iran, a Pentagon spokesman said such concerns affect Russia, Israel, the Middle East, Europe and beyond: ", "We have long recognized that the threat\u2014that they pose a real threat, and it is a growing threat, and that they are determined to develop long-range ballistic missiles. And I think all of Europe has recognized that to be the case, and that is why they unanimously embraced a third site for missile defense in Europe. And the Russians have recognized it, telling the secretary that they view Iran to be a threat as well. Clearly everybody in the Middle East recognizes it. The Israelis in particular but also the Gulf States are very concerned about Iran's actions in this realm. So this development today is cause for concern, not just here in the United States but in Europe, throughout the Middle East and, I believe, the greater world.", "Similarly, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Aleksandr Losyukov, was quoted by news agencies after a failed Iranian space launch attempt in 2008 saying the test \"adds to general suspicions of Iran regarding its potential desire to build nuclear weapons\" and he noted that long-range missiles \"are one of the components of such weapons. That causes concern.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Iran: A Source of Military Concern", "paragraphs": ["More specifically, Iran's ballistic missiles challenge U.S. military capabilities and U.S. influence in the Middle East.

Its ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering WMD, and, if so armed, would fit into this strategy.\"", "In addition, some observers have argued that because many of Iran's neighbors lack their own deterrent capabilities or effective ballistic missile defenses Iran could \"blackmail such states into meeting demands, for example, to raise oil prices, cut oil production or even withhold cooperation with the U.S. on which their very survival depends.\" In the event of a conflict, one expert wrote, \"U.S. military action would be to forestall Iranian interference with Gulf oil exports, this would have to be near total in its effect on Iranian capabilities. This would be difficult if not impossible to achieve, leading to a fear of attack which alone would have a formidable impact on oil prices.\" Iran thus is viewed as a challenge to U.S. national security interests in the region, even with superior U.S. conventional military power. A major trend in U.S. military sales to the Persian Gulf states today is for anti-missile systems intended precisely to address this threat.", "Congress has long been concerned over the proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems, especially ballistic missiles. Over the past few decades, Iran has progressed from relying entirely on the outright purchase of ballistic missile systems to becoming nearly self-sufficient in important ways. Many now see Iran as a potential supplier to other nations or actors. This point is elaborated upon elsewhere in this report. Finally, some Members are concerned that an Iran armed with a nuclear ballistic missile, by the nature of the regime itself and the prospect of even wider proliferation that may follow, will result in a deterrence dynamic that is less stable and less reliable compared to the one that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.", "Finally, Iran's ballistic missile and space launch programs are major drivers of the U.S. BMD program. In addition to an extensive number of short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) and a smaller number of medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) in Iran, the United States remains concerned about the possibility of an intercontinental range ballistic missile (ICBM) program in Iran. Since 1999, the IC has assessed that Iran could test an ICBM capable of striking parts of the United States by 2015 with sufficient foreign assistance. Interestingly, however, LTG Burgess, Director, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) testified in 2010 that DIA \"assesses that, with sufficient foreign assistance, Iran could develop and test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the United States,\" but he did not include any particular date by which this might be accomplished. More recently, however, the 2012 DOD Annual Report on Military Power of Iran stated \"Iran may be technically capable of flight-testing an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015.\" The report added that \"beyond steady growth in its missile and rocket inventories, Iran has boosted the lethality and effectiveness of existing systems by improving accuracy and developing new submunition payloads,\" repeating what the same report said in 2010.", "Potential Iranian missile threats to U.S. allies and friends in Europe and to the United States itself in the future are the basis for the Pentagon's plan to deploy increasingly capable phases of BMD, called the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA), over the next decade in Europe and perhaps in the Persian Gulf as well. At the May 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago, the Alliance declared an interim territorial missile defense capability based on U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) assets placed under NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) command and control to guard against possible missile attacks from Iran and other potential adversaries. The EPAA, which seeks to develop and deploy increasingly capable BMD over four phases through 2020, would serve as the cornerstone of this new NATO capability. Phase 1 of the U.S. EPAA was completed in December 2011 as scheduled. Phase 2 is expected to be completed by 2015, although Defense Secretary Panetta has stated that the future of the EPAA could be called into question by the application of automatic defense spending limitations under the Budget Control Act of 2012. The U.S. EPAA will be integrated with other BMD systems already being developed, augmented and deployed by NATO individual member states under NATO command and control architecture.", "Further, some analysts, including the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission on the evolving missile threat to the United States and its allies, suggest that countries could threaten U.S. territory by pursuing unconventional deployment modes. Among these, it is argued, is to deploy shorter range missiles on surface ships. These analysts argue that such ships could be brought close to coastal areas of the United States, thus giving the shorter range missiles the ability to strike targets in the United States. Others discount the ease with which this could be accomplished."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Context", "paragraphs": ["This report is limited to analyzing Iran's efforts to develop, test and field ballistic missiles and to develop a space launch capability.

Assessing Iran's progress and capabilities in this area are challenging given the general difficulty in evaluating ballistic missile capabilities and projections in general, especially from the vagueness of official assessments and the numerous, but specific and conflicting analyses by experts and others in the public domain. Although Iran is transparent in many ways, it remains secretive and attempts to obfuscate intent and capabilities in others.

Indeed, many U.S. friends and allies have such missiles and pursue missile modernization programs.

Such concerns are amplified considerably when that state might develop a weapon of mass destruction (WMD), particularly a nuclear weapon that could be carried by that ballistic missile force. In Iran's case, no major intelligence community has concluded that Iran has made the decision to develop a nuclear weapon. But Iran has taken steps in its civilian nuclear program that raise serious questions about future intent to develop or break out of its nonproliferation commitments and obtain nuclear weapons on short notice.", "An effective nuclear weapons capability has three major elements, each of which presents its own unique technical and other challenges. Additionally, each of these elements must work together as part of an operational system. All this is required to make the case that a specific ballistic missile threat is grave and imminent.", "First is the production of fissile or nuclear material in sufficient quantity and quality as the source of a nuclear device. The second element concerns the design, weaponization, miniaturization, and survivability of the warhead and its physics package capable of being delivered to its intended target, especially at long-range. The third element is providing an effective means for delivery, such as a ballistic missile or, as some believe, a capability that could grow out of a space launch program. ", "This report focuses solely on Iran's ballistic missile and space programs. It is important to note that this report does not assess Iran's capabilities in the other two critical areas. Without a reliable, survivable nuclear warhead the proliferation of Iranian ballistic missiles is arguably not an imminent significant threat.", "Finally, there are literally many thousands of articles, news accounts and other sources regarding Iran's ballistic missile and space programs. It is not possible to sort through the tremendously varied and often different accounts of events or capabilities. This report does not rely on those items or try to adjudicate any differences in them. As much as possible, this report instead emphasizes U.S. Government and other official sources. It is noted, however, that official sources are frustrating to rely on as they frequently do not provide much specificity. On the other hand, some of the best non-government open sources provide much more specificity yet those same sources can vary considerably from one to another on the very same elements of Iran's ballistic missile and space launch programs. There are, however, perhaps a dozen or so excellent analysts who write and publish on Iran's programs, but who may differ on their various facets. This report attempts to make clear where some of those key differences exist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Technological Challenge of Ballistic Missiles", "paragraphs": ["This section very briefly touches on some of the challenges inherent in rocket science and missile engineering regarding the development, testing and production of ballistic missiles. ", "As enormously capable as the United States is regarding the development and acquisition of ballistic missiles, it too experiences challenges and even failures on occasion. For instance, several years ago when the Pentagon sought to develop the first variant of the Ground-based Interceptor for long-range BMD, it experienced significant technical problems in developing a new solid rocket motor. Eventually, the Pentagon chose to go forward with an interceptor based on existing launch vehicles (Minotaur and Pegasus). Other modern states with advanced missile and space launch programs will also run into problems while developing new missile systems despite their long-standing expertise and an extensive industrial base that is unencumbered with external trade constraints, such as sanctions or export controls. In contrast, Iran's expertise and industrial base is significantly challenged in this regard on a number of fronts and cannot be viewed as comparable to that of the United States or of the other major nuclear powers. Nevertheless, Iran has demonstrated persistence over decades in continuing to develop and improve its indigenous capabilities in spite of widespread international opposition and cooperation against Iran's ballistic missile programs. A significant advantage that Iran has had is that the basic technology of rocket science is established and reasonably well known around the world.", "Another comparative marker is to contrast the number of missile flight tests between modern missile countries such as the United States and Russia on one hand and Iran on the other. By the end of their development efforts, the United States had conducted perhaps a couple dozen or more flight tests of the Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile and somewhat less than that number for the MX ICBM. The Soviet Union/Russian flight test record for their ICBMs (SS-24, SS-25, and SS-26) was comparable. Moreover these flight tests took advantage of decades of flight testing of older systems dating to the 1950s. This record entailed scores of space launch flight tests and over a hundred each of the earliest ICBMs (Atlas and Minuteman I) prior to their deployments. In contrast, Iran has conducted very few flight tests of its modern missiles. This has major implications for how much confidence Iranian decision makers and military leaders would have in the reliability and expected performance of their ballistic missile force to achieve its intended missions. ", "Iran may also have difficulties in developing rocket motors for various reasons some of which might include the effect of sanctions and export control regimes. The U.S. IC has touched on this on many occasions. Although many principles of rocket science are much better known and more widely shared today, missile engineering remains a challenging skill acquired only through direct experience\u2014it cannot simply be studied and applied without much trial and error. For instance, there is tremendous complexity in finding the right formulation of solid propellants for a specific missile system. Although the underlying rocket science has been reasonably well understood and publicly available for decades the predictability of how a solid rocket motor will perform depends on very subtle factors. This means that even after a propellant is formulated, the manufacturing of solid rocket motors still requires extreme reliability controls.", "Additional factors necessary for developing an effective ballistic missile include a guidance system that directs the missile and its payload to its intended target. This requires testing of missiles and their reentry vehicles, which produces data from which mathematical models can be developed, further tested and fine-tuned. From the time a ballistic missile lies dormant in its silo or launch vehicle to its actual launch, various errors can begin to accumulate. A systematic and rigorous testing regimen of all the component parts can help reduce as much as possible such structural or inherent errors even in proven systems, but such errors cannot be eliminated entirely. Operational tests of the system are generally necessary to know whether the entire system will work as intended, and the degree to which further testing may be required to ensure such missiles will launch successfully and operate as planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Management and Organization", "paragraphs": ["Many experts would argue that strong management and organization are considered critical to a good ballistic missile program. Iran is generally assessed to have such an organizational and managerial program, although it too cannot be compared to similar programs in the major nuclear weapons states\u2014the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France. Michael Elleman, for instance, among others, has said \"Iran's record in the area of overall systems management and engineering involving a range of technologies and industries is impressive.\" He has further said ", "their approach to missile development and modification is disciplined and well structured. This is unique in the proliferation world. They are not up to Western standards, but they are far more sophisticated than the DPRK, Iraq or even Pakistan. This capability empowers Iran to develop and produce whatever missile range it decides the country needs. It may take a decade or more, and they will still rely on foreign sources for some key items, but there appears to be little the West can do to stop (as opposed to impede) progress.", "Aaron Karp, one of the first experts to write about this, said ", "There is much more to any major R&D project than just assembling metal and plastic. Easily overlooked are the necessary skills, experience and judgment required of engineers and programme managers. Also, behind every missile programme are conceptual, organizational, financial, and command and control factors, each imposing its own problems for ballistic missile development.", "Karp also said that, although countries may receive considerable amounts of foreign assistance in their missile programs, \"would-be rocket makers are almost entirely on their own\" in the area of program management: \"foreign companies and governments can offer advice and their own example, but little else.\"", "For instance, both appropriate organization and managerial choices have proven critical to successful ballistic missile programs when governments are choosing their development strategies. An incremental development strategy, which Iran appears to have pursued, in which a missile program moves in sequence through progressively larger designs, improving the performance of major components, and gradually introducing new ones is the most effective according to Karp. He cites the experience of the French as the best example of this. By contrast, states that have begun their missile programs by taking huge leaps tend to face greater difficulties. For instance, the UK began by developing an IRBM using this approach and that program eventually collapsed. Similarly, India began its space launch program in the early 1970s enduring many false starts and serious delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missile Proliferation: Challenges with Estimates and Projections", "paragraphs": ["Assessing ballistic missile proliferation capabilities in general has proven to be challenging. Further, projecting those capabilities over some near- or long-term future has proven unreliable. As a result, efforts to time responsive measures precisely according to program advancements in select countries are likely to fail by projecting such advancements coming later or earlier than will turn out to be the case. In the first instance, the United States was surprised by the advancement of the Soviet Union's space rocket capability, and by implication its ballistic missile program, with the launch of the Sputnik satellite. At the other end of the spectrum, in 1990 the U.S. IC projection for MRBMs and ICBMs by 2000 did not transpire: ", "Most missiles likely to be fielded in the Third World over the next 5 years will have ranges of less than 1,000 kilometers, but by the year 2000 at least six countries probably will have missiles with range of up to 3,000 kilometers. At least three of them may develop missiles with ranges of up to 5,500 kilometers.", "Instead, intelligence assessments in 2000 showed that no country in the developing world had acquired such capabilities. And the 1990 forecast has not been borne out through today.", "For a variety of reasons, projections of ballistic missile trends in countries over time may not materialize as expected, instead slowing significantly, apparently halting, or even reversing from earlier assessments. In some cases, missile proliferation estimates might show significant projected increases from year to year only later to show that same effort apparently halting entirely.", "In particular, few countries have successfully developed and deployed operational, nuclear-armed ICBMs. The developmental record of those who were successful indicates how challenging that effort was. The fact that more nations have not achieved this capability is perhaps witness in part to the extraordinary technical effort it took. The long history of acquiring ICBM capability among the five nuclear-armed ICBM states (U.S., Russia, China, UK and France) demonstrates that such success required considerable resources in time, funding, knowledge, infrastructure, organization and national commitment. After 50 years of commitment and experience, these nations still experience developmental or even operational failures in their missile or space launch programs on occasion. Although there are frequent charges of the ease in which a country might develop an intercontinental ballistic missile from a space launch program, this has not in fact occurred under missile programs by emerging missile and rocket powers, despite the fact that so many of the technologies are comparable. Perhaps the closest example is that of India, which may have used a few elements of its more than 30-year old space program to develop and test an ICBM-range missile for the first time in April 2012.", "Some argue, however, that the small number of ICBM programs to date may result from the small number of countries who perceive the need for ICBMs rather than it being so difficult. Five countries make ICBMs, but nine countries have made successful SLVs, which are close to ICBMs. Additionally, it is argued, that countries such as the United States, the Soviet Union and France took considerable time and money to build their ICBMs is not necessarily an indication for other ICBM contenders. The superpowers and France adhere to high quality and reliability standards, which may or may not be present in Iran. Iran also may be satisfied with an ICBM capability of lesser quality and reliability, it is argued.", "Contributing further to understanding missile proliferation in Iran is the difference in names often given to various Iranian missiles by Iran, the United States, U.S. friends and allies, and other good open sources, even when it appears specific missile capabilities seem to suggest the same missile is being described. This report does not attempt to reconcile those differences, but rather retains the missile designations in the sources cited.

Iran regularly televises and talks about its operational missile exercises, publicly showcases many of its ballistic missile and space launch tests, and even holds televised interviews with Iranian officials and leaders in some of its missile and nuclear plants. By comparison, some countries considered allies or friends of the United States do not demonstrate this much openness themselves. In the absence of a diplomatic relationship or any kind of verifiable arms control regime between the countries, a few observers have suggested that Iran may be signaling a certain level of transparency to the United States and others regarding its ballistic missile and space launch programs.", "Iran readily acknowledges that U.S. and other countries \"possess satellite systems, especially the countries which control the space above Iran, [who] can see our missiles quite clearly.

This licensed production arrangement, they argue, may continue today. Some of those systems in turn may then have made their way into Iran; these authors, like many others, believe many of Iran's ballistic missiles are of North Korean origin or manufacture.

How Iran actually acquired such technology is further debated, but DPRK-Iranian collaboration on reverse engineering is often suggested, with varying levels of assistance from Chinese entities as well. Michael Elleman for instance, argues there is no evidence to suggest that Iran itself succeeded in procuring a licensed production line for liquid-fueled engines. Instead, Elleman has said it is possible but uncertain that Iran received Russian assistance in attempting to reverse-engineer and manufacture the North Korean No Dong engine, which is widely believed to be an adaptation of the Soviet-era Scud missile.

Instead, China has adopted its own export controls modeled after those of the MTCR and works with the United States to help stop some proliferation activities within China.

From 2004-2007, Chinese arms transfer agreements with Iran totaled about $300 million (current U.S. dollars); from 2008-2011 total arms transfer agreements dropped to less than $50 million (current U.S. dollars).", "The U.S. Intelligence Community expressed concern in the early 1990s over China selling other unnamed countries longer range missiles and the technology to produce them, especially those technologies that might grow out of China's preexisting military cooperation with countries such as Russia and Ukraine. The IC pointed out that although China had agreed to observe MTCR guidelines when the United States lifted sanctions, unless sales of such missiles were actually stopped, it was likely these delivery systems would be mated with WMD capabilities, especially in the Middle East. During this period it was also clearly a source of concern that China might be cooperating on missile programs with North Korea who might in turn assist Iran in its ballistic missile programs.", "Russian intelligence to this point in 1993, however, assessed that Iran's missile programs were restricted to Syrian and DPRK Scud purchases. According to Russia, available data confirmed there were \"bottlenecks\" throughout the whole of Iran's missile program, primarily a shortage of skilled personnel, science-intensive technology, scarce starting materials, and, possibly, the requisite amounts of financing.", "In 1996, the Intelligence Community began to testify openly that China was among several countries and private consortiums that were willing to sell missile systems and technologies to developing countries around the world. Although Iran was not named specifically in the annual threat assessment, the IC reported to Congress a more specific role between China and Iran in the 721 Report that year, stating \"China and Russia have been primary sources for missile-related goods\" to Iran.\" Iran's efforts to acquire foreign missile technology was characterized as \"unrelenting,\" and the Chinese were described as having provided a tremendous variety of assistance to both Iran's and Pakistan's ballistic missile programs. This charge was stronger the following year when the IC reported that Iran was using these goods and technologies (from several countries including China) \"to achieve its goal of becoming self-sufficient in the production of MRBMs. The foreign equipment obtained in 1997 will be essential for achieving that goal.\" It was not clear how key China's participation was compared to the other countries named: Russian and the DPRK.", "By 1998, the IC testified that PRC defense industries were under increasing pressure to become profit making organizations \u2013 an imperative that put them at odds with U.S. interests. The IC added that conventional arms sales had lagged in recent years, encouraging Chinese defense industries to look to WMD technology, primarily to Pakistan and Iran, in order to recoup any losses. Further, there was no question that China contributed to WMD advances in these countries. Moreover, although China had passed comprehensive laws governing nuclear technology exports, China's relations with some proliferant countries were long-standing and deep. The 721 Report added little more, other than that Chinese entities provided a variety of missile related items and assistance to several countries of proliferation concern, implying, but not naming, Iran. ", "Since 1999 through today, in its annual worldwide threat assessments and through the 721 reports to Congress, the IC regularly discussed concern over ongoing Chinese or Chinese entity involvement with Iranian and other country missile programs, despite some level of PRC government commitment to restricting such exports. From these assessments, China's role has apparently not changed significantly one way or the other. ", "In part, China has disagreed with the United States and others with interpretation of some of its MTCR commitments to restrict missile-related exports. The PRC might therefore argue that the types of exports its companies are selling to countries such as Iran are legitimate. The U.S. position has been otherwise. But there might also be another explanation: lax PRC enforcement of its commitments and its laws. In 2011, the IC reported that", "Chinese entities \u2013 including private and state-owned firms \u2013 continue to engage in WMD-related proliferation activities. The United States in recent years has imposed sanctions on several Chinese companies for sales of WMD- and ballistic missile-related technologies to states of concern. Although China has export control legislation that approximates MTCR controls, enforcement continues to fall short. Chinese entities continue to supply a variety of missile-related items to multiple customers, including Iran, Syria, and Pakistan.", "Missile proliferation or problematic missile-related exports from China was not mentioned in the most recent IC annual threat assessment (2012)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Net Effects on Iranian Programs", "paragraphs": ["Iran has become self-sufficient in many aspects of its ballistic missile and space launch programs. But as noted in the above section, the U.S. IC has said on several occasions that Iran almost certainly remains dependent on foreign suppliers for some key missile components. The United States has not identified what these components are. According to an unreleased report by a Panel of Experts at the UN, however, a number of specific items that Iran continues to procure from foreign sources indicate a lack of indigenous capability. Iran continues to seek navigation guidance units, including gyroscopes and accelerometers, testing and satellite navigation equipment, control systems, tracking telemetry equipment, transmitters, receivers, on-board sensors and transducers. In addition to these missile components, Iran lacks access to some high quality production materials to improve the effectiveness and precision of their missiles. These dual-use materials include carbon-carbon materials, structural materials, polymeric substances, ammonium percholorate and aluminum powder.", "Perhaps the most consequential contribution has been from China, mostly in the provision of solid-propellant production facilities and equipment and likely training. What China has provided and the accumulated knowledge gained by Iran in operating these facilities has likely enabled Tehran to build whatever size and range solid fuel missile they want, although this will require time and money. ", "Today Iran is viewed increasingly as a rising proliferator. Perhaps the irony of a restrictive nonproliferation regime is that Iran became largely self-sufficient. This likely took longer than Iran had wanted, but with a considerable indigenous capability Iran may now be positioned to export some of its own ballistic missile systems, components or knowledge to others. It has been noted that Syria continued work on establishing a solid-propellant rocket motor development and production capability with help from outside countries such as Iran. But civil war in Syria raises doubts as to whether this will result in anything of consequence."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges Today", "paragraphs": ["Iran has demonstrated its willingness over decades to pursue the development, testing, acquisition and deployment of ballistic missiles as an essential part of its regional war fighting, deterrent and retaliatory capability. A determined adversary such as Iran has not shown that it is deterred or dissuaded by U.S. conventional military superiority, or by U.S. and international sanctions, or by the deployment of U.S. BMD capabilities.", "Iran has similarly demonstrated resolve and commitment to a genuine space launch program as a matter of national pride and self-sufficiency in space in the face of widespread international condemnation. Just as every other space faring nation, however, Iran too will use space for a range of military purposes, such as for reconnaissance and communications.", "Is slowing down Iran's ballistic missile and space launch programs, making them more difficult and expensive, and forcing Iran to find less reliable and capable alternatives an adequate solution for dealing with Iran? On this point there are significant disagreements and no consensus on how to proceed. At the same time, is it realistic to believe that ending Iranian interest in acquiring ballistic missiles or pursuing a space launch capability is even possible? Some point out that other countries have given up their missile programs entirely, or forsworn ballistic missiles while developing an effective space launch program alone. But would Iran change its pattern of behavior short of a change in regime? Most are skeptical.", "So this seemingly leaves the United States and its allies, many might reluctantly agree, with few better choices than the current apparent path. On the other hand, there are perhaps early indicators that Congress' attitudes regarding the reliability of the \"assured destruction\" deterrence policy of the Cold War era may be changing under the circumstance of both nuclear and missile delivery system proliferation. Among the pieces of evidence suggesting this change in attitude is Declaration 2 in the Resolution of Ratification accompanying New START. Such a change in attitude might imply that defensive options will no longer be seen as 'destabilizing', as was the dominant view during the Cold War. Although the behavior of rogue states such as Iran may be catalyzing this change in attitude, the language of Declaration 2 also carries the strong implication that in the future Congress will gauge the missile threat more broadly than just focusing on the activities and progress of ballistic missile and nuclear programs in such rogue states. This is because Declaration 2 challenges even a mature missile power such as Russia to adopt a more defensive strategic posture in order to provide a political and policy basis for devaluing offensive missile and nuclear weapon programs in a broader grouping of threatening and potentially threatening states. In this case, the focus on assessing the progress of ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs of rogue states might become less intense in Congress because responsive U.S. policies will become more broadly based. In short, specific actions by Iran may become a less powerful driver of U.S. strategic deterrence policy than is the case today. For the time being, however, Congress will likely continue to take a focused interest in Iran's role in the region and in its missile programs. Beyond efforts to impose increasingly stringent sanctions, it is unclear whether there is more Congress itself can do to affect Iran's commitment to its ballistic missile and space launch programs. But continuing to work with the Administration through cooperation and oversight, to stay prepared to take additional action as needed is a process many decision makers appear prepared to be committed to.", "Appendix A. The \"Great Prophet\" Exercises (2006-2012)", "Since 2006, Iran has conducted various military exercises that included some number of ballistic missile tests. These are called \"Great Prophet\" exercises by Iran and sometimes \"Noble Prophet\" or \"Holy Prophet\" by others. Iran tests missiles at other times as well, but these particular missile tests are held in conjunction with other conventional land, sea, and air military exercises. From open sources it is neither possible to identify with precision the number and type of all missiles launched during these exercises, nor to identify all other test launches by Iran at other times.", "Nevertheless, these ballistic missile exercises provide considerable information to U.S. and other intelligence communities that assess Iran's ballistic missile programs. Additionally, these exercises serve several purposes for Iran, including testing and evaluating weapon system performance, providing operational training and evaluation of military personnel, broadcasting Iran's capabilities to the United States and others throughout the Middle East, and showcasing military prowess to Iran's own populace. Many of these missile launches are shown in photos and video on Iranian television and other media and can be found on such places as YouTube. There does not appear to be any single source that tracks or details the missile launch components of all these exercises. Therefore this appendix is added to this report. This appendix will be updated for future \"Great Prophet\" exercises. ", "Great Prophet 1 (March-April 2006)", "Iran conducted military exercises in the Straits of Hormuz from March 31 to April 6, 2006. Most reports at the time were vague or conflicting about precisely what missile launches were involved. Various Iranian media reported launches of a medium-range radar-evading anti-ship missile, a different multi-warhead missile and a very fast torpedo. Most media reports at the time, however, reported these simply as missile launches. Various observers outside Iran greeted Iranian technical claims with some skepticism or believed that these were not Iranian weapons, but more likely Russian and Chinese in origin. A Pentagon spokesman responded to the launches saying while it is \"possible they are increasing their capability.... Iranians have also been known to boast and exaggerate their statements about greater technical and tactical capabilities.\" In one account, Iran reportedly claimed to have launched an improved \"intermediate-range ballistic missile likely a Shahab-3 missile,\" but in another report a Pentagon official said Iran tested a Shahab-2 SRBM.", "Great Prophet 2 (November 2006)", "Iran conducted military exercises throughout the country November 2-9, 2006. According to Iranian military leaders, \"the first and main goal of this exercise is to demonstrate power and national determination to defend the country against any possible threat.\" Iran military officials added that other objectives included enhancing and testing the IRGC's deterrence capability and effectiveness; testing sophisticated and advanced weapons, conducting operational tactics involving distances of more than 1,400 kilometers; and, finally, coordinating land, naval, and air operations and logistics forces covering an area of 1,730 kilometers. The Commander of the IRGC added that Iran was ready to share its missile systems with political allies and neighboring countries.", "Iran claimed to have test-fired \"dozens of Shahab-2 and -3, Zolfaghar-73 [unknown what this referred to], Scud B, Fateh-110 and Zelzal\" missiles in a central area of Iran. It was the first time Iran claimed to have launched an enhanced range Shahab-3 MRBM during military maneuvers and said that it was fired with cluster warheads; it was also reported to have an extended range of about 1,900 kilometers. Iran further claimed to have launched three new types of tactical naval warfare missiles named Noor, Kowsar and Nasr, \"suitable for covering all the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman.\" Vice Admiral Walsh, commander of U.S. naval forces in the region, expressed \"particular concern over the threat the missiles pose to vessels traveling through the Sea of Oman and the Strait of Hormuz.\" ", "Great Prophet 3 (July 2008)", "Iran conducted a series of missile tests during military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz and in the desert from July 8-10, 2008. The missiles were launched from the Semnan Missile Test Range with warheads impacting within Iran or its coastal waters. Although there was some confusion over what precisely occurred, U.S. officials and others determined that no new capabilities were demonstrated.", "Iran reportedly launched some number of Shahab-1 and Shahab-2 SRBMs, a Shahab-3 MRBM, and Fateh, Zelzal, Nazeat, Fajr-3 and Oghab tactical missiles, but there is uncertainty over exactly how many. Iran and most early media accounts said nine missiles of varying ranges were launched. But another report said that U.S. tracking systems detected only seven missile launches. Television footage showed at least six missiles firing simultaneously, including the Shahab-3. The following day, U.S. officials reported that one of the missiles had apparently failed the day before and that although Iran reported a second round of missile launches it appeared there was only one missile launched and it was unclear whether it was the one that had failed the day before. Adding to the confusion were various reports concluding Iran had doctored or \"photo-shopped\" one of the photographs to make it appear that one of the missiles fired simultaneously with the others had launched successfully, instead of actually failing. And a U.S. intelligence official was quoted as saying \"while I cannot comment one way or another on these particular photos, it would be wrong to assume that the U.S. intelligence community accepts at face value what the Iranians disclose about their missile tests.\" The State Department responded to the debate over how many launches actually occurred by noting that it did not matter precisely how many, but rather that Iran was testing increasingly longer and more capable missiles in the region.", "Great Prophet 4 (September 2009)", "Iran conducted military and missile exercises from September 27 - 28, 2009 in which it reportedly launched the Shahab-3 MRBM and the new solid-fueled Sejil-2 MRBM. An Iranian military official, Abdullah Araqi, was quoted as saying \"Iranian missiles are able to target any place that threatens Iran.\" Another source said the \"optimized Shahab-3\" missile has a range of 1,300 \u2013 2,000 kilometers and that the Sejil was launched for the first time in military maneuvers from the central province of Semnan where Iran's space program is located. The IRGC's Air Force Commander said the main aim of the exercise was to evaluate the \"technical developments recently achieved in surface-to-surface missiles ... including simultaneous ... and successive\" missile launches. Also reported were launches specifically of Shahab-1 and 2 SRBMs, and Fateh, Tondar, Zelzal, and various other tactical ballistic missiles. Iran claimed to have also tested a \"multiple missile launcher for the first time.\"", "Great Prophet 5 (April 2010)", "Iran conducted war games on April 22 \u2013 25, 2010, reportedly firing five tactical sea-to-sea and shore-to-sea missiles at a single target simultaneously from different locations.

At least one Qiam SRBM, or an upgraded Shahab-3 or Ghadr (or Kadr), or a Sejil MRBM was reportedly launched, depending on which source is cited. Reports said some missiles were aimed at targets at sea and perhaps as many as nine of the missiles were fired simultaneously. The Department of Defense subsequently confirmed that this exercise included a multiple missile salvo of some unspecified number.", "Iran also unveiled the existence of a network of underground missile silos for the first time, which IRGC spokesman Asghar Qelich-Khani said were \"part of the swift reaction unit of [Iran's] missile brigade; missiles are stored vertically.\" The New York Times added that Iranian officials showed an underground launching pad or silo for what they called the Shahab-3 MRBM. The televised reports also showed a large metal roof opening atop the silo to allow the firing of the missile. Iran claimed the silos were built indigenously, but Israel was reported as saying the silos were built with DPRK assistance. One account of a tour of the silo complex also showed reported footage of a missile launch from a silo, which at least one analyst said looked like the launch of a DPRK missile from its silo. Although Iran kept the location of the silos a secret, others, such as Jane's Defence Weekly , said Iran's hidden silos were near Tabriz and Khorramabad.", "IRGC deputy commander BG Hossein Salami further added \"our missiles have aggressive, tactical, strategically deterrent and defensive features, of course we will not initiate any operation but our responses will be purely aggressive.\" The Washington Post reported a Shahab-3 was fired at targets at sea and added that Iranian television quoted Iranian military officials saying that Iran \"began building a network of such silos across the nation 15 years ago.\" ", "Great Prophet 7 (July 2012)", "Iran held military exercises and missile launches July 1-3, 2012. Iran reported that it fired from different locations tens of Shahab-1 and Shahab-2 SRBMs, Shahab-3 MRBMs and Fateh, Qiam, Persian Gulf, and Zelzal tactical ballistic missiles simultaneously at a mock air base in Iran's Lut desert in southeastern Iran. IRGC Aerospace Force Commander BG Amir Ali Hajizadeh said \"these maneuvers send a message to the adventurous nations that the IRGC is standing up to bullies alongside the determined and unified Iranian nation, and will decisively respond to any trouble they cause.\" Iran's FARS news agency further said these exercises \"underline Tehran's threat to strike U.S. military bases in the neighboring countries\u2014in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\u2014if it comes under attack by Israel or the United States.\"", "The Associated Press (AP) reported from Iranian sources that the missile tests demonstrated improved accuracy where 90% of the missiles hit their targets. Additionally, AP reported that Iran said it fired a considerable number of missiles against a single target (mock air base) making it \"impossible for anti-missile systems to intercept and destroy them.\" Iran warned that 35 U.S. military bases in the Middle East are within Iran's missile range and would \"be destroyed within seconds after any attack on Iran.\" Another source said Iran claimed it had launched a missile capable of reaching targets 2,000 km away, but only fired to a range of 1,300 km. and repeated many of the things said here of July 2012 test launches.", "There was no reported official U.S. response as to the accuracy of the claims made by Iran about their Great Prophet 7 exercises.", "Appendix B.
