GPOI was established in mid-2004 as a five-year program with intended annual funding to total $660 million from FY2005 through FY2009. (Actual funds allocated to the GPOI program from FY2005 through FY2009 totaled, as of April 2009, some $480.4 million.) The centerpiece of the Bush Administration's efforts to prepare foreign security forces to participate in international peacekeeping operations, GPOI's primary purpose has been to train and equip 75,000 military troops, a majority of them African, for peacekeeping operations by 2010. In October 2008, the National Security Council's Deputies Committee approved a five-year renewal of GPOI's mandate. Congressional approval of the FY2010 budget request would provide funding for the first year of this extension.", "To date, GPOI also provides support for the Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU), an Italian \"train-the-trainer\" training center for gendarme (constabulary police) forces in Vicenza, Italy. In addition, GPOI promotes the development of an international transportation and logistics support system for peacekeepers, and encourages information exchanges to improve international coordination of peace operations training and exercises. Through GPOI, the United States supports and participates in a G* Africa Clearinghouse and a G8++ Global Clearinghouse, both to coordinate international peacekeeping capacity building efforts.", "GPOI incorporates previous capabilities-building programs for Africa. From FY1997 to FY2005, the United States spent just over $121 million on GPOI's predecessor program that was funded through the State Department Peacekeeping (PKO) account: the Clinton Administration's African Crisis Response Initiative (ACRI) and its successor, the Bush Administration's African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program. (ACOTA is now GPOI's principal training program in Africa.) Some 16,000 troops from ten African nations were trained under the early ACRI/ACOTA programs. Some $33 million was provided from FY1998 to FY2005 to support classroom training of 31 foreign militaries through the Foreign Military Financing account's Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capabilities program (EIPC).", "Within a year after GPOI was initiated in late 2004, the Administration began expanding its geographical scope to selected countries in Central America, Europe, and Asia. In 2006 and 2007, the program was further expanded to countries in Asia, South Asia, and the Pacific. GPOI now includes 53 \"partner\" countries and two partner organizations throughout the world, although the emphasis is still on Africa.

Through FY2010 funds, the United States will continue to provide lift and sustainment to peacekeeping troops worldwide, and to support the evaluation of GPOI, including measures of effectiveness. As in previous years, funding for GPOI is requested under the State Department Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action in the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 (Section 1108, H.R. 2410)", "paragraphs": ["In its first action on GPOI during the 111 th Congress, the House passed legislation which would authorize the Secretary of State to carry out and to expand GPOI programs and activities. Section 1108 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2010 and 2011 ( H.R. 2410 ), as passed by the House on June 10, 2009, specifies eight GPOI functions, including five that GPOI has carried out since its inception and three new functions. ", "In support of this proposed authorization, Section 1108 finds that the United States has \"a vital interest in ensuring\" that U.N. peacekeeping operations are successful because countries in conflict threaten U.S. national security and economic interests, and because conflicts result in deplorable human suffering. Section 1108 also finds that the United States benefits from U.N. peacekeeping because, in general, the costs of U.N. operations are lower than the potential cost of a similar U.S. peacekeeping operation. ", "Of the three new functions that Section 1108 would authorize, two reaffirm the State Department's concept of GPOI's future direction. These functions are (1) \"enhancing the capacity of regional and sub-regional organizations to plan, train for, manage, conduct, sustain and obtain lessons-learned from\" peace operations; and (2) helping partner nations become self-sufficient in developing and sustaining peacekeeping capabilities, as well as in furnishing troops and equipment for and carrying out peace operations (see Section 1108(c)(1)). ", "The third new GPOI function that Section 1108, as passed by the House, would authorize is financing the refurbishment of helicopters for use in U.N. peacekeeping operations or U.N. Security Council-authorized regional peacekeeping operations. A Sense of Congress statement (Section 1108(c)(2)) would direct the Secretary of State to prioritize helicopter refurbishment, to set a goal of refurbishing no fewer than three helicopters by the end of FY2011, and to seek additional refurbishment funds from other countries. ", "In the report accompanying H.R. 2410 ( H.Rept. 111-136 ), the House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) states that the addition of helicopter refurbishment to GPOI's functions is intended to respond to current critical shortfalls in air assets in ongoing peacekeeping operations in Darfur, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Chad, as well as to potential new operations \"which would likely face similar shortfalls ... \" (p. 167) The bill finds that a shortfall of over 50 helicopters critically hampers those three peacekeeping operations. ", "H.R. 2410 , as reported by the committee and passed by the House, does not authorize a specific funding amount for GPOI programs and activities, including helicopter refurbishment. Instead, Section 1108 would authorize the appropriation of the funds necessary in FY2010 and FY2011 to carry out that section. In H.Rept. 111-136 , HFAC encourages appropriators \"to allot such funds as may be necessary above the President's request\" of $96.8 million in order to refurbish helicopters. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the cost of refurbishing one medium-lift utility helicopter is about $2 million, and that the total cost of implementing GPOI programs and activities over the FY2010-FY2014 period, including the refurbishment of three helicopters by the end of 2011, would be about $195 billion. ( H.Rept. 111-136 , p. 103)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Issues for the 111th Congress", "paragraphs": ["Over the past few years, the State Department responded to concerns of the 109 th and the 110 th Congresses to strengthen GPOI. Its steps included producing a strategic plan (the executive summary of which is publically available), facilitating procedures to speed planning and implementation, and implementing an evaluation program. As of 2008, Congress requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigate a number of remaining issues: the GAO expressed several concerns about GPOI performance and management in a June 2008 report. ", "Among the points the Congress requested the GAO to address were (1) the extent to which contributing and participating countries maintain records and databases; (2) the quality and sustainability of the training of individuals and units; (3) the extent to which those trained are equipped and remain equipped to deploy in peace operations; (4) participating countries capacity to mobilize those trained; (5) the extent to which trained individuals are deployed; and (6) the extent to which contractors are used and the quality of their results. The committee also requested an assessment of whether GPOI is achieving its goals and recommendations as to whether a country's participation in GPOI \"should require reciprocal participation.\"", "In its June 2008 report, the GAO doubted, based on information available to it in its investigation, that GPOI would be able to reach its goal of training 75,000 peacekeepers by 2010. The GAO stated, however, that it could not evaluate information that the State Department subsequently provided to demonstrate that GPOI would reach its goal. As of February 2008, GPOI officials are stating that 75,000 will be trained by early 2010. GPOI officials also state that the program will, as recommended by the GAO, ensure that plans for extending GPOI activities beyond 2010 identify the necessary resources for developing long-term peacekeeping skills and infrastructure in Africa. They point to plans to concentrate on building infrastructure in any post-2010 program.", "The GAO made several recommendations to improve human rights vetting, program management, and training content. The following bullets note the recommendations and the steps that GPOI is taking to meet them. Congress may wish monitor progress on the GAO recommendations. ", "Noting that a number of foreign military troops who received GPOI training had not been properly vetted, the GAO recommended that the Secretary of State develop a system for monitoring all GPOI vetting activities and for ensuring that all individuals are vetted. According to GPOI officials, the recommendation applies not only to GPOI, but to State Department vetting in general. To improve the vetting system, according to those officials, the Department has secured funding to establish a database that will facilitate record-keeping and access to past vetting cases. GPOI program implementers will use the system when it is available. Judging that GPOI was unable to account for the delivery and transfer of nonlethal training equipment to partner countries, the GAO recommended that the Secretary of State monitor implementation, on an ongoing basis, of new procedures to account for delivery and transfer of nonlethal training equipment to partner countries. According to GPOI officials, the State Department GPOI Evaluation Team had identified this accountability problem before the GAO investigation. The ACOTA program has instituted a sole-source logistics contract to improve the entire logistics process from acquisition to delivery, and is establishing a mechanism with its African partners to manage joint inventories. The State Department is developing procedures with other stakeholders to better account for equipment that is commercially acquired through the State Department's Office of Acquisition Management's regional procurement support offices. Similarly, new procedures have been developed by the State Department and the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to account for training equipment provided through the Foreign Military Sales system, with the U.S. government retaining title to and custody of defense articles until a designated U.S. government agent confirms and documents delivery of GPOI material to a recipient country's authorized representative or agent. In order to improve training, GAO recommended that the Secretary of State develop, in consultation with DOD a training program for GPOI that uses standard military task lists and related training standards in order to establish program-wide criteria for evaluating the quality of training and measuring trainee proficiency. According to GPOI officials, a GPOI contractor, Detica, is working in close collaboration with key stakeholders and others, including the U.N. Department of Peacekeeping Operations, to develop a set of essential tasks for peace operations and corresponding training standards to improve training programs. In regard to U.S. support to CoESPU, GAO recommended that the State Department work with DOD in order to help Italy staff key unfilled positions in order to better evaluate progress and monitor results. GAO also suggested that GPOI provide additional guidance to U.S. missions to help the United States and Italy collect data on the training and deployment of CoESPU graduates. The State Department is looking into the possibility of using GPOI funds to provide additional staff at CoESPU who would help with evaluation and monitoring, including the development of an alumni database, outreach materials, and tracking mechanisms. Also, according to GPOI officials, U.S. Embassy staff and others have been asked to help administer a survey regarding the training activities and deployments of CoESPU graduates. The results may be available by mid-2009.", "Section 1108 of H.R. 2410 calls for a report (within 180 days of enactment) that would provide information related to monitoring progress on these recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
