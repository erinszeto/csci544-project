NIST has identified five characteristics in particular: ", "On-demand self-service: A user can directly access the needed computing capabilities from the source, no matter what specific resource is required. An analogy is that a television viewer or radio listener can change stations at will. Broad network access: A user is not tied to one location but can access resources from anywhere the network (typically the internet) is available. Resource pooling: Many users share the same overall set of resources from a provider, using what they need, without having to concern themselves with where those resources originate. An analogy is that homeowners and businesses do not need to know which specific power plants generated the electricity they are using [although some do care, and specifically buy power from \"green\" sources]. Rapid elasticity: Users can quickly increase or decrease their use of a computing resource in response to their immediate needs. An analogy is that electricity customers can use as little or as much power as they need, within the capacity of their connections to the grid. Measured service: The amount of usage by a customer is monitored by the provider and can be used for billing or other purposes. An analogy is the metered use of electricity, water, natural gas, and other utilities.

Customers use the service over the internet through web browsers or other software applications. Providers usually sell these services on a metered basis, an approach that is sometimes called \"utility computing.\" Some common examples of services using a public cloud model include internet backup and file synchronization and web-based media services. Public clouds may have price and flexibility advantages over other deployment models, but security and other concerns could restrict federal use. The public cloud deployment model is used predominantly by businesses with low privacy concerns.

It is a cloud used by a company itself\u00e2\u0080\u0094rather than its customers. Private clouds may provide services that are similar to those provided by public cloud providers, but potentially with fewer risks. Potential disadvantages include cost and logistical challenges associated with purchasing and managing the required hardware and software.
