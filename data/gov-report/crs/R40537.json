For these purposes, the issuer of a qualified 501(c)(3) bond shall be deemed to be the ultimate borrower on whose behalf a bond was issued. ", "Delay Application of Withholding Requirement on Certain Governmental Payments for Goods and Services. For payments to contractors made after December 31, 2010, the Internal Revenue Code requires withholding at a 3% rate on certain payments made by federal, state, and local governments to persons providing property or services. The withholding is required regardless of whether the government entity making the payment is the recipient of the property or services. Government entities with less than $100 million in annual expenditures for property or services are exempt. Numerous government entities and small businesses have raised concerns about the application of this provision, expressing concern about the administrative burden of implementation. ARRA delays for one year, through December 31, 2011, the application of the 3% withholding requirement on government payments for goods and services in order to provide time for the Treasury Department to study the impact of this provision on government entities and other taxpayers. ", "Tax-Exempt Bonds and Tax Credit Bonds. The federal government subsidizes the cost of most state and local debt by excluding the interest income from federal income taxation. This tax exemption of interest income is granted because it is believed that state and local capital facilities will be under provided if state and local taxpayers have to pay the full cost. Both tax credit bonds and tax-exempt bonds provide a subsidy to municipalities by reducing the cash interest payments that a state or local government must make on its debt. ", "Interest on private activity bonds issued by state and local governments typically is not deductible under the alternative minimum tax (AMT), though that interest is deductible under the regular income tax system. This tax treatment can increase the costs of issuing tax-exempt private activity bonds imposed on state and local governments by limiting the marketability of these bonds and, therefore, forces state and local governments to issue these bonds at higher interest rates. ARRA temporarily waives the interest exclusion for the AMT for bonds issued in 2009 or 2010 in order to maximize investment in such bonds, which are typically issued by state and local governments. ARRA also allows AMT relief for current refunding of private activity bonds issued after 2003 and refunded during 2009 and 2010. ", "ARRA creates a new category of tax credit bonds for the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of public school facilities or for the acquisition of land on which a public school facility will be constructed. There are national limitations imposed by ARRA on the amount of qualified school construction bonds that may be issued. State and local governments have a limit of $22 billion ($11 billion allocated initially in 2009 and the remainder allocated in 2010) and Indian tribal governments have a limit of $400 million ($200 million allocated initially in 2009 and the remainder allocated in 2010). ", "ARRA also allows an additional $1.4 billion of Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) issuing authority to state and local governments in 2009 and 2010, which can be used to finance renovations, purchase equipment, develop course material, and train teachers and personnel at a qualified zone academy. In general, a qualified zone academy is any public school (or academic program within a public school) below college level that is located in an empowerment zone or enterprise community and is designed to cooperate with businesses to enhance the academic curriculum and increase graduation and employment rates. QZABs are a form of tax credit bonds which offer the holder a federal tax credit instead of interest.", "ARRA created a tax credit bond option for state and local governments (Build America Bonds). For 2009 and 2010, the bill provides state and local governments with the option of issuing a tax credit bond instead of a tax-exempt governmental obligation bond. Because the market for tax credits is currently small given current economic conditions, the bill would allow the state or local government to elect to receive a direct payment from the federal government equal to the subsidy that would have otherwise been delivered through the federal tax credit for bonds.

In July 2008, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) included a debt limit increase to $10,615 billion. Subsequently, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Division A of P.L. 110-343 ) raised the debt limit, for the second time in 2008, to $11,315 billion. The debt limit was raised for the third time in less than a year as a result of passage of ARRA, which raises the debt limit to $12,104 billion.", "Grants in lieu of tax credits were enacted and the authorization for those credits was assigned to the Treasury Department. Several provisions\u2014electricity production tax credits, investment tax credits for certain renewable property, and low income housing tax credits\u2014have existed in the tax code with the intent of attracting private capital investment in targeted projects.

Many provisions are specific to individual programs, agencies, and appropriations accounts. Other provisions are more general in nature, applying to multiple programs, agencies, or appropriations. This section concerns the latter type. Most of the general oversight provisions appear to cover activities and provisions associated with Division A rather than the entire law.", "The general oversight provisions might be further categorized into two groups: ", "appropriations to oversight entities including offices of inspector general (IG), the Government Accountability Office (GAO), and a newly established Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (RATB); and a number of substantive provisions, including establishment of RATB and enumeration of numerous reporting requirements.", "Appropriations to IGs, GAO, and RATB are included predominately in Division A. The provisions are distributed among 12 titles in Division A and one title in Division B. In total, 23 IGs receive $254.75 million in 25 separate appropriations. IGs in all 15 executive departments receive appropriations, ranging from the Department of Veterans Affairs on the low side ($1 million in a single appropriation) to the Department of Health and Human Services on the high side ($48.25 million in two appropriations). ARRA provides funding to be available to IGs with widely varying periods of availability. For the IG at the Department of State, for example, funds are available until the end of FY2010. Other IGs variously have funds available until the end of FY2011, FY2012, FY2013, or \"until expended\" (i.e., \"no-year\" funds). GAO receives $25 million, available through the end of FY2010, and RATB receives $84 million, available through the end of FY2011. Some appropriations specify that funds are to be used specifically for oversight of ARRA-related activities, but others essentially are supplemental appropriations that do not restrict use of funds to ARRA-related purposes. It should be noted that RATB has authority to transfer up to 100% of its funds to any office of inspector general, the Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, and an advisory panel for RATB that ARRA establishes (Division A, Title XV, Section 1524(f)). In total, the appropriations provided to these oversight-oriented entities sum to $363.75 million.", "The second group of general oversight provisions is included only in Division A\u2014chiefly in Titles XV and XVI\u2014albeit in considerable variety. Among other things, these substantive provisions establish new oversight-oriented entities like RATB, enumerate diverse reporting requirements for federal agencies and nonfederal recipients of funds, and task RATB, IGs, and GAO with several duties. Under ARRA's requirements, for example, RATB's purpose is \"to coordinate and conduct oversight of covered funds to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.\" RATB's membership is to be comprised of at least 10 IGs, in addition to or including a chairperson, who may be designated or appointed by the President according to certain criteria. RATB has several enumerated functions, including to review whether reporting for contracts and grants \"meets applicable standards\" and \"specifies the purpose of the contract or grant and measures of performance.\" In addition, RATB is required to establish a website. The Obama Administration established a rudimentary Recovery.gov website in anticipation of enactment of stimulus legislation. As agencies implement ARRA, the website is to contain, among many other things, considerable information about how funds are allocated and used. IGs and GAO also are required to conduct certain reviews. State and local governments that receive funds also will have certain certification and reporting requirements, which may be funded, at least in part, by flexibility granted to federal agencies to adjust applicable limits on administrative expenditures for federal awards. ", "Further requirements and guidance concerning ARRA implementation was forthcoming from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), some of which went beyond ARRA's statutory requirements. On February 18, 2009, OMB issued \"initial implementing guidance\" regarding ARRA, including numerous reporting requirements, to agencies in a 62-page document. Some of the required information will be posted on Recovery.gov and agency-specific ARRA-related websites. On March 20, 2009, President Obama issued a five-page presidential memorandum entitled \"Ensuring Responsible Spending of Recovery Act Funds.\" The memorandum directed agencies in how to use \"available discretion\" when allocating and spending certain ARRA-related funding. On April 3, 2009, OMB issued \"updated implementing guidance\" to agencies in a 175-page document.
