{"id": "R41182", "title": "Preservation of HUD-Assisted Housing", "released_date": "2012-01-06T00:00:00", "summary": ["The term \"assisted housing preservation\" refers to public policy efforts to maintain the affordability of rental properties financed or subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) but owned by private for-profit or nonprofit organizations. Beginning in the late 1950s, HUD extended mortgage and/or rental assistance to owners, in exchange for which the owners agreed to make their units affordable to low- and, in some cases, moderate-income tenants. The agreements to maintain affordability, sometimes called \"affordability restrictions,\" were to last between 20 years and 50 years depending on the program. When these affordability restrictions come to an end, owners have the option to stop providing affordable housing to tenants. In some, but not all, cases, tenants living in units that are leaving the assisted housing stock receive housing vouchers that are meant to prevent their displacement.", "Properties at issue in assisted housing preservation were developed through various programs. HUD provided mortgage assistance or direct loans to owners through the Section 202 loan program and the Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) Below Market Interest Rate (BMIR) mortgage insurance programs, all named for the sections of the housing acts under which they were created. HUD also subsidized tenant rents through programs such as the Rent Supplement program, the Rental Assistance Payment program, and the Section 8 project-based rental-assistance program. In some cases, owners received both mortgage financing assistance and rental assistance.", "Property owners that received mortgage financing assistance can end their federal obligation to provide affordable housing early by prepaying their mortgages (in some cases), or end it when the mortgage terms come to an end. Owners that entered into rental-assistance contracts with HUD can choose not to renew their contracts when they end. In some cases, HUD can choose to terminate assistance contracts with owners when properties are in poor physical or financial condition. In the past, Congress attempted to reduce the number of property owners that leave HUD-assisted housing programs by restricting owners' abilities to prepay their mortgages. However, these laws (known by their acronyms, ELIHPA and LIHPRHA) faced legal challenges and are no longer in effect. Currently, the primary preservation tool available to HUD is the ability to restructure debt and rental assistance in Section 8 contracts, as authorized by the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Accountability Act (MAHRA).", "There have been several proposals to expand the tools available to HUD to help preserve assisted housing. Recent proposals would, in general, focus on incentives to owners to remain in HUD programs or to encourage \"preservation purchasers\" to buy the properties and maintain affordability. However, any new incentives will require additional funding. In a limited funding environment, questions regarding preservation include whether all properties can and should be preserved, and, if not, which should be the highest priority.", "This report introduces the concept of assisted housing preservation; provides background information; and discusses current public policy issues, HUD actions to promote preservation, and proposed legislation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has provided housing assistance for low-income households through numerous programs.

In exchange for assistance from HUD, owners agreed to provide affordable housing to tenants for a period of time, anywhere from 20 to 50 years depending on the program. These HUD programs are no longer active, but they created hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing from the late 1950s through the late 1980s, and these units continue to provide affordable housing to nearly 1.4 million families.", "The affordability terms agreed to by property owners participating in these programs, sometimes referred to as \"affordability restrictions,\" began to come to an end in the 1980s. When the restrictions on these properties end, there is a risk that they will become unaffordable to low- and moderate-income tenants, and that those tenants will be displaced. Efforts to maintain the affordability of the remaining HUD-assisted properties as their affordability restrictions come to an end are often referred to as \"assisted housing preservation.\" ", "This report focuses on assisted housing preservation efforts involving six specific HUD programs, three of which provided financing assistance to private owners through low-interest loans and/or mortgage insurance, and three of which provided rental assistance to owners. These programs were often used in combination with each other, with a property owner receiving both financing assistance and rental assistance.", "The following financing assistance programs are covered in this report:", "The Section 202 loan program, active from 1959 to 1990. HUD extended low-interest, direct loans to property owners for durations of 40 or 50 years.

The Section 221(d)(3) BMIR (Below Market Interest Rate) program , active from 1961 to 1968. HUD provided mortgage insurance for low-interest, 40-year loans to private developers. The Section 221(d)(3) BMIR program helped finance the creation of approximately 159,000 units of affordable housing, more than 15,000 of which are in properties that still have active loans insured through the BMIR program. The Section 236 program , active from 1968 to 1974. HUD provided mortgage insurance for 40-year loans along with mortgage subsidy payments to private developers. The Section 236 program helped finance the development of approximately 400,000 units of affordable housing, more than 150,000 of which are in properties that still have active loans insured through the Section 236 program. ", "The following rental-assistance programs are also covered in this report:", "The Rent Supplement program , active from 1965 to 1973.

Most Rent Supplement contracts were converted to Section 8 project-based contracts (described below), although nearly 13,000 units continue to receive Rent Supplement assistance. The Rental Assistance Payment (RAP) program , active in the mid-1970s. HUD provided long-term (up to 40 years) rental-assistance contracts to owners of Section 236 properties. Most RAP contracts have been converted to Section 8 assistance (described below), although nearly 16,000 units continue to receive RAP assistance. The Section 8 project-based program , active from 1974 to 1983.

Roughly 1.2 million units continue to receive Section 8 project-based rental assistance.", "While other affordable housing programs also face expiring use restrictions, this report focuses on these six programs for several reasons: (1) Many of the property owners are private for-profit organizations that may have interests other than providing affordable housing when their affordability restrictions come to an end. This contrasts with, for example, the Public Housing program, where owners are quasi-governmental entities whose primary purpose is providing affordable housing. (2) The majority of the affordability restrictions in these six programs will come to an end during the next 5-15 years, depending on the program. This contrasts with newer housing production programs, such as the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly capital grants program, the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities program, or Low Income Housing Tax Credits, where affordability restrictions may extend many years into the future. (3) In past years, Congress has enacted laws that attempted to address housing preservation related to many of these six programs. These attempts met with varying success. This report does not address the programs of the Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service.", " Figure 1 illustrates the universe of rental units that were created as part of the six programs discussed in this report. The large circle in the center represents the housing units that receive rental assistance through the Section 8, Rent Supplement, and RAP programs. The circle on the left represents housing units that continue to have active financing through the Section 221(d)(3) BMIR and Section 236 mortgage insurance programs, and the circle on the right represents units that continue to have active financing through the Section 202 loan program.

The second section describes how affordability restrictions come to an end. In the case of financing assistance, this can occur through mortgage prepayment or maturation, and in the case of rental assistance, it can occur when contracts expire. And in cases of both financing and rental assistance, properties may become unavailable as affordable housing due to physical deterioration. The second section also discusses what happens to tenants when affordability restrictions end. In the third section, the report describes efforts by both Congress and HUD to extend affordability restrictions in these programs. Some of these efforts have been successful, and some have not. The fourth section discusses preservation priorities\u2014factors that interested parties (owners, tenants, local communities, HUD, Members of Congress) may take into consideration when determining whether a property should be preserved as assisted housing.

Units in developments that resulted from these arrangements were considered rent restricted, with property owners agreeing to keep rents at an affordable level. Later, primarily with the creation of Section 8 project-based rental assistance in 1974, the federal government began to pay a portion of tenant rents directly to owners.

(For-profit entities were not eligible to participate in the Section 202 loan program.) The Section 202 program operated as a direct loan program until 1990, when the structure of the program changed and HUD began to offer capital grants to developers instead of direct loans. This report focuses on the loan program because the affordability restrictions attached to the properties funded by capital grants will not begin to expire until approximately 2030.", "The Section 202 loan program had two different phases. From the program's inception until 1974, HUD extended loans with low interest rates (generally 3%) to developers. These pre-1974 loans funded the development of housing for moderate-income, elderly households. Some units were also set aside to serve tenants with disabilities. In exchange for the assistance provided through government loans, building owners agreed to ensure that their units were affordable for 50 years. In 1974, the Housing and Community Development Act ( P.L. 93-383 ) made changes to the Section 202 loan program. The law changed the interest rate charged on government loans from 3% to the U.S. Treasury's cost of borrowing. P.L. 93-383 also made Section 8 project-based rental assistance available to owners so that units would be affordable for low-income tenants.

Through the program, private lenders extended FHA-insured loans with interest rates of 3% and durations of up to 40 years to developers of multifamily rental housing projects of at least five units.

Private nonprofit organizations, limited dividend corporations, and cooperative housing corporations were eligible to participate. In addition to mortgage insurance, the program provided (and continues to provide) mortgage subsidies to building owners through a mechanism called Interest Reduction Payments (IRPs). At the time developers built their housing, they borrowed funds at the market interest rate. The government then provided an IRP subsidy that ensured that owners would only pay a 1% interest rate on their mortgages. The low interest payments were meant to reduce the financing costs paid by owners, which would, in turn, permit owners to pass the savings on to tenants by charging lower, more affordable rents. Contracts between HUD and building owners for IRPs were initially supposed to last 40 years. However, in order to attract developers to the Section 236 program, some contracts enabled owners to prepay their mortgages after 20 years.

Market rate rent is the amount needed to support the facilities at the mortgage interest rate without the IRPs. Both the basic rent and market rent are set by the property owner based on the budget of the individual property and are subject to HUD's approval. Tenants pay the basic rent or 30% of their income, whichever is higher, but rent cannot exceed the market rate. In addition, some tenants in Section 236 housing have their rents subsidized.

Section 311 of P.L. 109-115 required HUD, to the extent feasible, to maintain Section 8 project-based rental assistance contracts when managing or disposing of multifamily properties owned or held by the Secretary as a result of foreclosure. Prior practice had often been to terminate Section 8 project-based contracts and replace the assistance with vouchers. In cases where the Secretary determined that continued rental assistance payments for the existing property were not feasible, the provision permitted HUD to transfer the rental assistance to another multifamily property or replace it with vouchers.

In cases where units already receive rental assistance (principally through Section 8), continued rental assistance is needed to maintain affordability for low-income tenants. In addition, some currently unassisted units may need rental assistance to help pay for increased operating costs after rehabilitation has occurred.

An assisted property might also be the only affordable rental housing in an otherwise low-poverty neighborhood. If it were no longer available, families may be required to move from an area of economic opportunity to one of concentrated poverty. In rural areas, an assisted housing property might be the only affordable housing available, or perhaps even the only rental housing available.

As outlined earlier, some properties are better located than others, some are in better physical conditions than others, some serve particularly vulnerable populations, and their owners have varying levels of commitment and capacity. The subsidy status of the properties also varies widely. Some have received relatively large amounts of federal funding over the years through rental-assistance contracts and subsidized mortgages; others have received much less, perhaps only an interest rate that was initially below market, but is now at or above market.

HUD could be given explicit authority to subordinate or forgive loans that it made to property owners over the years. For example, HUD extended Flexible Subsidy loans to Section 236 and Section 202 owners, among others, to help \"restore or maintain the financial or physical soundness of the project.\" If HUD waived this debt in the case of a refinancing, an owner would not have to use loan proceeds to pay off the debt and would have more funds available to improve the property.

Increased rents and/or rent assistance\u2014If owners were to receive higher rents, they might be better able to pay for improvements to their properties or may be willing to continue to provide affordable housing. In the case of rent-assisted units, the federal government would likely pay the cost of increased rents. In the case of units without rent assistance, lower-income tenants could end up paying the cost of increased rents unless additional rent subsidies were provided. Access to reserves\u2014Some property owners with rental-assistance contracts are required to establish residual receipt accounts.

Another option is to fund additional rental-assistance contracts, which can serve to both provide ongoing operating assistance and act as a credit enhancement when a purchaser is seeking private market financing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements for Current Owners", "paragraphs": ["Another way to preserve affordable housing would be to impose requirements on property owners. Such requirements could include limiting an owner's options in selling the property, giving tenants the right to enforce existing housing quality standards, and expanding tenant notification requirements.", "An advantage of owners requirements is that they can accomplish the goal of preservation without costly incentives. However, requirements that restrict an owner's ability to sell or convert a property to market-rate housing could result in legal challenges. As discussed earlier in this report (\" Previous and Ongoing Efforts to Preserve Assisted\u00a0Housing \"), in the late 1980s and early 1990s Congress enacted laws designed to limit the ability of owners to end affordability restrictions. The laws resulted in years of litigation over whether these restrictions resulted in a constitutional \"takings\" claim. The federal government has lost several of these lawsuits and some are still pending. Owner requirement options include the following:", "Right of first refusal or right of first purchase for preservation purchaser \u2014One proposal is to give preservation purchasers a right to purchase properties in order to prevent them from being converted to market-rate housing. In this scenario, if an owner wanted to sell the property he or she would first have to attempt to sell the property to an organization that would maintain affordability, or would have to accept a fair market offer by a preservation purchaser over other offers. Right of first refusal or right of first purchase for tenants\u2014Another option similar to the right of first purchase or right of first refusal for a preservation purchaser would be offering the same rights to tenants. The idea is that, with sufficient notification, tenants can get technical assistance, organize themselves, and purchase the property in which they live. Tenant enforcement of HUD contracts\u2014A criticism preservation advocates have made of current policy is that tenants have no way to compel HUD to enforce its rules, such as those meant to ensure that properties do not deteriorate to the point that they fail inspection. It has been proposed that if tenants were given the standing to compel enforcement with contract rules, properties may be better maintained and may not be at risk of loss due to HUD enforcement action. This type of private right of action exists in fair housing law and would give tenants greater power in negotiation with private property owners. Tenant notification\u2014In cases where owners plan to convert units to market-rate housing or sell the property to an owner that will not maintain affordability, they must notify tenants. Proposals have been made to expand these notification requirements; this would help resident groups organize in case they wish to purchase the property or contest a sale, or it would give them ample time to find alternative arrangements with their vouchers. Current law requires that owners give a minimum notification of at least 150 days before prepaying an FHA-insured mortgage and at least a one-year notice before choosing not to renew a Section 8 contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What if Property Is Not Preserved?", "paragraphs": ["In some cases, a property either cannot be preserved with existing incentives, or should not be preserved, perhaps due to its physical condition or location. In circumstances where an individual property will not be preserved, there may be options to either transfer the assistance to another property or provide residents with ongoing assistance.", "Transferring Section 8 assistance\u2014If a property is significantly deteriorated, outdated, or poorly located, one preservation option is to transfer the assistance attached to the property (its rental-assistance contract and/or its affordability restriction) to another, better-suited property. The idea is to preserve the existing assistance, since there is no authority for new rental-assistance contracts or affordability restrictions. In recent years, Congress has given HUD limited authority to undertake these types of transfers, and there has been interest in further expanding that authority. Expanded Enhanced Voucher Eligibility\u2014In the case of mortgage prepayment or termination of a Section 8 contract, the tenants receive vouchers in some circumstances. These vouchers are designed to provide ongoing rent assistance to tenants and to protect them from rent increases, which may allow them to remain in their current rental units. In the case of the expiration of RAP and Rent Supplement contracts, as well as in the case of mortgage maturation or HUD-approved prepayments (in the absence of rental-assistance contracts), the residents are not eligible for vouchers. There have been proposals to expand enhanced voucher eligibility to those groups that are not currently eligible.

Owners must be able to show that the subordination is necessary in order to preserve the project, and must enter into extended use agreements for the longer of 20 years beyond the loan's original maturity date or the date on which the subordinated loan is repaid. Similarly, HUD issued a notice that gives it the authority to defer the repayment of flexible subsidy debt in circumstances that would assist in preserving properties. From the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, the flexible subsidy program provided loans to properties with HUD-assisted financing that were having financial difficulties (the last year in which Congress gave new obligation authority was FY1995). Under the terms of the notice, HUD may approve deferral of payment in cases where an owner refinances a loan but the funds are not sufficient to pay off the flexible subsidy debt. As with subordination of Section 202 loans, an owner has to show that the deferral is necessary to ensure preservation of the project and must agree to an extended use agreement for the longer of 20 years beyond the flexible subsidy loan's original maturity date or the date on which the subordinated loan is repaid. Another HUD notice, issued on February 1, 2011, allows multifamily project owners to convert efficiency units to one-bedroom units, even if conversion results in fewer total units in the building. Owners may wish to pursue conversion because efficiency units are undesirable in some markets and owners are unable to rent them, resulting in lack of income to keep properties operational.

Under current law, HUD does not have the authority to renew Rent Supplement and RAP contracts, so when the contracts expire, owners are no longer eligible to receive rental assistance for the previously subsidized units. While tenants living in units assisted through Rent Supplement may receive tenant-protection vouchers, those in RAP-assisted units are not eligible for vouchers.
