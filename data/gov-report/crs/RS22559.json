(The potential for using the DDG-1000 design for the CG(X) was one of the Navy's arguments for moving ahead with the DDG-1000 program.) At an April 5, 2006, hearing, for example, a Navy admiral then in charge of shipbuilding programs, when asked what percentage of the CG(X) design would be common to that of the DDG-1000 (previously called the DD(X)), stated the following:", "[W]e haven't defined CG(X) in a way to give you a crisp answer to that question, because there are variations in weapons systems and sensors to go with that. But we're operating under the belief that the hull will fundamentally be\u2014the hull mechanical and electrical piece of CG(X) will be the same, identical as DD(X). So the infrastructure that supports radar and communications gear into the integrated deckhouse would be the same fundamental structure and layout. I believe to accommodate the kinds of technologies CG(X) is thinking about arraying, you'd probably get 60 to 70 percent of the DD(X) hull and integrated (inaudible) common between DD(X) and CG(X), with the variation being in that last 35 percent for weapons and that sort of [thing]....", "The big difference [between CG(X) and DDG-1000] will likely [be] the size of the arrays for the radars; the numbers of communication apertures in the integrated deckhouse; a little bit of variation in the CIC [Combat Information Center\u2014in other words, the] command and control center; [and] likely some variation in how many launchers of missiles you have versus the guns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prospective Affordability of CG(X) in Numbers Desired", "paragraphs": ["If the CG(X) is based on the DDG-1000 design, its unit procurement cost might be comparable to that of the DDG-1000. The FY2008-FY2013 FYDP includes notional \"placeholder\" figures of about $3.2 billion in FY2011 to procure the first CG(X) and about $3.1 billion in FY2013 to procure the second CG(X). This compares with about $3.2 billion to procure each of the first two DDG-1000s in FY2007-FY2008. Early Navy plans called for procuring two DDG-1000s per year, and a total of 16, 24, or 32 ships. In large part for affordability considerations, planned DDG-1000 procurement was reduced to one ship per year, and a total of 7 ships. If affordability considerations similarly limit CG(X) procurement to one ship per year, total CG(X) procurement might be reduced from 19 ships to perhaps no more than 12 ships, and possibly as few as eight.

Lengthening the DDG-51 hull with a mid-hull plug might produce a CG(X) design displacing roughly 11,000 tons, which would be about 24% smaller than the 14,500-ton DDG-1000, and roughly as large as the six California (CGN-36) and Virginia (CGN-38) class nuclear-powered cruisers that were procured for the Navy in the 1960s and 1970s. The deck house and lower decks of the DDG-51 hull would need to be redesigned to accommodate a radar capable of supporting BMD operations, an integrated electric-drive propulsion system, other new technologies from the DDG-1000, and (if desired) missile-launch tubes large enough to accommodate a BMD interceptor now in development called the Kinetic Energy Interceptor (BMD). Since the DDG-51 hull design was originally developed in the 1980s, it may include hard-to-change features that prevent it from fully accommodating certain DDG-1000 new technologies, such as, perhaps, those permitting the ship to be operated by a substantially smaller crew.", "For ships of a similar type and level of complexity, relative size can be rough proxy for relative unit procurement cost. A 9,000- to 11,000-ton CG(X) would be 62% to 76% as large as a 14,500-ton DDG-1000-based CG(X). However, some shipbuilding costs, such as shipyard fixed overhead costs, do not go down proportionately with ship size. A DDG-51-based CG(X) consequently might cost more than 62% to 76% of what a 14,500-ton CG(X) would cost to procure\u2014perhaps something more like 72% to 86%. Production of a DDG-51-based CG(X) might benefit from residual learning-curve effects of prior production of DDG-51s, the last of which was procured in FY2005. Any limitations in incorporating DDG-1000 technologies for reducing crew size could result in a ship with a larger crew than that of the DDG-1000, and thus higher crew-related life-cycle O&S costs than a DDG-1000-based CG(X).", "The DDG-51 hull is a conventional flared hull that slopes outward as it rises up from the waterline. A CG(X) based on the DDG-51 hull consequently would be more detectible by radar than a ship using a tumblehome (inwardly sloping) hull, like that of the DDG-1000. In addition, as ship size grows, so does the size of the ship's weapon and sensor payload. Consequently, larger ships generally have more capability than smaller ones. Indeed, due to certain economies of scale that occur in naval architecture, larger ships can have proportionately larger payloads than smaller ones. Thus, a DDG-51-based CG(X) might be less than 62% to 76% as capable as a 14,500-ton CG(X). Due to the space, weight, and energy requirements of the large and powerful BMD-capable radar to be carried by the CG(X), accommodating such a radar in a DDG-51-based CG(X) design might require steep reductions in other ship capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ship Based on New-Design Hull Smaller Than DDG-1000 Hull", "paragraphs": ["A ship using a new-design hull smaller than the DDG-1000 hull might similarly displace roughly 9,000 to 11,000 tons. (A new-design hull larger than about 11,000 tons might be too close in size to the DDG-1000 hull to produce savings that are worthwhile compared to the option of simply reusing the DDG-1000 hull.) The unit procurement cost of such a ship might be about equal to that of a DDG-51-based design, or perhaps somewhat less, if the new-design hull incorporates producibility features (i.e., features for ease of manufacturing, such as straighter-running pipeline arrangements) that are more advanced than those of the DDG-51 hull. A new-design hull might be able to take more complete advantage of DDG-1000 technologies than a DDG-51-based design, possibly giving the ship a smaller crew and thus lower personnel-related O&S costs. The new-design hull could be a conventional flared hull, like that of the DDG-51, or a reduced-size version of the DDG-1000's tumblehome hull. The latter option could produce a ship as stealthy as (or perhaps slightly stealthier than) the DDG-1000. Due to the potential greater ability to take advantage of DDG-1000 technologies or other new technologies, a 9,000- to 11,000-ton ship based on a new-design hull might be somewhat more capable than a DDG-51-based design. A 9,000- to 11,000-ton design would still, however, be substantially less capable than a DDG-1000-based design, and perhaps proportionately less capable. As with the previous option, due to the space, weight, and energy requirements of the large and powerful BMD-capable radar to be carried by the CG(X), accommodating such a radar in a 9,000- to 11,000-ton CG(X) based on a new-design hull design might require steep reductions in other ship capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ship Based on DDG-1000 Hull or Variation of That Hull", "paragraphs": ["This option, which is the Navy's stated preferred approach, could produce a ship about as large as the 14,500-ton DDG-1000, or (if the DDG-1000's hull is expanded) somewhat larger than the DDG-1000 (i.e., upwards of 20,000 tons). The unit procurement cost of this option would be substantially greater than those of the previous two options, but perhaps less so than a simple size comparison would suggest, due to shipbuilding costs that are fixed or relatively insensitive to ship size. Production of the ship would benefit from learning-curve effects of producing DDG-1000s. Hull-design and system-integration costs would be minimized through reuse of the DDG-1000 hull and elements of the DDG-1000 combat system, and could be substantially lower than those of the previous two options.

Ford (CVN-78) class aircraft carriers. The third option above might also accommodate a modified version of one-half of a Ford-class propulsion plant, but perhaps less easily and with more modifications. The first two options above would likely require the design of a new nuclear propulsion plant. Designing a new nuclear propulsion plant would likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars; modifying the Ford-class plant would cost substantially less.", "A nuclear-powered ship would be more capable than a corresponding conventionally powered version because of the mobility advantages of nuclear propulsion, which include, for example, the ability to make long-distance transits at high speeds in response to distant contingencies without need for refueling.

The question of whether to procure a potentially smaller number of individually more expensive and more capable ships, or a potentially larger number of individually less expensive and less capable ships, is a classic ship-design and force-planning issue that the Navy, the Department of Defense, and Congress have faced many times in the past. The advantage that larger ships have in terms of unit capability and capability per dollar is one reason why the Navy has often preferred larger and more capable designs in recent decades.
