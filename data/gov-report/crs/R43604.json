These activities include coordination and information sharing, spare equipment programs, security standards, security exercises, and other measures. There has been some level of physical security investment and an increasing refinement of voluntary security practices across the electric power sector for at least the last 15 years. However, recent grid security exercises, together with a 2013 physical attack on transformers in Metcalf, CA, have changed the way grid security is viewed and have focused congressional interest on the physical security of HV transformers. They have also prompted new grid security efforts by utilities and regulators.", "On November 20, 2014, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a new mandatory Physical Security Reliability Standard (CIP-014-1) proposed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC). The new standards require certain transmission owners \"to address physical security risks and vulnerabilities related to the reliable operation\" of the power grid by performing risk assessments to identify their critical facilities, evaluate potential threats and vulnerabilities, and implement security plans to protect against attacks. Legislative proposals would expand federal efforts to prevent or recover from a physical attack on the U.S. grid. These include the Enhanced Grid Security Act of 2015 (S. 1241), the Critical Electric Infrastructure Protection Act (H.R. 2271), the Terrorism Prevention and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 85), a House bill to establish a strategic transformer reserve program (H.R. 2244), and the Grid Modernization Act of 2015 (S. 1243).", "There is widespread agreement among government agencies, utilities, and manufacturers that HV transformers in the United States are vulnerable to terrorist attack, and that such an attack potentially could have catastrophic consequences. But the most serious, multi-transformer attacks could require acquiring operational information and a certain level of sophistication on the part of potential attackers. Consequently, despite the technical arguments, without more specific information about potential targets and attacker capabilities, the actual risk of a multi-HV transformer attack remains an open question. As the electric power industry and federal agencies continue their efforts to improve the physical security of critical HV transformer substations, Congress may consider several issues as part of its oversight of the sector: identifying critical transformers, confidentiality of critical transformer information, adequacy of HV transformer protection, quality of federal threat information, recovery from HV transformer attacks, and the overall resiliency of the grid.

This network is interspersed with hundreds of large electric power transformer substations whose function is to adjust electric voltage as needed to move power across the network ( Figure 1 ). High voltage (HV) transformer units make up less than 3% of transformers in U.S. power substations, but they carry 60% or more of the nation's electricity.

The various parts of the electric power system are all vulnerable to failure due to natural, operational, or manmade events. Such outages can have considerable negative impacts on business, government services, and daily life. Notwithstanding its high reliability overall, the U.S. power grid has periodically experienced major regional outages. Recent examples include the Northeast Blackout of 2003 (which affected 55 million customers in eight states and Canada) and extended outages in the New York/New Jersey area after Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

Thus, while occasionally causing blackouts, physical attacks on towers generally have not resulted in widespread or long-lasting outages. The power industry also has experienced mechanical failure of individual HV transformers within a single control area resulting in blackouts lasting hours. However, no region in the United States has experienced simultaneous failures of multiple HV transformers. Experts have long asserted that a coordinated and simultaneous attack on multiple HV transformers could have severe implications for reliable electric service over a large geographic area, crippling its electricity network and causing widespread, extended blackouts. Such an event would have serious economic and social consequences.

Transformers range in size from small, pole-mounted units that may serve a dozen homes to transmission units that serve an entire city. The larger the transformer, the higher the voltage the transformer can handle. Utility transformers, regardless of size, fundamentally consist of copper wire wrapped around a metallic \"core\" within an insulated protective housing covered with a 5/8 to 3/4-inch mild steel tank. They are linked to the power grid by protruding metal and (usually) ceramic connectors called \"bushings\" which resemble giant spark plugs. Larger transformers generate waste heat during operation (like all transformers), so they are cooled by a system comprised of internally circulating oil and external radiators, analogous to the cooling system in a car engine. Large transformers are located in network substations along with transmission lines, associated electric equipment, and system controls. These substations may be found in remote locations or near urban centers, depending upon regional transmission needs. Many are located alongside electric generation plants, linking those plants to the grid.", "High-voltage transformers, especially units above 345 kV, are physically large and extraordinarily heavy. For example, Figure 3 shows a new 345 kV transformer many times larger than the pickup truck parked alongside. This transformer unit weighs 435 tons, including 29,000 gallons of cooling oil. (Note that the vertical bushings are not yet connected to transmission lines because the unit is being moved.) This is a three-phase unit, with one bushing for each of the three phases. Some substations alternatively employ separate single-phase transformers in sets of three. Generally, the higher the transformer's voltage, the larger the transformer. A three-phase 765kV transformer could be 45 feet tall and occupy a footprint of 2,200 square feet\u2014about the size of an average new single-family house."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Manufacture and Cost", "paragraphs": ["Most HV transformers are unique\u2014designed and manufactured to custom specifications for a specific network application. In 2010, the lead time between an HV transformer order and delivery ranged from 5 to 12 months for U.S. manufacturers and 6 to 16 months for foreign manufacturers, although lead times well over 20 months could be required in certain situations. This process may include three to four months for the engineering design alone. Since manufacturing generally occurs on a single production line with just-in-time component supplies, advanced production scheduling is important for managing delivery. Physical assembly is labor intensive, requiring manual winding of the copper wire around the transformer core and frequent engineering checks during manufacturing. Extensive testing of completed units also contributes to HV transformer manufacturing time.", "The installed cost for an HV transformer depends heavily on its configuration and specific design requirements. New HV transmission substations can cost well in excess of $10 million, including the cost of transformers and other station equipment. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the factory prices for HV transformers typically range from $2 million for a 230 kV unit to $7.5 million for a 765 kV unit, before transportation and installation costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Manufacturing Capability", "paragraphs": ["From 1950 to 1970, utility construction of large generation plants and associated transmission networks fueled a robust U.S. manufacturing market for large transformers. During this period, the United States (and Canada) accounted for approximately 40% of global demand for such units. After 1970, however, utility investment in transmission infrastructure began falling off due to perceived overcapacity, public resistance to transmission siting, and greater regulatory scrutiny of capital expenditures. Beginning in the late 1980s, uncertainty about industry restructuring and the introduction of competition made grid owners even less willing to invest in new transmission. This decline in U.S. transmission investment greatly reduced domestic demand for large transformers, especially HV transformers. By the late 1990s, the United States and Canada accounted for only 20% of global large transformer sales. Demand in the United States has subsequently increased, however. For example, between 2005 and 2013, the total value of large transformers (including medium- and high-voltage units) imported to the United States more than doubled, from $284 million (363 units) to $676 million (496 units).", "At the same time, global demand for transformers continued to grow and more foreign manufacturers entered the market. According to U.S. industry representatives, many of these foreign manufacturers benefited from dramatically lower labor costs, so they could underbid U.S. transformer makers for the remaining U.S. demand. Some of these foreign manufacturers may have been protected by import barriers which effectively closed their home markets to U.S. transformer imports. Today, there is limited manufacturing capacity in the United States for HV transformers. Five U.S. facilities state that they can manufacture transformers rated 345 kV or above, although it is not clear how many units in this range they have actually produced. Canada and Mexico have five additional HV manufacturing plants.

HV transformer substations are distributed throughout the electric grid, as shown in Figure 1 , with the greatest number in the eastern part of the country."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Criticality of HV Transformers", "paragraphs": ["Because HV transformers carry so much electricity, the destruction of even a small number could seriously reduce the transmission capacity of a regional electric power grid and lead to extended blackouts. The impact of such a failure would depend on the electricity flows in that part of the grid, congestion from major network bottlenecks, and the status of other key facilities such as power plants, transmission lines, and other substations. Power grid planners generally anticipate the possible loss of a single HV transformer substation and are prepared to reroute power flows as necessary to maintain regional electric service. But the simultaneous loss of multiple HV transformers, especially in a constrained transmission area, could exceed the capability of a regional network to reroute power through secondary lines.", "Numerous publicly available studies have analyzed the risks from such a multiple failure. For example, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), in a 1990 report on the physical vulnerability of the electric power system, found that", "In most cases, the nearly simultaneous destruction of two or three transmission substations would cause a serious blackout of a region or utility, although of short duration where there is an approximate balance of load and supply.... The destruction of more than three transmission substations would cause long-term blackouts in many areas of the country.", "In such an emergency scenario, limited electric service could likely be restored in the short term by imposing \"rolling\" blackouts, rerouting transmission, and using portable transformers. Nonetheless, the loss of key HV substations would leave the regional network crippled and highly susceptible to further disturbance and cascading failure. According to power industry experts, certain parts of the U.S. transmission network are particularly vulnerable to HV substation disruption. These areas may have severely constrained transmission paths relying on a small number of HV transformers in extremely critical network locations. According to press accounts, a FERC power flow analysis in 2013 identified 30 such critical HV transformer substations across the continental United States; disabling as few as nine of these substations during a time of peak electricity demand reportedly could cause a \"coast-to-coast blackout.\"", "Notwithstanding the FERC study and similar claims by security analysts, the actual risk to the U.S. grid of extended blackouts due to a deliberate attack on multiple HV transformers is the subject of ongoing debate. An investigation by the Department of Energy's Office of Inspector General (IG) appears to discredit FERC's risk analysis. According to the IG investigation, officials at the department previously concluded that FERC's study was based on \"highly unlikely assumptions\" and that \"loss of the critical substations identified in the analysis would not result in the consequence described in the analysis or any other consequence that could be reasonably expected to result in damage to national security.\" Due to the complexity of HV transmission networks and uncertainties about potential physical threats, a range of differing conclusions may be reached by industry experts on the potential severity and duration of a blackout from a multi-transformer attack. However, most analysts acknowledge that severe regional, if not national, power outages may be technically possible under certain conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physical Vulnerability of HV Transformers", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy's recent Quadrennial Energy Review identifies HV transformers as one of the electric grid's \"most vulnerable components.\" All HV transformers are designed to withstand operational risks such as lightning strikes, hurricanes, and network power fluctuations\u2014but they are vulnerable to intentional physical attacks. Despite their great size and internal complexity, HV transformers of conventional design can be readily disabled or destroyed. According to one manufacturer, \"if someone were to intentionally try ... it is a surprisingly simple task and there are a large number of ways to conceivably damage a transformer beyond repair.\" Transformer experts have asserted that a bad actor with basic knowledge of transformer design could inflict irreparable damage. Such attacks can cause massive electrical short circuits and oil fires that would destroy an HV transformer and damage surrounding infrastructure. One fire at a 345 kV substation in Texas, for example, destroyed the transformer and burned for five hours, causing \"plumes of smoke that could be seen for miles.\" In addition to direct attacks on the transformers themselves, HV substations can be further disabled by damaging associated transmission lines or control centers that may be located on site.", "Because HV transformers are so big and are connected to the largest overhead transmission towers, they are easily identified along major transmission corridors. High voltage transformers are usually housed in substations that are enclosed with a chain-link fence. Guards are not often stationed at these facilities under normal operating circumstances. Consequently, HV transformers are ordinarily easier to access than other critical electric facilities such as generation plants and control centers. Utilities use closed-circuit surveillance and other methods to detect intrusion. However, access to the substation may be achieved by either cutting or scaling the chain-link fence. Once inside, a saboteur could cause damage by accessing the control room or physically damaging the HV transformer. Penetrating the 5/8 to 3/4-inch steel tank with any device could short-circuit the windings and irreparably destroy the transformer. Alternatively, a saboteur could attempt to open a valve and drain the insulating oil. Igniting the oil might cause the transformer to arc and eventually explode. With a clear line of sight, an attacker could also disable transformers from a distance using conventional rifles. Other methods of disabling HV transformers have also been identified.", "The vulnerability of individual transformer substations has been demonstrated by successful attacks in recent years. In the most serious case, a rifle attack occurred in April 2013 at PG&E's 500 kV substation in Metcalf, CA. In this attack, multiple individuals outside the substation reportedly shot at the HV transformer radiators with .30 caliber rounds, causing them to leak cooling oil, overheat, and become inoperative. In October 2013, the U.S. Justice Department charged an individual with attacks on the transmission grid in Arkansas, including a deliberate fire at Entergy's 500 kV substation in Lonoke County. The fire consumed the substation control house but electrical service was not interrupted. In 2005, at a Progress Energy substation in Florida, a rifle attack ruptured a transformer oil tank, ultimately causing an explosion and local blackout. Other incidents at substations have been reported with some regularity, although most have been attributed to vandals or careless hunters.", "It is very difficult to restore a damaged HV transformer substation. As noted above, transmission experts assert that most HV transformers currently in service are custom designed and, therefore, cannot be generally interchanged. Furthermore, at $3-5 million per unit or more, maintaining large inventories of spare HV transformers solely as emergency replacements is prohibitively costly, so limited extras are on hand. The number of spares a utility maintains is increasingly sensitive information, but one regional transmission control area reported in 2007 that it maintained 29 spares for 188 transformers rated 500 kV on its system. Programs for the sharing of spare HV transformers among multiple utilities are discussed later in this report.", "Within the United States, transportation of HV transformers is difficult. Due to their size and weight, most HV transformers are transported on special railcars, each with up to 36 axles to distribute the load. There are fewer than 20 of these railcars in the Unites States rated to carry 500 tons or more, which can present a logistical problem if they are needed in a transformer emergency. In some cases involving older transformers, adjacent rail lines are no longer in service, so replacement transformers may need to be transported by other means. Specialized flatbed trucks can also carry heavy transformer loads over public roadways, but the few such trucks that exist have less carrying capacity and greater route restrictions than the railcars because HV transformers may exceed highway weight limits. Transporting HV transformers, especially in an emergency, can create other logistical challenges as well, including the coordination of movement through ports and road constraints (e.g., tunnels and overpasses), special transportation permits, and police escort requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Targeting of HV Transformers", "paragraphs": ["Malicious individuals could, without significant training, identify critical HV transformer locations and time an attack for greatest effect. This could be accomplished with basic knowledge of transmission operations and regional network characteristics drawn from publicly available sources, including electric marketing data indicating constrained areas of the network.

Attacking during peak consumption times (Winter in cold climates and Summer in hot climates) will make power diversion impossible.... Arson, explosives or long-range rifle fire can be used to disable substations, transformers and suspension pylons. A simultaneous attack against a number of these targets can shut down power ... with the advantage that service cannot be quickly restored by diverting power from another source.

Determination of whether a specific HV transformer is \"critical\" will be based on each individual asset owner's \"objective analysis, technical expertise, and experienced judgment.\" In its physical security standards, NERC requires transmission owners with HV assets meeting prescriptive criteria to examine whether they may have critical transformers, but it is up to the owners to determine themselves if any of their assets are critical through a periodic risk assessment based on their own respective transmission analyses, subject to independent validation. Thus, grid owners could have considerable latitude in determining which of their transformer substations (if any) are critical and therefore subject to the requirements of the new standard. ", "Although there are many candidate transformer substations in the grid, relatively few are likely to be of national significance. As discussed above, of the numerous HV transformer substations in the United States, FERC's 2013 power flow analysis identified only 30 as being critical to the national grid (although each of these substations may contain multiple HV transformers). Whether the number of critical transformer substations under FERC's definition above turns out to be higher or lower than 30, it will likely be only a small fraction of the total asset base. This conclusion is consistent with FERC's expectation that under NERC's new standard \"the number of facilities identified as critical will be relatively small.... For example, of the many substations on the Bulk-Power System, our preliminary view is that most of these would not be 'critical' as the term is used in this order.\" Consistent with this view, the NERC working group responsible for drafting the proposed physical security standard likewise expected the number of critical facilities to be \"small and that many Transmission Owners that meet the applicability of this standard will not actually identify any such Facilities.\"", "Although the new NERC physical security standards were approved by FERC after extensive utility and public comments, some stakeholders take issue with specific requirements and methodology in the standards. For example, some analysts have objected to NERC's standards as focusing too narrowly on a limited number of substations evaluated individually. They argue this approach fails to adequately consider potential impacts from a planned, multi-substation attack. They assert that NERC's approach may overlook transformers that are \"critical\" in the context of such an attack. FERC has rejected these arguments (for the time being) arguing that \"by protecting individual critical facilities, responsible entities will necessarily protect critical facilities against simultaneous attacks.\" FERC states that it is not prepared \"to expand the scope of covered facilities to include those not individually critical ... at this early stage of industry experience with the new requirements. Our priority at this time is to have responsible entities protect the most critical facilities.\" However, the commission also states that it remains \"open to a different approach in the future as industry continues to gain experience in this area and as risks may evolve.\" ", "Properly identifying which HV transformer substations are critical is a key issue. Otherwise, the electricity sector risks the possibility of hardening too many substations, hardening the wrong substations, or both. Either outcome could increase ultimate costs to electricity consumers without commensurate security benefits, and could potentially divert limited security resources from other important grid priorities (e.g., cybersecurity). Hardening too few substations could leave the grid exposed to unacceptable levels of risk. Independent verification is intended to validate utility assessments of substation criticality, but the standard's reliance on company-by-company assessments may still allow for important differences in analytic methodology or assumptions, and thus inconsistent conclusions about transformer criticality. Furthermore, company-specific studies may not align with a \"top down\" assessment of asset criticality like that performed by FERC in its Electrically Significant Location (ESL) analysis. Congress may examine whether company-specific assessments of transformer criticality could differ from national-level assessments or assessments using other analytic approaches, and what implications, if any, such differences might have on overall grid security and company efforts to protect particular substations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Confidentiality of Critical Transformer Information", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring the confidentially of critical infrastructure information has been a long-standing concern across all critical infrastructure sectors.

PG&E, BPA, and the other utilities announcing large security investments have already decided to make such investments. Other major owners of critical HV transformers have not publicly announced similar plans, in some cases because they have not yet completed security evaluations under NERC's new standards, so they are unsure what new measures they will require. For example, based upon a security gap analysis after the Metcalf incident, Florida Power and Light (FPL) identified multiple potential security enhancements, but has only implemented some of them; other measures have been delayed for comparison to requirements under NERC's new standards.", "NERC's proposed standards for power grid physical security would ensure considerable consistency in the analytic process utilities must undertake to identify critical substations and develop plans to secure them.

In particular, how physical security is managed within a corporate structure can influence the effectiveness of physical security programs. For example, a 2014 corporate memo from PG&E leaked to the press states that \"due to the existing structure and limited authority of CSD [Corporate Security Division], little has changed relative CSD's abilities to make significant and intended security improvements.\" How capital is allocated and accounted for can also be a barrier to physical security implementation and verification. In a 2014 report to Florida regulators, FPL stated that", "not all security costs are contained within the Corporate Security budget. Some physical security costs are shared with appropriate operational business units. For example, the cost of security equipment for new substations is rolled into the cost of the substation. Not all physical security costs are budgeted and tracked in separate line items. Therefore, difficulties exist estimating total costs of FPL's physical security efforts.", "As FERC continues to implement its policy of regulating physical security of the power grid, Congress may examine whether company-specific security initiatives appropriately reflect the risk profiles of their particular assets, and whether additional security measures across the grid uniformly reflect terrorism risk from a national perspective. Examining the extent to which the corporate structures and accounting functions support company-specific physical security programs may be of particular interest as grid owners adapt to evolving threats and physical security requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality of Federal Threat Information", "paragraphs": ["The power industry's physical security risk assessments rely upon information about security threats provided by the federal government, among other sources, communicated through the ISAC, during DHS and other agency briefings, or through other channels. The quality and timeliness of this threat information is a key determinant of what grid owners need to be protecting against and what security measures to take. Incomplete or ambiguous threat information\u2014especially from the federal government\u2014may lead to inconsistency in physical security among grid owners, inefficient spending of limited security resources at facilities (e.g., that may not really be under threat), or deployment of security measures against the wrong threat. For example, prior to FERC's physical security order, the head of NERC, which initially opposed mandatory physical security standards, stated? ", "I am concerned that a rule-based approach for physical security would not provide the flexibility needed to deal with the widely varying risk profiles and circumstances across the North American grid and would instead create unnecessary and inefficient regulatory burdens and compliance obligations.", "Differences in the interpretation or application of threat information, as discussed in the previous section, may be a reason why some large utilities have announced major new substation security initiatives while others have not.", "Concerns about the quality and specificity of federal threat information have long been an issue across all critical infrastructure sectors. Threat information continues to be an uncertainty in the case of power grid physical security. For example, the PJM regional transmission organization employs probabilistic models to assess risks to the grid due to equipment malfunction and severe weather, but its model has not incorporated an assessment of a physical attack due to insufficient data. ", "Some federal officials reportedly have characterized the Metcalf incident as a domestic terrorist attack, potentially a \"dry run\" for a more destructive attack on multiple HV transformer substations, while the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stated that it does not believe Metcalf was a terrorist incident. Because the perpetrators have not been identified, it is impossible to know for certain, but the ambiguity has significant implications for HV substation security going forward. Although there is wide consensus that the Metcalf attack was extremely serious, some industry analysts have opined that FERC's physical security order may be an \"overreaction\" to Metcalf. By contrast, former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff has predicted that \"the sophistication and resulting damage of the Metcalf attack will ... be exceeded\" in a future attack. Still others have expressed concern that FERC's physical security concerns may be too heavily focused on another Metcalf-type scenario (the last threat) rather than a wider range of potential future threats (the next threat).", "There is widespread agreement among government, utilities, and manufacturers that HV transformers in the United States are vulnerable to terrorist attack, and that such an attack potentially could have catastrophic consequences. But the most serious, multi-transformer attacks could require acquiring operational information and a certain level of sophistication on the part of potential attackers. Consequently, despite the technical arguments, without more specific information about potential targets and attacker capabilities, the true vulnerability of the grid to a multi-HV transformer attack remains an open question. As Congress seeks to establish the best policies to address HV transformer vulnerability relative to other infrastructure security priorities, understanding this vulnerability in the context of specific demonstrable threats may become increasingly important. To this end Congress may examine how federal threat information is developed and used by grid owners, and how limitations and uncertainty of this information may affect the HV transformer physical security among electric utilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recovery from HV Transformer Attacks", "paragraphs": ["Physical security for HV transformer substations has the primary purpose of preventing successful attacks against these critical assets within the power grid. However, in the event of a successful attack, measures to minimize its effect on the overall grid are equally important so that the loss of any particular transformer remains a local event. To this end the electric power industry emphasizes its strategy of \"defense-in-depth,\" which includes incident response and recovery in addition to preparation and prevention. Industry initiatives to enhance grid resiliency, including incident recovery programs such as the DHS recovery transformer program and EEI's spare transformer program, contribute to the power grid's ability to sustain a terrorist attack without widespread grid failure. Indeed, some analysts have pointed to the Metcalf incident as a successful demonstration of grid resiliency; electric service was not interrupted despite the loss of a critical substation in the San Francisco Bay area. Nonetheless, some policymakers have proposed additional federal authorities to respond to physical incidents affecting grid critical infrastructure, including HV transformers.", "Some stakeholders, including FERC officials, have asserted that the commission's current grid reliability authority under the Federal Power Act (\u00a7215) does not provide FERC with adequate authority for emergency action in the event of an attack on the grid. A House bill to amend the Federal Power Act with respect to critical electric infrastructure security ( H.R. 2271 ) would allow the President to authorize the Secretary of Energy to order emergency measures to protect grid reliability during a \"grid security emergency\" (\u00a7(b)(1)). The director of FERC's electric reliability office has testified in support of the bill that FERC's existing \"procedures ... for the development and approval of reliability standards do not provide an effective and timely means of addressing urgent cyber or other national security risks to the bulk power system.\" NERC's president likewise has testified that he generally supports legislation clarifying federal authority during grid emergencies, as long as they focus clearly on \"national, catastrophic instances\" and do not conflict with the existing system of ongoing measures in place to protect the grid. Utility industry representatives also support facilitation of industry-government coordination in the event of an attack on the grid. As consideration of H.R. 2271 or similar legislation continues, Congress may focus on specific language related to consultation, duration of emergency measures, grid recovery activities, and other details to ensure that they align with a complex industry structure while achieving the bill's objectives in the event of a future security incident.", "As discussed above, the DOE's Quadrennial Energy Review calls for federal efforts to develop one or more critical HV transformer reserves. H.R. 2244 would mandate a DOE plan for how such a reserve program could be carried out. Some in the utility industry support the policy intentions of such a reserve, as already demonstrated by the industry's own spare HV transformer programs and planned expansion of those programs, but they believe stakeholders \"will be better served by allowing the industry to create the structure, cost responsibility and pricing for [transformer] sparing services as opposed to a top-down government solution.\" They believe federal assistance would be most helpful if limited to funding the startup of a transformer reserve program administered by the asset owners themselves. The Grid Assurance sparing service appears consistent with a private sector-driven approach to expand existing spare transformer initiatives. ", "Others have questioned the cost-effectiveness of a new national HV transformer reserve program, asserting that\u2014had it been in place\u2014the reserve program envisioned by H.R. 2244 would not have been called upon by any grid incident over the last ten years. As Congress considers any plans for a federally administered strategic transformer reserve, it may consider the relationship of such a program to ongoing industry efforts to maintain HV transformer spares, the relationship between federal and state administrators of such a program, its cost-effectiveness, and its practical requirements (e.g., size, location, and transportation)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electric Grid Resilience", "paragraphs": ["In addition to measures focused on the protection of critical HV transformers from physical attack, analysts have advocated policies to reduce the criticality of individual HV assets by enhancing the overall \"resiliency\" of the electric power grid.

Although most attention is placed on best practices for hardening, resilience strategies must also consider options to improve grid flexibility and control. Resilience includes reconstitution and general readiness such as pole maintenance, vegetation management, use of mobile transformers and substations, and participation in mutual assistance groups.", "A number of federal, state, and industry initiatives exist to address various aspects of electric power grid resiliency. While many of these initiatives have been motivated by weather-related events such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003 and electric grid failure during Superstorm Sandy, policies to improve grid resilience also have benefits in the context of intentional physical attacks. For example, an official from PJM has reportedly stated, ", "You can only harden a substation so much. If someone wants to attack a substation, they will.... That leads us to the resilience piece. Maybe the best way to make a substation less critical is to build more transmission. A substation is critical basically because we're pushing too much power through it.", "Grid scale energy storage, distributed generation, smart grid technology, and other measures to redistribute or optimize transmission system power flows may also increase grid resiliency and reduce vulnerability to physical security threats.", "The Enhanced Grid Security Act of 2015 ( S. 1241 ) would require the Secretary of Energy develop an advanced energy security program to increase the \"functional preservation\" of the electric grid in the face of both natural and human-made threats and hazards (\u00a77(b)). The objectives of the program would explicitly include both \"security and resiliency\" through vulnerability assessment, modeling, exercises, research, and technical assistance (\u00a77(c)). The Grid Modernization Act of 2015 ( S. 1243 ) would likewise encourage greater grid resilience, including modelling, research, and investment in grid modernization and new technologies\u2014including tools to increase physical security (\u00a7101(3)(E)). Other legislation related to power grid resilience or efficiency would also likely have physical security implications. As Congress continues its examination of physical security policy, maintaining an integrated perspective on prevention, recovery, and resilience may help to promote an effective balance among industry investment, regulatory requirements, and federal oversight."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
