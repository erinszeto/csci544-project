H.R. 2603 (Thomas) and S. 643 (Baucus) were reported out of the House Ways and Meansand Senate Finance Committees on July 26. H.R. 2603 was passed in the House, bya voice vote, on July 31, and in the Senate by a voice vote on September 24. It became law as P.L.107-43 on September 28, 2001.", "In the past, Congress has shown an interest in developing free trade relations between the United States and select Middle East countries. In 1985, Congress approved the U.S.-Israel FTA andamended it in 1996 to include the West Bank and Gaza Strip as well as qualifying industrial zones(QIZs) between Israel and Jordan, and Israel and Egypt. Since 1994, when Jordan and Israel signeda peace treaty, Congress and the Clinton Administration also undertook several initiatives designedto assist the Jordanian economy. These initiatives included increased levels of foreign assistance,debt forgiveness, and the QIZ program.", "In addition to covering traditional reductions in barriers to trade in goods and services, the FTA also deals with other issues that became part of the U.S. trade policy agenda during the ClintonAdministration such as intellectual property rights (IPRs), e-commerce, and labor and environmentalstandards. The inclusion of labor and environmental standards within the text of the FTA hasprovoked disagreement between those with differing visions of what should be included in futureU.S. FTAs.", "The volume of bilateral trade between the United States and Jordan throughout the 1990s was consistently modest. Many top Jordanian exports to the United States already enter the United Statesduty-free through various programs, and cereals- the top U.S. export to Jordan-already face low orzero-level tariff rates. Therefore, a free trade agreement is unlikely to have an immediate anddramatic impact on the volume of bilateral trade. However, Jordanian exports of textiles and apparelto the United States, as well as U.S. exports to Jordan of various commodities that face moderatelyhigh Jordanian tariffs, could expand under an FTA.", "In addition to a modest increase in the bilateral trade of goods, a U.S.-Jordan FTA could have several economic and political implications. These include the possibility of increased levels oftrade in services, greater foreign direct investment (FDI) to Jordan both from U.S. and foreign-basedcompanies, and reinforced momentum for further economic reform in Jordan. If approved byCongress and the Jordanian parliament, the U.S.-Jordan FTA will also mark the first U.S. free tradeagreement with an independent Arab country, thereby reflecting the strength of U.S.-Jordanianbilateral relations and the importance that the United States attaches to these relations."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["On June 6, 2000, President Bill Clinton and King 'Abdullah II announced that the United Statesand Jordan would begin negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), (1) eventually leadingto reciprocal duty-free trade in goods.

Congress began its approval process of the FTA on April 29, 1985 when the UnitedStates-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act (H.R. 2268) was introduced in theHouse. The House passed the bill unanimously on May 7, 1985 and the Senate passed it withoutamendment on May 23, 1985. President Reagan signed the bill into law ( P.L. 99-47 ) on June 11,1985. U.S.-Israeli bilateral trade has increased substantially since the conclusion of the FTA. Whenthe agreement was signed in 1985, total U.S.-Israeli bilateral trade amounted to $4.7 billion. Sincethen, the volume of bilateral trade has increased steadily, reaching more than $20.7 billion in 2000,representing more than a four-fold increase in total bilateral trade.

(6) This legislation expanded the geographicscope of the U.S.-Israel FTA in two ways. First, it extended the FTA to cover goods produced ormanufactured in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. By providing Palestinian exporters with duty-freeaccess to the U.S. market, Congress hoped that such a 'peace dividend' would strengthen thePalestinian economy and thereby reinforce support for the peace process. The extension of theU.S.-Israel FTA to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has had a modest impact on direct Palestinianexports to the United States. In 1995, there were no such exports, but by 2000, the United Statesdirectly imported $4.8 million of Palestinian goods. (7) These figures might understate the actualamount of Palestinian exports to the United States in recent years because of Israel's continuing rolein heavily intermediating Palestinian trade with the rest of the world. In other words, somePalestinian goods may be exported indirectly to the United States via Israel, and therefore appear inU.S.-Israeli bilateral trade statistics.", "Second, P.L. 104-234 also granted the President additional proclamation authority to extend the U.S.-Israel FTA to cover products from qualifying industrial zones (QIZs) between Israel andJordan, and Israel and Egypt. QIZs are designed to further Arab-Israeli economic cooperation byproviding goods produced with certain levels of Israeli, Jordanian, Egyptian, or Palestinian contentduty-free access to the U.S. market.

Egypt has yet to express interest in participating in the QIZ program,probably because it entails a level of Arab-Israeli economic cooperation that Egypt would prefer toengage in only after the conclusion of a comprehensive regional peace.", "Although Egypt, for the time being, has decided not to participate in the QIZ program, some analysts have suggested Egypt as a potential candidate to be one of the United States' next free tradepartners. (8) Some Members of Congress haveexpressed interest in this idea as well. On August 4,2000, 26 Senators sent President Clinton a letter urging him to negotiate an FTA with Egypt thatwould form the basis for a Middle East Free Trade Region that would include Israel, the West Bankand Gaza Strip, Jordan, and Egypt. (9) On November1, 2000, 45 Representatives sent PresidentClinton a similar letter.

However, afterJordan and Israel signed the Washington Declaration, which terminated the state of belligerencybetween Jordan and Israel, on July 25, 1994, and a peace treaty on October 26, 1994, (10) Congress andthe Clinton Administration took a number of initiatives intended to benefit the Jordanian economy. These steps have included increasing the level of bilateral economic and military assistanceprovided to Jordan, forgiving Jordan's debt to the United States, and establishing qualifyingindustrial zones (QIZs) in Jordan and Israel. The primary Congressional motivation behindattempting to improve the Jordanian economy has been to provide Jordan with a 'peace dividend'-aneconomic reward designed to demonstrate the benefits of peace to a Jordanian population that hassometimes criticized and protested its government's pace and depth of normalization of relationswith Israel.", "In recent years, one of the most visible aspects of Congressional interest in the Jordanian economy has been in the realms of foreign assistance and debt forgiveness. In the wake of theWashington Declaration, President Clinton promised King Hussein that he would work towardsforgiving Jordan's debt to the United States. Congress responded with subsidy appropriationsmainly in FY1994 and FY1995 that forgave the equivalent of roughly $700 million of Jordanian debtto the United States. Beginning in FY1996, Congress agreed to increase first military and theneconomic assistance to Jordan. In FY1999 and FY2000, at the request of the ClintonAdministration, Congress also earmarked $300 million for Jordan in its supplemental appropriationsfor funding the 1998 Israeli-Palestinian Wye River Memorandum. Congress provided Jordan withWye River funds in gratitude for King Hussein's prominent role in mediating the agreement and tohelp Jordan withstand internal and regional opposition to its supportive role.

Some FY2000 Wye River appropriations might not be obligated until FY2001 or FY2002. ", "Apart from foreign assistance and debt forgiveness, Congress has also promoted jointJordanian-Israeli economic ventures through the Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) program. In1996, Congress adopted this program as an amendment to the United States-Israel Free Trade AreaImplementation Act of 1985 (H.R. 3074) and President Clinton signed the bill into law( P.L. 104-234 ) in October 1996. Under this legislation, products with a certified minimum contentof Jordanian and Israeli inputs that are manufactured in specially designated qualifying industrialzones are eligible for unilateral duty-free access to the U.S. market. To date, the United States TradeRepresentative (USTR) has designated ten QIZs in Jordan, which have had a modestly successfuleffect in boosting Jordanian exports to the United States, spurring Jordanian-Israeli businesspartnerships, promoting job creation in Jordan, and encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) inJordan.

Toward thisend, between March and May 2000, over 45 Members of Congress sent President Clinton letters (12) urging him to enter into negotiations for an FTA with Jordan as soon as possible. In these letters,Members provided several interrelated rationales for supporting a U.S.-Jordan FTA: 1) it wouldstrengthen bilateral relations and express the United States' appreciation for Jordan's role infurthering the Middle East peace process and actively cooperating in international counter-terrorismactivities; 2) it would promote economic growth in Jordan and regional economic cooperation,thereby enhancing stability and security in Jordan and the Middle East; and 3) it would assist infurther promoting economic reform and liberalization in Jordan.", "About a month after formal U.S.-Jordanian negotiations on the FTA began, on July 17, 2000, a bipartisan group of 41 Senators sent President Clinton a letter urging his Administration to\"promptly conclude negotiations\" so that the Senate could consider and pass the FTA during the106th Congress.

The Clinton Administration viewed the FTAas a potential catalyst to sustained economic growth in Jordan, providing its people with along-awaited 'peace dividend,' which in turn would reinforce support for the peace process. ThenUnited States Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky recently stressed the link betweeneconomic growth and regional peace, stating that the FTA \"can be a step toward the creation of afuture Middle East which is peaceful, prosperous, and open to the world; whose nations worktogether for the common good; and whose people have hope and opportunity.\" (15)", "As noted above, President Clinton and King 'Abdullah agreed to begin negotiations on an FTA on June 6, 2000. Shortly thereafter, on June 15, the United States Trade Representative (USTR)gave official notice of the United States' intent to conclude an FTA with Jordan.

Consequently, USITC initiated investigation No.332-418, entitled \"Economic Impact on the United States of a U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement.\" (17) The economic impact study was completed and submitted to the USTR on July 31, 2000, and wasdeclassified and released to the public on September 26, 2000.

By running partial equilibrium analyses, in which tariffs levels werehypothetically reduced to zero and all other factors influencing levels of trade flows were heldconstant, USITC concluded that had zero-level tariffs been in place in 1998, U.S. exports to Jordanwould have increased in three sectors. Under this model, U.S. exports of cereals (other than wheat)would have increased by 14% (or $2.9 million); U.S. exports of electrical machinery would haveincreased by 104% (or $22 million); and U.S. exports of machinery and transportation equipmentwould have increased by 39% (or $48 million). USITC also predicted that the FTA \"will likely leadto an increase in U.S. imports of textiles and apparel from Jordan.\" However, USITC did not runa partial equilibrium analysis for this Jordanian export sector, and therefore, was unable to quantifythe potential increase. Though USITC concluded that the overall impact of the FTA on the U.S.economy will be negligible, it did infer that the FTA could occasion a modest increase in bilateraltrade.", "The Office of the USTR, through the Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), is also conducting an environmental impact study of the U.S.-Jordan FTA. This environmental review responds to anew U.S. commitment to \"factor environmental considerations into the development of its tradenegotiating objectives,\" embodied in Executive Order 13141, issued by President Clinton onNovember 16, 1999. (19) Some view this ExecutiveOrder as the Clinton Administration's responseto criticisms of the environmental effects of United States trade policy expressed before and duringthe November 1999 Seattle Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks. (Coincidentally,violent confrontations between the police and protesters in Seattle curtailed the agenda of the WTOtalks, forcing Jordan's accession to the WTO to be deferred until April 2000.

Manufacturers, importers, andmarketers of textile and apparel products accounted for the plurality of public comments receivedby the USTR (six of seventeen public comments filed on the economic aspects of the FTA primarilydealt with textiles and apparel, while another one secondarily dealt with these sectors as well). Theinterest that U.S. textile and apparel companies have shown in the U.S.-Jordan FTA is unsurprisingsince these sectors could prove to be the largest potential area of growth for Jordanian exports to theUnited States under an FTA.", "Some of these textile manufacturers, such as BCTC Corporation and certain members of the American Apparel Manufacturing Association (AAMA), have recently invested in Jordan'squalifying industrial zones (QIZs) and therefore have an interest in expanding Jordanian textile andapparel access to the U.S. market. Those supportive of greater Jordanian textile and apparel accessto the U.S. market tended to urge the USTR to adopt the U.S.-Israel FTA 'rules-of-origin' in theU.S.-Jordan FTA. The 'rules-of-origin' clauses in the U.S.-Israel FTA allow Israeli exports toqualify for duty-free access to the United States if Israel added at least 35% (of which up to 15% canbe from the United States) to the value of the product.", "Those who fear that greater Jordanian textile and apparel access to the U.S. market could harm textile and apparel manufacturers and workers within the United States, such as the American TextileManufactures Institute (ATMI), urged the USTR to apply North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) 'rules-of-origin' standards to the U.S.-Jordan FTA. NAFTA 'rules-of-origin,' includingthose for textile and apparel, are stricter than those in the U.S.-Israel FTA, and if applied to theU.S.-Jordan FTA would probably result in a smaller growth potential for Jordanian exports oftextiles and apparel to the United States. (For further details on NAFTA 'rules-of-origin,' see CRSInfo Pack IP445N, NAFTA: The North American Free Trade Area , updated as needed.)", "Another topic that elicited multiple responses is the issue of protecting intellectual property rights (IPRs).

Other respondents who filedpublic comments either export to Jordan or import from Jordan particular commodities and urgedthe USTR to negotiate immediate zero-level tariffs for these commodities in the FTA.", "As noted above, USTR also received three public comments specifically relating to the environmental aspects of the U.S.-Jordan FTA.

On the positive side, theFTA could lead to expanded agricultural imports to Jordan, which would decrease the demand forwater for agricultural purposes and lessen the strain on this depletable resource. On the negativeside, increased trade is likely to lead to greater amounts of solid wastes, which could prove to beproblematic, especially in the Jordanian mineral and natural resources sectors. Also, increased tradewould likely increase maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aqaba, posing risks to the fragile ecosystem ofthe Red Sea, famed for its coral reefs.

The FTA contains safeguard measures to ensure that if the implementation of the agreement leads to \"a substantialcause of serious injury, or threat thereof\" to a domestic industry, either country may temporarilysuspend further tariffs reductions on the affected goods. If either country decides to implement asafeguard measure, its duration cannot exceed 4 years or the 10-year transitional period, and nomeasure shall be maintained \"except to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to preventor remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment.\" (Article 10.2.(a)(i)) The FTA also recognizesthe special challenges faced by \"infant industries\" during a period of trade liberalization and thattherefore neither country should create obstacles to \"infant industries\" that seek the imposition ofsafeguard measures.

The FTA establishes a Joint Committee whose functions include reviewing the general functioning of the agreement; improvingtrade relations; avoiding and settling disputes; amending the agreement; developing guidelines,explanatory material, and rules on the implementation of the agreement; and reviewing theenvironmental impact studies conducted by both countries. The Joint Committee will be headed bythe USTR and by \"Jordan's Minister primarily responsible for international trade\" and will make alldecisions by consensus. The committee will consider \"the views of interested members of the publicin order to draw upon a broad range of perspectives in the implementation of this Agreement\" and\"seek the advice\" of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).", "Dispute Settlement. The FTA sets out a multi-step procedure for dispute settlement. First, the United States and Jordan \"shall make everyattempt to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution through consultations\" if a dispute arises. If theParties do not resolve the dispute within 60 days through consultations, either Party has the right torefer the dispute to the Joint Committee. If the Joint Committee does not solve the dispute within90 days, the dispute may be referred to a specially appointed three-person dispute settlement panel. The dispute settlement panel is authorized to make non-binding recommendations to resolve thedispute. After the dispute settlement panel issues its recommendations within 90 days, the JointCommittee \"shall endeavor to resolve the dispute, taking the report into account.\" If the JointCommittee stills fails to resolve the dispute within 30 days, then \"the affected Party shall be entitledto take any appropriate and commensurate measure.\" The United States and Jordan also signed aMemorandum of Understanding on Transparency in Dispute Settlement, obligating the Parties to\"solicit and consider the views of members of their respective publics in order to draw upon a broadrange of perspectives.\" According this memorandum, if a dispute panel is established, anysubmission made to it shall be made available publicly; oral presentations before the panel shall beopen to members of the public; the panel shall \"accept and consider\" amicus curiae submissions byindividuals, legal persons, and NGOs; and the panel shall release its report to the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Effects of the U.S.-Jordan FTA", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade in Goods", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the 1990s, bilateral trade between the United States and Jordan was modest.

Exports of durum wheat, wheat and meslin, and barley totaled $62 million and accounted for about 20% of totalU.S. exports to Jordan.

Food prices have tended to be avolatile domestic political issue in Jordan since the government began to lower food subsidies in the context of its structural adjustment reform program.

Excluding mineraland petrochemical production, textiles and apparels were Jordan's second leading worldwideindustrial export (roughly $50 million) in 1994.
