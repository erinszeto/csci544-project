Covered entities would need permits (called allowances) to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and unused allowances could be banked for future use or sold. The number of allowances issued each year would be gradually reduced until greenhouse gas emissions from covered entities were cut 83% below 2005 levels in 2050.", "To address concerns that greenhouse gas controls could place U.S. manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage, the draft bill authorizes compensation to certain industrial sectors.

A state could meet up to one-fifth of that requirement with energy efficiency measures. Deployment of \"smart grid\" technologies would be encouraged, as would technologies to capture and sequester carbon emissions.
