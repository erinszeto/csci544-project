The alternative policies are meant to increase the cost-effectiveness of assisted housing programs, promote the self-sufficiency of assisted families, and increase housing choices for low-income families.", "The more than 30 PHAs currently participating in the demonstration have adopted a wide range of new policies that would not have been possible under the traditional rules governing assisted housing programs. Participating PHAs have merged their various federal funding streams and used their merged, \"block grant\" funding to undertake new activities, including supportive services for residents, development of new affordable housing, and the restructuring of traditional public housing. MTW PHAs have also changed their rent policies in ways that may raise rents for some tenants, but may also improve incentives for families to increase earnings. Some PHAs have adopted policies that place new conditions on assistance, such as time limits and work requirements. And PHAs have undertaken changes to streamline administration of the program, such as modifying their quality inspection procedures.", "The way the demonstration program was designed\u2014allowing for a wide variety of activities\u2014and issues with data collection have meant that no systematic evaluation of the outcome of the policies adopted by MTW agencies has been undertaken.

The MTW demonstration was initially intended to serve as a testing ground for innovations in the provision of assisted housing; some have contended that it should be restructured to better serve that purpose. Others believe that MTW agencies have demonstrated that PHAs can successfully operate outside of the traditional regulatory structure, and thus some version of the program should be considered as the future of assisted housing.", "Despite the controversy around the future of the MTW demonstration program itself, the policies developed by MTW agencies have informed discussions about reforms to the mainstream assisted housing programs.

The authorizing language directs the Secretary of HUD to conduct a demonstration program providing PHAs with the flexibility to design and test approaches for providing housing assistance to low-income families outside of the rules that govern HUD's primary assisted housing programs: the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program and the low-rent public housing program. The intent is to test ways to achieve three policy objectives:", "1. reducing costs and increasing cost-effectiveness in the provision of assisted housing, 2. encouraging the self-sufficiency of assisted families, and 3. increasing the housing choices for low-income families.", "The law directs the Secretary to select up to 30 PHAs for participation through a competitive process, and to conduct detailed evaluations for up to 15 participating agencies in order to identify replicable program models. ", "Legislative guidelines for the MTW demonstration program are broad. The law does not specify the approaches to assisted housing that MTW agencies are to develop and test. Instead, the law allows MTW agencies to develop their own policies to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Examples of the flexibilities provided under the law include allowing PHAs to combine their Section 8 voucher funding with public housing operating and capital funding, creating one funding stream for housing assistance and development, and allowing HUD to waive many of the statutory requirements for assisted housing programs as established by the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as amended. The law explicitly permits PHAs to design a \"reasonable\" rent policy, designed to encourage employment and self-sufficiency by participating families. Further, the law directs that participating PHAs be held harmless in terms of funding.", "However, the legislation also places limits on the flexibility allowed to MTW agencies. MTW agencies are required to", "serve substantially the same number and size-mix of families, guarantee that at least 75% of assisted families are low-income, and ensure that their assisted housing stock meets HUD-established housing quality standards.", "Further, the law prohibits HUD from issuing waivers of certain provisions of the U.S. Housing Act, including requirements related to public housing demolition and disposition, labor standards, and public housing community service requirements. ", "The legislation also requires that PHAs seek public input in the development of their MTW policies. The law requires a PHA to hold a public hearing on its proposed policies prior to submitting an application to become an MTW agency. The PHA must then take into account the public comments within its MTW application plan. That plan must spell out how the PHA intends to use its flexibilities under the MTW program. It must be approved by HUD in order for a PHA to participate in the MTW demonstration program and HUD must monitor MTW agencies' compliance with their plans. The law goes on to require that MTW agencies submit annual reports to HUD that describe their use of funds, activities during the prior year, and any data required by the Secretary of HUD to assess the demonstration program. ", "Thus, the statutory authorization for the MTW demonstration program allows MTW agencies to implement a diverse set of policies and activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Policy Context", "paragraphs": ["To understand the structure of the MTW demonstration program, it is useful to understand the policy context that shaped its development. ", "The administration of public housing was a controversial issue during the 1980s and 1990s, due to concerns about rising costs, a decaying public housing stock, and a perception that public housing developments were pervaded with social ills. Federal policymakers at the time, therefore, took interest in strategies that could reduce the cost of public housing while also improving its management. Major public and assisted housing reforms were debated throughout this period.", "Several policy debates influenced the consideration of public housing reform and the resulting development of the MTW demonstration program. First, at the time, the concept of \"block granting\" was being explored in many social programs. Housing practitioners and some federal policymakers wanted to explore the possibility of block granting or otherwise devolving assisted housing programs to the local level so that local officials would have greater autonomy to design programs and target funding to meet local community needs. This strategy was not universally supported, as some federal policymakers and tenant advocates believed that federal regulation of assisted housing programs was necessary to ensure the achievement of federal housing goals, such as desegregation. Second, the welfare reform debates of the 1990s focused the attention of federal policymakers on increasing family self-sufficiency across social welfare programs, including housing assistance programs. Third, federal policymakers and housing practitioners had increasingly come to believe that providing assisted housing through market-based approaches practiced by private industry would reduce assisted housing costs. The MTW demonstration program was a compromise that allowed for the pursuit of all of these varying policy goals while largely maintaining the existing models of assisted housing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Implementation and Growth", "paragraphs": ["HUD announced the demonstration program in December 1996 and received 43 applications for participation from PHAs. From that pool of applicants, HUD selected 30 PHAs for participation. The selected PHAs each entered into an individual negotiation process with various HUD offices to set the terms of their MTW agreements. That initial MTW negotiation process proved to be both complicated and lengthy as each statutory or regulatory waiver was individually approved. The first agreement was reached in February 1998 and the majority of MTW agreements were signed in 1998 or 1999. ", "Perhaps due to the delays in implementation, or perhaps due to the passage of a public and assisted housing reform law in 1998 that provided all PHAs increased flexibility in the administration of assisted housing programs (such as in selecting tenants), six of the selected MTW agencies opted not to participate in the program. In 2000, HUD competitively allocated the remaining six open spaces to housing authorities with more than 2,500 units (see Table 1 ).", "Additional PHAs have become MTW agencies through acts of Congress and the program has grown beyond the original statutory cap of 30 PHAs (see Table 1 ). Congress specifically directed HUD to add the following PHAs to the MTW demonstration: Charlotte and Pittsburgh through P.L. 105-276 ; and Alaska, San Bernardino, CA, San Jose, CA, and Santa Clara, CA, through P.L. 110-161 . Congress directed HUD to competitively select another three PHAs for participation in MTW through P.L. 111-8 and another three each through P.L. 111-117 and P.L. 112-10 ; all nine of these competitive slots were only available to high-performing PHAs with fewer than 5,000 assisted housing units, and three of the six competitive slots were open only to HOPE VI sites. ", "Several MTW agencies completed their participation in the demonstration program and chose not to renew their agreements. As a result, 35 PHAs are currently participating in the MTW demonstration program (see Table 1 ). HUD recently selected another four agencies to participate in MTW, although they had not yet finalized agreements with HUD at the time this report was last updated. ", "The MTW authorizing language granted HUD broad discretion in administering the demonstration program and there have been criticisms of HUD's implementation. First, some PHAs were selected for participation despite prior poor performance. Second, the design of the program's structure was not uniform, so MTW agencies implemented a variety of policies under a variety of agreements, making it difficult to compare across agencies. Third, HUD's data systems did not allow for variations in PHA income and rent policies and thus could not accommodate data collection from MTW PHAs. As a result, HUD was unable to collect information on tenant characteristics in the early years of the demonstration, which would be necessary to fully evaluate the effects of MTW policies on tenant outcomes and assisted housing program costs. As a result of both data collection issues and the program's design, HUD has not been able to measure and compare the results of different MTW policies. While HUD has issued or contracted for several reports about MTW, these evaluations are largely process-oriented and limited to descriptions of policies adopted by PHAs. HUD was criticized by its Inspector General for insufficient monitoring of the demonstration's implementation, and in April 2012 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report recommending HUD undertake additional steps to improve its monitoring and oversight of the program. ", "Partly in response to these critiques, HUD executed a standard MTW agreement with each participating agency in 2008. The standard agreement introduced uniform language for the MTW agreements and normalized reporting requirements, but still allowed MTW agencies flexibility to develop their own local policies. The standard MTW agreements extended MTW agencies' participation in the demonstration program until 2018. HUD has stated it believes that the introduction of the standard agreement and the extension of the MTW demonstration program will allow for more systematic evaluation of MTW agencies' policies in the future. However, the standard agreement does not require the standardization of performance data, which limits HUD's ability to evaluate specific policies implemented by MTW agencies. In 2008, HUD also began to collect data on tenant characteristics, which might allow for some evaluation of MTW policies in terms of tenant outcomes and the cost of assisted housing.", "According to the 2012 GAO review, HUD has recently increased its efforts to monitor MTW agencies' compliance with the program's statutory purposes and requirements. For example, many of the terms in the MTW statute are undefined, including \"self-sufficiency,\" \"housing choice,\" and \"comparable mix of families.\" HUD has announced plans to require MTW agencies to create their own, or to adopt HUD's, definitions of \"self-sufficiency\" and \"housing choice,\" and plans to provide MTW agencies with a template to collect data on what constitutes a \"comparable mix of families.\" In addition, in 2011 HUD undertook an assessment of whether MTW agencies met two of the statutory requirements of the program: (1) that 75% of individuals served are low-income; and (2) that substantially the same number of families are served. In that review, HUD found that 91% of individuals served by MTW agencies were low-income and that all but one MTW agency served substantially the same number of families (defined by HUD as at least 95% of the number of families served by the PHA before it entered the MTW demonstration program). The GAO report concluded that HUD's recent initiatives were moving in the right direction in terms of ensuring MTW agencies' compliance with statutory requirements, but it also concluded that without standard definitions and a systematic process, HUD cannot effectively evaluate whether MTW agencies are in full compliance with the statute. ", "A HUD IG report issued in September 2013 also noted that while HUD has taken some steps to improve its oversight of the MTW program, the department was still unable to ensure agencies' compliance with statutory requirements, among other issues. The IG report thus recommended HUD add no additional MTW agencies, or delay adding additional MTW agencies, until its administration of the program improved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Policies Implemented by MTW Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As stated previously, MTW agencies have adopted a wide range of program activities.

", "The following section describes three policy areas in which MTW agencies have discretion and provides some examples of the policies that MTW agencies have developed in these areas. The three areas discussed are (1) the merging of assisted housing program funding streams and development activities; (2) the level of assistance provided to program participants and conditions of assistance; and (3) other administrative flexibilities.

This form of \"block grant\" assistance departs from traditional program operations, in which each assisted housing program has a dedicated funding stream and there are few allowances for the use of funds across programs. For instance, under the non-merged funding structure, Section 8 voucher funding can only be used for landlord payments; voucher funding cannot be used to fund the PHA's administration of the program (they receive separate administrative fees for this purpose), the PHA's public housing program, or its other low-income housing development plans. In another departure from the traditional funding structure, the amount of MTW block grant assistance a PHA receives is not determined through traditional programmatic formulas but rather through the negotiation of the MTW agreement.", "At the outset of the demonstration program, only six MTW agencies elected to receive merged assistance funding, but currently the majority of MTW PHAs receive merged funding. A 2004 report showed that MTW agencies used this area of discretion in a limited fashion during the early years of the program. In general, MTW agencies used the merged funding flexibility to smooth financial shortfalls in particular programs and for cross-programmatic purposes that may have been approved by HUD in the absence of the MTW discretion. Although MTW agencies appeared to use the funding flexibility for uses that were available absent merged funding, in interviews officials at MTW agencies stated that they believed that the funding flexibility provided by MTW created a level of autonomy from regulatory processes that encouraged alternative uses of funds. For instance, some MTW agencies developed additional support services for tenants to increase self-sufficiency\u2014these programs might have been possible under the traditional funding structure, but MTW agencies felt that they would not have undertaken them without funding flexibility.

Some MTW agencies have undertaken ambitious development activities, including the conversion of their public housing stocks to new forms of assistance. For example, two of the largest MTW agencies, the Chicago Housing Authority and the Atlanta Housing Authority, have used their MTW flexibility to undertake significant redevelopment of their public housing stock. The Chicago Housing Authority used its merged funding stream to attract private investment to its \"Plan for Transformation,\" in which the PHA has replaced large parts of its deteriorating public housing stock with new developments\u2014many of which are in mixed-income communities. When testifying before Congress, an official from the Chicago Housing Authority stated that the fixed 10-year merged MTW funding stream was key in obtaining financing for its transformation plan from private investors.

Similarly, Atlanta used its merged funding stream to finance the replacement of its distressed public housing stock.", "Other MTW agencies, such as the Keene Housing Authority and the Housing Authorities of the County of Santa Clara and the City of San Jose, have used the flexibility in their funding to convert public housing to project-based voucher developments, which is generally not possible under standard program rules (see discussion in next section and \" Sample Policy: Keene Housing Authority (NH) and Project-Based Assistance \" text box).

The law that authorizes the voucher program limits project-basing such that PHAs may project-base only up to 20% of their tenant-based vouchers and cannot project-base more than 25% of the units in any private building, or project-base any units in a building receiving federal assisted housing funds (e.g., public housing units).

In 2011, HUD issued guidance stating that, under the terms of the authorizing statute, MTW agencies must determine if families are income eligible for housing assistance based on the statutory income calculation; it is unclear when and how MTW agencies with approved alternative income calculations will become compliant with the new guidance. Although MTW agencies will no longer be granted the discretion to use an alternative income calculation, they continue to have the discretion to implement alternative rent structures.

Whether the implementation of the MTW demonstration program has positively or negatively affected assisted housing tenants has not been thoroughly studied and is thus unclear.", "HUD has suggested that MTW has permitted participating PHAs to provide a greater number of assisted housing units than they would have been able to provide under the traditional assistance programs. This would mean that the MTW program has provided a benefit to low-income individuals more broadly. However, the ability of MTW agencies to assist a greater number of families may be a result of agencies reducing the amount of assistance provided to current recipients, rather than a result of savings from administrative streamlining. For example, some PHAs have implemented policies that reduce the amount of rental assistance that an individual tenant receives (e.g., requiring tenants to pay rent above the affordability standard of 30% of tenant income). ", "Similarly, while the self-sufficiency policies and programs implemented by MTW agencies could potentially benefit some low-income individuals over the long term by facilitating increases in family income, it is unclear if time limit and work requirement policies have resulted in needy families losing access to assistance. Finally, there have been reports that MTW agencies have reduced tenants' access to portability (the ability to move from one PHA's jurisdiction to another's using the same voucher), which would limit tenants' housing choices. Further research would be required to know the net benefit of MTW discretion to low-income individuals receiving or waiting to receive assistance.", "In addition, the MTW demonstration program has facilitated the large-scale demolition of public housing in some communities, significantly affecting the lives of the tenants in those developments. Although MTW agencies are subject to the same rules and procedures for the demolition and disposition of public housing as non-MTW PHAs, the flexibility of being an MTW agency may make the demolition and disposition of an agency's public housing stock more feasible. As noted earlier, the Atlanta and Chicago PHAs are two MTW agencies that have demolished the majority of their public housing stock, replacing some of the lost stock with vouchers and mixed-income developments.", "PHAs pursuing this strategy contend that the replacement housing is of better quality than the demolished public housing and provides more opportunities for residents. Tenant advocates have objected to this type of large-scale displacement of public housing residents; they argue that the relocations destroy communities and employment networks and make social services less accessible.", "The primary research on the effects on tenants of the demolition and disposition of public housing has looked at the results of the HOPE VI public housing revitalization program. HOPE VI has funded the demolition or redevelopment of severely distressed public housing, including public housing owned by MTW agencies. Research conducted by the Urban Institute on the outcomes of HOPE VI has shown mostly positive results for tenants. Tenants who were displaced from severely distressed public housing appear to now live in lower-poverty neighborhoods with improved health outcomes. However, research has also found that some tenants who are considered to be particularly vulnerable (such as very large families, families with disabled members, and families with multiple barriers to self-sufficiency) have not seen the same levels of benefit from public housing revitalization and may require additional services.

The fact that most participating PHAs have chosen to renew their participation and more PHAs wish to participate than there are advertised slots is evidence of the popularity of the program among assisted housing practitioners. Congress has exhibited some support for the program by taking action to expand the number of agencies participating. Further, HUD officials have suggested that they believe MTW agencies are more cost-effective in their administration of assisted housing.", "However, this belief that MTW has been successful at improving cost effectiveness and efficiency is not universally held. Some low-income housing advocates have argued that MTW agencies administer assisted housing at a higher cost than non-MTW agencies. Some advocates have also suggested that, in a limited funding environment, the negotiated funding MTW agencies receive negatively affects the funding of other PHAs. While MTW agencies' funding levels are subject to the same across-the-board decreases in funding that apply to non-MTW agencies, it is unclear how MTW agencies' funding levels would have fared if they were subject to the standard funding formulas instead of their negotiated agreements.", "Supporters of MTW have claimed that the increased discretion afforded to MTW agencies decreases administrative burdens without increasing oversight risk. In the traditional structure of assisted housing programs, PHAs are held accountable through a regulatory structure that monitors if PHAs have delivered assisted housing according to the rules of the specific programs. As a result, PHAs are evaluated based on their ability to follow processes rather than the outcomes of their activities. A traditional regulatory oversight model may be perceived as a necessary tool to guard against waste, fraud, and abuse. ", "MTW agencies are not subject to this form of regulatory accountability, and instead define their own outcome goals and then self-report their effectiveness in meeting these goals to HUD through their annual MTW reports. Supporters of the MTW program argue that this structure allows MTW agencies to pursue innovative strategies and focus on program outcomes and long-term planning.

Other proposals have called for continuation of the program, with perhaps a limited expansion, but with changes designed to address concerns raised by tenant-advocates and to allow for a stronger evaluation component.

HUD has also stressed the importance of selecting high-performing agencies that have the capacity to take part in a rigorous evaluation.

The MTW compromise allowed for the creation of a new, block grant-like housing program for a small number of PHAs, and the maintenance of the existing programs for most PHAs. Over time, more PHAs have been added to MTW than originally envisioned and many additional PHAs wish to receive MTW status.", "The desirability of MTW for PHAs has led to calls to expand and make MTW a permanent program.

For example, in 2004 the Bush Administration proposed the Housing Assistance for Needy Families program, which was modeled on MTW and would have converted housing assistance into a block grant, allowing PHAs many of the same flexibilities provided under MTW. That proposal did not receive wide support. PHA industry groups raised concerns that a block grant funding model could lead to funding reductions down the road, as has been seen with other HUD block grant programs. Tenant advocates raised concerns that deregulation would mean that they would lose protection in the law against policies that would raise tenants' rents and subject them to conditions of assistance they felt would be unreasonable. A differently structured block grant proposal could garner wider support, although some of the same concerns raised in 2004 could be raised again.", "In addition, HUD has expressed concern about the capacity of some agencies entering the MTW demonstration program. As previously mentioned, some of the PHAs admitted to the current program were considered poor performers prior to entering. HUD argues that high performers are more likely to succeed because they have proven their ability to meet reporting requirements and thus will be able to report on their activities and outcomes as required in the MTW demonstration program. HUD has also recommended that PHAs be selected for the program based on evaluation capacity, previously demonstrated innovation, and the level of local support.
