Bush signed S. 1, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-81), into law. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act (HLOGA) amended the Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 (P.L. 104-65, as amended) to provide, among other changes to federal law and House and Senate rules, additional and more frequent disclosures of lobbying contacts and activities. This report explains the role of the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the Senate in implementing lobbying registration and disclosure requirements and summarizes the guidance documents they have jointly issued.", "Under the HLOGA and predecessor lobbying laws, the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate manage the registration, filing, and the collection of documents submitted by the lobbyists and lobbying firms. Prior to the HLOGA, lobbyists were required to file paper documents with both the Clerk and the Secretary. These forms are now filed electronically and jointly with the Clerk and the Secretary. In addition, the Clerk and the Secretary are responsible for making documents publicly available and reporting incorrect or false filings to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.", "Beginning in December 2007, the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate issued joint guidance documents for HLOGA implementation. The guidance document identified eight substantive changes to the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act, and discussed how the Clerk and Secretary interpret and implement the HLOGA's provisions. In addition, the guidance document provided direction on successful completion of quarterly registration and disclosure documents, the new semi-annual reporting requirement, and interpretation of the Clerk and Secretary's role in referring non-compliance to the U.S. attorney.", "Since issuing an initial guidance document in 2007, the Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate, pursuant to 2 U.S.C. \u00a71605, have conducted periodic reviews of existing guidance and have issued multiple updates.

The initial provisions, which were contained in the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, required that lobbyists register with the House of Representatives and the Senate and dis close certain receipts and expenditures. In 1995, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which repealed the 1946 act and created a detailed system of reporting thresholds. In 1998, technical amendments to the 1995 law were passed. Finally, in 2007, Congress amended the 1995 act to further enhance disclosure and reporting requirements for lobbyists and lobbying firms.", "The Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) of 1995 provided specific thresholds and definitions of lobbyists, lobbying activities, and lobbying contacts, compared to the 1946 act. In reporting the LDA, the House Judiciary Committee summarized the need for new lobbying provisions:", "The Act is designed to strengthen public confidence in government by replacing the existing patchwork of lobbying disclosure laws with a single, uniform statute which covers the activities of all professional lobbyists. The Act streamlines disclosure requirements to ensure that meaningful information is provided and requires all professional lobbyists to register and file regular, semiannual reports identifying their clients, the issues on which they lobby, and the amount of their compensation. It also creates a more effective and equitable system for administering and enforcing the disclosure requirements.", "The technical amendments made to the LDA in 1998 clarified the definition of covered executive branch officials, more clearly defined what constitutes a lobbying contact, and provided that organizations, whose lobbying activities are limited by their Internal Revenue Code (IRC) non-profit status, could use their tax estimates to report lobbying activities. In reporting the 1998 technical amendments, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs explained the need for change:", "Once the LDA was implemented by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate, several minor problems with the language of the statute materialized. The offices of the Clerk and the Secretary have sought to interpret the LDA with respect to these problems in accordance with the original intent of the law, but it is necessary and appropriate to conform the language of the law to intent, and that is the motivation behind the introduction of S. 758 .", "The most recent amendments to the LDA, the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (HLOGA), mandated additional and more frequent disclosures.", "Pursuant to the 1946 act, the 1995 LDA, as amended by the 1998 act, and the HLOGA, the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate have had joint responsibility for implementing systems to register lobbyists. Under the 1946 act, individuals, groups, and organizations involved in lobbying activities were required to keep detailed financial records and to file financial statements with the Clerk. Lobbyists also were required to register before engaging in lobbying activities and file quarterly reports with the Clerk and the Secretary. The Clerk was then required to maintain these records for two years.", "The 1995 act, as amended, modified the responsibilities of the Clerk and the Secretary in registering lobbyists and collecting disclosure documents. In addition to collecting registration and disclosure documents from lobbyists the Clerk and the Secretary are required to", "1. provide guidance and assistance on the registration and reporting requirements of this Act and develop common standards, rules, and procedures for compliance with this Act; 2. review, and, where necessary, verify and inquire to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of registration and reports; 3. develop filing, coding, and cross-indexing systems to carry out the purpose of this Act, including\u2014 a. a publicly available list of all registered lobbyists, lobbying firms, and their clients; and b. computerized systems designed to minimize the burden of filing and maximize public access to materials filed under this Act; 4. make available for public inspection and copying at reasonable times the registrations and reports filed under this Act; 5. retain registrations for a period of at least 6 years after they are terminated and reports for a period of at least 6 years after they are filed; 6. compile and summarize, with respect to each semi-annual period, the information contained in registrations and reports filed with respect to such period in a clear and complete manner; 7. notify any lobbyist or lobbying firm in writing that may be in noncompliance with this Act; and 8. notify the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia that a lobbyist or lobbying firm may be in noncompliance with this Act, if the registrant has been notified in writing and has failed to provide an appropriate response within 60 days after notice was given under paragraph (7).", "The 2007 HLOGA further refined the role of the Clerk and the Secretary in collecting and reporting information on lobbyists under the LDA. The Clerk and the Secretary are required to electronically register lobbyists and collect quarterly and semi-annual reports; make registrations and filings available on the Internet; and review each registration and filing for accuracy, notify lobbyists of a misfiling, and refer appropriate cases to the U.S. attorney's office for the District of Columbia.
