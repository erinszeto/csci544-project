As the 112th Congress turns to the law's next reauthorization\u2014PDUFA V, CRS has prepared another report that describes current law and the PDUFA V proposal (legislative language and the performance goals Agreement between FDA and industry representatives). It also explores the impact of PDUFA on FDA application review time and the agency's Human Drugs Program budget, and issues that Congress is likely to discuss as it prepares for anticipated PDUFA V reauthorization.

The impetus behind the 1992 law stemmed from the length of time between a manufacturer's submission of an FDA New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) and the agency's decision on approval or licensure. FDA had attributed the delay, which affected patients and manufacturers, to constraints on its ability to hire and support review staff. Congress reauthorized the user fee program in 1997 (PDUFA II), in 2002 (PDUFA III), and, most recently, in 2007 (PDUFA IV), as Title I of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, P.L. 110-85).", "Congress intended PDUFA to diminish the backlog of applications at FDA and increasingly shorten the time from submission to decision. PDUFA II expanded the program's scope to include activities related to the investigational phases of a new drug's development, and to increase FDA communications with industry and consumer groups. PDUFA III again expanded the scope of authorized activities to include both preclinical development and a three-year postapproval period.", "In keeping with the law, FDA has worked with the drug manufacturers to set PDUFA performance goals, which the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has submitted in letters to the chairs of the relevant congressional authorizing committees. The Secretary also submits annual performance and financial reports.", "In crafting PDUFA IV, the most recent reauthorization, the 110th Congress addressed workload and compensation adjustments; expanded the authorized range of safety activities to include development of data collection systems and analytic tools, and enforcement of postapproval study, labeling, and risk evaluation and mitigation strategy requirements; increased public communication requirements; and authorized a user fee for the advisory review of prescription drug television ads.", "The general view is that PDUFA has succeeded. FDA has added review staff and reduced its review times. At each reauthorization, however, discussion returns to certain issues in the context of PDUFA that also reflect broader FDA concerns. These include budget choices under limited resources, including the relationship between direct appropriations and user fees; the identification and amelioration of conflicts of interest when the regulated industry is a major source of industry funding; and the tension between making new drugs available to the public and ensuring that those drugs be safe and effective."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["In September 2007, Congress reauthorized the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). This was the third five-year extension of the original 1992 law.

The law intends those fees to supplement direct appropriations not replace them. This most recent version of the user fee program, often referred to as PDUFA IV, retains the basic structure and elements of the original PDUFA.

All three felt it took far too long from the moment a manufacturer submitted a drug or biologics marketing application to the time FDA's reached its decision. In the late 1980s, that process took a median time of 29 months. Patients had to wait for access to the products. For some patients, a drug in review\u2014and therefore not available for sale\u2014could be the difference between life and death. Manufacturers, in turn, had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. At that time, FDA estimated that each one-month delay in a review's completion cost a manufacturer $10 million.", "FDA argued that it needed more scientists to review the drug applications that were coming in and the ones already backlogged in its files. It had not received sufficient appropriations to hire them. For decades FDA had asked Congress for permission to implement user fees; the pharmaceutical industry generally opposed them, believing the funds might go into the Treasury to reduce federal debt rather than help fund drug review.", "The 1992 law became possible when FDA and industry agreed on two steps: performance goals, setting target completion times for various review processes; and the promise that these fees would supplement\u2014rather than replace\u2014funding that Congress appropriated to FDA. Those steps helped persuade industry groups the fees would reduce review times\u2014and gave FDA the revenue source it had sought for over 20 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Prescription Drug User Fee Act and Its Reauthorizations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PDUFA I", "paragraphs": ["Congress first authorized FDA to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies in 1992 with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA, P.L. 102-571 ), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).

FDA has added review staff and now completes it reviews of NDA/BLA applications more quickly and runs less of a backlog. Median time from an NDA or BLA submission to FDA's approval decision was 29 months in 1987; for the first two years of PDUFA I, it fell to 17 months. In later years, FDA presented separate calculations for standard applications and priority applications. Table 1 shows median approval times for 1993 through 2006. In calendar year 2006, the median review times were 13.0 months for standard applications and 6.0 months for priority applications.", "FDA attributes shorter approval times to PDUFA-funded staff increases. PDUFA also funds FDA activities with sponsors before their official NDA or BLA submissions, resulting in increasingly more complete applications that require fewer extensive resubmissions.", "As a result of PDUFA, industry faces shorter and more predictable review times. It has treated the per-application fee\u2014about $100,000 FY1993 and over $1 million FY2008 \u2014as an acceptable cost relative to the estimated $10 million monthly cost of delay in the years immediately before PDUFA was enacted. Meanwhile, PDUFA has enabled consumers to have quicker access to new drugs.", "Such quicker access, however, has raised concerns. First, critics ask whether PDUFA's emphasis on speed results in inadequate review. Second, they ask whether the increase in industry funding might lead to undue industry influence. They are concerned that PDUFA, in the name of speed, might lead FDA to sacrifice safety and effectiveness.", "Many overlapping factors influence drug safety, most unrelated to the source of funding. Some safety problems cannot be identified before public marketing. In its consideration of PDUFA and in other plans for FDA, the Congress has discussed whether FDA has the authority and resources to identify and then act on problems during both the premarket and postmarket periods. It addressed these issues in FDAAA, both in the PDUFA title and a broader drug safety title."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect on FDA Resources", "paragraphs": ["The key to the shortening of review times is the influx of funds that PDUFA allows. This section first describes the extent of the collected fees and then discusses that revenue in the context of the budget for both the human drug program and FDA overall. What began as a program to fund new drug review has budget, management, and policy implications beyond that.", " Figure 1 and Figure 2 illustrate the resource (funding and personnel) history of the FDA Human Drugs program from FY1989 through FY2007. ( Table A-1 and Table A-2 in the Appendix provide detailed actual and inflation-adjusted budget figures, along with full-time equivalent positions, by funding source for selected fiscal years.) Beginning in FY1994, user fees have made up an increasing proportion of FDA's budget for human drug activities. While total funding has increased over the period, this has been entirely due to the increase in user fees. Congressional appropriations have remained essentially flat in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms.", "Indicating full-time equivalent (FTE) positions by funding source shows that the overall increase in personnel comes solely from the user fees first collected in FY1993 and that the overall increase in FTEs obscures a 19% decrease in FTEs funded by congressional appropriations from FY1992 to FY2007.", "The PDUFA triggers (described above), in particular, and the relative contributions of appropriations and user fees to FDA's budget for human drugs have implications for budget planning both within the human drugs activity area and in agency-level decisions across all activities.", "Balance between pre- and postapproval activities. Because PDUFA initially allowed FDA to use the fees on only pre-approval activities (the review of manufacturer applications to market drugs and biologics) and still directs a majority of fees to those tasks, it is widely asserted that PDUFA is responsible for what some observers view as an inappropriate budget imbalance between FDA's premarket drug review and its postmarket safety activities. They point out how PDUFA requirements\u2014the trigger requirements that congressional appropriations for FDA's review activities be maintained at least at 1992 levels\u2014and congressional budget trends\u2014increasing FDA responsibilities at relatively flat funding levels\u2014result in a squeezing out of non-PDUFA related programs. Faced with losing fee revenue if PDUFA-authorized activities decrease, FDA must prioritize its use of appropriated dollars to those activities. Critics say that non-PDUFA activities, such as the review of generic drug applications, therefore suffer.", "In part to address this concern, the Congress has, with each PDUFA reauthorization extended the scope of covered activities. The top and middle sections of Figure 3 illustrate the five stages of drug development, beginning with basic research and continuing through preclinical development (which could be research in the laboratory or with animals), clinical research (the Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials that involve people), and FDA review; and the related industry-FDA interactions. The bottom third displays the span of industry R&D activities over which the laws allowed PDUFA fees to cover FDA activities. The law authorized FDA to use PDUFA I fees to fund only those activities from NDA submission through the review decision; PDUFA II allowed FDA to use the funds for meetings with manufacturers during the clinical development stages, going, therefore, from the investigational new drug (IND) submission through review; and PDUFA III extended the time range at both ends, to include the pre-clinical development period and up to three years after marketing begins. PDUFA IV removes the three-year limit on postapproval activities. FDA may, therefore, use PDUFA funding for authorized activities throughout the life of a product.", "Industry influence. Some critics think that, through its provision of fees, the industry has too much influence over FDA actions. They believe that, by structuring industry participation into the setting of performance goals, the law creates conflicts of interest. This is compounded because, they say, the process of setting performance goals is not transparent.", "Until an amendment in PDUFA IV that requires consumer participation as well, the law directed FDA and manufacturers to meet, in preparation for each PDUFA reauthorization, to discuss workload and revenue needed. FDA then submitted a letter to the authorizing committees that presents performance goals for the following five years. The performance goals regarding review activities were structured to include a length of time (in months) and the percent of applications that would be completed in that time. The industry participation in goal negotiation and the focus on review time created what some see as actual or the appearance of industry influence on the management of FDA resources. At the least, those speculations could threaten confidence in FDA reviews. At the worst are the concerns of some that the fee system contributes to quick and suboptimal reviews. FDA staff reports of pressure to meet performance goal deadlines suggest to some that safety and effectiveness data are being inadequately evaluated.", "Interaction with congressional appropriations decisions. As previously noted, user fees are an increasing part of FDA's budget. In FY2008, user fees contribute 24.2% of FDA budget. Looking only at the agency's Human Drug Program (basically that is the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and related activities of the Office of Regulatory Affairs), as in Figure 1 (and Tables A 1 and A- 2 in the Appendix ) for FY2008, user fees contribute 48.4% of the drug program's budget. Not shown on the figure: the FY2008 enacted budget for the human drug program shows user fees contributing 58% of the pre-market activities total and 25.3% of the postmarket activities total.", "FDA relies on fee revenue for maintaining its expert science base via staff retention. Critics say that FDA is becoming too dependent on industry fees to carry out its normal review activities. A related concern is that the large percentage of FDA's budget being covered by user fees may undercut congressional support for increases in direct appropriations to the agency.", "Leaving aside some critics' distrust of the pharmaceutical industry's motives, other political and health analysts believe that drug application review is a regulatory responsibility that the federal government should shoulder completely. They believe that rather than rely on user fees, Congress should appropriate the full amount necessary to support FDA in its mission to protect the public's health."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
