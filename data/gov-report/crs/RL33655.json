Convention Against Torture (CAT). In response to this controversy, Congress approved additional guidelines concerning the treatment of detainees via the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA), which was enacted pursuant to both the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 (P.L. 109-148, Title X), and the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2006 (P.L. 109-163, Title XIV). Among other things, the DTA contains provisions that (1) require Department of Defense (DOD) personnel to employ United States Army Field Manual guidelines while interrogating detainees, and (2) prohibit the \"cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of persons under the detention, custody, or control of the United States Government.\" These provisions of the DTA, which were first introduced by Senator John McCain, have popularly been referred to as the \"McCain Amendment.\" This report discusses provisions of the DTA concerning standards for the interrogation and treatment of detainees.", "This report discusses the application of the DTA by the DOD in the updated 2006 version of the Army Field Manual, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld. In addition, the report discusses the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) (P.L. 109-366), which contains provisions that reference or amend the DTA. It also addresses the Executive Order issued by President Barack Obama that generally instructs all U.S. agencies to comply with Army Field Manual requirements when interrogating persons captured in an armed conflict. The report also discusses the recommendations made by the Special Task Force on Interrogation and Transfer established by the Executive Order, and the DTA's relevance in the event of the prosecution of U.S. personnel for authorized interrogation or detention activities.

Both bills would have barred the CIA and other intelligence agencies from employing any interrogation tactic that is not authorized by the Army Field Manual.

The Field Manual establishes procedures for the treatment and questioning of persons by military personnel. Prior to the enactment of the DTA, the DOD had authorized certain interrogation techniques for possible use in the interrogation of security detainees whom the Bush Administration deemed to be ineligible for prisoner of war status under the Geneva Conventions\u2014namely, Taliban fighters designated as \"unlawful combatants\" and members of Al Qaeda. These techniques were more aggressive than those authorized by the Army Field Manual, and were prohibited from being used against lawful prisoners of war.", "Though the DTA generally requires the interrogation of persons in DOD custody to be consistent with Field Manual requirements, an exception is made for individuals being held pursuant to U.S. criminal or immigration laws. The DTA does not require non-DOD agencies, such as non-military intelligence and law enforcement agencies, to employ Field Manual guidelines with respect to interrogations they conduct.", "The DTA does not prevent DOD from subsequently amending the Field Manual. As discussed later, an updated version of the Army Field Manual was released on September 6, 2006. The 2006 Manual contains general requirements that are similar to those in the earlier version of the Manual, requiring all detainees to be treated in a manner consistent with the Geneva Conventions, and prohibiting the use of torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment in any circumstance. It further provides that the only authorized interrogation techniques or approaches are those included in the Manual."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prohibition on Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment", "paragraphs": ["The second provision of the DTA prohibits persons in the custody or control of the U.S. government, regardless of their nationality or physical location, from being subjected to \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\" The DTA specifies that this restriction is without geographical limitation as to where and when the government must abide by it. Unlike the first section of the DTA, this provision covers not only DOD activities, but also intelligence and law enforcement activities occurring both inside and outside the United States. This provision does not appear to prohibit U.S. agencies from transferring persons to other countries where those persons would face \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment,\" so long as such persons were no longer in U.S. custody or control. However, such transfers might nonetheless be limited by applicable treaties and statutes. The DTA also provides that this provision may \"not be superseded, except by a provision of law enacted after the date of the enactment of this act which specifically repeals, modifies, or supersedes the provisions of this section.\"", "In interpreting whether treatment falls below this standard, the DTA defines \"cruel, unusual, and inhuman treatment or punishment\" to cover those acts prohibited under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution, as stated in U.S. reservations to the U.N. Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). The Constitution applies to U.S. citizens abroad, thereby protecting them from the extraterritorial infliction by U.S. state or federal officials of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment that is prohibited under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. However, noncitizens who have not entered the United States have historically been recognized as receiving few, if any, constitutional protections. In the 2008 case of Boumediene v. Bush , the Supreme Court held that the constitutional writ of habeas corpus extends to noncitizen detainees held at Guantanamo, in significant part because Guantanamo, while not technically part of the United States, is nonetheless subject to its complete control. The Court's opinion did not address the extent to which other constitutional protections extend to Guantanamo detainees, and it suggested that noncitizens held by the United States in foreign territories where U.S. control was less absolute than Guantanamo would be afforded even lesser protections.", "The DTA prohibits persons under U.S. custody or control from being subjected to \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\" of any kind prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments, regardless of their geographic location or nationality . Accordingly, it appears that the DTA is intended to ensure that persons in U.S. custody or control abroad cannot be subjected to treatment that would be deemed unconstitutional if it occurred in the United States.", "The scope of the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment prohibitions upon harsh treatment or punishment is subject to evolving case law interpretation and constant legal and scholarly debate. The types of acts that fall within \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment\" contained in the DTA may change over time and may not always be clear. Heightening this uncertainty is the possible difficulty of comparing situations that might arise in the context of hostilities and \"the war on terror\" with interrogation, detention, and incarceration within the U.S. criminal justice system. Courts have recognized that circumstances often determine whether conduct \"shocks the conscience\" and violates a person's due process rights. Accordingly, a U.S. court might employ a different standard to determine whether interrogation techniques employed against a criminal suspect are unconstitutionally harsh than it would use to assess whether those same techniques were unconstitutional if employed against an enemy combatant in a war zone.", "Nevertheless, types of treatment in a criminal law context that have been deemed prohibited under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments may be instructive to a reviewing court. A sampling might include, inter alia :", "handcuffing an individual to a hitching post in a standing position for an extended period of time that \"surpasses the need to quell a threat or restore order\"; maintaining temperatures and ventilation systems in detention facilities that fail to meet reasonable levels of comfort; and prolonged interrogation over an unreasonably extended period of time, including interrogation of a duration that might not seem unreasonable in a vacuum, but becomes such when evaluated in the totality of the circumstances.", "Again, whether such conduct would also be considered \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment prohibited by the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment\" when employed in other circumstances (e.g., against terrorist suspects or enemy combatants abroad), or whether different constitutional standards could govern such conduct, remains unclear.", "Conduct that has not been deemed to violate the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments includes, inter alia :", "the double-celling of those in custody, at least so long as it does not lead to deprivations of essentials, an unreasonable increase in violence, or create other conditions intolerable for confinement; solitary or isolated confinement, so long as such confinement is within a cell in acceptable condition and is not of an unreasonable duration; and in detention situations, the use of constant lighting in prisoner cells when the detainees' inconvenience and discomfort is outweighed by the need to protect safety and welfare of the other detainees and staff.", "It is not clear that these and similar treatments may never be deemed constitutionally impermissible outside the criminal context, including when such treatments are used upon enemy combatants or terrorist suspects who have not been charged with a criminal offense.", "As discussed later, the Army subsequently released an updated version of the Field Manual to implement requirements of the DTA, including the prohibition upon \"cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Protection of U.S. Personnel Engaged in Authorized Interrogations", "paragraphs": ["The conference committees established to resolve differences between the House- and Senate-passed versions of the defense appropriations and authorization bills inserted an additional provision into the DTA, providing legal protections and assistance to U.S. personnel engaged in authorized interrogations. As modified, the DTA provides a legal defense to U.S. personnel in any civil or criminal action brought against them on account of their participation in the authorized interrogation of suspected foreign terrorists. The DTA specifies that a legal defense exists to civil action or criminal prosecution when the U.S. agent \"did not know that the [interrogation] practices were unlawful and a person of ordinary sense and understanding would not know the practices were unlawful.\" A good faith reliance on the advice of counsel is specified to be \"an important factor, among others, to consider in assessing whether a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the practices to be unlawful.\" The DTA further states that the specification of a \"good-faith\" defense neither extinguishes any other defenses available to U.S. personnel nor accords such personnel with immunity from criminal prosecution.", "In addition, the DTA originally permitted the U.S. government to employ legal counsel for and pay the court costs of U.S. personnel in any legal actions brought against them in foreign judicial tribunals and administrative agencies on account of such persons' participation in authorized interrogations. The Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA, P.L. 109 - 366 ) subsequently amended the DTA to require the federal government to provide or employ counsel and pay fees related to any prosecution or civil action against U.S. personnel for authorized detention or interrogation activities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Post-DTA Developments Concerning the Interrogation and Treatment of Detainees", "paragraphs": ["In the years following the enactment of the DTA, the standards governing the interrogation and treatment of detainees have been further modified by executive, legislative, and judicial action.

Rumsfeld and the MCA", "paragraphs": ["In the 2006 case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the Supreme Court rejected the Bush Administration's long-standing position that Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions was inapplicable to the present armed conflict with Al Qaeda. Among other things, Common Article 3 prohibits protected persons from being subjected to violence, outrages upon personal dignity, torture, and cruel or degrading treatment. As a result of the Court's ruling in Hamdan , questions arose regarding permissible interrogation tactics that could be used against Al Qaeda suspects, and whether U.S. personnel could face criminal liability for the harsh interrogation of such persons under the War Crimes Act, which made it a criminal offense to commit any violation of Common Article 3. Several bills introduced in response to the Hamdan decision contained provisions that referenced the DTA. One of these proposals, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, was signed into law on October 17, 2006.", "With respect to criminal conduct, the MCA amended the War Crimes Act provisions concerning Common Article 3, so that only specified violations would be punishable (as opposed to any Common Article 3 violation, as was previously the case). While the MCA expressly criminalized torture and certain less severe forms of cruel treatment against persons protected by Common Article 3, it did not criminalize all conduct that violates the standards of the DTA (i.e., cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment of the kind prohibited under the Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments). The MCA also retroactively applied the DTA's provision establishing a defense for U.S. personnel relating to the authorized treatment of detainees, so that defense could be employed by U.S. personnel charged with a War Crimes Act offense based on conduct that occurred between September 11, 2001, and December 30, 2005 (i.e., the date that the DTA was enacted).", "The MCA also included provisions concerning authorized conduct under Common Article 3 more generally. Under U.S. treaty obligations, U.S. personnel cannot commit any violation of Common Article 3, even though the MCA amended the War Crimes Act so that U.S. personnel would only be subject to criminal penalty for severe violations of Common Article 3. The MCA provided that it is generally a violation of Common Article 3 to engage in conduct (1) inconsistent with the DTA or (2) enumerated in the War Crimes Act, as amended by the MCA, as constituting a \"grave breach\" of Common Article 3. It should be noted that most, if not all, activities specified by the War Crimes Act, as amended, as \"grave breaches\" of Common Article 3 (e.g., rape, murder, torture, cruel treatment) are probably already impermissible under DTA standards. Additionally, the DTA arguably imposes less stringent requirements concerning the treatment of detainees than the plain text of Common Article 3, and may permit U.S. personnel to engage in more aggressive means of interrogation than Common Article 3 might otherwise allow.", "The MCA also authorized the President, pursuant to an Executive Order published in the Federal Register , to interpret the meaning and application of Convention requirements and promulgate administrative regulations implementing this interpretation. Although the President is generally permitted to interpret the Geneva Conventions, the act did not permit the President to interpret and apply the Conventions so as to permit \"grave breaches.\" Presidential interpretations of the Conventions are deemed authoritative (if published and concerning non-grave breaches) as a matter of U.S. law to the same degree as other administrative regulations, though judicial review of such interpretations might be more limited.", "The MCA amended the DTA to require the Federal Government to provide or employ counsel and pay fees related to any prosecution or civil action against U.S. personnel for authorized detention or interrogation activities.", "In addition, the act included a provision restating the DTA's prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment of persons under the detention, custody, or control of the U.S. Government.

Similarly, H.R. 893 , the American Anti-Torture Act of 2009, would generally prohibit all U.S. agencies from employing any interrogation technique or treatment not authorized by the Army Field Manual, though this requirement would not apply with respect to any person detained under U.S. criminal or immigration laws. S. 147 / H.R. 374 would also bar the CIA from permitting a contractor or subcontractor from carrying out an interrogation of an individual.
