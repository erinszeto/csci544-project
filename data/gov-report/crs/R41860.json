The broadest mission of public child welfare agencies is to strengthen all families in ways that ensure children can depend on their parents to protect their safety, ensure they have a stable and permanent home, and enhance their well-being. More specifically, public child welfare agencies are expected to identify families where children are at risk of abuse or neglect and to provide services to prevent maltreatment. Public child welfare agencies are also expected to identify children who have been abused and neglected and to provide services and supports necessary to ensure no further maltreatment occurs. These services may be provided while the child remains living in his/her parent's home or, if an out-of-home placement is necessary to ensure the child's safety, while the child is living in foster care.", "Under Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, the federal government provides funds to states, tribes, and territories to help ensure children's safety, permanence, and well-being through the provision of child welfare-related services to children and their families. These services may be made available to any child, and his or her family, and without regard to whether the child is living in his or her own home, living in foster care, or was previously living in foster care. Title IV-B funds are primarily distributed to states via two formula grant programs. Combined FY2014 federal funding for these two programs\u2014the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services (CWS or Subpart 1) and the Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF or Subpart 2) program\u2014was $649 million ($269 million for CWS and $380 million for PSSF). Funding for these two programs, which represented 94% of the total $689 million in federal FY2014 funding provided for all programs and activities under Title IV-B, has been declining in recent years.", "The CWS and PSSF programs have overlapping purposes and are used to fund some of the same services. At the same time, the programs have distinct federal requirements and spending patterns. Many requirements under the CWS program are specific to protecting and otherwise ensuring the safety and permanency of children in foster care. By contrast, requirements under the PSSF program primarily focus on state planning for the delivery of child and family services for a broader population, including setting goals and regularly reviewing progress toward those goals.", "Under the CWS program states must ensure provision of case review and permanency planning for each child in foster care, including those children who do not meet the federal eligibility criteria to receive those services under the Title IV-E foster care program. Spending for \"protective services\"\u2014including child abuse and neglect investigations; caseworker visits to, and permanency planning for, children in foster care; and other activities\u2014represents the largest share of federal funds expended under the CWS program. Combined, states anticipated spending close to 41% of their federal FY2013 CWS funding on that purpose. At the same time, they expected to spend close to that same share of CWS funding (more than 38%) on the four categories of child and family services for which they are required to use their PSSF funding (i.e., family support, family preservation, time-limited family reunification, and adoption promotion and support).", "States are required to spend no less than 90% of their PSSF child and family services funds on four categories of services. Family support services are considered \"upfront\" spending in that these dollars are spent to strengthen families so that children's developmental needs are met and neither abuse nor neglect occurs. The three remaining categories for which states must spend their PSSF funds target some, or all, services on children in foster care and their families: Family preservation services may be used to prevent a child's placement in foster care, or to help children in care reunite with their parents. Time-limited family reunification services and adoption promotion and support services target children in foster care\u2014either to permit their expeditious return home or, when this is not possible, to find them a new adoptive home. Adoption support services may also be used to provide post-adoption services to children living in new permanent families.", "In November 2011 (P.L. 112-34), Congress extended funding authorization for the CWS and PSSF programs through the last day of FY2016."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["The broadest mission of public child welfare agencies is to strengthen all families in ways that ensure children can depend on their parents to keep them safe, give them a stable and permanent home, and, overall, enhance their well-being.

However, some focused primarily on families with children at-risk of entering care (15%) or those with children already in care (13%). The average number of families served by a grantee ranged from a low of 24 to a high of 1,305 and averaged 231. Among those who had been served and discharged from the program by the end of year four, the average length of service under the regional partnership grant program was 215 days, or 7.2 months.

Among these were enhancements to or creation of court-based drug treatment programs; increasing timely access to treatment services, including residential treatment and home-based services; strengthening and expanding available services to families with substance abuse concerns or establishing new continuums of care for these families; and improving service integration and knowledge skills and collaboration across practice areas. ", "By year four of the grant program many regional partnerships had refined their service models to better meet needs of families served. Specifically, HHS reported that they had (1) added or expanded services to identify and address effects of trauma on both the adults and children served; (2) improved their ability to identify and meet children's service needs, including through direct provision of services or better links to other agencies providing needed services (e.g., early childhood development and substance abuse education); (3) better integrated their services to adults and children (serving family as whole); (4) strengthened their recovery services, especially through implementing or enhancing peer/parent mentors, recovery coaches, or other substance abuse specialists; and (5) continued to focus on provision of key supportive services, particularly housing (lack of which grantees noted directly impacts ability of families to be reunited) as well as medical and health care services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Indicators and Findings as of Year Four", "paragraphs": ["The 2006 law authorizing regional partnership grants required HHS to establish performance indicators (in consultation with certain stakeholders) to assess the work carried out by grantees. Twenty-three indicators were established to assess grantees work in the areas of safety and permanency for children served; recovery for adults; well-being for children, families, and adults served; and systems collaboration. HHS established a web-based program that grantees use to regularly report data on these performance indicators. Not all of the indicators may necessarily be deemed relevant to the design of a particular regional partnership grantee. Grantees must report only on indicators relevant to their program.

By year four of the program 100% of the grantees reported both child welfare services and substance abuse treatment agencies and organizations were a part of their regional partnership and close to three-fourths (74%) of the partnerships involved courts or court-related organizations. These three groups might be considered core constituencies in addressing needs of children with substance-abusing parents. As of year four of the program, however, most regional partnerships included 10 or more partners. Beyond the three already mentioned, these included (in descending order of frequency) mental health agencies or providers, community-based providers of child and family services, criminal justice and legal systems partners, education/early childhood education groups, adult health services agencies or providers, state and local employment agencies, and housing agencies or service providers. ", "Grantees report that collaboration is critical to identifying families needing services and appropriately assessing and responding to those needs, and further, that it is essential to sustaining a project over time. They concede, however, that collaboration takes ongoing effort and planning and note that it takes time to move beyond first steps (such as sharing data or information) to implementing shared practices and policies at a system level and maintaining joint accountability for outcomes achieved. To meet these ends, some important components of collaboration, as discussed by grantees, include cross-system training, clearly defined roles and expectations for each partner, regular and ongoing communication, and shared supervision or monitoring of project outcomes.", "In terms of program operations, as of year four regional partnerships were increasing their efforts to provide family-centered responses (as opposed to those solely focused on child welfare or, alternatively, adult recovery). Grantees reported co-location of workers to be positive for partners in the grant project as well as for families served, and also that it can facilitate shared treatment planning. Providing supportive services to families was found to be critical to the success of a regional partnership. Further ongoing review of the services and activities offered was noted as important to respond to newly identified or changing needs of families served.", "Federal money was critical to development of the partnerships, with grantees reporting that federal dollars alone funded close to two-thirds (64%) of their \"system collaboration and improvements\" work (compared to 40% of project services and activities overall). Among the 43 grantees who received an initial five-year project grant, 17 regional partnerships were assessed (at year four) as likely able to continue their project beyond the end of federal funding, 17 were thought likely to be able to continue some part of the project or a scaled down version, and sustainability of 9 of the projects was deemed not yet knowable. Integrating the work of the regional partnership into larger community or state systems was considered important to enable ongoing work, including the ability to establish third-party billing to pay for some work (e.g., billing Medicaid). The operation and longer-term sustainability of these regional partnerships, which began operation shortly before the 2008-2009 recession, were affected by the difficult fiscal climate, which outside the regional partnership, reduced substance abuse treatment capacity, affected child welfare staffing, and reducing community supports available. Changes in child welfare policy and practice also affected the work of the partnerships as more child welfare agencies implemented policies (such as differential response) that reduced the number of children entering foster care, providing more in-home services. The often voluntary nature of those services (as opposed to court order) required greater family engagement efforts to bring families to the services of the regional partnership.
