The agreement increases the disproportionate share hospital allotments forstates. It also extends a special DSH payment rule for public hospitals in California to qualifyingfacilities in all states, and provides additional funds to certain public hospitals not receiving DSHpayments.

Within broad federal guidelines, each statedesigns and administers its own program. Total program outlays in FY1999 were $180.9 billion. Federal outlays were $102.5 billion and state outlays were approximately $78.4 billion. The federalgovernment shares in a state's Medicaid costs by means of a statutory formula designed to providea higher federal matching rate to states with lower per capita incomes. In FY1999, federal matchingrates ranged from 50% to 76% of a state's expenditures for Medicaid items and services. Overall,the federal government finances about 57% of all Medicaid costs.", "The 105th Congress made important changes to the Medicaid program through the BalancedBudget Act of 1997 (BBA 97; P.L. 105-33 ). (1) That legislation included provisions to achieve net Medicaidsavings of about $13 billion between FY1998 and FY2002, largely from reductions in supplementalpayments to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid and low-income patients. BBA 97 also significantly increased the flexibility that states have to manage their Medicaidprograms. In particular, it gave states the option of requiring most beneficiaries to enroll in managedcare plans without seeking a federal waiver, and replaced federal reimbursement requirementsimposed by the Boren amendments with a public notice process for setting payment rates forinstitutional services. The Act also required that the previously existing cost-based reimbursementsystem for Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) be phasedout over a 6-year period. Spending items in the Act included Medicaid coverage for additionalchildren, and increased assistance for low-income individuals to pay Medicare Part B premiums.", "The 106th Congress made additional changes to Medicaid in 1999. On November 29 of thatyear, the President signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 ( P.L. 106-113 ). Includedin that bill by reference was the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Actof 1999 (BBRA 99), a bill largely comprised of Medicare provisions, but which also included anumber of changes to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP;described below).", "In addition to technical amendments to BBA 97, BBRA 99 included provisions allowing forincreased Medicaid disproportionate share payments to hospitals for certain states and the Districtof Columbia, and for extended access to a special $500 million fund to pay for Medicaid eligibilitydeterminations resulting from welfare reform for a longer period of time than allowed under previouslaw. BBRA 99 also modified the schedule for phasing out cost-based reimbursement for FQHCsand RHCs that had been included in the BBA 97.", "SCHIP, enacted in BBA 97, is targeted at uninsured children who live in families withincome below twice the federal poverty level and who would not otherwise be eligible for Medicaid. The program began in October 1997 with total federal funding of nearly $40 billion for the periodFY1998 through FY2007. States may use SCHIP funds to provide coverage through healthinsurance that meets specific standards for benefits and cost-sharing (known as separate stateprograms), or through expansions of eligibility under Medicaid, or through a combination of bothoptions. SCHIP entitles states with approved SCHIP plans to pre-determined, annual federalallotments based on a distribution formula set in law. Each state has flexibility to define the groupof targeted, low-income children who are eligible for its SCHIP. Eligibility criteria may include, forexample, geography, age, income and resources, residency, disability status, access to other healthinsurance, and duration of eligibility for SCHIP. All 50 states, the District of Columbia and fiveterritories had approved SCHIP plans. Among these, 22 are Medicaid expansions, 16 are new orexpanded separate state programs, and 17 will use both a Medicaid expansion and a separate stateprogram.", "Changes to SCHIP in BBRA 99 included provisions to improve state-level data collection;to evaluate the SCHIP (and Medicaid) programs with respect to outreach and enrollment practices;and to create a clearinghouse to coordinate and consolidate federal databases and reports onchildren's health.

The formula grant programuses appropriated funds for a wide variety of activities, including but not limited to, capacity andsystems building, public information and education, outreach and program linkage, technicalassistance, and direct health care services where no services are available. SPRANS activitiesinclude maternal and child health research, training, genetic services, hemophilia diagnostic andtreatment centers, and maternal and child health improvement projects. CISS grants seek to reduceinfant mortality and improve the health of mothers and children through development and expansionof integrated services at the community level. The block grant requires that states match $3 in fundsor resources for every $4 in federal funds received, and that a minimum of 30% of block grant fundsbe used to support programs for children with special health care needs. For FY1994 forward, TitleV authorizes to be appropriated $705 million annually.", "BBA 97 created two diabetes grant programs under the Public Health Service Act. One grantprogram supports research into the prevention and cure of type I diabetes, or insulin-dependentdiabetes. The second grant program supports prevention and treatment of diabetes in Indians. ForFY1998 through FY2002, each program receives $30 million annually through funds transferredfrom the SCHIP appropriation. BBA 97 also required evaluations of these grant programs with aninterim and final report due to Congress on January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2002, respectively.", "The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-369 ) established a 5-year trustfund to make compassionate payments of $100,000 to certain individuals with blood clottingdisorders, such as hemophilia, who contracted HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) through theuse of anti-hemophiliac factor between July 1, 1982 and December 31, 1987.

First, the agreement sets each state's FY2001 DSH allotment equal to its allotmentfor FY2000, increased by the percentage change in the consumer price index for FY2000, subjectto a ceiling of 12% of that state's total medical assistance payments. A parallel change is made forFY2002 allotments. The bill also applies the 175% hospital-specific DSH limit to certain publichospitals in all states (not just those in California as under current law) for a 2-year period. Additional funds are provided for certain state public hospitals not receiving DSH payments andhaving a low-income utilization rate in excess of 65%.", "The are two other major Medicaid provisions in the agreement. The bill replaces the currentcost-based reimbursement arrangements for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Rural HealthClinics with a new Medicaid prospective payment system. The agreement also modifies proposedHHS rules governing upper payment limits on inpatient and outpatient services provided by certaintypes of facilities, and requires that final regulations be issued by the end of 2000. The proposedrules and modifications made by the agreement close a loophole under which some states aremaximizing federal Medicaid payments arguably beyond the intent of federal statute. Finally, thebill extends by 1 year the availability of transitional medical assistance (TMA) for certain familiesno longer eligible for Medicaid on the basis of meeting former Aid to Families with DependentChildren (AFDC) rules and adds several entities to those qualified to make Medicaid presumptiveeligibility determinations for children.

Current law redistributes unused funds only to those states that spend theirallotments. The bill also authorizes the payment of costs of SCHIP Medicaid expansions and costsof benefits provided during periods of presumptive eligibility from the SCHIP appropriation ratherthan the Medicaid appropriation and clarifies states' authority to conduct presumptive eligibilitydeterminations, as defined in Medicaid law, under separate (non-Medicaid) SCHIP programs.", "With respect to other programs, the agreement requires that outreach efforts be implementedto identify individuals who may be eligible for Medicaid payment of Medicare cost-sharing and thatthose individuals are notified of the availability of such assistance.
