The law in the area is an intricate weave of statute and case law.", "Current federal law operates under the premise that with rare exceptions prisoners challenging the legality of the procedures by which they were tried or sentenced get \"one bite of the apple.\" Relief for state prisoners is only available if the state courts have ignored or rejected their valid claims, and there are strict time limits within which they may petition the federal courts for relief. Moreover, a prisoner relying upon a novel interpretation of law must succeed on direct appeal; federal habeas review may not be used to establish or claim the benefits of a \"new rule.\" Expedited federal habeas procedures are available in the case of state death row inmates if the state has provided an approved level of appointed counsel. The Supreme Court has yet to hold that a state death row inmate who asserts he is \"actually innocent\" may be granted habeas relief in the absence of an otherwise constitutionally defective conviction. The Court has made it clear in the case of the Guantanamo detainees that the privilege of the writ may not be legislatively extinguished unless there is an adequate substitute, Boumediene v.

It is most often invoked after conviction and the exhaustion of the ordinary means of appeal. It is at once the last refuge of scoundrels and the last hope of the innocent. It is an intricate weave of statute and case law whose reach has flowed and ebbed over time.", "Prior to enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), the most recent substantial recasting of federal habeas law and the Supreme Court cases that immediately preceded it, it was said that federal habeas was \"the most controversial and friction producing issue in the relation between federal and state courts.... Commentators [were] critical, ... federal judges [were] unhappy, ... state courts resented [it], . . [and] prisoners thrive[d] on it as a form of occupational therapy.... \" The AEDPA was passed and yet the debate goes on. Judges, academics and political figures regularly urge that the boundaries for federal habeas be readjusted; some would make it more readily available; others would limit access to it.", "Debate has been particularly intense in capital punishment cases. There, unlike most other cases, the decisions of the state courts stand unexecuted while they await completion of federal habeas corpus proceedings; there, unlike most other cases, an erroneously executed sentence is beyond any semblance of correction or compensation. The AEDPA offers states expeditious habeas procedures in capital cases under certain circumstances; no state has yet been able to take full advantage of the offer, and as a consequence, Congress adjusted the method of determining qualification in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act.", "An unsuccessful endeavor to curtail access of Guantanamo Bay detainees to habeas relief provided the Supreme Court with an opportunity to further explain the scope of Congressional authority over habeas jurisdiction under the suspension clause."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "History", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Origins", "paragraphs": ["At early common law, much of the business of the courts began with the issuance of one of several writs, many of which have survived to this day. The writs were a series of written order forms, issued by the court in the name of the king, commanding the individual to whom they were addressed to return the writ to the court for the purpose stated in the writ. The purpose was generally reflected in the name of the writ itself. Thus for example, a subpoena ad testificandum was a command to return the writ to the court at a specified time and place, \"sub poena,\" that is, \"under penalty\" for failure to comply, and \"ad testificandum\" that is, \"for the purpose of testifying.\"", "Just as the writs of subpoena have been shortened in common parlance to \"subpoena,\" references to the several writs of habeas corpus were shortened. The habeas corpus writs were all issued by the courts in the name of the king and addressed to one of the king's officials or a lower court. The writs commanded the officers of the Crown to appear before the court with the \"corpus\" (\"body\") of an individual named in the writ, whom \"habeas\" (\"you have\" or \"you are holding\"), for the purpose stated in the writ. Thus for instance, the writ of habeas corpora juratorum commanded the sheriff to appear before the court having with him or holding the bodies of potential jurors.", "By the colonial period, \"habeas corpus\" had come to be understood as those writs available to a prisoner, held without trial or bail or pursuant to the order of a court without jurisdiction, ordering his jailer to appear with the prisoner before a court of general jurisdiction and to justify the confinement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early American Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Colonial America was well acquainted with habeas corpus and with occasional suspensions of the writ. The drafters of the United States Constitution, after enumerating the powers of Congress, inserted the limitation that \"the privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"", "The Act that created the federal court system empowered federal judges to issues writs of habeas corpus \"and other writs not specially provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions.... [a]nd ... to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment.\" The power was limited, however, in that \"writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol, unless where they are in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or are committed for trial before some court of the same, or are necessary to be brought into court to testify.\"", "The Supreme Court further clarified federal habeas corpus law when in Ex parte Bollman , 8 U.S.(4 Cranch) 75 (1807), it held that the power of the federal courts to issue the writ was limited to the authority vested in them by statute. The courts had no common law or inherent authority to issue writs of habeas corpus. While the common law might provide an understanding of the dimensions of the writ, the power to issue it depended upon and was limited by the authority which Congress by statute vested in the courts, id . at 93.", "Consistent with the common law, the writ was available to those confined by federal officials without trial or admission to bail, but was not available to contest the validity of confinement pursuant to conviction by a federal court of competent jurisdiction, even one whose judgment was in error.", "Congress expanded the authority it had given the federal courts in response to the anticipated state arrest of federal officers attempting to enforce an unpopular tariff in 1833 and again in 1842 in response to British protest over the American trial of one of its nationals. The writ was made available to state prisoners held because of \"any act done, or omitted to be done, in pursuance of a law of the United States,\" and to state prisoners who were foreign nationals and claimed protection of the Act of State doctrine.

Shortly after 1867, however, the Supreme Court began to recognize a growing number of circumstances where courts were said to have acted beyond their jurisdiction because some constitutional violation had extinguished or \"voided\" their jurisdiction.", "This development was of limited benefit to most prisoners, since most were confined under state convictions and relatively few of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution were thought to apply against the states. Even when a constitutional claim was available, state prisoners could not be granted federal habeas relief until all possibility of state judicial relief\u00e2\u0080\u0094trial, appellate, and postconviction\u00e2\u0080\u0094had been exhausted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ebb and Flow", "paragraphs": ["Eventually two developments stimulated new growth. First, the jurisdictional tests, cumbersome and somewhat artificial, were discarded in favor of a more generous standard. Later, the explosion in the breadth of due process and in the extent of its application to the states multiplied the instances when a state prisoner might find relief in federal habeas corpus.", "Evolution began with two cases which reached the Court early in the last century and in which petitioners claimed that mob rule rather than due process of law led to their convictions and death sentences. The Court in Frank v. Mangum , 237 U.S. 309 (1915), denied the writ because Frank's claim had already been heard and rejected as part of the state appellate process. The Court did suggest, however, that a state court might lose jurisdiction by virtue of a substantial procedural defect, such as mob domination of the trial process, and that federal habeas relief would be available to anyone convicted as a consequence of the defect. It also indicated that the question of whether relief should be granted was not to be resolved solely by examination of the trial court record, as had historically been the case, but upon federal court consideration of the entire judicial process which pre-dated the petition.", "If Frank had been intended as a warning, it appears to have been in vain, for soon thereafter the Court confronted yet another conviction allegedly secured by mob intervention. In spite of the fact that the state appellate courts had already heard and denied the petitioners' claims, the Court ordered the lower federal court in which relief had been initially sought to make its own determination of the validity of petitioners' claims of procedural defect.", "Soon thereafter it became clear that federal habeas was not limited to instances of mob intervention or other external contaminants of the judicial process; it reached deficiencies from within the process which rendered the process so unfair as to result in a loss of life or liberty without due process of law, whether they took the form of a prosecutor's knowing use of perjured testimony and suppression of evidence that would impeach it, or of a denial of the assistance of counsel in criminal prosecutions, or of confessions or guilty pleas secured by government coercion.", "Early in the 1940s, the Court stopped requiring that an alleged constitutional violation void the jurisdiction of the trial court before federal habeas relief could be considered. Federal judges soon complained that federal prisoner abuses of habeas had become \"legion.\" Congress responded by incorporating into the 1948 revision of the judicial code the first major revision of the federal habeas statute since 1867.", "State courts exerted little pressure for revision of the federal habeas statute in 1948. Although habeas relief had been available to state prisoners by statute since 1867 and subsequent decisions seemed to invite access, the hospitality that federal habeas extended to state convicts with due process and other federal constitutional claims had not yet become apparent.", "This all changed over the next two decades. As noted earlier, some of the change was attributable to expansive Supreme Court interpretations of the procedural guarantees of the Bill of Rights and of the extent to which those guarantees were binding upon the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.", "Federal habeas was the vehicle used to carry much of the due process expansion to the states. After Brown v. Allen , 344 U.S. 443 (1953), there was little doubt that the federal habeas corpus statute afforded relief to state prisoners whose convictions were tainted by constitutional violations, both those violations that would void state court jurisdiction and those that would not.", "The majority position in Brown on the impact of the Court's denials of certiorari contributed to the expansion of federal habeas as well. When the Court refused to review a state case by denying certiorari, it thereby left the decision of the state's high court intact. If this should be read as the Court's endorsement of the state's disposal of constitutional issues as part of the normal appellate process, it would seem to chill any subsequent lower federal court reconsideration of those issues under habeas. Brown precludes such a result.", "The Court's denials of certiorari meant no more than that the Court had declined to hear the case; no conclusions on the Court's view of the issues raised could be drawn from its declinations. Moreover, in subsequent habeas proceedings, the lower federal courts were not bound by state resolution of federal constitutional issues, even if the state courts had given applicants for the writ a full and fair hearing on the very same issues raised on habeas.", "But the requirement to exhaust state remedies remained. Brown held that a state prisoner, seeking habeas relief, could not satisfy the requirement merely by showing that a remedy, once open to him, had been lost by his own inaction.", "The Court eased the exhaustion restriction considerably in Fay v. Noia , 372 U.S. 391 (1963), in which it held that federal courts were permitted, but not required, to deny habeas for an intentional failure to exhaust state remedies. At the same time, it articulated circumstances under which the evidentiary hearing, found permissible in Brown , would be mandatory, Townsend v. Sain , 372 U.S. 293 (1963).", "Relaxation of the default bar coupled with expansion of the circumstances under which constitutional issues might be reconsidered forecast the possibility of repetitious habeas applications and of lower court efforts to discourage repetition. The Court and Congress anticipated and combined to control such eventualities.", "Within weeks of Noia and Townsend , the Court announced the rule applicable for federal prisoners in Sanders v. United States , 373 U.S. 1 (1963). \"Controlling weight may be given to denial of a prior application for federal habeas corpus ... relief only if (1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, ... (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application\" and (4) any new ground presented in the subsequent application had been deliberately abandoned or withheld earlier under the same test used in state cases for default. 373 U.S. at 15, 17-18. Congress closed the circle in 1966 by amending the federal habeas statute to apply a rough equivalent of the Sanders rule to state prisoner petitions for federal habeas, 28 U.S.C. 2244, 2254.", "The few years which followed Sanders probably stand as the high water mark for the reach of federal habeas corpus. But by the early seventies, the Supreme Court had begun to announce a series of decisions grounded in the values of respect for the work of state courts and finality in the process of trial and review. Thus, for example, state prisoners who fail to afford state courts an opportunity to correct constitutional defects are barred from raising them for the first time in federal habeas in the absence of a justification. Nor may they scatter their habeas claims in a series of successive petitions. Those who plead guilty and thereby waive, as a matter of state law, any constitutional claims, may not use federal habeas to revive them. And with narrow exception, state prisoners may not employ federal habeas as a means to assert, or retroactively claim the benefits of, a previously unrecognized interpretation of constitutional law (i.e., a \"new rule\")."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Contemporary Limits on the Exercise of Habeas Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132 , 110 Stat. 1214 (1996) (AEDPA), codified, supplemented, and expanded upon the Court's limitations on the availability of the writ.

Cause could be found in the ineffective assistance of counsel, Kimmelman v. Morrison , 477 U.S. 365 (1986); the subsequent development of some constitutional theory which would have been so novel at the time it should have been asserted as to be considered unavailable, Reed v. Ross , 468 U.S. 1 (1984); or the discovery of new evidence not previously readily discoverable, Amadeo v. Zant , 486 U.S. 214 (1988).", "A prisoner unable to show cause and prejudice might nevertheless be entitled to federal habeas relief upon a showing of a \"fundamental miscarriage of justice,\" that is, that \"the constitutional error probably resulted in the conviction of one who was actually innocent.\" \"To establish the requisite probability, the petition must show that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him in the light of the new evidence.\" The Court's pre-AEDPA tolerance for second or successive habeas petitions from state prisoners was limited; the tolerance of the AEDPA is, if anything, more limited. \"If the prisoner asserts a claim that he has already presented in a previous federal habeas petition, the claim must be dismissed in all cases.\" A claim not mentioned in an earlier petition must be dismissed unless it falls within one of two narrow exceptions: (A) it relies on a newly announced constitutional interpretation made retroactively applicable; or (B) it is predicated upon on newly discovered evidence, not previously available through the exercise of due diligence, which together with other relevant evidence establishes by clear and convincing evidence that but for the belatedly claimed constitutional error \"no reasonable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty,\" 28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(2).

Under this view, habeas is perceived as a deterrent used to encourage state and lower federal courts to adhere to constitutional standards. Therefore, a novel constitutional interpretation, or \"new rule\" should not be applied retroactively during federal habeas review of state convictions since state courts could only be expected to defer to those rules in existence when their consideration became final. Furthermore, since it would be unfair to grant a habeas petitioner the benefit of a new rule but deny its benefits retroactively to others similarly situated, a plurality of the Court held that \"habeas corpus cannot be used as a vehicle to create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants on collateral review\" under one of the two exceptions where retroactive application is permitted, 489 U.S. at 316.", "Thus, under Teague and its companion, Penry v. Lynaugh , 492 U.S. 302 (1989), a new rule cannot be sought through federal habeas and a new rule may only be applied retroactively for the benefit of habeas petitioners when (1) the new interpretation \"places certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\" 489 U.S. at 307, or places \"a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense\" beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe, 492 U.S. at 329, or (2) the new interpretation \"significantly improve[s] the pre-existing fact finding procedures ... [which] implicate the fundamental fairness of the trial ... [and] without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished,\" 489 U.S. at 312-13.", "In order to constitute a new interpretation or \"new rule\" for purposes of the exceptions, the interpretation must \"break new ground or impose a new obligation on the States or Federal Government,\" or \"[t]o put it differently, a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant's conviction became final,\" 489 U.S. at 301 (emphasis of the Court). A decision may announce a \"new rule\" for purposes of Teague , even if the Court states its decision is \"dictated by precedent,\" as long as a split in the lower courts or some other source of authority provides a ground upon which a different outcome might reasonably have been anticipated, for the Teague rule \"serves to validate reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be contrary to later decisions.\"", "The Court has more recently indicated that the rules covered in the first exception, the exception for rules that place certain conduct beyond proscriptive reach, are more accurately characterized as substantive rather than procedural rules and thus not subject to the Teague rule from the beginning.", "The second exception, available to new \"watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding\" like Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 U.S. 335 (1963), does not extend to cases less indispensible to fundamental fairness than Gideon . The Court observed in Beard v. Banks that it has yet to rule on a case that satisfied this second Teague exception."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opting In", "paragraphs": ["The most controversial of the proposals that preceded enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) involved habeas in state capital cases.

A state defendant convicted of a capital offense and sentenced to death could take advantage of three successive procedures to challenge constitutional defects in his or her conviction or sentence. His or her claims could be raised on appeal, in state habeas proceedings, and in federal habeas proceedings. As a consequence, there were extensive delays between sentence and execution of sentence.", "In June 1988, Chief Justice Rehnquist named a committee chaired by retired Justice Powell to study \"the necessity and desirability of legislation directed toward avoiding delay and the lack of finality in capital cases in which the prisoner had or had been offered counsel.\" The Committee identified three problems associated with federal habeas corpus in state capital punishment cases: unnecessary delay and repetition, the need to make counsel more generally available, and last minute litigation. The Committee recommended amendments to the federal habeas statute and Chief Justice Rehnquist transmitted its report to Congress in September 1989.", "Congress weighed the recommendations, but initially enacted no major revision, other than the provision in the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act that required the appointment of counsel in conjunction with federal habeas in capital punishment cases. The AEDPA, however, offered procedural advantages to the states to ensure the continued availability of qualified defense counsel in death penalty cases, 28 U.S.C. 2261-2266. Prior to the AEDPA, federal law called for the appointment of counsel to assist indigent state prisoners charged with or convicted of a capital offense at every stage of the proceedings other than during collateral review in state court.

States that elect to opt in must still provide a \"mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel in state postconviction proceedings,\" 28 U.S.C. 2265(c). References to competence standards for appointed counsel were removed. Although it might be thought that the authority to promulgate such standards comes within the Attorney General's newly granted regulatory authority, 28 U.S.C. 2265(b), the Justice Department does not believe the Attorney General has any such authority.", "The Attorney General's certification that a state has taken the necessary steps to opt in is subject to de novo review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, an appeal which in turn is subject to certiorari review in the Supreme Court, 28 U.S.C. 2265(c).

Previously, the federal habeas statute authorized federal courts to stay the execution of a final state court judgment during the pendency of a state prisoner's federal habeas proceedings and related appeals, 28 U.S.C. 2251 (1994 ed.). Federal appellate courts could consider motions for a stay, pending review of the district court's decision or at the same time they considered the merits of the appeal.

In doing so, however, the Court made it clear that the loss of its jurisdiction to hear appeals in habeas cases did not mean the loss of its ability to review lower court habeas decisions altogether.

It was necessary to use the writ of certiorari in addition to the writ of habeas corpus, and there was no regulated and established practice for the guidance of parties invoking the jurisdiction, 73 U.S.(6 Wall.) at 324.", "The Court reexamined and confirmed this view the following year when it concluded that it had jurisdiction under writs of habeas corpus and certiorari to review the case of another Mississippi newspaper man held by military authorities. The 1868 Act repealed appellate jurisdiction vested in the Court by the 1867 Act.

Once Congress reopened more normal means of Supreme Court review in habeas cases, recourse to the original writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court described in McCardle and Yerger had been infrequent and rarely successful. Seen only as a burdensome way station of the unartful and ill advised, its best known chronicler urged its effective abandonment.", "Yet it offered the Court in Felker precisely what it supplied in McCardle and Yerger , a means of preserving Supreme Court review, under circumstances where Congress rather clearly intended to deny that possibility, without forcing the Court to address the question of whether Congress' efforts exceed its constitutional authority.", "The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, declared that \"although the Act does impose new conditions on [the Court's] authority to grant relief, it does not deprive [the] Court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeas petitions,\" Felker v.

Its reticence may have been calculated to avoid any suggestion that suspension or exception clauses have become dead letters.", "Although it concluded that Felker had not satisfied the requirement that the original writ issue only upon \"exceptional circumstances,\" the Court did not say why nor did it indicate when such exceptional circumstances might exist. On the other hand, the Court's denial makes it clear that McCardle and Yerger notwithstanding, legislative barriers blocking access to the more heavily traveled paths to review do not by themselves constitute the necessary exception circumstances.", "It is interesting that the Court sought refuge in the arcane confines of \"original\" habeas rather than acknowledging that the gatekeeper provision came within Congress' power under the exceptions and regulations clause whatever limitations that power might otherwise be subject to. Given the expedited nature of the proceedings, it might have meant no more than the Court lacked the time to formulate an opinion outlining the dimensions of the clause in terms that a majority on the Court could endorse. A simpler explanation may be that, in deference to the political branches, the Court sought every means to avoid suggesting that they might have overstepped their constitutional bounds.

When the King and the royal courts began to recognize restrictions on the writ, the English Parliament had responded with the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679. But in times of crisis, the Parliament allowed that the privilege of the writ should be temporarily suspended upon its approval.", "Perhaps the most notable of these suspensions occurred during the American Revolution when Parliament annually enacted suspension provisions to permit temporary imprisonment of the rebelling colonists without bail or trial for the duration of the year. Not to be outdone, several colonial legislatures afforded their executive officials similar authority to deal with those loyal to the crown.", "Early in the Republic, President Jefferson sought and was denied a suspension. During the Civil War, perhaps remembering Congress' rejection of Jefferson's suspension requests, President Lincoln did not bother to request authority to suspend at first. He simply instructed his military commanders, in ever broadening terms, to suspend access to the writ as they felt appropriate.", "After Chief Justice Taney, acting upon a petition presented in chambers, held the President had exceeded his authority, Ex parte Merryman , 17 Fed.Cas. 144 (No. 9,487) (C.C.D.Md. 1861), Congress ratified Lincoln's efforts with sweeping suspension legislation. In Ex parte Milligan , 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 2, 130-31 (1866), the Court concluded that the suspension clause operated to afford a prisoner's jailers a defense as to why they should not release the prisoner once the court had issued the writ instructing them to bring the prisoner before the court and justify the imprisonment, \"The suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus does not suspend the writ itself. The writ issues as a matter of course; and on the return made to it, the court decides whether the party applying is denied the right of proceeding further with it.\"", "Ex parte Milligan and experience during the period leading up to the drafting of the suspension clause offer scant support for the suggestion that the suspension clauses must be read as a general limitation upon Congress' authority to enact habeas legislation. Nevertheless, there were grounds for the contention that suspension of the privilege of the writ meant more than that, in times and places of trouble, particular individuals might be temporarily denied access to the writ and jailed without bail or trial by a court of competent jurisdiction. In more contemporary times, the Court and scholars pondered the extent to which the suspension clause marks an outer limit of the authority of Congress and the courts to adjust the procedures associated with the writ. If, as these authorities indicated, the suspension clause enjoyed organic qualities that permit it to expand and contract under various environmental circumstances, several evolutionary stages of the modern writ deserve repeating.", "First, as part of the Reconstruction after the Civil War, Congress expanded federal habeas to make it available to state prisoners held in violation of federal law. Second, by the early forties the Court had completed its slow abandonment of the common law prohibition against use of habeas to attack a conviction or sentence collaterally. Thereafter, the Court used an expanded habeas to help carry the commands of the Bill of Rights to the state criminal procedure. Beginning in the seventies, the Court announced a series of doctrines calculated to eliminate unnecessary delay, repetition and frivolity. The AEDPA extended this last trend.", "Felker dispelled any contention that the AEDPA's provisions violated the suspension clause. The Georgia Attorney General and the Solicitor General each denied that the suspension clause had been violated. The Court agreed. It did not rely on the proposition that the suspension clause does not extend to convicted prisoners or any other prisoners ineligible for the writ under common law, however, but \"assume[d], for purposes of decision here, that the Suspension Clause of the Constitution refers to the writ as it exists today, rather than as it existed in 1789,\" 518 U.S. at 663-64.", "Even under this relaxed standard, it found any claim based on Felker's case wanting. The AEDPA's limitation on repetitious or stale claims was seen as a variation of res judicata, which in the area of habeas had been an \"evolving body of equitable principles informed and controlled by historical usage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions,\" 518 U.S. at 664, quoting McCleskey v. Zant , 499 U.S. 467, 489 (1991). \"The added restrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process and ... do not amount to a 'suspension' of the writ contrary to Article I, \u00c2\u00a79,\" 518 U.S. at 664.", "Shortly after Felker , however, the Court narrowly construed Congressional efforts to restrict review of various immigration decisions and recognized that the courts retained jurisdiction to review habeas petitions, with the observation that otherwise serious suspension clause issues would arise.", "The Court was compelled to face the issue of Congress' constitutional authority to absolutely bar access to the writ, which the Court avoided in Felker , in Boumediene v. Bush , 128 S.Ct. 2229 (2008). Boumediene was among the foreign nationals detained at the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Until Hamdi v. Rumsfeld , 542 U.S. 507 (2004) held otherwise, the government questioned whether habeas remained available to citizens seized in a combat zone. Thereafter, the Defense Department established tribunals to determine whether detainees were in fact enemy combatants. However, until Rasul v. Bush , 542 U.S. 466 (2004) held otherwise, the government questioned whether detainees held outside the United States, whether in Guantanamo or elsewhere, rested beyond the habeas reach of U.S. courts.", "While the detainees' subsequent habeas petitions were pending, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, providing combatant status review tribunal procedures and stating that \"no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider\" a habeas petition filed on behalf of a foreign national detained in Guantanamo, 119 Stat. 2742 (2006). After the Court held that the Detainee Treatment Act provision did not apply to cases pending prior to its enactment, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , 548 U.S. 557 (2006), Congress passed the Military Commissions Act, which made the provision applicable to pending cases, 120 Stat. 2636 (2007). ", "At this point, the constitutional issue could not be avoided. The government argued in Boumediene \"that noncitizens designated as enemy combatants and detained in territory located outside our Nation's borders have no constitutional rights and no privilege to habeas corpus.\" The detainees disputed both claims. They argued that the legislation violated the suspension clause which declares that \"[t]he privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.\"", "The Court began with the observation that, \"[t]he Framers viewed freedom from unlawful restraint as a fundamental precept of liberty, and they understood the writ of habeas corpus as a vital instrument to secure that freedom.\" The Framers also remembered the history of the English writ, with its periodic suspensions of the writ. \"In our own system the Suspension Clause is designed to protect against these cyclical abuses. The Clause protects the right of the detained by a means consistent with the essential design of the Constitution. It ensures that, except during periods of formal suspension, the Judiciary will have a time-tested device, the writ, to maintain the delicate balance of government that is itself the surest safeguard of liberty.\" ", "These separation of powers concerns and the history of the territorial scope of the writ led the Court to conclude that \"Art. I, \u00c2\u00a7 9, cl. 2, of the Constitution has full effect at Guantanamo Bay.\" And so, the question became, did the suspension clause bar curtailment of habeas jurisdiction in the manner of the Military Commissions Act provision? Since the Military Commissions Act did not constitute a formal suspension of the writ, the issue was \"whether the statute stripping jurisdiction to issue the writ avoids the Suspension Clause mandate because Congress has provided adequate substitute procedures for habeas corpus\" in the Detainee Treatment Act's combatant status review tribunal procedures.", "The Court found little precedent to guide its \"adequate substitute\" assessment. Felker involved a suspension clause challenge, but the provisions there did little more than replicate and codify pre-existing habeas jurisprudence. Besides, Felker arose following a state criminal conviction, hardly a close parallel to the federal detention without trial of Boumediene.", "Two other \"habeas substitute\" cases\u00e2\u0080\u0094 Swain v.

Hayman , 342 U.S. 205 (1952)\u00e2\u0080\u0094do little to explain the characteristics of an adequate substitute, because they involved statutes designed to expand rather than curtail habeas relief.", "So the Court identified, in context of Boumediene , the essential features of habeas corpus and any adequate substitute. First, it noted that \"the privilege of habeas corpus entitles the prisoner to a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he is being held pursuant to the erroneous application of interpretation of relevant law.\" Second, \"the necessary scope of habeas review in part depends upon the rigor of any earlier proceedings.\" Thus, \"when a person is detained by executive order, rather than, say, after being tried and convicted in a court, the need for collateral review is more pressing.\" Third, \"[f]or the writ of habeas corpus, or its substitute to function as an effective and proper remedy in this context, the court that conducts the habeas proceeding must have the means to correct errors that occur during [prior] proceedings.\" Fourth, it must have \"some authority to assess the sufficiency of the Government's evidence against the detainee. It also must have the authority to admit and consider relevant exculpatory evidence that was not introduced during the earlier proceeding.\" ", "The Court found the Detainee Treatment Act procedures wanting when assessed against the standards of an adequate substitute for normal habeas procedures.
