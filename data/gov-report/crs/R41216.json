Some review conferences, such as those in 1995 and 2000, have been viewed as successes; others, like the one on 2005, have been seen as failures. A number of factors affect these assessments, but many analysts agree that the treaty may suffer irrevocable harm if the parties do not agree on a range of measures that will strengthen the treaty and address growing concerns about nuclear proliferation.

Over the years, NPT states without nuclear weapons, particularly from developing countries, have cited lack of progress on disarmament as the reason they do not support further tightening of nonproliferation rules.

The NPT recognizes five nations (the United States, Russia, France, Britain, and China) as nuclear-weapon states, and 189 countries are parties to the NPT. India, Israel, and Pakistan have never signed the treaty and possess nuclear weapons. North Korea ratified the NPT but announced its withdrawal in 2003.

The IAEA also has a role in implementing Article IV of the NPT by providing technical assistance for peaceful applications of nuclear technology for energy, medical, and agricultural applications.", "Events in the past decade have stressed the nonproliferation regime. Revelations about the A.Q. Khan proliferation network, advancements in India and Pakistan's nuclear arsenals, North Korea's nuclear tests, Iran's defiance of UN Security Council resolutions regarding its nuclear program and noncompliance with IAEA safeguards, and questions about the Syrian nuclear program have all contributed to uncertainty over the future of the regime. Moreover, there has been increased interest in nuclear power and an attendant increase in demands on the IAEA's safeguards resources. At the same time, countries have been working together to interdict WMD transfers, improve nuclear security, and live up to requirements to control the transfer of technology under UN Security Council resolution 1540. Furthermore, the United States and Russia continue formal efforts to reduce their nuclear arsenals. ", "Many see the 2010 NPT Review Conference as an important test of the viability of the treaty and how it will evolve to meet new challenges. The United States was instrumental in the negotiation of the NPT in the late 1960s and has played a leadership role in development of the nonproliferation regime ever since. As noted, the Obama Administration has prioritized nuclear nonproliferation in its foreign policy. For example, in September 2009, President Obama chaired a UN Security Council Summit that focused on nuclear nonproliferation. The Council unanimously adopted Security Council Resolution 1887, which outlined ways to strengthen the NPT and related nonproliferation measures. The United States is also the largest contributor to the IAEA . The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States concluded that U.S. leadership in nuclear nonproliferation, and in particular at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, is required to advance U.S. nonproliferation interests.

Regarding the importance of a final conference document, she said that \"it would be very positive if we could agree on a statement, a forward-looking statement ...

This would include treating cases of noncompliance \"honestly and seriously.\" Ambassador Burk has said that a key U.S. objective is for the 2010 Review Conference discussions to give \"valuable momentum\" to efforts at the IAEA, the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament to strengthen the nonproliferation regime.", "Some Members of Congress have expressed particular support for strengthened compliance measures as an outcome of the conference, and have stated that they view a strong statement on Iranian non-compliance with NPT requirements as a key objective of the review conference. U.S. officials have maintained that Iran's agreement would be necessary for a consensus document to be adopted. Although a consensus document is not required, past review conferences have traditionally sought one.

States have attempted to negotiate a consensus \"final declaration\" at each review conference. Consensus documents were adopted in 1975, 1985, 1995, and 2000. In 1980, 1990, and 2005 no document was agreed upon mainly due to disagreements between the non-aligned movement states and nuclear-weapon states over progress on nuclear disarmament (1980, 1990, 2005), access to peaceful nuclear technology (1980) or cases of non-compliance and the Middle East resolution (2005). However, adoption of a final document is not required, nor is adopting it by consensus.

As part of the compromise package that approved indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 and again in the 2000 Final Document, states agreed to a strengthened review process. The 1995 decision created PrepComs where states were to make recommendations to the review conferences and decide on procedural issues. The Review Conferences are traditionally structured by issue areas: ", "Main Committee I discusses nonproliferation, disarmament and negative security assurances; Main Committee II examines nonproliferation and safeguards compliance as well as nuclear-weapon-free zones; and Main Committee III looks at access to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, universality of the treaty (meaning all countries joining the NPT) and other issues.", "The 1995 decision also allowed for subsidiary bodies within each Main Committee for a focused look at particular issues.

Key to securing Middle Eastern NPT members' support for indefinite extension was the adoption of a Resolution that supported a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East (see Appendix B ). The 1995 decisions and resolution were crucial in gaining the support of some non-nuclear-weapon states resistant to extending the treaty indefinitely, such as Indonesia, Mexico, and Egypt. Some of these states felt that the treaty should be extended for another 25 years, which in their view would give greater leverage to non-nuclear-weapon states to press the nuclear-weapon states on disarmament steps. Because indefinite extension was seen as being granted in exchange for the other decisions and resolution, review conferences since 1995 have also examined progress on the nonproliferation and disarmament steps, universality of the treaty (membership by all states), and the Resolution on the Middle East."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The 2000 Review Conference Final Document", "paragraphs": ["At the 2000 NPT Review Conference, two main blocs of states, the five nuclear-weapon states and the geographically diverse New Agenda Coalition, negotiated \"13 Practical Steps\" that were part of a consensus final document. These steps (see Appendix C ) entailed specific commitments to reduce the role and number of nuclear weapons. Such specificity was considered necessary because of the NPT's vague language regarding disarmament. Assessment of implementation of the 1995 Middle East Resolution was a point of strong contention at the 2000 Review Conference, but states reached agreement on language before the meeting concluded. Addressing treaty compliance questions in Iraq and North Korea was also controversial for the conference but eventually agreement was reached.

Egypt also held to its position on Middle East Nuclear-Weapon-Free zone issues (see Appendix B below). Another major point of contention in 2005 for Egypt and other states was the Bush Administration's position that it was not obligated to fulfill the \"13 Steps\" agreed to in 2000. Several Bush Administration policies (such as opposition to Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty ratification) directly contradicted those steps. Non-nuclear-weapon NPT states resisted agreeing to strengthened nonproliferation measures in the absence of progress on disarmament steps. The skepticism of non-nuclear-weapon states toward the weapon states' commitment to the treaty continues today, although the Obama Administration made important progress on arms reductions and updating U.S. nuclear weapons policy in advance of the Review Conference.

For example, NPT members agreed in past consensus review conference documents that the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is an essential step in meeting Article VI obligations (see Appendix C ). The United States, however, has not ratified the CTBT, and the Bush Administration indicated that it had no plans to do so. Instead, during the 2005 NPT Review Conference, the United States indicated it was in compliance with its Article VI obligations by pointing to the history of bilateral arms control treaties between the United States and Soviet Union and recent unilateral steps that the United States had taken to reduce its nonstrategic nuclear weapons and nuclear stockpile. It indicated that these steps represented \"effective measures relating to the cessation of the arms race.\" Although members of the NPT welcomed these steps, some questioned whether these measures were enough, and whether the nuclear-weapon states ought to take stronger steps on the path to disarmament.

The Bush Administration concluded a Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) in early 2002. Following the review, the Bush Administration proposed several new programs that might have led to the development of new nuclear weapons. The Bush Administration also sought to invest heavily in the U.S. nuclear weapons infrastructure. Moreover, some observers argued that the Bush Administration had increased U.S. reliance on nuclear weapons by threatening to use them in retaliation for chemical or biological weapons attacks.", "The Obama Administration sought to address these concerns in its recently released Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). It highlighted that nuclear proliferation, along with the threat of nuclear terrorism, were now primary security concerns for the United States and that Washington would adjust its nuclear posture with these concerns in mind. Specifically, the Administration pledged that, while the United States would maintain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal for as long as other nations maintained nuclear weapons, it would not design or develop any new nuclear weapons nor assign any new missions or capabilities to existing U.S. nuclear weapons.", "Moreover, the Obama Administration reaffirmed the U.S. negative security assurance, and linked it closely to efforts to strengthen the NPT when it stated, in the Nuclear Posture Review, that \"the United States will not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the NPT and in compliance with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations.\" The Administration said that \"this revised assurance is intended to underscore the security benefits of adhering to and fully complying with the NPT and persuade non-nuclear-weapon states party to the Treaty to work with the United States and other interested parties to adopt effective measures to strengthen the non-proliferation regime.\"", "The Administration did indicate that the United States reserved the right \"to make any adjustment in the assurance that may be warranted by the evolution and proliferation of the biological weapons threat and U.S. capacities to counter that threat.\" But, for the most part, this new negative security assurance did narrow the range of circumstances under which the United States would consider using nuclear weapons and, therefore, reduced the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy.

A ban on future nuclear testing is seen as fulfilling both disarmament and nonproliferation goals by curbing the qualitative development of nuclear weapons in weapons states and preventing new states from testing a nuclear weapon. NPT states have said in consensus documents at past review conferences that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) is considered part of implementing Article VI commitments under the treaty. One element of the 1995 Review Conference documents was a call for completing negotiations on a CTBT no later than 1996. The latter decision was instrumental in securing indefinite extension. The 2000 NPT Review Conference agreed to 13 \"practical steps for the systematic and progressive efforts to implement Article VI\" of the NPT, the first of which was the \"early entry into force\" of the CTBT.

The Obama Administration's Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), released in April 2010, says that United States \"will not conduct nuclear testing and will pursue ratification and entry into force of the CTBT.\" The NPR also says U.S. ratification would encourage NPT states, including China, and the non-NPT states to ratify the treaty.", "Much of the international community continues to view U.S. ratification of the CTBT as the touchstone of compliance with Article VI. For example, a report by the international WMD Commission in 2006 said that U.S. ratification of the treaty \"would have more positive ramifications for arms control and disarmament than any other single measure.\" The 2010 International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament Report says that U.S. CTBT ratification would be the \"circuit-breaker\" in gaining ratification by other hold-out states. ", "Some analysts argue that U.S. CTBT ratification would convince other countries to support U.S. initiatives to strengthen the nonproliferation regime and put pressure on those outside the regime. As discussed elsewhere in this report, some non-nuclear-weapon states are resistant to supporting proposals for strengthened nuclear proliferation measures when the nuclear-weapon states have not fulfilled past commitments on nuclear disarmament.

Negotiators of the NPT realized that fissile material usable for nuclear weapons could still be produced under the guise of peaceful nuclear activities within the treaty. Consequently, a fissile material production ban, or FMCT, has remained on the long-term negotiating agenda at the Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva and has been endorsed by past NPT review conferences.

In contrast, the Obama Administration supports the negotiation of an FMCT with verification measures. NPT Review Conferences in 1995 and 2000 have called for the immediate start of negotiations on a \"non-discriminatory and universally applicable\" convention. The start of FMCT negotiations are currently being blocked by Pakistan's opposition. The NPT review conference is likely to repeat its past calls to start negotiations on a verifiable treaty as soon as possible.", "Like the CTBT, the FMCT is viewed by many as having disarmament and nonproliferation benefits. The five NPT nuclear-weapon states have already ceased fissile material production for weapons. Such a treaty has the potential to include the non-NPT nuclear-weapon states, which are subject to very few if any restrictions or monitoring, in a major multilateral disarmament measure. One key issue still under debate is whether or not such a treaty would seek to dispose of existing stocks of fissile material.

Several countries have developed proposals for addressing this issue, although they do not involve amending the treaty or altering parties' right to withdraw from it.

Although the treaty itself does not make this direct connection, some argue that states should be able to access peaceful technology only when in full compliance with their safeguards obligations.

The NPT does not forbid access to enrichment or reprocessing technologies, which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and fissile material usable in a nuclear weapon. These technologies are required to be under IAEA safeguards. But in order to further discourage the spread of these technologies, states and the IAEA have proposed various options to create additional nuclear fuel supply assurances. These issues likely to be debated at the review conference. ", "U.S. policy has sought to limit the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technology due to their military potential. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is negotiating a set of criteria that would be used to decide whether to authorize a future transfer of enrichment or reprocessing technology. Previously, such transfers were not banned under NSG rules but suppliers have exercised self-restraint.", "Many developing countries are resistant to any changes to the rules that regulate nuclear commerce, as they perceive such restrictions as potentially limiting their access to economic and development benefits of nuclear energy under Article IV of the NPT. The Non-Aligned Movement is especially critical of both potential NSG restrictions on enrichment and reprocessing transfers and international fuel cycle initiatives more generally. Some developing countries also resist adoption of the IAEA Additional Protocol in their country. These states argue that the NPT does not limit their access to fuel cycle technology for peaceful use in any way and that only comprehensive IAEA safeguards are required by the treaty. In contrast, other states, as noted, view access to nuclear technology as conditional on a state's nonproliferation behavior. The debate over access to fuel cycle technology is further complicated by Iran's operation of an enrichment plant and noncompliance with its safeguards agreements, as discussed above. Nevertheless, the vast majority of states do support the Additional Protocol, and to date the IAEA Board of Governors has approved 139 Additional Protocols and 96 are in force. States at the review conference are likely to discuss how to universalize adherence to the Additional Protocol, which is a U.S. goal for the conference.

For example, a fuel bank under IAEA auspices has been proposed that would supply nuclear fuel to a state if supply was cut-off for reasons other than nonproliferation (such a bank would not be the regular fuel supplier). Another model creates multilateral ownership in a uranium enrichment facility at Angarsk, Russia. Despite the voluntary nature of participation in these models, some non-nuclear-weapon states, as evidenced in Non-Aligned Movement statements, are skeptical toward multilateral fuel assurance proposals. They argue that these are unnecessary in current market conditions and could constrain future technology acquisition. The countries in favor of multilateral approaches, including the United States, argue that these models provide an extra layer of assurance, would not replace market solutions, and would provide a disincentive for indigenous enrichment and reprocessing plants.
