On March 11, 2019, the Trump Administration submitted to Congress its SFOPS budget proposal for FY2020, which totaled $42.72 billion in discretionary funds ($42.88 billion when $158.9 million in mandatory retirement funds are included), reflecting adherence to discretionary funding caps, as determined by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ).", "The initial FY2020 request would have represented a 2.5% increase in SFOPS when compared to the FY2019 request but a 21% decrease in SFOPS funding when compared to the FY2019 enacted funding levels. Within these totals, Department of State and Related Agency funding would have been reduced by 15.7%, with the greatest cuts to the Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs (56%), International Organizations (26%), and the U.S. Agency for Global Media (22%) accounts. The Foreign Operations accounts would have seen a reduction of 23.5%, with the greatest cuts to the non-health development assistance (39%), humanitarian assistance (34%), and global health (28%) sectors.", "On May 16, 2019 the House Appropriations Committee agreed to its SFOPS measure ( H.R. 2839 ) that would have provided $56.54 billion in total spending ($56.39 billion in discretionary spending). The bill included either level or increased funding in nearly all accounts compared to FY2019. It did not include the President's proposal to consolidate spending into the proposed Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) and International Humanitarian Assistance (IHA) accounts, and moved the Economic Support Fund (ESF) account from Title III (Bilateral Economic Assistance) into Title IV (International Security Assistance) to make clear the committee's desire to keep ESF distinct from the Development Assistance (DA) account. Finally, the bill would have provided funds to make operational the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (pursuant to the BUILD Act of 2018; P.L. 115-254 ). On June 19, 2019, the House passed the FY2020 SFOPS legislation in a \"minibus\" measure that included three other appropriations bills\u00e2\u0080\u0094Labor, Health and Human Services, Education; Defense; and Energy and Water Development ( H.R. 2740 ).

Much like the House measure, the bill included level or increased funding for most accounts compared to FY2019 and did not include the President's proposals to consolidate spending into the ESDF and IHA accounts. However, unlike the House bill, the Senate committee measure kept ESF in Title III (Bilateral Economic Assistance), consistent with prior year appropriations.", "FY2020 began with all appropriations bills unfinished.

On December 20, 2019, Congress passed, and the President later signed, two consolidated appropriations bills ( P.L. 116-93 and P.L. 116-94 ). SFOPS funding was included as Division G of P.L. 116-94 , Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.

During the Obama Administration, Congress typically provided less SFOPS funding than was requested, though the gap narrowed over time. Thus far in the Trump Administration, Congress has enacted significantly more SFOPS funding than the amount requested, both because the requested amounts have represented large cuts and because enacted funding levels have been high relative to most recent years ( Table 1 ).

The BBA 2019 raised discretionary spending limits set by the BCA for FY2020 and FY2021, the final two years the caps are in effect. ", "In addition to raising the caps, another way that Congress has managed the constraints imposed by the BCA budget caps is through the use of Overseas Contingency Operations funding, which is excluded from the BCA discretionary budget caps. Congress began appropriating OCO in the SFOPS budget in FY2012, having previously provided OCO funds for the Department of Defense. Originally used to support shorter-term, temporary contingency-related programming in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan that was not part of the \"base\" or \"core\" budget, the use of OCO has expanded considerably over the years. In FY2019, OCO funds were used to support 11 different SFOPS accounts, from USAID operating expenses and the Office of Inspector General to International Disaster Assistance and Foreign Military Financing. ", "When Congress raised the BCA caps for FY2019, the Administration chose not to request OCO funding for FY2019 SFOPS. Congress nevertheless designated $8 billion of FY2019 SFOPS funding as OCO, a 33% reduction in OCO spending compared to FY2018 and the second year in a row that SFOPS OCO levels declined significantly. ", "While the FY2020 SFOPS request did not include OCO funding, the Administration's FY2020 defense budget request included an unprecedented amount of OCO funding, widely viewed as a means of increasing defense spending without amending the BCA's defense discretionary spending cap. Through BBA 2019, Congress established OCO funding targets for both defense and nondefense discretionary spending. For foreign affairs OCO, Congress designated $8 billion for FY2020 and FY2021, indicating its intent to continue to use OCO in SFOPS appropriation measures for the next two fiscal years. Congress adhered to that target, and remained consistent with FY2019 funding, in the final FY2020 SFOPS appropriation, providing $8 billion in OCO, representing nearly 14% of the total SFOPS funding ( Figure 2 )."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["House SFOPS Legislation.
