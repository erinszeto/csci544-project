For example, the tax could be expanded to apply to more institutions, or the cut-off points (either the per-student or assets per FTE thresholds) changed. The tax could also be modified to be more punitive in nature. For example, Representative Reed has suggested an approach that would require institutions with endowment assets in excess of $1 billion to use at least 25% of investment gains to reduce the cost of attendance for lower- and middle-income students. Institutions not meeting this target would face a tax of 30% of net investment income, with the tax increasing for institutions that do not use endowments to reduce cost of attendance as stipulated over time.

The Tax Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1 ), a tax reform proposal introduced in the 113 th Congress by then Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, proposed a flat excise tax for foundations and extended it to net investment earnings of private universities and colleges. Under this proposal, private colleges and universities with endowments in excess of $100,000 per student would be subject to a 1% excise tax. The tax on net investment returns of private college and university endowments enacted in the 2017 tax revision ( P.L. 115-97 ) applies to institutions with endowments in excess of $500,000 per student, at a rate of 1.4%.

While a payout requirement of 5%\u2014the payout requirement for private nonoperating foundations\u2014is one option, some other level (higher or lower) could be chosen. The payout requirement could be restricted to certain endowments, such as those that exceed a certain threshold, either in absolute terms ($500 million, for example) or on a per-student basis. Payout requirements could be tied to investment earnings, or capped to not exceed investment earnings in down years. Payout requirements could also be determined on a rolling basis (5% over a 3-year period, for example). Payouts requirements could also be tied to tuition levels, metrics on student need (Pell grant recipients, for example), or students' receipt of federal student aid. ", "Additional nuances could complicate various policy design choices. For example, if payout requirements were to be imposed in institutions with endowments per student above some predetermined level, what measure of students would be used (e.g., would the measure of students include graduate students; would the measure of students be fall enrollment, the 12-month unduplicated headcount, full-time equivalents, or some other measure?). ", "Opponents of a payout requirement for endowments say the approach is misguided, and have been critical of various aspects of different payout policy options. When considering payout policies that target institutions with large endowments, some have suggested that these institutions may be more likely to offer robust financial aid and perhaps more likely to have modest tuition increases over time. In recent years, institutions with larger endowments have tended to have higher average payouts than institutions with smaller endowments. Thus, a payout requirement applied to all institutions regardless of endowment size could impose a greater burden on institutions with smaller endowments. Some have also questioned whether the 5% payout rate that currently applies to nonoperating foundations would be appropriate for endowments, noting that operating foundations often have lower effective payout rates. Finally, there are concerns that imposing a payout requirement might serve as a ceiling rather than a floor, leading institutions that would have paid out more than 5% (or whatever rate is required) to make payouts that meet the requirement but no more. ", "One issue raised by university representatives is restrictions on endowments imposed by donors (i.e., donor-restricted funds, discussed earlier). Donor restrictions come in two forms (which often appear simultaneously): a requirement that the principal not be spent (so as to preserve the fund permanently) and a requirement that funds be spent for specified purposes. Mary Frances McCourt, representing NACUBO at a recent hearing, indicated that, in FY2014, colleges received $7.7 billion in new financial contributions to their endowments. Of those new gifts, 90% were restricted for a specific purpose by the donors. Since most endowments have grown over time, and proposed payout rates tend to be below earnings over time, restrictions on not spending principal could likely be designed to be manageable for most institutions. ", "If a payout were to be required, payouts might come from quasi-endowments, as opposed to donor-restricted funds. As noted earlier in this report (see the \" What Is an Endowment? \" section), in 2017, 24% of all endowment funds were reportedly held in quasi-endowments, and 25% of endowment funds in a nondefined \"other\" category. Thus, across endowments as a whole, it could be possible to meet a payout requirement even if a sizable portion of endowment funds is restricted. What is not clear is how a payout requirement might affect specific institutions, where the proportion of restricted endowment funds may be higher. ", "Restrictions on purposes are unlikely to impose a constraint to increased payouts, either for increasing spending generally or for the purpose of slowing tuition increases, because of the fungibility of money. That is, if some endowment funds are limited to specific purposes and increased spending for those purposes is not feasible (e.g., supporting an endowed chair), increased payouts from other endowments without restrictions or endowments that are devoted to student aid can be used to meet a payout requirement. Providing aid to students is one of the most common restrictions. ", "Nevertheless, any legislation requiring a payout or a payout tied to a particular purpose might need a \"safe harbor\" so that colleges and universities would not be caught between legal restrictions on donations and payout requirements. Protections from fluctuations in asset values might also be addressed by requiring minimum payout averaged over several years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Endowments or Impose Additional Taxes on Endowment Earnings", "paragraphs": ["Another option would be to impose a tax on the value of endowments or impose additional taxes on endowment earnings. As is the case with the payout option, there are a number of different ways such a policy could be designed. For example, the tax could only be applied to endowments of a certain size, or to institutions with \"large\" endowments that have increased tuition at a certain rate (more than the rate of inflation, for example). ", "Endowment earnings could also be subject to tax. One option would be to impose a tax similar to the current maximum rate of 21% already imposed on tax-exempt entities for earnings from activities not related to their exempt purpose (the unrelated business income tax, UBIT). ", "A tax on endowments or an additional tax on endowment earnings would generate additional federal revenues. These revenues could be earmarked to provide student aid across all colleges and universities, or could be treated as general fund revenues or used for other purposes. Whether a tax on endowments encourages universities to spend more is unclear: saving via the endowment becomes more expensive (as the after-tax return is lower) which would encourage payouts relative to endowment savings and accumulation.

Taxpayers might choose instead to make nonrestricted contributions, substituting one form of giving for another. Since limiting the deduction would reduce the tax incentive for giving to endowments, overall contributions may fall.", "One option for implementing this approach could be to limit the deduction based on when the contribution is expected to be spent. For example, if the contribution is expected to support educational activities for 10 years, some adjustment could be made to reflect the fact that a dollar spent in the future is worth less than a dollar spent today, as a result of inflation. Since this type of adjustment could become complex, it could be limited to gifts of a certain size. ", "Another option would be to provide an enhanced charitable deduction for certain types of gifts. For example, taxpayers making charitable donations of funds that would be used to offset tuition for lower- and middle-income students could receive an enhanced charitable deduction for such contributions. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Change Policies for Certain Offshore Investments", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, some have noted that the increased share of endowment assets being invested in alternative strategies, particularly hedge funds, raises concerns about the use of offshore blocker corporations to avoid UBIT. The ability to use offshore blocker corporations to avoid UBIT creates disparate tax treatment between debt-financed investments made domestically and those made offshore. Some have also expressed concern that current law creates an incentive to borrow to increase the level of the endowment, which could force spending cutbacks in a downturn. ", "In 2007, then Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Charles Rangel introduced a bill, H.R. 3970, which addressed the disparate tax treatment of domestic and offshore investments by exempting partnership income from the UBIT. Following hearings by the Senate Finance Committee in 2007, a draft proposal by Senators Grassley and Wyden circulated in August 2008 proposed instead to disallow the use of offshore blocker corporations by providing look-through rules to determine the source of earnings. Others have suggested that Congress could disallow the use of blocker corporations and expand the scope of UBIT rules covering debt-financed investment to apply to all forms of leveraged investment. Another option would be to repeal debt-financed UBIT rules, eliminating the incentive created under current law to use offshore blocker corporations.

Others have suggested that the IRS Form 990 be modified to collect additional information on endowment funds. ", "If endowment spending on financial aid and low- and moderate-income students is an issue of interest, it might be useful to collect additional information on spending on grants and scholarships. Another area of potential concern is administrative expenses associated with managing the endowment, including fees paid to third parties. It might also be helpful to policymakers to have additional information on the types of endowments held. For example, are endowments composed of quasi-endowments? Or is the use of assets otherwise restricted? Policymakers might also seek information on endowment holdings of real property.", "Collecting additional information on college and university endowments could increase transparency, while also being useful for policymakers in both policy and oversight capacities. A potential trade-off associated with collecting additional information is increased administrative burden. ", "Appendix A. Endowment Data Reported to the IRS by 501(c)(3) Institutions", "Data on endowments of 501(c)(3) universities and colleges are reported on Schedule D of IRS Form 990 informational returns. The IRS makes available data files that contain a sample of information reported on the Form 990s. The most recent year for which IRS microdata files are available is 2014. Public universities and colleges are not required to file 990s and thus information on nonfiling institutions' endowments is not included in the IRS data.", "The IRS SOI 990 sample contains 1,048 observations of higher education entities, including colleges, universities, two-year colleges, and graduate and professional schools. Since the IRS SOI file is a sample, and not all smaller institutions are included, the sample weights can be used to estimate the population. Overall, this sample represents an estimated 1,782 institutions. For 2014, these institutions reported total endowments of $390.2 billion. ", "In addition to collecting data on endowment balances, the IRS collects data on endowment contributions; net investment earnings, gains, and losses; grants and scholarships; other expenditures for facilities and programs; and administrative expenses. Contributions and positive net investment earnings increase endowment balances. Grants and scholarships, expenditures for facilities and programs, and administrative expenses reduce endowment balances.

Administrative costs were $1.0 billion, or 0.3% of endowment funds.", "Data reported by 501(c)(3) universities and colleges on their IRS Form 990 can be used to calculate payout rates. Following NACUBO, effective spending rates, or payout rates, are calculated as distribution for spending (spending on grants or scholarships and other expenditures for facilities and programs) divided by the beginning of year endowment value, net of administrative expenses. Payout rates for different endowment size classes are reported in Table A-2 , in both dollar-weighted and equal-weighted terms. ", "Analysis of the distribution of payout rate for 501(c)(3) higher education institutions reveals a couple of trends. First, median payouts tend to be higher for institutions with larger endowments. Second, payout rates for larger institutions are more concentrated.
