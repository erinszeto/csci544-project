In the SDWA amendments of 1996, Congress reauthorized appropriations for most SDWA programs through FY2003. Although the authorization of appropriations has expired for most provisions, Congress has continued to appropriate funds for the ongoing SDWA programs. Enacted in December 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WINN) Act, P.L. 114-322 , made numerous amendments to the SDWA, with significant focus on addressing lead in public water systems and increasing compliance assistance for small or disadvantaged communities.

Congress passed this law after nationwide studies of community water systems revealed widespread water quality problems and health risks resulting from poor operating procedures, inadequate facilities, and uneven management of public water supplies in communities of all sizes. The 1974 law gave the EPA substantial discretionary authority to regulate drinking water contaminants and gave states the lead role in implementation and enforcement.", "The first major amendments ( P.L. 99-339 ), enacted in 1986, were largely intended to increase the pace at which the EPA regulated contaminants and to increase the protection of ground water. From 1974 until 1986, the EPA had regulated just one additional contaminant beyond the 22 standards previously developed by the Public Health Service. The 1986 amendments required the EPA to (1) issue regulations for 83 specified contaminants by June 1989 and for 25 more contaminants every three years thereafter, (2) promulgate requirements for disinfection and filtration of public water supplies, (3) limit the use of lead pipes and lead solder in new drinking water systems, (4) establish an elective wellhead protection program around public wells, (5) establish a demonstration grant program for state and local authorities having designated sole-source aquifers to develop ground water protection programs, and (6) issue rules for monitoring underground injection wells that inject hazardous wastes below a drinking water source. The amendments also increased the EPA's enforcement authority.", "Congress again amended SDWA with the Lead Contamination Control Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-572 ). These provisions were intended to reduce exposure to lead in drinking water by requiring the recall of lead-lined water coolers and requiring the EPA to issue a guidance document and testing protocol for states to help schools and day care centers identify and correct lead contamination in school drinking water.", "After the regulatory schedule mandated in the 1986 amendments proved to be unworkable for the EPA, states, and public water systems, the 104 th Congress made sweeping changes to the act with the SDWA Amendments of 1996 ( P.L. 104-182 ). As over-arching themes, the amendments targeted resources to address the greatest health risks, increased regulatory flexibility, and authorized funding for federal drinking water mandates. Congress revoked the requirement that the EPA regulate 25 new contaminants every three years and created a risk-based approach for selecting contaminants for regulation.", "Among other changes, Congress added some flexibility to the standard-setting process, required the EPA to conduct health risk reduction and cost analyses for new rules, authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program to help water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to comply with SDWA regulations and protect public health, added programs to improve small system compliance, expanded consumer information requirements, increased the act's focus on pollution prevention with a state source water assessment program, and streamlined the act's enforcement provisions. P.L. 104-182 authorized appropriations under the act through FY2003. Authorizations of appropriations under the SDWA are identified in Table 3 .", "In 2002, several drinking water security provisions were added to the SDWA through the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-188 ). Title IV of that act included requirements for community water systems serving more than 3,300 individuals to conduct vulnerability assessments and prepare emergency response plans. The law increased criminal and civil penalties for tampering with water supplies and required the EPA to conduct research on preventing and responding to terrorist or other attacks. ", "Signed into law on January 4, 2011, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act, P.L. 111-380 , tightened the SDWA definition of \"lead free\" and added specific exemptions from the ban on the use or sale of lead pipes and plumbing fittings and fixtures that are not lead free. (A subsequent amendment [ P.L. 113-64 ] explicitly exempted fire hydrants from coverage under the act's lead plumbing restrictions. ) Enacted August 7, 2015, the Drinking Water Protection Act ( P.L. 114-45 ) directed EPA to develop a strategic plan to assess and manage the risks associated with algal toxins in public drinking water supplies. Enacted December 11, 2015, the Grassroots Rural and Small Community Water Systems Assistance Act ( P.L. 114-98 ) revised and reauthorized the small system technical assistance program and extended the authorization of appropriations for the program through FY2020. ", "In December 2016, Congress made numerous revisions to the SDWA through the WIIN Act ( P.L. 114-322 ; Title II, the Water and Waste Act of 2016). Among other amendments, the WIIN Act authorized new grant programs to (1) help public water systems serving small or disadvantaged communities meet SDWA requirements; (2) support lead reduction projects, including lead service line replacement; and (3) establish a voluntary program for testing for lead in drinking water at schools and child care programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulated Public Water Systems", "paragraphs": ["Federal drinking water regulations apply to the approximately 152,700 privately and publicly owned water systems that provide piped water for human consumption to at least 15 service connections or that regularly serve at least 25 people.

These water systems provide water to more than 299 million people. All federal regulations apply to these systems. Most community water systems (82%) are relatively small, serving 3,300 or fewer individuals. Despite this large percentage, these systems provide water to just 9% of the total population served by community water systems. Fully 92% of CWSs serve populations of 10,000 or fewer, and 55% serve populations of 500 or fewer. In contrast, 8% of CWSs serve populations of 10,000 or more but provide water to 82% of the population served (more than 246 million individuals). Among the community water systems, 71% rely on ground water, and 29% rely on surface water.

Most drinking water regulations apply to these systems. Of these water systems, 99% serve populations of 3,300 or fewer and provide water to 83% of the population served by these systems.", "Nearly 83,200 other public water systems are transient non-community water systems , such as campgrounds and gas stations, which provide their own water to transitory customers.

The regulations apply to privately and publicly owned \"public water systems\" that provide piped water for human consumption to at least 15 service connections or that regularly serve at least 25 people. The EPA has issued regulations for more than 90 contaminants, including regulations setting standards or treatment techniques for drinking water disinfectants and their byproducts, microorganisms (e.g., Cryptosporidium and Legionella ), radionuclides, organic chemicals (e.g., benzene and many pesticides), and inorganic chemicals (e.g., arsenic and lead)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contaminant Selection and Regulatory Schedules", "paragraphs": ["The SDWA, as amended in 1996, directs EPA to promulgate a drinking water regulation for a contaminant if the Administrator determines that the following three criteria are met:", "the contaminant may have adverse health effects; it is known, or there is a substantial likelihood, that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and its regulation presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems. ", "Every five years, EPA must publish a list of unregulated contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and that may require regulation (known as a contaminant candidate list [CCL]). The SDWA further directs EPA to administer a monitoring program for unregulated contaminants to facilitate the collection of occurrence data for contaminants that are not regulated but are suspected to be present in public water supplies. Every five years, EPA must publish a rule (Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule [UCMR]) listing no more than 30 unregulated contaminants to be monitored by public water systems. This list is based on the contaminant candidate lists as well as other data.

EPA must then set an enforceable standard, a maximum contaminant level (MCL), as close to the MCLG as is \"feasible\" using best technology, treatment techniques, or other means available (taking costs into consideration). Once the Administrator makes a determination to regulate a contaminant, EPA must propose a rule within 24 months and promulgate a \"national primary drinking water regulation\" within 18 months after the proposal.", "EPA may set a standard at other than the feasible level if the feasible level would lead to an increase in health risks by increasing the concentration of other contaminants or by interfering with the treatment processes used to comply with other SDWA regulations. In such cases, the standard or treatment techniques must minimize the overall health risk. Also, when proposing a regulation, EPA must publish a determination as to whether or not the benefits of the standard justify the costs. If EPA determines that the benefits do not justify the costs, the agency may, with certain exceptions, promulgate a standard that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost that is justified by the benefits.", "Referencing legislative history, the agency generally sets standards based on technologies that are affordable for large communities; however, as amended by P.L. 104-182 , the act requires EPA, when issuing a regulation for a contaminant, to list any technologies or other means that comply with the MCL and are affordable for small public water systems serving populations of 10,000 or fewer. If EPA does not identify \"compliance\" technologies that are affordable for small systems, then the agency must identify small system \"variance\" technologies or other means that may not achieve the MCL but are protective of public health. ", "New regulations generally become effective three years after promulgation. Up to two additional years may be allowed if EPA (or a state in the case of an individual system) determines the time is needed for capital improvements.

When developing a regulation, if EPA cannot identify a technology that meets the standard and is affordable for small systems, EPA must identify variance technologies that are affordable but do not necessarily meet the standard. In cases where EPA has identified variance technologies, then states may grant small system variances to systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons if the system cannot afford to comply with a standard (through treatment, an alternative water source, or restructuring) and the variance ensures adequate protection of public health. A state may then grant a variance to a small system, allowing the system to use a variance technology to comply with a regulation. With EPA approval, states may also grant variances to systems serving between 3,301 and 10,000 persons. Variances are not available for microbial contaminants. The EPA has determined that affordable compliance technologies are available for all existing standards. Thus, small system variances are not available.", "Section 1416 authorizes states to grant public water systems temporary exemption s from standards or treatment techniques if a system cannot comply for other compelling reasons (including costs). An exemption is intended to give a water system more time to comply with a regulation and can be issued only if it will not result in an unreasonable health risk.

If the state fails to commence enforcement action within 30 days after the notification, EPA is authorized to issue an administrative order or commence a civil action. In a nonprimacy state, EPA must notify an elected local official (if any has jurisdiction over the water system) before commencing an enforcement action against the system.", "The 1996 amendments strengthened enforcement authorities, streamlined the process for issuing federal administrative orders, increased administrative penalty amounts, made more sections of the act clearly subject to EPA enforcement, and required states (as a condition of primacy) to have administrative penalty authority.

The law specified that the regulations could not interfere with the underground injection of brine from oil and gas production or recovery of oil unless USDWs would be affected.", "Section 1422 authorized affected states to submit plans to EPA for implementing UIC programs and, if approved, to assume primary enforcement responsibility. If a state's plan has not been approved, or the state has chosen not to assume program responsibility, then EPA must implement the program. For oil and gas injection operations only, states with UIC programs are delegated primary enforcement authority without meeting EPA regulations under Section 1421, provided that states demonstrate that they have an effective program that prevents underground injection that endangers drinking water sources. EPA has delegated primacy for all classes of wells to 35 states; it shares implementation responsibility with seven states and two Indian tribes and implements the UIC program for all well classes in nine states.", "To implement this program, EPA has established six classes of UIC wells based on similarity in the fluids injected, construction, injection depth, design, and operating techniques and issued regulations that establish performance criteria for each class. Most recently, EPA issued regulations for Class VI wells establishing requirements for the underground injection of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Class VI wells are intended to be used for the long-term geologic sequestration of CO 2 as a tool for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and other large stationary sources of carbon dioxide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other SDWA Groundwater Protection Programs", "paragraphs": ["The act contains four other state programs aimed specifically at protecting groundwater.

In areas that overlie a designated sole-source aquifer, no federal funding may be committed for projects that EPA determines may contaminate such an aquifer. Any person may petition for sole source aquifer designation. Nationwide, EPA has designated 77 sole source aquifers. 2. Sole Source Aquifer Demonstration Program .
