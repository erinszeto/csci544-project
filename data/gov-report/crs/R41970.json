{"id": "R41970", "title": "Addressing the Long-Run Budget Deficit: A Comparison of Approaches", "released_date": "2014-12-09T00:00:00", "summary": ["A small share of federal spending is for direct provision of domestic government services, which many people may think of when considering federal spending. Because this spending is normally about 10% of total federal spending and about 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) and deficits are projected to be 2.8% of GDP and rising in the future, cutting this type of spending can make only a limited contribution to reducing the deficit. (Note that direct provision of domestic services by the federal government is smaller than the total of nondefense discretionary spending, about 17% of spending, because it excludes transfers. Discretionary spending is spending that requires appropriations.) Transfers and payments to persons and state and local governments constitute most of federal spending, about 70%. Defense spending, currently accounting for about 20% of spending, has declined over the past 35 years but tends to vary depending, in part, on the presence and magnitude of international conflicts.", "Recently, issues concerning the level of federal debt have become a significant source of debate in Congress. As a result of the recent recession (December 2007 to June 2009), along with policies enacted in response to it, federal debt held by the public rose from 36% of GDP in 2007 to 74% in 2014. Although the debt held by the public is projected to be relatively stable over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects it will rise to 106% of GDP by 2039. This increase in debt is mainly due to growth in federal spending on health care programs and Social Security, as well as increasing interest payments that typically accompany rising budget deficits. Although spending on these programs is rising, other types of federal spending have remained constant or declined. These trajectories are projected to continue under current policy.", "Because reductions in the spending allocated for federal provision of goods and services appear inadequate to reduce the future deficit and debt to a sustainable level, limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in transfers, which include entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.", "Preserving entitlements would eventually require increases in taxes; CBO's baseline projection shows spending on Social Security, health, and interest will absorb virtually all revenue collected by 2039, leaving little room for any discretionary and other mandatory spending. Options to put the federal budget on a more sustainable path include raising tax rates, reducing tax expenditures, increasing other taxes, or introducing new revenue sources. Tax expenditures may be difficult to eliminate, but if not used to lower rates they may be a source of additional revenue. If Congress were to address the eventual Social Security trust fund shortfall largely with tax increases, it would smooth the burden of accommodating longer lives across both working and retirement years. This argument might also apply, in part, to Medicare and Medicaid.", "The federal government provides about one-fifth of the revenue for state and local governments. Reducing the long-term deficit and debt may require cutbacks in transfers to these governments that could, in part, shift the burden of providing services from the national to subnational governments rather than altering the overall size of government services."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The growth of the national debt, which is considered unsustainable under current policies, continues to be one of the central issues of domestic federal policy making. On August 2, 2011, Congress adopted, and the President signed, the Budget Control Act (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ), which might be viewed as an initial step in addressing long-run debt issues. It had been recognized for some time that the growing long-term debt is an issue, and this concern was reinforced with Standard and Poor's downgrading of U.S. Treasury securities from AAA to AA+ on August 5, 2011. As part of the BCA, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction (sometimes referred to as the Super Committee) was appointed to find ways to achieve a specified amount of deficit reduction. The committee failed to reach agreement, which triggered a set of automatic spending cuts, largely on discretionary spending, that were put into effect in FY2013. ", "At the end of 2012, however, concerns about the effect of recent spending cuts and tax increases about to take effect (called the fiscal cliff ) on economic recovery became a central issue. Action to address this problem resulted in retaining tax cuts compared with present law by making most expiring tax cuts permanent and increasing discretionary spending levels. These decreases in revenue collection and increases in spending resulted in higher budget deficits.", "This report examines alternative approaches to reducing the deficit, relating to the immediate issues arising from the BCA and the extended tax cuts as well as to ongoing, longer-term decisions about how to bring the debt under control. It focuses on the trade-offs between limiting the provision of defense and domestic public goods, reducing transfers to persons including entitlements for the elderly and those with low income, reducing support for state and local governments, and raising taxes. Using projections of the debt and deficit, it also addresses how limiting reliance on one source of deficit reduction creates pressure on other sources."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Budget Control Act and the Fiscal Cliff", "paragraphs": ["The BCA, the result of months of negotiation, combined a multistep increase in the debt ceiling with proposals to begin reducing the deficit. As part of the legislation increasing the debt ceiling, the BCA adopted caps that cut discretionary spending by $741 billion from FY2012 to FY2021. Along with mandatory spending reductions of $20 billion and savings in interest of $156 billion, these measures were estimated to reduce deficits by $916 billion over the FY2012-FY2021 period. The act also directed a newly created joint committee, composed of 12 members (3 each from the House majority, the House minority, the Senate majority, and the Senate minority) to find an additional $1.2 trillion over 10 years in deficit reduction for a total of 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) over that period from the act. In addition, the plan contained a process and enforcement mechanism. The committee was unable to reach agreement by the deadline of November 23, 2011, setting into motion automatic spending cuts ( sequestration ) that took effect on January 1, 2013.", "Congress faced, at the end of 2012, the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would increase revenues by 1.5% of GDP. In addition, at the end of 2012, some other temporary tax cut and expenditure provisions were scheduled to expire, including the 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax and some temporary increases in unemployment benefits. These reductions in spending were set to occur in addition to the cuts contained in the BCA, and the full set of spending cuts and tax increases came to be referred to as the fiscal cliff . Concern developed about the fiscal cliff's short-run contractionary effects on the economy. At the end of the 112 th Congress, the American Taxpayer Relief Act ( P.L. 112-240 ) made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent. Some other tax cuts (although not the payroll tax reduction) were extended, reductions under the BCA were delayed (and a portion of them were eliminated), and unemployment benefits continued for another year. These actions reduced, but did not eliminate, the contractionary effect of the fiscal cliff. In December 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ) increased the discretionary spending caps for FY2014 and FY2015. The caps for FY2016 and later years were not changed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Timing of Deficit Reductions", "paragraphs": ["How much should be done to address the budget issues, and how quickly, is a topic of some debate. As noted above in relation to the fiscal cliff, there was concern about front-loading deficit reduction at a time when the economy was operating well below potential. The economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 recession was slow, although by October 2014 the unemployment rate had dropped to 5.8%, close to the full employment rate. At that time, labor force participation was still below prerecession levels, as was part-time and long-term unemployment. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the output gap (the difference between potential and actual output) was at 3.5%. ", "For that reason, some believed the deficit should not be significantly reduced until the economy fully recovered. Indeed, although the budget plan agreed upon on August 2, 2011, had limited spending cuts in FY2012, critics of the plan suggested at that time that it might be inappropriate given current economic conditions. Others suggested it did not go far enough. However, the budget plan may be viewed as an initial step toward addressing the long-run budget challenges.", "A case can also be made that once the economy recovered it would be important to move quickly to address the deficit. The greater the debt-to-GDP ratio grows, the more burdensome interest payments become and the more the debt compounds. For example, in CBO's long-run budget projections, under the agency's alternative baseline, which reflects current services, interest payments are projected to rise to 3.3% of output by FY2024 and 4.7% by FY2039. CBO also projects that a sustained reduction in the deficit of 1.2% of GDP would be required to stabilize debt at 74% of GDP, its current level, under the standard baseline, whereas a 2.6% cut would be required to bring debt to the average of the last 40 years (39%). If the reduction is delayed for 5 years, the required decreases would be 1.5% and 3.2% of GDP; if delayed for 10 years, 2.1% and 4.3% of GDP. ", "The need to not move too slowly can also affect the optimal approaches to deficit reduction. For example, it is difficult to change current entitlements for the elderly (such as Social Security, Medicare, and part of Medicaid, which funds nursing home care). Many already-retired individuals have little leeway to adjust to such changes and could be particularly burdened by benefit reductions, which suggests that benefit changes be adopted in the near term but applicable to the future. Changing discretionary spending or increasing taxes can be achieved more quickly, although, as discussed below, the long-run gap between spending and taxes is too large to be addressed with discretionary spending revisions alone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Budget Issues: Overview", "paragraphs": ["Addressing a federal budget deficit that is unsustainable over the long run involves choices. Fundamentally, the issues require deciding what government goods, services, and transfers are worth paying taxes for. Most people would agree that the country benefits from a wide range of government services\u2014air traffic controllers, border security, courts and corrections, and so forth\u2014provided by the federal government. Yet, as shown below, federal government provision of goods and services, outside of defense, constituted only 10% of federal spending and 2% of GDP in 2007, the last normal year before the recession. Transfers, including interest payments, accounted for around 70% of the federal budget. Finding budget savings by reducing nondefense federal government services alone would fall short of what is needed to address the deficit.", "Transfers, including interest payments, accounted for 75% of the federal budget in FY2014, up from the 70% figure from FY2007. Outside of the 10% for provision of domestic goods, defense spending for goods and services constitutes about 20% of federal spending. In this area as well, there are limits to the savings that might be found without compromising national security. Therefore, to address the budget shortfalls facing the country over the long run, it is likely that transfer payments to or on behalf of individuals (such as Social Security and Medicare), which already account for almost half of federal spending and are growing, must be reduced; transfers to state and local governments must be reduced (which would shift the budget problem to a different level of government); taxes must be raised; or some combination of the above. ", "The next section of this report examines the allocation of government spending, the method of its financing, and how these shares and sources have changed over time. It demonstrates that the surge in the debt is a recent phenomenon that has occurred with the recession and is inherently transitory. Going forward, however, as shown in the subsequent section, the growth in transfers to the elderly and spending for health car\u2014a trend that has been under way for some time but was offset by a decline in spending for other purposes, relative to GDP\u2014will increasingly contribute to unsustainable deficits. The following section addresses philosophies for approaching deficit reduction, as embodied in a number of proposals. It discusses how different approaches to and constraints imposed on deficit reduction will have consequences for the menus of other choices available. For example, if deficit reduction begins with a constraint that taxes will not rise, policy would almost certainly require significant cutbacks in Social Security and Medicare. If the benefits of these programs are to be maintained, an increase in taxes would likely be required. ", "Central findings of this analysis include the following:", "A comparatively small share of federal spending is for direct provision of domestic government goods and services, which many people may think of when considering federal spending. Because this spending is normally about 10% of total federal spending and about 2% of GDP, whereas deficits excluding interest are projected to be 2% to 7% by FY2039, cutting this type of spending alone cannot realistically contain the problem of unsustainable deficits. Transfers and payments to persons and to state and local governments constitute most of federal spending, about 70% or more. Defense spending, accounting for about 20% of federal spending, has declined as a share of output over the past 35 years, but it also tends to vary depending, in part, on the presence and magnitude of international conflicts. Until the recent recession, most types of nondefense spending had been constant or declining as a percentage of output, but spending on programs for the elderly and health care have been rising. Although some recent increases in the debt can be attributed to the Bush tax cuts and the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with growth in spending on the elderly and health, the concern about the debt is not the result of prolonged and large deficits in the past. Debt grew during the recession and its aftermath. Debt held by the public had actually declined from almost 50% of GDP in 1993 to 33% in 2001; it rose slightly to 36% by 2007. During the first three recession and recovery years (2008 through 2010), it rose to 62%. With many of the Bush tax cuts made permanent and a slow recovery, it eventually rose to 74% by FY2014. It is projected to stabilize for a period of time and then grow, reaching 106% or more of GDP by FY2039. The problem with the debt lies not in the past but in the future, as growth in spending for health and Social Security is projected to continue. Because much of the pressure on future spending arises from imbalances in Social Security and Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) trust funds, keeping these funds and their source of financing intact is a concern that could constrain choices. Reductions in discretionary spending are insufficient to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level, so limiting taxes as a percentage of output or constraining the overall size of the government to current levels would likely require significant cuts in mandatory spending, including entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Preserving entitlements would likely require significant increases in taxes, such as raising rates, reducing tax expenditures, increasing other taxes, or introducing new revenue sources. Tax expenditures may be difficult to eliminate, but they may be a reasonable source of new revenue if not used to lower rates. Addressing the eventual Social Security trust fund shortfall largely with tax increases would smooth the burden of accommodating longer lives across both working and retirement years. This argument might apply in part to Medicare and Medicaid issues. Because the federal government provides about one-fifth of the revenue for state and local governments, cutbacks in transfers to these governments may, in part, shift the burden of providing services from the national to subnational governments rather than altering the overall size of government services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Spending and Taxes: Patterns over Time", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of government spending and taxes are generally viewed as providing for public and quasi-public goods, such as defense, law enforcement, infrastructure, and education; correcting market failures, including externalities (both negative, such as pollution, and positive, such as research and development); achieving distributive justice; and managing business cycles. Measured by amount of spending, the most important pure public good the federal government provides is defense. Many public and quasi-public goods, as well as income-support programs, are provided by state and local governments, and some federal spending is through grants to state and local governments for these programs. For example, in the state and local governments' FY2007, state governments received 21% of total revenues from federal transfers and local governments received 3.6%. States also provide transfers to local governments, and local governments provide transfers among themselves as well. These intergovernmental transfers are important in evaluating budget proposals because a reduction in transfers to state and local governments may in large part shift the burden to these governments rather than reduce the overall government role.", "Spending in the U.S. budget can be divided in various ways that are relevant to considering deficit reduction. In the remainder of this section, government spending is divided by whether the spending is to provide public goods or transfers, whether it is discretionary or mandatory (and the major categories within those divisions), and by function. This section also discusses taxes by source, tax structure, tax expenditures, and receipts and payments in the major trust funds. The first approach to presenting spending distinguishes between the provision of goods and services (defense and nondefense) and transfers to persons or to state and local governments. This approach is not a typical way of presenting budget data. It is important to divide spending in this way, however, to address concerns about potential inefficiency in federal government operations, especially outside of defense, as it indicates the scope for cutbacks relative to the deficit. The second approach divides spending into discretionary (requiring appropriations) and mandatory (embodied in laws providing entitlements to benefits). It is associated with the procedures needed to alter spending. The third, also a common way of presenting budget data, divides spending by function (defense, education, energy, health, etc.). "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Distribution of Spending By Fundamental Economic Form: Government Goods and Services Versus Transfers", "paragraphs": ["One way to look at spending is to examine the extent to which spending involves actual government consumption or production (that is, spending on the direct provision of goods and services) as compared with transfers. In calendar year 2007, a more normal year than the recent recession years, only 29% of government spending involved the direct provision of goods and services. Of the remaining payments, 45% were transfers to persons, 13% transfers to state and local governments, 11% interest payments, and 2% subsidies. Although federal government spending amounted to 20.6% of output in 2007, spending by the federal government on the provision of public and quasi-public goods was only 6% of output. Based on budget data reported subsequently, 3.9% was for defense, leaving 2.1% for nondefense. Because total nondefense discretionary spending was 3.6% of GDP, 40% of this amount was transfers. By the third quarter of 2014, as the economy was approaching full employment, consumption spending had declined to 5.6% of output, whereas transfers and interest had increased. Government spending on nondefense goods and services was 2.6% of GDP, and defense spending was 3%. Budget data for FY2014 indicate that discretionary spending was 6.9% of GDP, with defense spending at 3.4% and nondefense at 3.5%. Thus, a quarter of nondefense spending, about 1% of GDP, was transfers at that time. ", "State and local government spending (netting out transfers between these remaining two levels of government spending) in 2007 was 14% of output, and total spending by all forms of government (after netting out federal transfers) was 32% of output. A larger share of state and local spending (which includes federal government transfers), 50%, was in government provision of goods and services (consumption), with 39% transfers to persons, 9% interest payments, and 1% subsidies. In the third quarter of 2014, state and local spending net of federal transfers was 11%, for a total of 34% for all governments. Provision of goods and services was 66%; transfers were 25%; and interest was 8%. ", "Combining all levels of government, government production of goods and services in 2007 was 16% of output, so the federal government share (6%) was 38% on the total provided by all levels of government. Subtracting 4% from the federal government share and the total share to eliminate national defense spending (shown subsequently), the federal share of nondefense provision of goods and services by all levels of government was 17%. In 2014, the nondefense share had declined to 15%, with the federal share (6% of output) remaining at 38%. ", "Similar results are found when examining employment levels. Total government civilian employment is 16% of total nonagricultural employment, with the federal government accounting for 2%, the state government accounting for 4%, and local government accounting for the remainder (11%). By October 2014, the share remained about 16%, and each level of government maintained approximately the same shares (with local government falling to 10%).", "The share of federal government spending that goes to the direct provision of public or quasi-public goods (consumption) has declined over time, as shown in Table 1 , which compares 1971 with 2007 and 2014. The decline from 9% of GDP in 1971 to 6% of GDP in 2007 is largely due to a reduction in defense spending, which was higher in 1971 during the Vietnam War.", "The discussion in this section indicates that although total spending as a percentage of GDP grew by about a percentage point between 1971 and 2007, government involvement in the economy, narrowly defined as using resources to provide public goods directly, had fallen by a third and, outside of defense, had remained roughly constant and small (at around 2% of output). At the same time, transfers to persons increased by more than 40% and transfers to state and local governments increased by more than a third. Spending rose another 2% of GDP by 2014, primarily due to transfers to persons, whereas consumption declined.

Interest payments are listed separately because they are a consequence of past spending and tax policies. Discretionary spending is determined in the annual appropriations process and is normally divided into defense and nondefense categories. It is also sometimes divided into security and nonsecurity spending, although security spending outside of defense is small. Discretionary spending is where most of the public provision of goods and services occurs, but some discretionary spending is in the form of transfers. Mandatory spending is governed by a set of permanent provisions, and some of these programs (such as Social Security and Medicare) are referred to as entitlements. These types of spending are listed in Table 2 as a percentage of output.", "Since 1971, defense spending has declined as a share of output, first as a result of the ending of the Vietnam War (by FY1981, defense spending was 5.2% of output). It rose in the 1980s and then fell, reaching 3.0% by 2001, before rising again with the Afghanistan and (second) Iraq wars. This pattern suggests that although defense spending may generally grow with the economy and be affected by other factors (such as moving to an all-volunteer force or the peacetime buildup in the 1980s), it also fluctuates depending on whether the United States is engaged in international conflicts.", "Nondefense discretionary spending has fluctuated much less, although it rose in the late 1970s, then reverted back to historical levels. Nondefense discretionary funding, although small as a share of the budget and of GDP, is largely the spending that many people think of when they think of the direct provision of goods and services by the federal government. ", "What does nondefense discretionary spending include? About 16% is education, training, employment, and social services, and the vast majority of this spending is for elementary and secondary education for disadvantaged and special-needs children. A similar share, about 15%, goes to transportation, with about half related to highways, almost a quarter air transport, and about one-sixth mass transit, as well as small shares for marine and railroad transportation. About 11% is for income security (mostly low-income housing assistance); 10% is for health research and public health; 10% is for veterans' benefits; 9% is for international purposes (about half of which is for humanitarian and development aid and about 15% is funding for the State Department); and 9% is for administration of justice (border security, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration, courts and corrections). Finally, about 6% is for the environment and natural resources (of this, about one-quarter goes to the Environmental Protection Agency, one-quarter is for the Army Corps of Engineers, 15% is for the forest service, and the remainder is for parks, fish, and wildlife and national oceanic and atmospheric programs). About 5% is for general space and science (about half of that is for the space program). As noted in the discussion above, nontransfer domestic spending is 2% of GDP. In 2007, less than half (40%) of total discretionary nondefense spending was for transfers, such as highway funds and grants provided to state and local governments.", "Thus, any one program area is modest as a share of output, which means that cuts in a particular area would also be small. For example, total spending on the entire federal domestic enforcement program, including immigration and the border patrol, federal courts and prosecutors, federal prisons, and the FBI, constitutes only three-tenths of 1% of output, and even a significant cutback in this spending would be small compared with projected deficits of 3.8 percentage points of GDP by FY2024.", "Mandatory spending, although it varies over time, increased over the period FY1971 through FY2007 and again in FY2013. The increase is most pronounced for Medicare, which provides health care for the elderly and has grown relative to GDP due to rising health care costs, certain other benefit changes, aging, and increased life spans. Social Security has also grown relative to GDP, although by a smaller amount, due to aging and longer life expectancy of the population. A significant percentage of Medicaid benefits the elderly (largely through long-term care), and its growth has also been influenced by increased life spans as well as costs. Other mandatory programs that provide benefits for low-income individuals, the unemployed, retirement programs for federal workers, and other purposes (such as agricultural support payments) have remained relatively constant or declined between FY1971 and FY2007. The rise in some of these programs between FY2007 and FY2013 is probably due to the effects of the recession."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Spending by Function", "paragraphs": ["Another traditional way of viewing the budget is by budget function relating to the area of spending (education, health, etc.). These comparisons, shown in Table 3 , provide a similar picture to the previous allocation: although total spending as a share of output has remained about the same from FY1971 to FY2007, the federal government has an increasing share of output in health and programs for the elderly, with declining shares for almost every other functional category. In 2007, 64% of spending was for human resources, with 20% for defense, 9% for interest, and 7% for all other functions. These ratios were similar in FY2013.

The individual income tax, the largest single source of revenue as a percentage of GDP, was about the same in FY1971, FY2007, and FY2013, but over the time period it fluctuated considerably. Individual income tax revenues grew during the 1970s due to bracket creep, reaching 9.4% in FY1981. The tax cuts in the Reagan Administration are the major reason revenues declined, falling to 7.6% in FY1992. Revenues increased slightly with the 1993 Clinton Administration tax increase, but the more significant growth occurred with the strong economic performance in the late 1990s, leading to a ratio of 9.7% in FY2001. They declined during the first decade of the 21 st century following the George W. Bush Administration tax cuts. Along with the individual income tax, total taxes have also fluctuated, dropping as low as 17.1% in FY1977 and rising as high as 20.6% in FY2001. The lower level in FY2013 reflects, in part, the lingering effects of the recession. ", "Corporate taxes have fluctuated as well, although largely due to economic conditions, whereas payroll taxes rose to around their current levels by the mid-1980s, reached a peak of 6.8% in 2001, and have since declined slightly. Excise taxes have declined by two thirds, and other revenue sources have remained about the same. Part of the decline in excise taxes is because these taxes are imposed on a per unit basis and not indexed for inflation and, with the exception of tobacco taxes, have not been recently increased."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Structure", "paragraphs": ["These revenue sources differ in some important ways. Individual and corporate income taxes are progressive, have graduated rates, and can be revised in a variety of ways, including changing rates, deductions, exclusions, and credits. Income taxes are the main source of revenue for most federal spending outside of Social Security and Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI, whose benefits are about half of Medicare spending). Estate taxes are also progressive, but they are a very small share of government revenues and currently are smaller than they were in FY2007. Payroll taxes, which are significant, and excise taxes, which are small, tend to fall more heavily on middle- and lower-income individuals. ", "Payroll taxes, the next-largest source of revenue after income taxes, have flat rates with an earnings cap for Social Security (but not Medicare). These taxes tend to be proportional, with a reduced burden on high-income taxpayers. Because of their simple structure, the main options for increasing revenues from this source are increasing rates and raising or eliminating the earnings cap. Social Security taxes are the basic source of finance for Social Security, and they are linked to benefits so that larger taxes lead eventually to larger benefits, although there are progressive elements in the benefit formula. Medicare payroll taxes qualify individuals for Medicare HI coverage, but the Medicare benefits are the same for all recipients.", "Excise taxes, which largely apply to alcohol, tobacco, and transportation fuels, tend to be regressive but are also small. Transportation fuel taxes are a major source of finance for highways, airports, and other transportation needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Tax expenditures are revenue losses attributable to federal income tax laws that allow a special exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit, preferential rate of tax, or deferral of tax liability. The special tax credits and deductions in the income tax can also be viewed as a form of spending through the tax code. That is, one can view revenues as receipts without the special benefits and think of the special benefits from tax expenditures as spending. In FY2007, without tax expenditures, individual income tax receipts would have been an estimated 77% larger, corporate receipts 25% larger, and overall income tax receipts 39% larger. In FY2014, without tax expenditures, individual income taxes would have been an estimated 75% larger, corporate receipts would have been 44% larger, and overall income tax receipts would have been 39% larger. The significant increase in corporate tax expenditures relative to revenues appears to be largely due an increase in the estimated cost of deferring taxes on foreign source income . According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study, tax expenditures have tended to be around 7.5% of GDP during the period of the study (FY1974-FY2004). In FY2007, tax expenditures were 7.2% of GDP and about 36% of total government direct spending. In FY2014, tax expenditures were 6.9% of GDP and about 39% of government spending. ", "Viewed from the perspective of dividing government activity between transfers and direct provision of public goods, as in Table 1 , tax expenditures are transfers and subsidies that go to persons, as is the case with the bulk of federal spending. Viewed from the perspective of discretionary versus mandatory spending, as in Table 2 , they are similar to a mandatory form of spending. Finally, viewed from the perspective of budget function, as in Table 3 and as shown in Table 5 , which compares spending and tax expenditures by function for FY2004, the pattern of tax expenditures is quite different from that of spending. A much larger share of tax expenditures is for physical resources. For specific subcategories, the largest share of tax expenditures is for commerce and housing, a category that attracts a small share of spending. The size of this category reflects special benefits for earnings from capital income. It also reflects benefits for housing in the form of mortgage interest and property tax deductions and, to a lesser extent, exemption from capital gains tax on owner-occupied housing and the low-income housing credit. The relatively large share for general government reflects tax-exempt bonds and itemized deductions for state and local income and sales taxes.

By FY2013, benefits in all three funds exceeded outlays, although some of that was probably due to lingering effects of the recession. Because initial Social Security benefits are indexed to wages (and subsequently to prices), they tend to be a relatively constant share of output. Benefits have grown because of increasing longevity. Revenues also tend to be a relatively constant share of output but were increased in the mid-1980s, and Medicare as a program expanded significantly in its scope during this period.", "Table 7 provides income and outflow for the SMI trust fund.

Legislated changes in revenues accounted for an estimated 24% of the discrepancy, with most of that amount reflecting the 2001-2003 Bush tax cuts and extensions of these cuts.

Rather, it is a benchmark by which lawmakers can consider changes in policy. For those items (revenues and mandatory spending) that are based on laws other than appropriations, the baseline reflects those laws. Because of that convention, in FY2007 the baseline did not allow for some expected tax cuts (such as the indexing of the alternative minimum tax exemption and the extension of temporary tax provisions).

At that point, debt began to rise, reflecting a combination of a recession, lower income taxes, lower spending on nondefense discretionary programs, and higher defense spending. By FY1993, debt held by the public had reached 49.3% of GDP. Following the 1993 tax increase, spending caps, and the strong economic growth in the late 1990s, it declined, reaching 32.5% by FY2001.

The largest contributor to this rise was the decline in income-tax revenues (due largely to the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and their speedups) along with an increase in defense spending and, to a lesser extent, an increase in Medicare payments. (Part of the reason Medicare spending rose was increased payments to physicians. Legislation was adopted in 1997 to limit these payments, the Sustainable Growth Rate [SGR] System, but the cuts required by this legislation have repeatedly been suspended.

As shown in Table 8 and Table 9 , spending increased and revenues declined during this serious recession, both contributing about equally to the deficit increase by FY2010. The increased deficit between these years reflects measures undertaken to combat the recession, along with automatic stabilizer effects (taxes fall and spending rises during a downturn) that increased the deficit by about 2.5% of output between FY2007 and FY2010. (Note that comparing the two years obscures the temporary effect of the Troubled Asset Relief Program; in FY2009. Other mandatory spending was 2.6% of output due to this provision, although there was an offset in FY2010, with the net effect small.) On the spending side, the increases came from income-support programs as well as discretionary domestic spending, whereas on the tax side the primary decrease was in income taxes.

It also incorporated the cuts in the BCA through FY2021. There is no magic number indicating how high this spending should be in relation to output. Nevertheless, recent history has shown that nondefense discretionary spending has been higher in the past and hence cuts would lead to lower level of government services than has traditionally been the case. (Defense spending, as noted above, fluctuates depending on international conflicts, although it has increased to respond to perceived threats or other changes such as an all-volunteer force. Overall, however, it has declined since FY1971.)", "As shown in Table 15 and Table 16 , all of the deficit reduction proposals envisioned lower levels of discretionary spending relative to GDP. At the same time, most of the proposals did not spell out the specific cuts proposed, an important issue given the diversity in the types of programs in nondefense spending. That is, these plans generally directed agencies to cut spending without outlining the specifics. Thus, the plans did not indicate, for example, if fewer prisons will exist, if grants for special-needs children will be reduced, if fewer highways will be built or repaired, etc. However, these reductions might have needed to be significant. For example, the Fiscal Commission proposed cuts that were 18% below the CBO baseline (as shown in Table 16 ).", "Even so, it is unlikely that reductions in discretionary spending could close much of the long-run deficit gap. The Fiscal Commission's proposed cut in discretionary spending, for example, would have reduced overall spending by about 1.3 percentage points of GDP. Yet, as seen in Table 13 , the gap between spending and taxes by FY2039 if present policies continue (alternative scenario) is 17% of GDP. Thus, closing this gap is likely to require cuts in other spending, including entitlements, increases in tax revenues, or a combination. ", "CBO's 2011 study on budget options contained some specific proposals for cuts in discretionary spending, which might suggest the types of cuts that might be considered in these proposals, although most of these were small. For example, consider education, training, employment, and social services, the largest category in domestic discretionary spending. CBO included proposals to eliminate grants for educational opportunities outside school hours for low-income students, limit the availability of grants for college to the neediest students, eliminate national community service funding (which funds AmeriCorps and similar operations), eliminate funding for community-service jobs for low-income individuals over the age of 55, and cut funding for the arts by 25%. Taken together, these changes added up to about $40 billion over 10 years.

Benefits, although they are linked to contributions, are progressive in that the replacement rate for wages falls as wages rise.", "Because of the link between wages and benefits, many viewed Social Security as much like a pension, with income in retirement earned through contributions. With Social Security, there was a link between contributions and benefits, although it was not precise and, because the trust fund did not accumulate retirement contributions in the same way as a pension plan (but rather paid most benefits out of current contributions), the trust fund's financing was affected by demographics.

However, beyond that point, the costs remain about the same, falling slightly as the baby boom generation begins to die and then rising as longevity increases. The problem with Social Security funding did not arise from the baby boom; it arose from the increase in life span whose pressures on the system were masked for a time by the growth in the labor force (both from the baby boom and the entry of women into the labor force). Unlike health care, Social Security benefits are not expected to grow continuously but to settle down so that benefits and costs are relatively constant (with benefits slightly greater than 6% and revenues about 5% of GDP). There are, therefore, a range of tax increases, as well as benefit cuts, that could bring the program into permanent balance.

Another option, which affects both taxes and benefits, is to increase the retirement age, although such increases put pressure on the disability-insurance program because some individuals will find it more difficult to work longer.

Because most of these tax cuts were extended, this change would be the equivalent of a rate increase currently. The barriers for rate increases might be viewed as largely political rather than technical, and top tax rates in the past have been much higher than they are today. Allowing the temporary tax provisions to expire and including real bracket creep was reflected in the difference between the CBO standard and alternative baselines and accounted for 2.7% by FY2022.", "Although tax expenditures have received much attention and are included in budget proposals, policy makers face significant political and technical barriers to implementing changes. Some tax expenditures are technically difficult to eliminate (especially employer fringe benefits), some are valued as part of the social safety net (such as the earned income credit or exclusion of transfers), some are desirable for other reasons, and some are so politically popular (e.g., the home mortgage interest deduction) that eliminating them or scaling them back could be difficult. ", "For example, considering technical challenges alone, the largest individual tax expenditure is the exclusion of employer health insurance, which accounts for 11% of the total revenue foregone. As discussed during the health reform debate, however, fairly designing an inclusion is very difficult because the value of insurance varies, for example, with the age of the employee and other characteristics. If not allowed to vary by age, young employees who work for firms with higher average employee ages will be imputed more income than employees working for firms with younger employees. Potentially more serious imputation problems arise with the third-largest tax expenditure (the exclusion of pension contributions and earnings), which accounts for 9% of the total. Problems arise with regard to this tax expenditure because of defined benefit pension plans, whose benefits are difficult to allocate because they ultimately depend on future work history with the firm. ", "At the same time, many of the proposals discussed in Table 20 also envision eliminating tax expenditures to lower rates. If used to generate additional revenue, reducing tax expenditures could result in significant progress toward reducing the deficit. One study, for example, suggests that a more realistic appraisal of tax expenditure options, taking into account technical barriers, political barriers, and justification for some provisions, would increase income-tax revenues by about 15%. In the earlier CBO alternative baseline, income-tax revenues would have been about 10.6% in FY2021, suggesting increased revenues of 1.6% of GDP. This increase is about two-thirds of the difference in revenues between the regular and alternative CBO baselines, which reflected the Bush tax cuts, other temporary provisions, and some real bracket creep (growth in revenues because real incomes are rising). ", "Two other types of taxes that might be altered are the payroll and excise taxes. For example, some proposals have included a provision for raising or eliminating the cap on earnings for payroll taxes. Other options include raising rates and expanding the base to include fringe benefits, such as pension contributions and health care. (Imputing income, however, as noted above, may be problematic.) A number of options could significantly extend solvency to the Social Security trust fund. Revenue could also be raised by taxing Social Security benefits in the same way as pensions, and this revenue, although considered as part of tax expenditures, could be designated to finance Social Security benefits.", "In addition, proposals have included increases in gasoline taxes to provide additional funding for highways and increases in alcohol taxes, whose real value has been declining since 1991 and would be an estimated 60% higher if they had been indexed to inflation since then.", "Finally, there are options for additional types of taxes. Three new tax sources that have been included in the proposals are value-added taxes, carbon taxes (revenue could also be collected through an auction of carbon rights through a cap-and-trade system), and taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. Both value-added taxes and carbon taxes could raise significant amounts of additional revenues.", "These revenue sources differ in the incentives they create and also in their progressivity. Because income taxes tend to fall more heavily than other taxes on high-income individuals and tax expenditures tend to benefit higher-income individuals, these changes would likely add to the progressivity of the system. Changes in payroll rates would tend to be proportional and affect higher-income individuals less, although raising the wage cap would concentrate the effect on higher-income workers. Flat rate consumption taxes, including value-added taxes, carbon taxes, and specific excise taxes (such as those on gasoline, alcohol, and sugared beverages) tend to be regressive. A combination of changes could, however, achieve approximately the same distribution as current revenues.

Because the details of discretionary spending (other than caps and limits) are not generally spelled out, some of this reduction could reduce transfers to state and local governments in areas such as education, transportation, and community development. In addition, many entitlements, both for health and income security, are administered by the state and local governments with federal transfers. One of the largest of these programs is Medicaid, which the House Republican Budget proposal restricts to a block grant that grows at population rates plus inflation rates. As noted above, federal transfers to state and local governments are 2.8% of output and constitute 21% of the receipts of these governments. State and local governments also benefit from tax expenditures that allow itemized deductions for state and local taxes and exclusions for interest on state and local bonds. Depending on how these governments respond, restrictions that affect state and local transfers could largely shift the burden of spending from federal to subnational governments.
