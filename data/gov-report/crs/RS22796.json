If the Medicare trustees determine that general revenue funding for Medicare is expected to exceed 45% of Medicare outlays for the current fiscal year or any of the next six fiscal years, a determination of excess general revenue Medicare funding is made. If the determination is issued for two consecutive years, a funding warning is issued which triggers certain presidential and congressional actions (Sections 802-804 of the MMA). Specifically, in the event of a funding warning, the President would be required to submit to Congress proposed legislation to respond to the funding warning within 15 days of submitting a budget for the succeeding year, and Congress would then be required to consider that legislation on an expedited basis.", "Because a determination of excess general revenue Medicare funding was issued in both the 2006 and the 2007 Medicare trustees' reports, the President was required to submit a legislative proposal to Congress within 15 days of submitting his FY2009 budget (in 2008) that would lower the ratio to the 45% level. Similarly, each of the subsequent annual reports of the Boards of Trustees through 2013 included an estimate that general revenue funding would exceed 45% at some point during the current or six subsequent fiscal years, thus triggering a response from the President and Congress. President George W. Bush submitted such a proposal in 2008, but no related legislation has been enacted.", "In each of their 2014 through 2016 reports, the Medicare trustees projected that general revenue Medicare funding would not exceed 45% of total Medicare outlays within seven fiscal years. Therefore, the Medicare trustees did not issue funding warnings in those years, and the President was not required to submit related legislative proposals subsequent to the release of the FY2015 through FY2019 budgets. However, in both their 2017 and 2018 reports, the Medicare trustees issued a determination of projected excess general revenue Medicare funding. Because such a determination was made in two consecutive years, a funding warning has been triggered and the MMA provides that the President will be required to submit a responsive legislative proposal after the release of his FY2020 budget (in 2019).", "The Medicare funding warning focuses attention on the impact of program spending on the federal budget, and it provides one measure of the financial health of the program. However, some options for reducing general revenue spending below the 45% level would have a greater impact than others.

An affirmative determination in two consecutive annual reports is considered to be a Medicare funding warning in the year in which the second report is made.

The 2013 report was the eighth consecutive time that the threshold was estimated to be exceeded within the first seven years of the projection, and it was the seventh time that a Medicare funding warning was triggered. ", "However, the Medicare Trustees Reports issued in 2014, 2015, and 2016, projected that Medicare general revenue funding would not exceed 45% of total Medicare outlays within the next seven years. Therefore, the Medicare trustees did not issue determinations of excess general revenues and funding warnings were not triggered in those years. No response was required of the President or Congress in 2015, 2016, 2017, or 2018. ", "Specifically, in their 2014 and 2015 reports, the Medicare trustees projected that the expected higher tax income and lower outlays due to provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; P.L. 111-148 ) and other legislation would result in general revenue funding remaining below the 45% threshold over the next seven years. For similar reasons, as well as a recent slowing in Medicare spending, the Medicare trustees estimated in their 2016 report that general revenue funding would remain below the 45% threshold through FY2022. ", "In their 2017 report, however, the Medicare trustees projected that general revenues would exceed the 45% threshold in FY2023, within the seven-year projection window.

Similarly, in their 2018 report, the trustees estimated that general revenues would exceed the 45% threshold in FY2022 (at the end of CY2021), also within the seven-year projection window, and thus issued a determination of excess general revenue Medicare funding (see Figure 1 ).

The requirement that the President submit proposed legislation in response to a funding warning does not apply, however, if, \"during the year in which the warning is made,\" Congress enacts legislation to eliminate excess general revenue Medicare funding for the seven-fiscal year reporting period, as certified by the Medicare trustees within 30 days of the legislation's enactment. ", "The executive branch has generally taken the position that, under the Constitution's Recommendation Clause, Congress cannot compel the President, or executive branch officials, to submit legislative proposals directly to Congress. These objections have been registered in numerous presidential signing statements and Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel opinions, and have repeatedly been asserted in litigation. For example, upon signing the MMA on December 8, 2003, President George W. Bush issued a signing statement registering his constitutional objections to Section 802's requirement that the President submit proposed legislation to Congress in response to a Medicare funding warning. Specifically, President Bush noted that his Administration would construe Section 802 \"in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to recommend for the consideration of the Congress such measures as the President judges necessary and expedient.\" Similarly, the Obama Administration considered \"the requirement to submit legislation in response to the Medicare funding warning to be advisory and not binding, in accordance with the Recommendations Clause of the Constitution.\"", "Notwithstanding his objections to Section 802, President Bush submitted legislation in 2008 responding to the Medicare trustees' 2007 funding warning. No action was taken on the President's proposal. Although the Medicare trustees issued warnings each year from 2007 through 2013, no additional legislative proposals have been submitted to Congress pursuant to Section 802. Since the Medicare trustees did not issue funding warnings in their 2014, 2015, 2016, or 2017 reports, the President was not required to submit related legislation subsequent to the submission of his FY2015 through FY2019 budgets. However, as the Medicare trustees issued a funding warning in their 2018 report, the MMA provides that the President will be required to submit a responsive legislative proposal after the release of his FY2020 budget.", "The Recommendation Clause provides that the President \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the state of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\" Courts have rarely been presented with the opportunity to interpret the scope of this clause. However, the text of the clause, read in conjunction with analogous case law, does not appear to support an interpretation that would prevent Congress from directing the President to submit legislative recommendations. The clause is perhaps most accurately characterized as establishing a right as opposed to a substantive source of authority \u2014ensuring that the President may submit directly to Congress legislative proposals that he views as \"necessary and expedient.\" Thus, this right would appear only to be infringed where Congress prevents the President from submitting his own legislative proposal or attempts to dictate the contents of a required legislative proposal. Under this reading, it is unlikely that Congress imposes an excessive burden on the President where it merely directs the President to submit a proposal, the contents of which remain within the President's discretion, in response to a specific trigger. Whereas the Department of Justice may assert that \"any bill purporting to require the submission of recommendations is unconstitutional,\" no judicial decision has accepted such a broad proposition.

However, the formula used to determine excess general revenue Medicare funding combines revenue streams from both the HI and SMI Trust Funds.", "Because of the way that the trigger formula is structured, the various methods that could be used to reduce the general revenue Medicare funding percentage would not necessarily reduce federal general revenue outlays (used to finance Parts B and D) or reduce the percentage in direct proportion to reductions in total spending.", "Specifically, to reduce the percentage, one could increase dedicated financing (e.g., payroll taxes or premiums) or reduce outlays (HI and/or SMI spending), or some combination of the two. In the example presented in Table 1 below, applying FY2012 CBO estimates to the equation shown in the \" The Medicare Trigger \" section of this report, the total expected outlays of $585.0 billion and $289.3 billion in dedicated revenues results in a level of general revenue funding of about 50.5%. Given this scenario, one option to reduce the general revenue percentage to 45% would be to increase payroll taxes by an amount sufficient to raise an additional $32.5 billion in dedicated revenues. ", "Another option would be to decrease total outlays by reducing Part A (HI Trust Fund) spending. However, because the total Medicare outlays measure is included in both the top and bottom parts of the mathematical formula (i.e., the denominator as well as the numerator is reduced), a reduction in outlays would have less of an effect than an increase in dedicated revenues on the percentage of general revenue funding. Therefore a reduction of $59.0 billion in Part A funding would be needed to reduce general revenue funding to 45% (in contrast to the $32.5 billion increase in taxes). While the above options of increasing the payroll tax or lowering Part A spending would eliminate excess general revenue Medicare funding as defined under the Medicare trigger, these options would have no impact on actual federal general revenue spending (used to finance Parts B and D outlays) because Part A is primarily funded through payroll taxes.", "Similarly, continuing with the examples in Table 1 , one could reach the 45% general revenue spending level by increasing beneficiaries' Part B premiums by a percentage that would increase dedicated revenues by $32.5 billion. Although total Medicare outlays would remain the same, the general revenue percentage as defined by the trigger calculation and the level of Medicare spending financed through federal general revenues would both decline under this scenario. ", "Alternatively, Part B outlays could be reduced. However, because approximately 25% of SMI spending is financed by premiums, income from premiums (which are calculated based on expected outlays) would also be reduced under this option (i.e., a reduction in Part B outlays would be partially offset by a reduction in dedicated revenues). Therefore, greater spending reductions would be needed under Part B than under Part A to achieve the same amount of reduction in the general revenue funding percentage. In this example, a reduction in Part B outlays of $108.2 billion would be needed to bring down the level of general revenue funding to 45%."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "paragraphs": ["Excess general revenue Medicare funding is one measure that can be used to depict the financial status of the Medicare program.

Opponents of the measure suggest that it does not adequately recognize a shift toward the provision of more services on an outpatient basis (thus shifting spending from Medicare Part A to Part B) or the impact of the Part D program on general revenue increases, and that other measures such as Medicare spending as a portion of total federal spending, are better ways to determine the health of the Medicare program."], "subsections": []}]}}
