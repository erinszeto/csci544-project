Congress views the stability of the nation with great concern and commitment to improving conditions there. The Obama Administration considers Haiti its top priority in the Latin American and Caribbean region. Both Congress and the international community have invested significant resources in the political, economic, and social development of Haiti, and have closely monitored the election process as a prelude to the next steps in Haiti's development. For the past 25 years, Haiti has been making the transition from a legacy of authoritarian rule to a democratic government. Elections are a part of that process. In the short term, elections have usually been a source of increased political tensions and instability in Haiti. In the long term, elected governments in Haiti have contributed to the gradual strengthening of government capacity and transparency.", "Haiti has concluded its latest election cycle, although it is still finalizing the results of a few legislative seats. The United States provided $16 million in election support through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Like many of the previous Haitian elections, the recent process has been riddled with political tensions, violence, allegations of irregularities, and low voter turnout. The first round of voting for president and the legislature, held on November 28, 2010, was marred by opposition charges of fraud, especially in the presidential race. The Haitian government asked the Organization of American States (OAS) for help and delayed releasing final results, while the OAS team of international elections experts investigated and verified the process. On February 3, following the OAS team's recommendations, the Haitian Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) reversed their original finding by eliminating Jude Celestin, the governing party's candidate, from the race by a narrow margin. Instead, Michel \"Sweet Micky\" Martelly, a popular singer, proceeded to the run-off race against Mirlande Manigat, a constitutional lawyer and university administrator.", "After months of dispute, the second round of elections took place on March 20. The OAS electoral observation mission reported that the second round was more organized, transparent, and peaceful than the first. When final results were announced, controversy again erupted, this time over legislative races. The CEP's final tallies changed the outcome in favor of the ruling Inite party for 19 legislative districts. Under pressure from the public and the OAS mission, the CEP eventually reverted to 15 of the 19 original results; four seats in the chamber of deputies are still to be decided. The outcome of the presidential race was not challenged, and Michel Martelly was sworn into office peacefully on May 14. Local elections are due to be held, but haven't yet been scheduled.", "President Martelly is having difficulty forming his administration. The legislature passed several constitutional amendments in a flurry of activity in its first three weeks. Since then it has focused on the selection of a prime minister. The majority Inite parliament blocked Martelly's first choice, and over half of the Senate asked him to rescind his second candidate.", "In addition to ongoing issues regarding the legitimacy of the March 20 elections, other questions have raised concerns within the international community and Congress. These include the destabilizing presence of former dictator Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier and former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and the newly elected government's ability to handle the complex post-earthquake reconstruction process and its relationship with the donor community."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress views the stability of Haiti with great concern and commitment to improving conditions there.

Known as \"Baby Doc,\" Duvalier came to power in 1971, succeeding his father, Francois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier, who had ruled since 1957. Their 29-year dictatorship was marked by repression and corruption. Hoping to reverse almost 200 years of mostly violent and authoritarian rule, Haitians overwhelmingly approved a new constitution creating a democratic government in 1987. De facto military rule, coups and thwarted attempts at democratic elections continued until a provisional civilian government conducted what was widely heralded as Haiti's first free and fair elections in 1990, in which Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former Catholic priest, was elected President. In the short term, elections have usually been a source of increased political tensions and instability in Haiti. ", "In the long term, elections in Haiti have contributed to the slow strengthening of government capacity and transparency. Elected governments have developed long-term development plans resulting in international technical and financial assistance. They have developed national budgets and made them public. The number of employees in bloated state enterprises has been reduced. The government carried out the fiscal management and transparency reforms necessary to qualify for debt relief from multilateral and some bilateral creditors under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in 2009. Human rights violations have been drastically reduced. Despite controversy over some aspects of the 2006 elections, Pr\u00e9val was accepted as the legitimate head of state by Haitians and the world community, and oversaw a period of economic growth and relative internal political stability before a devastating earthquake struck the nation in January 2010.", "There is still much to be accomplished. Some parts of the government are not fully independent, the judicial system is weak, and corruption and political violence still threaten the nation's stability. Haitian governance capacities, already limited, were considerably diminished by the earthquake. Poverty is massive and deep, and there is extreme economic disparity between a small privileged class and the majority of the population.", "The United States and other members of the international community continue to support efforts to hold free and fair elections in Haiti in the belief that in the long run they will contribute to improved governance and, eventually, improved services to Haitian citizens and greater stability which will allow for increased development. Congress has given bipartisan support to this policy approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background to the Recent Elections", "paragraphs": ["The road to democratic development has been bumpy, and the international community became increasingly involved in trying to keep Haiti on that road. Aristide was overthrown in a military coup eight months after he was inaugurated. For three years, the coup leaders resisted international demands that Aristide be restored to office. Only when faced with a U.S. military intervention did the regime relent. Aristide returned in 1994 under the protection of some 20,000 U.S. troops, who transferred responsibility to a United Nations mission in 1995. With U.S. assistance, President Aristide disbanded the army and began to train a professional civilian police force. In 1996 Haitians saw their first transfer of power between two democratically elected presidents when Aristide was succeeded by Rene Pr\u00e9val.", "Subsequent elections held under Presidents Aristide and Pr\u00e9val, both of whom served two non-consecutive terms, were marred by alleged irregularities, low voter turnout, and opposition boycotts. Some election conflicts left Haiti without a fully functioning government, as when most of the legislators' terms expired in 1999 without elections being held to replace them. President Pr\u00e9val then ruled by decree for the remaining two years of his first term. The international community, including an OAS mission, tried in vain for several years to mediate negotiations between the Aristide government and the opposition over the elections in which Aristide was reelected in 2000. Tension and political violence continued throughout Aristide's second term, culminating in his flight into exile in 2004, after the refusal of the opposition to negotiate, an armed rebellion, and loss of international support. There were numerous allegations that Aristide was involved in drug trafficking and other corrupt activities. An interim civilian government was formed and oversaw elections in 2006 in which Pr\u00e9val, after a dispute over the vote calculation, was elected to a new term. ", "Since the earthquake that ravaged the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas on January 12, 2010, political stability has been especially uncertain, due to the loss of many political figures and government officials, massive damage to government infrastructure, and mounting frustrations at what is widely perceived as slow progress in reconstruction and distribution of over $9 billion in pledged international assistance. An outbreak of cholera has further complicated the situation.", "At stake in the recent election process were the offices of President, the entire 99-member Chamber of Deputies, and 11 of 30 Senators. The newly elected officials will be responsible for directing reconstruction efforts. Many observers therefore believe that it was especially important that these elections be conducted fairly, so that the new government be accepted as legitimate by both the Haitian public and international donors, including the United States, who are providing technical and financial support to the election process. The Obama Administration, which considers Haiti its top priority in the Latin American and Caribbean region, provided $16 million in election support through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). (See Appendix A for details on U.S. elections assistance to Haiti.) The UN Stabilization Mission for Haiti (MINUSTAH) provided security and technical support for the process.", "Parliamentary elections had originally been scheduled for February 28, 2010, but were postponed because of the earthquake. The terms of all of the Chamber of Deputies and of one-third of the Senate expired on May 10, 2010. Because elections were not held before then, the legislature ceased to function as a whole. Normally, the legislature must approve federal procurement contracts and authorize spending. Before it adjourned, however, the legislature passed a State of Emergency law in April 2010 giving the executive branch those and other broad powers for 18 months, to October 2011. The date mandated in the constitution for any president's inauguration is February 7 (the anniversary of Duvalier's flight into exile). Because of the delays caused by the earthquake, and the difficulty of organizing elections following such a disaster, the legislature also authorized the extension of Pr\u00e9val's term to May 14, if necessary. ", "The President, Senators, and Deputies are elected to serve five-year terms. The constitution limits presidents to two non-consecutive terms. There are no term limits for the legislature, although turnover for its members has been high. The first round of both the presidential and legislative elections took place on November 28, 2010. According to the Haitian constitution, if no candidate receives an absolute majority of the vote, a runoff vote between the top two candidates is held for presidential and Chamber of Deputy seats. For Senate seats, candidates who lack an absolute majority but have at least 20% more votes than the next candidate are declared the winner.

As Director of the National Equipment Center, Celestin oversaw the construction of hundreds of miles of roads that made remote villages and farmlands accessible. He was reportedly described by many as an extremely focused workaholic. Questions had arisen about his background: he claimed an engineering degree from the Swiss Ecole Polytechnique de Lausanne, which reportedly has no records of his attendance or graduation, and he has four properties in Florida in foreclosure.", "Polling at a distant third was Michel Martelly, a famous Haitian kompa dance musician, known for his bawdy performances, and popular with young voters. He acknowledges his political inexperience, but said he would seek expert international advice to guide him in developing foreign investments and tourism to stimulate the economy. Martelly, also a businessman, has personal financial issues. He defaulted on over $1 million in loans and had three properties in Florida go into foreclosure, raising questions about his financial management skills.

The U.S. Embassy stated that it was \"concerned\" by official preliminary results that were \"inconsistent with the published results\" of various domestic and international observers. The CEP's announcement was followed by three days of violent protests, with Martelly supporters charging that fraud had put Celestin ahead, and that their candidate should have placed second. Tensions continued, as various actors called for action across a range of options, including but not limited to, accepting the preliminary results, sending the top three candidates to a run-off (although the constitution calls for only the top two candidates to proceed), holding new elections, or re-counting the ballots.

The expert mission then reviewed the result sheets from all polling places where participation rate was 50% or higher and a single candidate garnered 150 votes or more, and from all polling places where the participation rate was greater than 100%. Using criteria established in Haitian electoral law, the expert mission recommended that votes from some of these polling places be excluded from the final tally. Some votes for all the candidates were excluded because of irregularities; the top three candidates had by far the most votes excluded. The revised tally reversed the second and third place candidates, giving Martelly 22.2%, and Celestin 21.9% of the vote, still less than one percent difference between the two. Manigat remained in first place with 31.6% of the vote.

Any further attacks against UN troops could have been particularly problematic, as MINUSTAH was responsible for providing security for the election process, as well as transportation of ballots and other election material. There are 9,000 MINUSTAH security personnel, and 3,500 Haitian National Police (PNH) providing security. UN officials revised security plans for the second round. An early assessment of the elections issued a reminder that MINUSTAH's mandate is mostly to observe and support the PNH, not to handle situations directly.", "After the first-round elections, the U.S. State Department issued a new travel warning strongly urging U.S. citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Haiti in part because of \"continued high crime, the cholera outbreak, frequent disturbances in Port-au-Prince and in provincial cities, and limited police protection\" and because \"travel within Haiti is hazardous.\" Since the first-round elections, there have been violent protests resulting in deaths. Once the final results were announced, the atmosphere was calmer. Nonetheless, the situation remained volatile.", "Observers of the electoral process also voiced concern about the level of voter participation because it affects the legitimacy of the election's results. In April and June 2009, voter turnout for partial Senate elections was a meager 11% of the electorate. Turnout is usually much higher for presidential elections, however, and the observation mission viewed active campaigning and large numbers of voters going to verification centers as signs that turnout would be healthy. Although turnout was higher than in 2009, it was only about 22% in the first round of the current election process. Some observers wonder if fear of cholera and of violent protests might have suppressed voter turnout.", "In the joint observation mission's November 11 statement, it repeated its concern over the use of state resources during the recent campaign season. The mission appealed \"to the political parties to adhere to the provisions aimed at guaranteeing the fairness of the election race,\" and said that the \"state authorities must ... ensure that agents of the state are not involved in activities related to campaigning.\"", "The OAS/CARICOM mission's October report expressed concern about several technical aspects of the electoral process. The distribution of voter identification cards seemed to be the greatest issue. About 400,000 new cards were printed but distribution was slow. About 4.7 million people have registered to vote, an estimated 95% of the adult population. The report estimated that about 6% of those listed in the voter registry are deceased. This was attributed mostly to the listing of people who died during the earthquake, for most of whom there are no death certificates, which are needed to remove someone's name from the registry. The report noted that safeguards such as photos on the electoral list, the need for a voter identification card, and indelible ink indicating votes had been cast, had been put in place to prevent multiple voting. Registering the internally displaced appeared not to have been as big a problem as some thought it would be, as not that many internally displaced requested replacement identity cards. The majority of displaced people in temporary camps appear to live near their former residences and polling stations, so that few additional polling places for them were needed, according to U.S. officials familiar with election preparations.

In late 2009, President Pr\u00e9val cut ties to the Lespwa movement that elected him in 2006, and formed a new movement, Inite (Unity). Opposition groups accused the presidentially appointed electoral council of bias in favor of the President's new movement. The electoral council disqualified without explanation about 15 rival political groups, which included members of Lespwa who did not join Pr\u00e9val's new party. ", "An assessment of the feasibility of organizing elections after the earthquake stated that the operational branch of the CEP was technically capable of organizing elections, but warned that the lack of credibility of the council as a whole posed a major problem. The report recommended replacing the commission, but the Preval administration chose not to do so. The OAS/CARICOM mission's October report acknowledged that \"the widespread mistrust of the CEP is perhaps by far the major obstacle to the credibility and legitimacy of the elections.\" ", "But the mission suggested that the CEP may be being blamed for some of the shortcomings of previous CEPs and of the Pr\u00e9val administration as well. For example, the previous CEP caused controversy by barring former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas party from participating in legislative elections in April 2009 for mostly technical reasons. Part of the problem was that three rival factions within Lavalas submitted separate lists of candidates. The council rejected all three lists because none of the factions had documents signed by the party's head, Aristide. Aristide lives in exile in South Africa. Although technically correct, some observers felt the decision had a politically motivated element, to prevent the once powerful Lavalas from gaining more seats in the National Assembly. No faction ever produced the required document, however, and so remained ineligible to register legislative candidates. No faction of Fanmi Lavalas tried to register a presidential candidate with the current CEP for the 2010 elections.", "The observation mission's October report notes that the current CEP has been responsive to criticism, improving the transparency of its actions, and communicating more openly with the public, political parties, and civil society organizations. The CEP began to implement some of the improvements recommended by the OAS and other observer missions as soon as they were received following the first round. About 500 poll workers and supervisors at voting centers where fraud and irregularities were high wre fired; education requirements for poll workers were raised to a 12 th grade equivalent; and officials continued to clean up the voter lists. ", "Following the second round, the OAS/CARICOM mission reported that the CEP's efforts had \"positive results,\" and that problems related to the electoral registers and voters finding their polling place \"were far less prevalent\" than they had been in the first round. The mission said that incidents of ballot stuffing and voter intimidation were isolated. ", "Concerns about fraud in the CEP's tabulation process soon emerged, however. As mentioned above, after the CEP announced results for the legislative elections, with final tallies that changed the outcome for 19 districts in favor of the ruling Inite coalition, the OAS/CARICOM mission demanded that those results be annulled. The CEP reverted the outcomes to the original tally in 15 cases; four seats in the chamber of deputies are still to be resolved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legitimacy", "paragraphs": ["An immediate concern for all involved was that the elections, carried out with $16 million in U.S. assistance, was that they be sufficiently free and fair to produce a government considered legitimate in the eyes of the Haitian public and the international community. The United States and other donors were also concerned that the level of irregularities, fraud and violence evident in the first round be addressed and reduced during the last round. The voting process in the second round did show improvements over the first. The CEP's calculation of legislative election results, however, once again called their integrity into question. It remains to be seen how well Haitian authorities resolve the dispute over the remaining contested legislative seats, and how willing they are to prevent such fraud in the future.

", "The IHRC, formed in late 2010, was designed to last 18 months, at which time the commission would become the Haitian-run Haitian Development Authority. While there has been criticism that the IHRC is not approving and distributing aid effectively, there is also widespread concern that the Haitian government is not ready to assume full control of the process either. The government's nascent institutions, which had limited capacity before the earthquake, were set back severely by the earthquake's destruction. Gross mismanagement of funds by this or any subsequent Haitian administration could prompt donors to impose conditions, reconsider further funding of programs, or return to directing aid solely through non-governmental organizations. Martelly pledged to make Haiti less dependent on foreign assistance, but was not clear on how he would do so. ", "There are also concerns about the effect either candidate will have on relations with the United States and with other major donors and international organizations. Donors worry about whether either candidate will try to change dramatically current development and recovery plans. President Martelly has been vague on specific policy plans.

At a debate before the second round of voting, both candidates supported establishing a national security force as a way of creating jobs. Martelly said the military should replace MINUSTAH, while Manigat said that MINUSTAH could be phased out eventually, but that it would not have been a priority for her administration. The proposal to reconstitute the Haitian army raises alarm not only about diverting funds from current development and reconstruction programs, but also about respect for human rights. The army was an instrument of state repression under the Duvalier regime, along with the Duvaliers' secret police, the Tontons Macoutes, and under the de facto military regimes that followed Duvalier's and Aristide's ousters. Both security forces committed gross violations of human rights over decades, according to numerous reports by the State Department, the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission, Amnesty International, and others.", "Both candidates in the final round had some association with de facto military regimes.

Private citizens have filed charges of human rights violations against Duvalier for abuses they allege they suffered under his regime. Former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in exile since his government collapsed in the face of political conflict in 2001, then said that he would also like to return, and the Haitian government issued him a new passport. The Obama Administration cautioned that Aristide's return before the elections would be an \"unfortunate distraction.\" Aristide returned to Haiti two days before the second round elections. He was reportedly greeted by thousands of supporters. Upon landing, he made a speech in which he complained that Lavalas was not represented in the elections, and seemed to make vague references to both presidential candidates, but did not directly support either one. He then kept a low profile through election day. Pr\u00e9val has long said Aristide was free to return, but that he should be prepared to face corruption and other charges as well. Both Duvalier and Aristide are seen as highly polarizing figures able to stir up unrest.", "It is a significant accomplishment that Haiti, long characterized by impunity for its leaders, has brought charges against its former dictator. Duvalier is currently not allowed to leave the country, while a judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a trial. Trying Duvalier and/or Aristide, however, would be a severe strain on Haiti's weak judicial system. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has offered to help Haitian authorities prosecute crimes committed during Duvalier's rule. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon called on the international community to continue to work with the Haitian government to bring about systemic rule-of-law reform, saying that", "\u2026the return of Jean-Claude Duvalier has brought the country's turbulent history of State-sponsored violence to the fore. It is of vital importance that the Haitian authorities pursue all legal and judicial avenues in this matter. The prosecution of those responsible for crimes against their own people will deliver a clear message to the people of Haiti that there can be no impunity. It will also be incumbent upon the incoming Administration to build on the achievements of the Pr\u00e9val presidency, which put an end to State-sponsored political violence and allowed Haitians to enjoy freedom of association and expression.", "Because the judicial system is not fully independent, the attitudes of the new president could have a large impact on any judicial process. Candidate Martelly called for clemency for former leaders, saying that, \"If I come to power, I would like all the former presidents to become my advisors in order to profit from their experience.\" He also said he was \"ready\" to work with officials who had served under the Duvalier regimes. As an argument in favor of clemency for Haiti's former leaders, Martelly cited a need for national reconciliation. The U.N.'s Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Kyung-wha Kang, in a visit to Port-au-Prince in July 2011, urged the creation of a truth commission, which she said would help promote national reconciliation in Haiti.
