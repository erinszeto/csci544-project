As part of a study of on-road emissions from diesel vehicles, the WVU researchers found emissions levels for some vehicles far exceeded U.S. certification standards. The study was part of a larger investigation by ICCT motivated by reports that some European-made diesel vehicles had passed emissions tests but had much higher real-world NO x emissions. (EU emissions standards apply only at the time a vehicle is produced; surveillance testing, mandatory emissions system warranties, and other features of U.S. rules are not incorporated in EU regulations.)", "According to the EPA notice, VW initially indicated that the excess emissions resulted from a software problem that could be addressed by a voluntary recall. Ultimately, EPA found that software installed in the vehicles' computers sensed when the vehicles were being tested and activated a lower-emissions mode. Thus, nonstandard testing was necessary to reveal VW's actions. Such software could circumvent the \"diesel dilemma,\" discussed below, and allow higher on-road performance and fuel economy than otherwise attainable with fully active emissions systems. WVU's testing indicated a BMW diesel vehicle was able to meet emissions targets. Thus, emissions compliance does not appear to be one of technical feasibility. It should also be noted that while ICCT has found other diesel vehicles that exceed European or U.S. NO x standards in real-world use, VW is so far the only automobile manufacturer accused of using defeat devices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is the Technology at Issue?

The 2015 EPA Fuel Economy Guide notes that", "Diesel engines are inherently more energy-efficient, and diesel fuel contains roughly 10%\u201315% more energy per gallon than gasoline. In addition, new advances in diesel engine technology have improved performance, reduced engine noise and fuel odor, and decreased emissions of harmful air pollutants. Ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels also help reduce emissions from these vehicles.", "Diesel engines generally last longer than gasoline engines and retain a higher resale value. However, diesel engines are more expensive to manufacture than gasoline engines and retail for more. They generally emit greater quantities of NO x and particulate matter (PM) that require pollution control devices not found on gasoline vehicles.", "Diesel engine technology has changed in recent years as automakers have sought to find new ways to raise fuel economy and reduce emissions so they can meet new federal (and EU) greenhouse gas standards. Providing direct injection of fuel into the engine combustion chamber and turbocharging the air used to burn the fuel are two ways in which the goals of higher fuel efficiency and lower emissions can be met.

In 2015, VW was the world's second-largest automaker after Toyota. In the United States, VW manufactures passenger vehicles at its Chattanooga, TN, plant, which opened in 2011. This is VW's second U.S. manufacturing facility: a Pennsylvania plant operated from 1978 until 1987, when it was closed because of decreasing sales. The Passat, reconfigured from the original European model as a larger vehicle for the U.S. market, has been manufactured with both gasoline and diesel engines at the Tennessee plant.", "The resumption of U.S. manufacturing is part of VW's strategy to significantly increase U.S. sales. In 2014, the VW Group sold nearly 600,000 vehicles in the United States, of which 48% were produced in the United States and Mexico. VW Group's total U.S. market share in 2014 was almost 4%.

The most recent revisions, referred to as the \"Tier 2\" standards, were promulgated in February 2000. Tier 2 required vehicle manufacturers to reduce tailpipe emissions of several common pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), NO x , non-methane organic gases (NMOG, a class of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)), and particulate matter (PM).

The main problem areas for diesel-fueled engines\u2014compared to gasoline-powered engines\u2014are emissions of NO x and PM. Engine design often involves a tradeoff, accepting greater emissions of one of these two pollutants in return for tighter control of the other. This trade-off is often referred to as the \"diesel dilemma.\" As summarized by researchers at the University of California\u2014Davis, \"the challenge for engine manufacturers is to reduce both NO x and particulates, and retain diesel's superior fuel efficiency.\"", "Under earlier U.S. standards, diesel vehicles were permitted higher NO x emissions, as is the case in the EU and elsewhere. However, in 1999, under EPA's \"Tier 1\" standards, the agency adopted a \"fuel neutral\" approach to emissions controls, requiring vehicles to attain the same standards regardless of the fuel they used. At the time, there was controversy over the ability of diesel cars to meet the new standards.

The specific processes depend on the engine design, and involve lubrication, fuel delivery and injection systems, turbochargers, and various \"aftertreatment\" technologies.", "One potential NO x control technology is selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which adds urea and water to the exhaust to break down NO x into nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Applying this solution on diesel vehicles sold in the United States requires additional equipment, including a urea tank, pump, and delivery system. Other parts of the vehicle would have to be designed to leave room for the SCR components. ", "Another potential control technology is a nitrogen oxide trap. Such a trap, or \"adsorber,\" chemically binds nitrogen oxides during lean engine operation. After the adsorber is saturated to capacity, the system is regenerated with an injection of diesel fuel, and the released NO x is catalytically reduced to nitrogen. This solution requires the use of additional fuel that is not dedicated to powering the engine, and thus, the vehicle's performance and fuel economy are compromised.

EPA selects vehicles for such testing from IUVP data, EPA certification data, consumer complaints, and random selection.

Experts in automotive technology have said that disengaging the pollution controls on a diesel-fueled car can yield better performance, including increased torque and acceleration. Further, several types of emissions control technologies require fuel to run; thus, disengaging them would return better fuel economy for the vehicle. In the case of VW, such modifications may have been intended to allow vehicles designed for the European Union market to meet more stringent U.S. NO x regulations, avoiding additional investment for the comparatively small U.S. diesel vehicle market.

For violations of the prohibition on tampering found in Section 203(a)(3)(A) of the CAA, the complaint stated that each vehicle equipped with an auxiliary emission control device that removed or rendered inoperative devices or elements of the emissions control system installed in new vehicles constitutes a separate violation, and that pursuant to Section 205(a) of the CAA, VW could be liable for civil penalties of up to $32,500 per vehicle for each violation occurring before January 13, 2009, and for civil penalties of up to $37,500 for each violation occurring on or after January 13, 2009.
