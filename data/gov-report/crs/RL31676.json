(25)", "Upon his return, Richardson testified before the House International Relations Committee on March 1, 2000, suggesting that this trip of \"quiet diplomacy\" was successful. On March 28, 2000,OPEC announced that production would be boosted roughly 1.45 mbd. However, this policy --whether quiet or not -- fomented reactions by one prominent producer and in the U.S. Congress.

However, Iran announced that it would not sacrificemarket share and would boost its production. (26)", "At a Senate hearing on March 2, before OPEC announced its production increase, Senator Murkowski challenged why OPEC would not advance the timetable for a decision. \"They couldhold that meeting [whenever] they want,\" he reportedly remarked to Richardson, suggesting that\"OPEC is poking you right in the eye, Mr. Secretary.\" (27)", "On March 1, 2000, Representative Gilman introduced H.R. 3822 , the Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000, which would have reduced, suspended or terminated \"any assistance underthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act to each country determinedby the President to be engaged in oil price fixing to the detriment of the United States economy.\" At the same time, the legislation included provisions expressing the sense of the Congress that theUnited States should continue its diplomatic efforts to persuade producer nations of the risks to theglobal economy from sustained high prices. (28) Asreported from committee, amended, on March 15,2000, the bill would have required the Administration to report to the Congress within 30 days ofenactment on whether oil exporting nations were engaging in price fixing. If so, the bill would havefurther required the Administration to initiate steps to reduce, suspend or terminate assistance orarms sales to those nations.", "The sanctions language was dropped from H.R. 3822 by the House Rules Committee on March 21, in response to arguments that many of these nations were important clientsof the U.S. aerospace, electronic, and defense industries, and that sanctions would be ill-advised. It was also argued that the Administration already had the authority to impose sanctions under theInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act ( P.L. 95-223 ). H.R. 3822 passed the House(382-38) on March 22, 2000. In the Senate, a resolution supporting U.S. diplomatic efforts( S.Res. 263 ) was also approved, amended, by the Senate Committee on ForeignRelations on March 8, 2000.

The SPR was authorized by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ( P.L.94-163 , EPCA) in 1975 to create a below-ground reserve of crude oil that could be tapped in theevent of an interruption in supply comparable to the experiences of 1973-1974. The SPR may alsobe used to replace oil intended for U.S. shores that may be diverted elsewhere in the event that theInternational Energy Agency (IEA) oil-sharing agreement is invoked. Under the oil-sharingagreement, IEA signatories would proportionately share the burden of a significant shortfall in worldsupply. As of the end of November 2002, the SPR held a record level of 593.5 million barrels, andthe SPR is expected to be filled to its current capacity of roughly 700 million barrels withroyalty-in-kind oil. (31) Maximum drawdown of theSPR is 4.3 million barrels per day.", "EPCA authorizes drawdown of the Reserve upon a finding by the President that there is a \"severe energy supply interruption.\" This is deemed by the statute to exist if three conditions arejoined: If \"(a) an emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply which isof significant scope and duration; (b) a severe increase in the price of petroleum products hasresulted from such emergency situation; and (c) such price increase is likely to cause a major adverseimpact on the national economy.\"", "Congress enacted additional drawdown authority in 1990 (Energy Policy and Conservation Act Amendments of 1990, P.L. 101-383 ) after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which interrupted the shipmentof Alaskan oil, triggering spot shortages and price increases. The intention was to provide for anSPR drawdown under a less rigorous finding than that mandated by EPCA. This section, 42 U.S.C.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd 6241(h), allows the President to use the SPR for a short period without having to declare theexistence of a \"severe energy supply interruption\" or the need to meet obligations of the UnitedStates under the international energy program. ", "Under this provision, a drawdown may be initiated in the event of a circumstance that \"constitutes, or is likely to become, a domestic or international energy supply shortage of significantscope or duration\" and where \"action taken ... would assist directly and significantly in preventingor reducing the adverse impact of such shortage.\" This authority allows for a limited use of the SPR. No more than 30 million barrels may be sold over a maximum period of 60 days, and this limitedauthority may not be exercised at all if the level of the SPR is below 500 million barrels. Authoritiesgoverning the SPR are periodically extended by the Congress. They currently expire on September30, 2004.", "In the event of a supply emergency, a likely initial response might be to suspend any fill activities. For example, at the present time, royalty-in-kind deliveries to the SPR scheduled to theend of FY2003 would average roughly 55,000 barrels per day (though there would be widefluctuation on a month-to-month basis).", "When the nation entered a period of volatility in oil prices in 1999-2001, many policymakers advocated drawdown. The Clinton Administration opposed a drawdown of SPR oil, arguing that thesituation did not fit the sort of supply problem for which the SPR was intended. Additionally, fromthe end of March 2000 until early November, the authorities for the SPR had lapsed. Thecomprehensive energy legislation debated but not enacted in the 107th Congress included provisionsto permanently authorize the SPR.", "The absence of a clear authority, or reluctance to find that circumstances warrant a drawdown, has not precluded use of the SPR. As the summer of 2000 ended, crude oil prices continued toescalate despite boosts in production by the OPEC cartel. Stocks of home heating oil had been athistoric lows, and concern was growing about the fresh pressure that escalating crude prices, colderweather, and anticipated refinery maintenance might have on home heating oil price and supplyduring the winter. On September 22, 2000, President Clinton announced a swap of 30 millionbarrels of oil from the SPR, and contracts were awarded on October 4. Interested parties bid toborrow quantities of not less than 1 million barrels. Contracts were awarded on the basis of howmuch oil bidders offered to return to the SPR between August 1 and November 30, 2001. In effect,bidders based their offers on their best models of what it would cost them to acquire replacementcrude, weighed against the benefit to them of having additional supply at the beginning of thewinter. Although there were reports that interest in the swap was thin, this proved not to be the case. DOE awarded 24 million barrels of sweet crude, and 6 million barrels of sour. Under the contractsaccepted by DOE, a total of 31.5 million barrels were to be returned to the SPR in 2001.", "In the period between announcement of the swap and the day after the awards were made, crude prices softened from $37 to less than $31/bbl. It was arguable how much of this was attributable tothe swap, or whether, absent the escalation in Middle East tensions during the week of October 9,2000, the decrease would have occurred anyway. U.S. willingness to use the SPR might havetemporarily taken the wind out of a speculative element in the futures market. Some argued at thetime that the Administration announcement was a calculated political gesture to affect price, that thecircumstances did not merit a drawdown of SPR oil, and that adding crude to the market would dolittle to boost home heating oil supply because refineries were operating at near capacity. Otherscontended that there was a legitimate need to call upon SPR supply, because it would increase supplyand exert some stabilizing influence. ", "Senator Murkowski, then Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, issued a press release on October 6, 2000, underscoring the irony that oil from the U.S. SPR might relieve European, ratherthan domestic markets. While it can be argued that, in a world market, it does not greatly matterwhere the product goes, a principal issue here appeared to be the reluctance among some Europeannations to draw upon their own strategic stocks. Officials in Spain and France called for acoordinated stock drawdown by the European Union in light of the U.S. action, but opinion wasdivided among the membership. An advantage of an European drawdown would have been thatthese stocks are held in the form of refined products, as well as crude, and would reach productmarkets faster. None, however, occurred.", "The preponderant risk in the swap transaction was borne by the oil companies or refiners who placed bids. The volume a refiner promised to return, and the price at the time the refiner acquiredthe replacement crude, determined the refiner's effective return on participating in the swap. However, in the absence of congressional appropriations to acquire oil for the SPR in recent years,the reserves received under the swap were a net acquisition that would not have otherwise occurred. In that sense, it is not especially material whether or not the quantity of oil returned to the SPR is atprice parity with the quantity originally borrowed. On March 29, 2001, the repayment schedule wasrenegotiated to allow five companies to return nearly 24 million barrels of the swapped oil betweenDecember 2001 and January 2003. In mid-December, five companies still owing roughly 6.5 millionfrom the swap renegotiated delivery in light of the drop in crude exports from Venezuela. Deliveryof swapped oil is now scheduled to be completed by the end of FY2003. (32) The projected total to bereturned under the swap will be over 33.5 million barrels.

The FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act ( P.L. 106-291 ), signed into lawon October 11, 2000, provided $8 million to fund establishment and fill of a Northeast Heating OilReserve (NHOR). Legislation to formally authorize the NHOR ( P.L. 106-469 ) was enactedNovember 9, 2000. The NHOR, with sites in New York and New Jersey strategically situated toserve New England in the event of shortages, holds 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The EnergyPolicy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163 ) included authority for the Secretary of Energy toestablish regional reserves as part of the broader Strategic Petroleum Reserve.", "Controversy over the regional reserve, and the language that would govern its use, was caught up in differences between the House and Senate over extension of the EPCA authorities in 2000.Opponents of establishing a regional reserve suspected that it might be tapped at times that someconsider inappropriate, and that the potential availability of the reserve could be a disincentive forthe private sector to maintain inventories as aggressively as it would if there were no reserve. Onecritic of the proposal, the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, predicted that \"aggressive useof a government reserve to hold down prices would hold down the supply response as well.\"However, advocates of the regional reserve pointed out that the experience of the 1999-2000 winterdemonstrated how the problems experienced in the Northeast can quickly generalize into associatedincreases in the price of other petroleum fuels. They argued that the benefits from measures thatprevent the sort of price increases experienced in home heating oil ultimately are shared byconsumers of diesel fuel and gasoline, too. ", "P.L. 106-469 , the NHOR authorization statute, allows drawdown if there is a regional supply shortage of \"significant scope and duration,\" or if -- for seven consecutive days -- the pricedifferential between crude oil and home heating oil increases by more than 60% over its five-yearrolling average. The intention is to make the threshold for use of the regional reserve high enoughso that it would not discourage oil marketers and distributors from stockbuilding.", "During mid- and late December 2000, the 60% differential was breached. However, this was due to a sharp decline in crude prices rather than to a rise in home heating oil prices. In fact, homeheating oil prices were drifting slightly lower during the same reporting period. As a consequence,while the 60% differential was satisfied, other conditions prerequisite to authorizing a drawdown ofthe NHOR were not. By February 2001, heating oil stocks had recovered sufficiently to ease anyserious concerns about adequacy of supply during the remainder of that winter.", "DOE updates and posts a table weekly, available on its web site http://www.fe.doe.gov/heatingoil/heatingoil_salebasis.shtml , which shows the various inputs thatgo into the calculation to determine the current differential. The threshold for use of the homeheating oil reserve was not breached during the winter of 2001-2002. At the moment, absent anysignificant disturbance in oil price or supply, use of the NHOR appears unlikely during the winterof 2002-2003. However, it is there if needed.", "The NHOR is designed to provide relief from weather-related shortages for approximately 10 days, which is the time needed for ships to bring heating oil from the Gulf of Mexico to New YorkHarbor. If drawdown of the NHOR were coordinated with drawdown of crude from the SPR to tidethe Northeast over until new refined product could reach the region, the NHOR could be an effectivetool. It cannot, however, be a long-term replacement for a shortfall in supply.

Proponents argued that vesting this responsibility in theprivate sector has the least costs administratively. Additionally, they argued that any slight upwardpressure on prices that resulted from advance purchases to meet inventory goals should be seen asanalogous to an insurance premium, a prudent investment in preventing any repetition of thevolatilities experienced during the winter of 1999-2000. This approach might be pursued as aseparate initiative if circumstances appear to warrant at a future date.", "International Energy Agency. The United States and its industrialized allies established the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 1974 -- in responseto the Arab oil embargo -- to coordinate their energy policies and mitigate severe supply disruptions.

These requirements may be met with a combination of stocksheld by industry, governments, or public- or private-sector agencies that have been created for thepurpose of holding stocks. This requirement may also be satisfied with demand restraint and fuelswitching.

In the late winter and early spring of 2000, policymakers in the 106th Congress focused on possible taxoptions to address a recent spike in petroleum prices, including a moratorium on the payment ofgasoline and diesel fuel excise taxes.

A review of the debate, however, is useful, given that the sameissues would likely arise were the policy option revisited in the event of military conflict in theMiddle East. It is also possible that a higher and more sustained spike in prices might overcomesome of the resistance that led the 106th Congress to not enact motor fuel tax suspension.", "Virtually all transportation fuels are taxed under a complicated structure of tax rates and exemptions that vary by mode and type of fuel. Gasoline used in highway transportation -- the fuelused more than any other -- is taxed at a rate of 18.4\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd per gallon, composed of an 18.3\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd HighwayTrust Fund rate, which goes into the HTF, and a 0.1\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd rate that is earmarked for the LeakingUnderground Storage Tank Trust Fund (LUST).

Unlike gasoline, however, which is largely consumed for personal use,diesel fuel is used primarily in trucks that transport goods; i.e, it is primarily used by businesses. Gross revenues from the diesel tax were projected to be about $7.2 billion in FY2003. However,as this tax is a cost of doing business for truckers, it is deductible against income taxes so that thenet revenue yield to the federal government -- i.e., the net cost to truckers -- is smaller by about25%, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the official scorer on such matters. Thus, netrevenues in FY2003, including offsets, are projected at about $5.4 billion.

Amidst such uncertainty, it reportedly has been difficult for the oilindustry to commit to long-term investments in higher-cost technologies. At the same time, thereis little that the United States can do to appreciably reduce its dependence on imported petroleum.", "Proposals to boost domestic production generally prompt comment from some policymakers that there are other initiatives -- conservation and alternative fuels -- that will achieve greatersavings than the additional production that would result from other policies. The National EnergyPlan released by the Bush Administration on May 16, 2001, was criticized by some for appearingto be predisposed toward boosting production in preference to reducing oil consumption. Chiefamong the proposals generating controversy was a call for oil and gas leasing in the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge (ANWR).", "Other policies that have been debated in the past to encourage domestic production have included a range of tax incentives. Spare capacity of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is also beingfilled with domestic oil as royalty-in-kind payment to the federal government. The 106th Congressenacted a guaranteed loan program to assist domestic producers ( P.L. 106-51 ). ", "Comprehensive energy legislation debated during the 107th Congress included several tax provisions intended to boost production from marginal wells, extension of suspension of thepercentage depletion allowance on marginal oil and gas wells through the end of 2006, and extensionof a credit for each barrel (or equivalent) for production from unconventional sources. The Housebill included language to open ANWR for leasing; the Senate legislation did not. The 107th Congressadjourned without taking final action on the bill, but similar omnibus legislation is being consideredin the 108th Congress.

For example, the Administration hasdirected the Secretaries of State, Commerce and Energy to develop closer energy integration withCanada and Mexico, and to provide support to American energy firms competing in markets abroad. Here, the role for Congress may be relatively limited."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
