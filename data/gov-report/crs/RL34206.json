The DRA extended funding for most TANF grants through FY2010, except TANF supplemental grants that expire at the end of this year (FY2008). Supplemental grants go to 17 states that have high population growth or low historic funding in TANF's predecessor programs per poor person. H.R. 6331, a Medicare bill enacted over President Bush's veto on July 15, 2008, extends supplemental grants for one year, through FY2009.", "TANF is best known as the funding source for welfare benefits for low-income families with children. In 2006, 1.9 million families per month received TANF cash welfare, down from the historical high of five million families receiving cash welfare in the mid-1990s. In 2006, less than three in ten poor children were in families that received TANF cash welfare. However, TANF funds a wide range of \"nonwelfare\" benefits and services for needy families with children. In FY2006, spending on activities related to traditional cash welfare accounted for a little more than half of total TANF funding, while other \"nonwelfare\" activities accounted for the remainder.", "Though cash welfare is a shrinking part of what TANF funds, many of the issues Congress might consider in the 110th Congress (beside supplemental grants) focus on families receiving cash welfare, particularly the work participation standards that apply to these families. The DRA made changes that require states to either increase participation among families receiving cash welfare in work or job preparation activities or reduce their welfare caseloads to meet these numerical performance standards. The DRA also required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue rules regulations defining what specific activities count toward the participation standards. HHS final regulations, published on February 5, 2008, allow states to count participation in a four-year college degree program toward the participation standards and provide for limited counting of rehabilitative activities. However, the regulations also limit counting activities such as adult basic education (ABE), pursuing a General Educational Development (GED) credential, and English as a Second Language courses, generally requiring them to be counted only in conjunction with activities more closely related to work.", "In terms of \"nonwelfare\" spending from TANF, Congress might consider proposals left over from TANF reauthorization proposals, but not included in DRA, to loosen some rules for nonwelfare spending. Congress might also consider improving the information available on how TANF funds are used for \"nonwelfare\" benefits and services, since relatively little is known about this half of TANF funding. Additionally, legislation that affects foster care, child welfare services for abused and neglected children, and child care funding would have an effect on TANF, since large amounts of TANF \"nonwelfare\" dollars are used to supplement dedicated federal and state funding for these programs.

Congress debated reauthorization of the block grant during the 107 th through the 109 th Congresses. Comprehensive legislation to reauthorize and revise TANF did not pass during this period, and the program operated on the basis of a series of temporary extensions.

However, Congress might examine the impact of DRA's provisions related to TANF work participation standards for welfare recipients. Additionally, in light of renewed interest in issues related to poverty and disadvantaged families with children, interest might be raised in the flexibility states have to use TANF funds for a wide range of \"non-welfare\" activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background and Context", "paragraphs": ["TANF is the block grant created in the 1996 welfare reform law that replaced the New Deal program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). AFDC provided monthly cash welfare benefits to needy families with children, with most of these families headed by single mothers. Concerns that AFDC helped create disadvantage by discouraging work and breaking up families dominated welfare reform debates from 1970 onward, culminating in the 1996 welfare reform law. Some of the most visible policies of the 1996 welfare reform law are TANF work requirements for welfare recipients, time limits on the receipt of welfare, and the end of a federal entitlement to welfare for needy families with children.", "The monthly TANF cash welfare benefit, like the monthly AFDC benefit before it, is determined by the states, and benefit amounts vary widely among the states. In January 2005, the monthly cash benefit in California was $723 for a family of three. The California benefit amount is high relative to many other states, though even that benefit is only a fraction (54%) of poverty-level income. In Alabama, a family of three received $215 per month (16% of poverty-level income).", " Table 1 shows selected economic and social indicators for 1995, 2000, and 2006. As shown, the cash welfare caseload plummeted from nearly 5 million to 1.9 million families over this period. Most of that caseload decline occurred from 1995 to 2000, though recently the cash welfare caseload has fallen again. The number of children in families receiving cash welfare fell from 9.1 million to 3.5 million from 1995 to 2006. Work among single mothers (who head most welfare families) increased from 1995 to 2000, with some slippage in the 2000-2006 period. However, despite the decline in receipt of cash welfare and increase in work among single mothers, improvements in other social and economic indicators have been less dramatic. The child poverty rate did fall from 1995 to 2000, but the 2006 rate of 17.4% is higher than in 2000. There remained 12.8 million children living in families with incomes below the poverty threshold in 2006. Further, the percentage of babies born out-of-wedlock in 2006 was 38.9%\u2014an all-time high.", "Cash welfare reaches far fewer disadvantaged children than it did prior to welfare reform. The ratio of the average monthly number of children in families receiving cash welfare to the total number of children in poverty declined from about six out of ten in 1995 to less than three out of ten in 2006.", "TANF is not just a welfare program. The 1996 law granted states permission to use funds for a wide range of benefits, services, and activities to address some of the social and economic ills afflicting disadvantaged families with children. States may use their funds in any manner \"reasonably calculated\" to further TANF's purpose, which is to provide states with the flexibility to achieve four goals set in statute:", "(1) provide assistance to needy families so that children may live in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;", "(2) end dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting work, job preparation, and marriage;", "(3) reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and", "(4) promote the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.", "Given the fixed funding of the TANF block grant, states are able to use the savings from the welfare caseload decline to fund other \"nonwelfare\" benefits, services, and activities. Total funding in the TANF \"system\" comprises both the federal block grant to states and a state's own funds spent to meet a maintenance of effort (MOE) requirement. Figure 1 shows the uses of TANF and MOE funds in FY2006. It shows that the categories typically associated with a traditional cash welfare program\u2014cash benefits, administrative costs, and work activities\u2014accounted for only a little more than half of total TANF funds.

Each state's basic grant and MOE levels has been frozen since FY1997: it is neither adjusted for inflation nor for changing circumstances (population or TANF cash welfare caseload). Thus, TANF funding rules have effectively \"locked-in\" historical levels of funding, which reflected the pre-1996 welfare policies of states.", "During the welfare reform debate of the mid-1990s, concerns were raised that the fixed funding based on historical spending patterns disadvantaged two sets of states: (1) those that paid relatively low welfare benefits and consequently had low federal grants relative to poverty in the state; and (2) high population growth states.

Supplemental grants bring up funding for some states with low funding per poor child. For example, the $480 in basic funding per poor child per year in Arkansas is 23% of the national average. The Arkansas supplemental grant adds $38 per year per poor child, raising its funding to $518 per year per poor child. The $518 is 25% of the national average.

They qualified based on high food stamp caseloads. The 1996 law provided that a state would be considered economically needy for contingency funds if a state's food stamp caseload was 10% higher than its adjusted caseload during the corresponding period in FY1994 or FY1995. (FY1994 and FY1995 are adjusted downward for immigrants made ineligible for food stamps by the 1996 welfare reform law.) Food stamp caseloads, unlike cash welfare caseloads, did increase with the 2001 recession and have remained historically high. The food stamp contingency fund trigger is also expressed in terms of number of participants, rather than a rate of receipt, in a state. Population growth over the 12- or 13-year period means that the number of participants in a state can be higher than in the base years, even if the rate at which people in the state receive food stamps declined.", "The 2002 Bush Administration welfare reauthorization proposal and all comprehensive reauthorization bills considered during the 2002-2005 period would have made some changes to the contingency fund.

Simultaneously, states had to adjust to new rules, in the form of regulations from HHS required by the DRA, for what specific activities count toward the participation standards and how participation is supervised and verified.", "However, a couple of points might help put issues regarding TANF work participation standards in perspective. First, although the TANF work participation standard rules undoubtedly influence the design of state work requirements, states themselves still determine the requirements that apply to individuals. States are free to determine that some families may be exempt from participating and can determine that some individuals in these families may participate in activities that are not countable toward the federal standards.", "Second, these TANF work participation rules affect a relatively small number of families each month.

Therefore, the focus of much of the work rules is the remaining 36% of families (713,000 families per month) with an adult recipient who is not employed.", "This is not to say that TANF work rules are unimportant.

Actual caseload reduction credits might be higher or lower: states are not given credit for caseload reduction that results from restricting eligibility, but might get additional credit if the state is aiding cases using state dollars in excess of the TANF MOE.

However, this would not be the case if a state failed both the all-family and two-parent participation standards. The rules penalize a state more heavily if they fail both standards than if they fail one of the two standards.", "Additionally, the high two-parent participation standard potentially encourages states to calculate ways to \"game\" TANF rules.

Additionally, the impact of \"work-first\" programs occurs faster.", "However, the evaluated programs with the largest increases in earnings and reductions in welfare tended to have a strong work message like the \"work-first\" programs but provided some flexibility for education and training. For example, large impacts were attributed to a program operated in Portland, Oregon during the 1990s, that, like other \"work-first\" programs, had job search as its most common activity. However, Portland program recipients also often participated in education or in both job search and education during the two years following entry into the program more often than in other evaluated programs.

Thus, college can now count as the prime or sole activity of a cash welfare recipient for up to 12 months.

Some of these declines are likely to stem from changes in eligibility rules for TANF/MOE cash welfare programs, including ending TANF/MOE funding for certain families (two-parent families, families dealing with disabilities) and funding their benefits from state-only funds outside the TANF/MOE system. There is no reporting on the number of families receiving benefits in state-only programs outside of the TANF/MOE system, so it is not possible to quantify at this point how much of the recent caseload reduction was caused by shifting families to state-only programs.", "The most common metric used to evaluate welfare policies is whether they lower welfare caseloads, and caseload decline is the most cited indicator of the success of welfare reform. A TANF goal is to \"end dependency on government benefits,\" and lower cash welfare caseloads help achieve that end. To the degree that receipt of welfare itself helps create disadvantage, a smaller role for cash welfare in society could be viewed as a positive outcome.

The available evidence indicates that the TANF caseload decline has been broad-based: the decline has affected both those who were \"work-ready\" as well as those considered \"hard-to-serve.\" The Urban Institute, using data from their National Survey of American Families, estimated that from 1997 through 2002, the share of welfare recipients with specified barriers to work had changed little. However, the share of recent welfare leavers with barriers such as health conditions that limit work and poor mental health has increased.
