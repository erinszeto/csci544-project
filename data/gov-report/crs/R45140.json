As directed by Congress, the Census Bureau is attempting to design and conduct the 2020 census at a lower inflation-adjusted cost per housing unit than in 2010. In April 2015 congressional testimony, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) stated that the cost to enumerate each housing unit \"escalated from around $16 in 1970 to around $94 in 2010, in constant 2010 dollars (an increase of over 500 percent).\" At a total life-cycle cost approaching $13 billion, the 2010 census was the most expensive in U.S. history. Its cost was about 56% greater than the 2000 census total of $8.1 billion, in constant 2010 dollars.", "The bureau is focusing on 2020 census cost-control innovations in four major areas", "Before past censuses, the bureau conducted address canvassing to try to ensure that it had the correct addresses and map locations of all U.S. residences. For the 2020 census, the bureau proposes canvassing the whole nation, as in previous censuses, but, to the extent possible, updating its Master Address File and Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing system (MAF/TIGER) by in-office use of geographic information systems and aerial imagery, not by more labor intensive, and thus more costly, in-field canvassing. The 1970 through 2010 censuses were primarily mail-out, mail-back operations. The bureau proposes replacing as much of the mail phase of the 2020 census as possible by offering the public an online response option. Other options will include by telephone, with assistance from census telephone interviewers, and by mailed paper questionnaires. Besides placing greater reliance on technology to promote the census, the bureau is implementing a \"communications and partnership campaign to engage and encourage the use of the Internet as the primary response mode.\" The campaign \"will provide information to government agencies, host events at community, recreation, and faith-based organizations,\" and publicize the census \"through radio advertising and social media.\" The bureau also will permit online responses to be submitted \"without a unique identification code\" for each questionnaire. In past censuses, the bureau generally followed up with nonrespondents by telephoning them or visiting their homes. The bureau proposes using administrative records, such as existing information from the federal and state governments, as well as \"third-party data\" from, for example, \"commercial sources,\" to reduce the extent of nonresponse follow-up in 2020. For whatever nonresponse follow-up remains necessary, the bureau proposes using an \"operational control system\" to automate certain tasks and make \"decisions that were previously made by people during field operations,\" such as case assignments and number of attempted contacts with nonrespondents. The objective is to \"reduce the staffing, infrastructure, and brick and mortar footprint required for the 2020 Census.\" The bureau expects to establish six regional census centers, instead of the 12 established for the 2010 census; two paper processing centers, versus three for 2010; and about 250 area census offices, versus almost 500 local census offices for 2010. The number of enumerators is to be reduced by about half, from almost 600,000 for 2010 to about 300,000 for 2020.", "The bureau initially estimated that these innovations could save more than $5 billion. Its estimate of the cost to repeat the 2010 design in the 2020 census was $17.8 billion, compared with $12.5 billion for a reengineered census. In 2017 congressional testimony, however, Commerce Secretary Ross gave a revised 2020 census cost estimate of $15.6 billion, which he attributed to an earlier \"overestimation of savings and an underestimation of the difficulty of implementing and integrating technological innovations to conduct the Decennial Census.\" Secretary Ross testified that the Commerce Department was \"working with our House and Senate appropriators\" on a request for \"a $187 million adjustment for FY2018.\" The additional funds, he said, would permit \"a significant course correction to keep crucial programs on track for the 2020 Census and provide much-needed financial oversight and better management at the Census Bureau.\"", "FY201 8 Activities in Preparation for the 2020 Census . Summarized below are the major census-related activities that the bureau has begun or intends to undertake or complete in FY2018. ", "The foremost activity for FY2018 is the end-to-end 2020 census test. It originally was to cover more than 700,000 housing units: approximately 330,000 units in Pierce County, Washington; 265,000 units in Providence County, Rhode Island; and 175,000 units in nine West Virginia counties that include the cities of Beckley, Bluefield, and Oak Hill. Address canvassing for the test still will occur in these sites, but, due to past budget shortfalls, other operations will be limited to Providence County. As the budget justification notes, this site was retained \"because it presents specific opportunities and challenges\" for the bureau, including high housing vacancy rates, varying levels of internet connectivity, a combination of urban and suburban areas, communication in multiple languages rather than uniformly English, a large group quarters population, \"non-traditional addressing styles,\" and sociodemographic diversity. The budget justification cautions that delayed or insufficient FY2018 appropriations could \"result in the Census Bureau not being ready\" for the crucial test, which will afford the \"last opportunity\" before 2020 to determine whether \"reengineered census operations and systems\" function as intended. \"An inability to test and refine major pieces of this complex architecture\" could jeopardize the census and result in \"significant cost increases or deterioration in data quality.\" The budget justification states that, by the end of FY2017, the bureau expected to have processed 70% of U.S. addresses through in-office canvassing and was \"on schedule\" to finish the remaining 30% in FY2018. In-field canvassing of addresses needing further verification is to begin in the first quarter of FY2019. In FY2018, the bureau is to continue developing the 2020 census communications and partnership program that it began in FY2017. Among its features will be a 2020 census website, a paid advertising campaign, \"national and regional partnership efforts,\" with a \"partnership database,\" a \"social media presence,\" and a \"Statistics in Schools program\" to engage students and, by extension, their parents in the census process. \"Significant in FY2018,\" according to the budget justification, will be the opening and staffing of six regional census centers, with associated IT infrastructure, to \"serve as the hub of field operations\" during the census. \"Additionally, during FY2018, the acquisition, leasing, and build-out processes\" for \"acquiring approximately 250 area census offices and a second paper data capture center will begin.\" Also, as required under Title 13, Section 141 (f)(2), of the United States Code , the bureau is to deliver the 2020 census questions to Congress by April 1, 2018. The questions will cover the census topics, which were delivered on March 28, 2017. They include gender, age, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, relationship of each household member to the person filling out the census form, and whether the housing unit is owned or rented. In the words of the budget justification, \"Any changes to the topics or questions after that point would have significant cost and schedule impacts on all English and Non-English questionnaires, the questionnaire vehicles (Internet, telephone, and paper), translation, and printing, and will put the 2020 Census at risk.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The American Community Survey", "paragraphs": ["The American Community Survey, which the Census Bureau implemented nationwide in 2005 and 2006, is the replacement for the decennial census long form.

It is sent monthly to small samples of the population, and the results are aggregated to produce data at regular intervals, yearly for areas with at least 65,000 people and every five years for areas from the most populous to those with fewer than 20,000 people.
