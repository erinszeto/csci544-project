Similarly, company underwriting gains (the amount by which a company's share of retained premiums exceeds its indemnities) have increased substantially in recent years, as weather has been generally favorable for growing crops.

Premium subsidies are specified in the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 ( P.L. 110-365 ), as amended. Periodic legislation can also affect federal outlays (see \" A&O Reimbursement ,\" below).", "The largest cost category is premium subsidies, which lower the cost to farmers of purchasing insurance policies. When purchasing a policy, a producer growing an insurable crop selects a level of coverage and pays a portion of the premium. The remainder of the premium is covered by the federal government. Nearly 60% of total premium, on average, is paid by the government. As with other insurance, premiums increase with additional coverage, in terms of greater price protection or yield protection (or both). ", "The second-largest cost category is A&O expense reimbursement. Unlike some other insurance products, premiums for crop insurance are not \"expense loaded.\" For crop insurance, the entire premium covers only the liability associated with payment of crop losses and excludes expenses for delivery of the product. Currently, expense reimbursement for insurance companies is directly related to the value of the premiums. Therefore, as premiums rise, so does the A&O expense reimbursement, even if other factors, such as the number of policies sold, remain unchanged.", "The third category is program losses. As a reinsurer, the federal government is liable for insured losses as agreed to in the current SRA.

After ranging between $2.1 and $3.6 billion annually during FY2000-FY2006, costs rose to $5.7 billion in FY2008 and more than $7 billion in FY2009 as higher policy premiums from rising crop prices drove up premium subsidies for farmers and expense reimbursements to private insurance companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Provisions in the Standard Reinsurance Agreement for 2010", "paragraphs": ["The Standard Reinsurance Agreement is a cooperative financial agreement between FCIC and each of the approved crop insurance companies to deliver eligible crop insurance contracts.

A company must also accept and approve applications from all eligible producers, and it is prohibited from providing a rebate (money, goods, or any other benefit) in exchange for purchasing a policy.

Under the SRA, insurance companies may transfer some liability associated with riskier policies to the government and retain profits/losses from less risky policies.

Within 30 days of the sales closing dates for each crop, companies assign each policy they sell to one of three funds\u2014assigned risk, developmental, or commercial\u2014for each state. Each company then decides what proportion of premiums (and potential for losses/gains) to retain within each reinsurance fund, subject to required minimum retention limits of individual funds.

As a general rule, for underwriting losses, the higher the loss ratio, the lower the company share of losses (calculated separately for each fund within each state). This provision limits overall losses, with the government paying increasing amounts as losses mount. For example, FCIC assumes 100% of the underwriting loss for portions incurred when a company's loss ratio exceeds 500% (indemnities are five times greater than total premiums). Similarly, when there are underwriting gains, a company's share of gains declines (and the government's share increases) when the loss ratio is relatively low.

As a result, the government receives a portion of underwriting gains from a company's retained business (but will also pay a portion of the losses, if realized).

GAO concluded that the current structure of A&O reimbursements \"present[s] an opportunity to reduce government spending without compromising the crop insurance program's safety net for farmers.\" The current approach using crop prices, GAO says, has generated a \"kind of windfall\" for many insurance agencies and agents, as the companies, using funds from increased levels of A&O reimbursements, pay higher commissions to compete for each other's \"book of business\" and associated underwriting gains.", "GAO reported that crop insurance companies have spent a large share of their higher A&O reimbursements on commission payments, partly in an effort to compete for business from other insurance agencies. Since the federal government, through RMA and FCIC, sets policy premiums and determines which products can be offered, insurance companies do not compete on product quality or price. Rather, they can offer independent insurance agents, who sell policies through multiple companies, higher commissions to increase the company's market share.

Analysis conducted on behalf of the National Crop Insurance Services, Inc., a not-for-profit organization representing more than 60 crop insurance companies, concluded that, although companies have cut expenses over time through efficiencies, A&O reimbursements have been consistently below actual expenses incurred by private insurers, with a shortfall of 1-2 percentage points in 2008. (Moreover, with crop prices declining from highs in recent years, A&O expense reimbursements declined in FY2009 and are projected to decline again in FY2010.) The analysis states that the inadequacy of the A&O reimbursements is absorbed through a reduction in company profits.

The insurance industry contends that the net book quota share provision of the SRA is equivalent to a tax on underwriting income and crowds out private reinsurance.

According to the draft agreement, companies would place policies into either the \"residual\" fund for riskier policies (as designated by the insurance companies) or the \"commercial\" fund for less risky policies. The move would eliminate the marginally used developmental fund and three sub-funds in the commercial fund under the 2010 SRA (see \" Major Provisions in the Standard Reinsurance Agreement for 2010 ,\" above). Importantly, the draft made the residual fund a nationwide fund, in contrast with the current assigned risk fund, which is state-based.

Aside from the level of A&O cuts, NCIS claimed that USDA does not have discretion to negotiate lower A&O rates because the 2008 farm bill \"fixed\" them. In its formal response, NCIS stated that A&O reimbursements must remain as provided in statute, although the industry indicated elsewhere that they are continuing to work with USDA to arrive at A&O cuts that are acceptable to both parties.", "Regarding changes to provisions for underwriting gains and losses, the industry did not want the government to take on additional risk\u2014specifically by RMA taking a larger portion of the gains and losses for the most profitable states \u2014and \"crowd out\" commercial reinsurance. In addition, the draft proposal, according to the industry, would have only a limited improvement in potential underwriting gains for low-return states. The overall effect of the proposed changes, according to the industry, would be a sharp reduction in potential net underwriting gains by the insurance companies and in incentives to expand in underserved markets, and a potential increase in the cost of reinsurance for crop insurance companies.", "In its response, the industry proposed two options for changing the underwriting provisions. Both options retain the current assigned risk fund and provide for a commercial fund with gain/loss share provisions that would differ for each of two state groups (group 1 is Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska; group 2 is all other states). Option A would eliminate quota share and alter both the company share of risk (which would increase for group 1 and decrease for group 2) and the company share of gain (which would be reduced for group 1 and increased for group 2). Option B would increase quota share to 10% and increase (relative to Option A) the company share of gains in both groups, particularly group 2. The industry estimated that both proposals would reduce expected underwriting gains by about $100 million annually.", "Another industry concern is \"regulatory risk.\" According to the industry, the proposal would mandate items such as data reporting and other activities, yet procedures for them are not thoroughly defined in the draft agreement. The concern is that companies could be subject to severe penalties, including loss of A&O reimbursements and/or reinsurance, if procedures are not followed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA's Second Draft SRA", "paragraphs": ["On February 17, 2010, USDA issued a news release announcing the second draft of the Standard Reinsurance Agreement. USDA said that the second draft, identified with the date of February 23, 2010, contained significant changes that reflected negotiations between RMA and the participating crop insurance companies, particularly with respect to the structure of A&O reimbursements and risk-sharing terms.", "Regarding A&O reimbursements, USDA inserted a two-year phase-in period for the proposed changes for using historical crop prices when calculating reimbursement levels. Rather than shifting immediately to the historical prices series, crop prices would be increased by 10 percentage points in the first year of the SRA and by five percentage points in the second year. Also, companies would receive an additional 5% in A&O reimbursements for operations in lower-served and/or higher-risk states. In an attempt to assert some control over agent commissions and to avoid instability in an insurance company's financial prospects, USDA also proposed a \"soft cap\" on agent commissions equal to no more than 80% of A&O reimbursements. The agreement would, however, allow profit sharing from underwriting gains. ", "In response to industry concerns that the commercial fund should be streamlined, the risk-sharing provisions in the second draft essentially reduced the number of state groups to only two\u2014one for Corn Belt states and another group for all other states. Also, at the request of the crop insurance companies, the second draft provided more profit/loss sharing for policies in the commercial fund. For the residual fund (containing the highest-risk policies), USDA shifted its proposal from a nationwide, all-company pool to individual company pools so that companies would not be exposed to liability associated with policies sold by other companies. Finally, the net book quota share, which had been set at 10% in USDA's first draft, was set at 7.5%, compared with the current level of 5%. Under the second draft, up to 2.5% of any net book quota share would be distributed to companies operating in underserved states.

The initial feedback from the industry was mixed, noting that USDA had listened to the industry \"to some extent,\" but arguing that the cost savings and associated impacts on the industry were still too great. ", "Some Members of Congress, including the Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, remain concerned that cuts would reduce baseline funding levels for crop insurance, which could have a negative effect on overall spending for the next farm bill. If concerns about the federal budget deficit lead to a call for reduction in mandatory spending, including funds for agriculture, cuts made administratively by USDA would not count as savings for agriculture spending that the House and Senate Agriculture Committees would need to make. Following precedence for reflecting a portion of budget savings due to \"rulemaking\" or similar administrative action, some cost savings based on USDA's first draft of the SRA have already been incorporated in the current estimate of baseline spending by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "CBO baseline budget estimates will serve as the official benchmark for scoring the budgetary impacts of the next farm bill. (CBO's March 2007 baseline was used to score the 2008 farm bill.) CBO's baseline projections typically assume continuation of current farm bill policies under expected economic conditions, as well as ongoing rulemaking and administrative changes. In the most recent CBO baseline (March 2010), spending on crop insurance totals $77.2 billion during FY2011-FY2020. This figure includes an estimated $3.9 billion in savings resulting from a new SRA. Subsequent CBO baselines are expected to include updated estimates of the impacts of the SRA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "2011 SRA Signed by Companies", "paragraphs": ["On June 10, 2010, USDA announced the release of what it called the final draft agreement (subject to technical review). On July 13, 2010, USDA announced that all of the approved crop insurance companies had signed the new SRA, making it effective for the reinsurance year beginning July 1, 2010.", "To control costs, the 2011 SRA places a cap on A&O reimbursements of $1.3 billion per year. The cap is adjusted annually for inflation, reaching $1.37 billion in 2015. The reference price concept proposed in earlier drafts was eliminated, and the A&O reimbursement is calculated using market prices as in the previous SRA. However, a minimum total A&O reimbursement of $1 billion is intended to protect companies against low market prices. To ensure company financial solvency and to control what some consider excessive commissions, particularly in the Midwest, the final SRA limits a company's expenditures on agent commissions to 80% of the A&O reimbursement in each state. Companies can supplement commissions with profit sharing, but total agent compensation will be limited to 100% of A&O reimbursements at the state level. According to USDA, under the previous SRA, average commissions were 108% of A&O reimbursements, a level which USDA said increases financial risk for companies if they encounter significant losses.", "Among the proposed changes to underwriting provisions, the 2011 SRA is designed to make crop insurance delivery in higher-risk states (generally outside the Corn Belt states) more attractive to insurance companies. The commercial fund state groupings remain the same as in the second draft, but risk-sharing terms for higher-risk states are altered to provide increased profit potential and reduced share of loss. Also, for the highest-risk policies, USDA has shifted back to an assigned risk fund for each state (and company) so companies can maintain stop-loss protection for major disasters in individual states, as provided under the previous SRA. Finally, the net book quota share, which had been set at 10% in USDA's first draft, would be set at 6.5%, compared with the previous level of 5%. Under the final SRA, 1.5 percentage points of any net book quota share would be distributed to companies operating in underserved states.

The department has stated that $4 billion of the savings would be used for deficit reduction and $2 billion for risk management and conservation programs, including expansion of the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage crop insurance program and a \"good experience\" discount for producers. USDA states that the new agreement generally maintains the A&O subsidy structure contained in the previous SRA but removes the possibility of \"windfall\" government payments based on commodity price spikes. Although the insurance companies have signed the agreement, the insurance industry remains concerned about the potential impact of reduced funding on overall delivery of the program and quality of service to producers."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
