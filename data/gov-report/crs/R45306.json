In a 2010 editorial, then-Vice President Biden noted that U.S. nuclear laboratories and facilities had been \"underfunded and undervalued\" for more than a decade. He stated that President Obama's budget request for FY2011 would include \"$7 billion for maintaining our nuclear-weapons stockpile and complex, and for related efforts,\" an amount that was $600 million more than Congress appropriated for FY2010. He also stated that the Administration would \"boost funding for these important activities by more than $5 billion\" over the next five years. ", "While the passage of the Budget Control Act in 2011 slowed the increases in NNSA budgets, appropriations for NNSA's weapons activities have grown in each of the subsequent years, reaching $9.25 billion in FY2017, the last year of the Obama Administration. The Trump Administration, in its budget for FY2018, requested an additional $1 billion for NNSA weapons activities over the level appropriated in FY2017. The Trump Administration's budget for FY2019 continues to fund increases in NNSA's weapons activities, requesting $11.02 billion, an increase of nearly $400 million over the funding enacted in FY2018. These amounts do not include site overhead costs (e.g., site security, maintenance, administration) paid through the Environmental Management (EM) program funding for certain sites (e.g., the Savannah River Site, where EM funding provided 70% of the site budget).", "These funding increases have not, however, assuaged concerns about the aging facilities in the nuclear weapons infrastructure. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2016, General Frank G. Klotz, who was then the Administrator of NNSA, noted that \"the age and condition of NNSA's infrastructure will, if not addressed, put the mission, the safety of our workers, the public, and the environment at risk.\" At a hearing held by the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, General Klotz noted that the resources available to maintain NNSA's infrastructure \"have historically not kept pace with growing needs.\" Further, press reports indicate that, in late 2015, then-Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz requested a $5.2 billion increase in the planned budget for NNSA between FY2018 and FY2021 to address \"programmatic gaps.\" He noted, in a letter described in the Wall Street Journal , that \"a majority of NNSA's facilities and systems are well beyond end-of-life\" and that \"infrastructure problems such as falling ceilings are increasing in frequency and severity.\"", "Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty, the current Administrator of NNSA, echoed the concerns raised by General Klotz during her testimony before the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee in March 2018. She stated that NNSA's FY2019 budget request of $3 billion for Infrastructure and Operations represented a 7% increase over the FY2018 request. She asserted that this funding would support both NNSA's deferred maintenance problem in existing facilities and its need to construct new facilities, including the Uranium Processing Facility at Oak Ridge, TN, and the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. In May 2018, NNSA announced that it was recommending a strategy to achieve the goal of producing 80 nuclear pits per year, which would both maximize pit production at Los Alamos within the CMRR project and repurpose the Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. NNSA argued that \"this two-prong approach\u2014with at least 50 pits per year produced at Savannah River and at least 30 pits per year at Los Alamos\u2014is the best way to manage the cost, schedule, and risk of such a vital undertaking.\" ", "As funding for NNSA continues to rise, interest has grown in U.S. nuclear policy, in general, and in the facilities and programs managed by NNSA, in particular.

The nuclear weapons program, in an effort known as the Manhattan Project, began in 1942. Many of the sites and facilities established early in the program to support the design, development, and production of the first nuclear weapons remain in operation today as a part of the DOE nuclear security enterprise. ", "The end of the Cold War saw numerous changes to the nuclear enterprise. The number of sites involved in nuclear warhead production declined, as the United States reduced the number of warheads in the stockpile while maintaining the capability to sustain the remaining nuclear weapons. In addition, the focus of the work shifted away from weapons research, development, and production\u2014the core mission during the Cold War\u2014toward a science-based stockpile stewardship program designed to enable the United States to sustain and maintain its warheads without conducting explosive nuclear testing. ", "The enterprise has also increased its focus on research into technologies and processes that can prevent, counter, and respond to threats of nuclear proliferation while addressing the degradation remaining from the environmental contamination and waste generated during the Cold War. These goals are not addressed in this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Origins and Organization of the Nuclear Weapons Enterprise", "paragraphs": ["In August 1939, Albert Einstein signed a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt to inform him that recent scientific research conducted at U.S. universities indicated that large amounts of power could be produced by a chain reaction using uranium and that, by harnessing this power, the construction of \"extremely powerful bombs\" was conceivable. The letter urged the U.S. government to support research in this area, in part, because the German government was doing so. ", "President Roosevelt responded to Einstein in October 1939, and informed him that he had set up a committee to study uranium. The President's Advisory Committee on Uranium first met in October 1939, and recommended that the government fund limited research into uranium. The effort expanded in 1940, after the German invasion of Poland, when President Roosevelt reorganized the Uranium Committee into a scientific body known as the National Defense Research Committee. Over the next few years, this organization supported funding for scientists who were exploring alternative processes that would produce the fissionable materials needed for a nuclear bomb. ", "By mid-1942, with research proceeding on several different processes, the committee decided that it was time to advance to the pilot plant stage and to full-production planning for the atomic bomb. In June 1942, President Roosevelt approved a plan giving the Army Corps of Engineers the responsibility for producing an atomic weapon before the end of the war, and the Army established the Manhattan Engineer District (MED).", "With Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves in charge, the Manhattan Engineer District joined major industrial partners with scientists and academia to research, develop, and produce an atomic bomb. The Army owned and managed the MED from 1942 through 1946. ", "After World War II, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established a policy to develop atomic energy for military and peaceful purposes. The act established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), an independent civilian agency, and moved the weapons program from the Army to the AEC. The act stipulated that, with certain exceptions, a civilian agency \"shall be the exclusive owner of all facilities for the production of fissionable material,\" including \"all materials, facilities, equipment, items, and property related to atomic energy research\"; this placed nuclear energy, and the U.S. nuclear weapons program, firmly under civilian control.", "The decision on whether to place nuclear energy under civilian or military control was bitterly contentious in 1946. Some feared that military control would impede or prevent the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, would impede the free international exchange of information on the basic science of atomic energy, would stifle independent inquiry, and would impede efforts to have international control of atomic energy. The armed services and some Members of Congress, however, were concerned about the need to preserve secrecy and to ensure the responsiveness of the nuclear weapons program to the needs of the services. Those concerns were raised as arguments for continued military control over nuclear energy.", "The Atomic Energy Act [42 U,S,C, 2121(b)] institutionalized civilian control. It authorized the AEC to conduct research and development on the military applications of nuclear energy and to produce nuclear weapons and their components, but \"only to the extent that the express consent and direction of the President of the United States has been obtained.\" The act gave the President further control:", "The President from time to time may direct the Commission (1) to deliver such quantities of fissionable materials or weapons to the armed forces for such use as he deems necessary in the interest of national defense or (2) to authorize the armed forces to manufacture, produce, or acquire any equipment or device utilizing fissionable material or atomic energy as a military weapon. ", "The act also established a Military Liaison Committee and directed the AEC to \"to coordinate nuclear defense activities between the War and Navy Departments the AEC.\" The council was expected to \"advise and consult with the Committee on all atomic energy matters which the Committee deems to relate to military applications.\"", "In the early years, civilian control extended to custodianship over operational nuclear weapons. With early weapon designs, the fissile core of the weapon was separated from the rest of the weapon to address safety concerns; AEC personnel maintained custody of the cores. This practice continued until the mid-1950s, when integrated warheads were designed, produced, and turned over to DOD.", "In the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-438 ), Congress dissolved the AEC and created the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). ERDA became the lead agency in the energy R&D program and the repository of the weapons program. That program was moved again by the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which dissolved ERDA and created the Department of Energy.", "Congress, in passing the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 ( P.L. 106-65 , Title XXXII), established the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency operating within DOE. According to NNSA, its mission, among other things, is to maintain and enhance \"the safety, security, and effectiveness of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile without nuclear explosive testing\"; work to \"reduce the global danger from weapons of mass destruction\"; provide the U.S. Navy \"with safe and effective nuclear propulsion\"; and respond to \"nuclear and radiological emergencies in the U.S. and abroad.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Nuclear Weapons Complex", "paragraphs": ["The eight sites that NNSA identifies as composing the current U.S. Nuclear Security Enterprise reflect the most recent in a series of expansions and contractions in the structure of the nuclear weapons complex for carrying out the functions required to maintain the nuclear weapons stockpile. Generally, the enterprise has been structured and operated in three phases. Although the locations of the facilities have changed, the essential functions have mostly remained the same because warhead designs have largely remained the same. ", "First, during the 1940s, the Manhattan Project included three well-known primary \"government-owned, contractor-operated\" (GOCO) facilities that were used during World War II and immediately afterward. These included the laboratory at Los Alamos, NM (called Site Y in World War II, now Los Alamos National Laboratory), which designed nuclear weapons; the Hanford Engineering Works (later known as the Hanford Reservation or Hanford Site) near Richland, WA, which produced plutonium; and three major sites at Oak Ridge, TN, which produced uranium enriched in the fissile isotope 235. The nuclear weapons complex also incorporated hundreds of smaller \"contractor-owned, contractor-operated\" (COCO) facilities that allowed for rapid increases in production in the early years of the nuclear weapons program. In some cases, these facilities performed nonnuclear materials production and fabrication operations; in other cases, they performed operations with radioactive materials alongside ongoing nonnuclear civilian operations.", "In the second phase, during the early 1950s, the Atomic Energy Commission consolidated many of these functions into a smaller number of larger GOCO facilities constructed throughout the United States. This consolidation reduced the AEC's reliance on the smaller COCO facilities and was expected to result in economies of scale at a time when overall production increased dramatically to meet the need of the Cold War stockpile buildup. Many facilities performed multiple functions. To provide sufficient capacity to meet the needs of the expanding stockpile, some operations were performed at multiple facilities. By late 1952, the AEC had several new production plants planned or under construction, and it was expanding existing plants. These included plants at Savannah River, SC; Oak Ridge, TN; Hanford, WA; Fernald and Miamisburg, OH; Rocky Flats, CO; Largo, FL; Albuquerque, NM; and Kansas City, MO.", "The third phase of U.S. nuclear weapons complex coincided roughly with the end of the Cold War. With President George H.W. Bush's 1991 decision to withdraw most nonstrategic nuclear weapons from deployment, the cancellation of several ongoing warhead programs, and the signing of arms control agreements that limited the numbers of deployed nuclear forces, the need for new nuclear warheads diminished and the number of warheads in the U.S. nuclear stockpile began to decline sharply. In addition, in 1992, Congress enacted a moratorium on U.S. nuclear weapons testing when it attached the Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment to the 1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act. President George H.W. Bush signed the bill into law ( P.L. 102-377 ) and President Clinton extended the moratorium three times before signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in 1996. Although the Senate declined to consent to ratification of the CTBT in 1999, the United States has not conducted any explosive nuclear tests since September 1992, before the moratorium entered into force. The United States also has not designed or produced a new nuclear warhead since production of the W88 warhead ended in 1992. ", "Regulatory challenges and concerns regarding environmental, safety, and health issues at existing nuclear weapons facilities, along with reductions in the size of the stockpile and growing public scrutiny, prompted a significant reduction in the number of facilities producing nuclear warheads and associated nuclear materials. By the mid-1990s, the number of sites working to maintain U.S. nuclear weapons had declined to the current nine sites, and a TVA reactor, in seven states. The remaining facilities not only continued to operate, but they often sought budget increases to address urgent safety and environmental issues and to repair and replace aging infrastructure. With the heightened focus on environmental and health issues, in FY1995, for the first time, the DOE budget for Environmental Management exceeded DOE's budget for nuclear weapons production.", "When these nuclear weapons operations shut down, there was typically no clear plan in place for follow-up operations. Perhaps most significantly, the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado ceased plutonium productions operations in June 1989 without clear plans to restore pit capacity elsewhere. In addition, when operations ceased at Hanford, Rocky Flats, and the Savannah River Site, significant amounts of special nuclear materials were in the midst of processing activities, which posed significant safeguards, security, and safety challenges. When DOE's efforts to restart the K-reactor at the Savannah River Site failed and caused tritium contamination in the Savannah River in 1991, a new tritium productions capacity had to be developed using commercial power reactors. ", "Over time, DOE developed the capacity at alternative facilities to meet most of the stockpile needs. For example, new nonnuclear hydrodynamic testing facilities were constructed at Los Alamos and Livermore National Laboratories. The Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power reactors provided tritium production capacity. Further, in the absence of nuclear weapons testing, the United States has adopted a science-based program to maintain and sustain confidence in the reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. This program, established in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 ( P.L. 103-160 ) and amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 ( P.L. 111-84 , \u00a73111), is designed to ensure \"that the nuclear weapons stockpile is safe, secure, and reliable without the use of underground nuclear weapons testing.\" However, as discussed below, plutonium pit capacity at LANL has not been able to keep pace with NNSA's stated needs for the stockpile."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Current Nuclear Weapons Complex", "paragraphs": ["The current nuclear weapons complex, which NNSA refers to as the Nuclear Security Enterprise, includes \"NNSA Headquarters (located in Washington, DC; Germantown, Maryland; and Albuquerque, New Mexico), the NNSA field offices, the three national security laboratories (two of which also have production missions), the four nuclear weapons production facilities, and the Nevada National Security Site.\" Two other facilities are essential for maintaining the stockpile: (1) the TVA's Watts Barr nuclear power reactor in Tennessee, which produces tritium, a relatively short-lived nuclear material vital to modern nuclear warheads, and (2) the WIPP site in New Mexico, which is used to manage, isolate, and store plutonium-bearing wastes from the warhead operations at other sites.
