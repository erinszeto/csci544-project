Prior to 2003, DOD used a threat-based approach to identifying warfighter requirements. With the advent of JCIDS, DOD shifted to a capabilities-based approach to identifying warfighter needs. In other words, instead of developing, producing, and fielding systems based on specific perceived threats to the nation, DOD adopted a policy of identifying what capabilities it needs to meet the strategic direction and priorities set forth in high-level strategy and guidance documents such as the National Military Strategy, National Defense Strategy, and Quadrennial Defense Review. ", "Many analysts suggest that under the threat-based approach, each military service identified a threat, and in response to the threat developed its own independent weapons.
