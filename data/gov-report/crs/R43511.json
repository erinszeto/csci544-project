In 2013, distillate fuel oil imports exceeded 56.4 million barrels, up from the previous year's 46.2 million barrels. However, distillate fuel imports have been declining. Overall, some 6.9 million households rely on heating oil nationally. The number of overall household users, however, has declined from 8.7 million in 2006-2007, and the Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects a 3% decline for 2013-2014. By and large, the greatest demand for home heating oil is in the Northeast United States, where some 5.5 million households relied on it for primary space heating during the winter of 2012-2013, consuming 645.5 gallons per household on average (compared to 766.4 gallons by Midwest households).", "In response to the near doubling of heating oil prices in some Northeastern states during the winter of 1999-2000, which raised the concern of many Northeastern lawmakers, Congress authorized 2 million barrel Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) in the Energy Policy Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-469). As an emergency stockpile of government-owned heating oil, Congress intended NHHOR to meet roughly 10 days of demand by the Northeastern states at the time. Currently, NHHOR stands at under 1 million barrels, split between Groton, CT (400,000 barrels), and Revere, MA (500,000 barrels).", "Middle-distillate range petroleum products can serve as both heating and transportation needs. In its 13-year history, NHHOR has only released fuel for use by federal, state, and local emergency responders during natural disasters and not for retail sales during market dislocations. While the release demonstrated the utility of maintaining a distillate stockpile, it was not based on the conditions of a heating oil supply shortage. The recent sale of NHHOR stocks and replacement with ultra-low sulfur distillate increased its utility as a transportation fuel. In the absence of NHHOR, residential consumers have the recourse of substituting ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel for their heating needs, although this fuel tends to be more expensive per gallon than heating oil.", "Congress also authorized the National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA) to develop projects for the research, development, and demonstration of clean and efficient oilheat utilization equipment; and to operate programs that enhanced consumer and employee training. Further, Congress authorized the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to help offset some homeowners' heating bills. Several charities also provide assistance.", "A number of factors may contribute to the nation's declining demand for heating oil. The most significant factor may be that the increasing price of heating oil has discouraged use. Heating oil prices continue to remain high, as do other petroleum products and crude oil. These factors raise several questions: what factors have contributed to the decline of heating oil consumption; does the Northeast still depend on heating oil to the extent it did over a decade ago; and should Congress continue to monitor the Northeast heating oil supply?"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since peaking in 2007 at 1.53 billion barrels, the volume of distillate fuel oil (DFO) supplied to the United States has declined somewhat (see Figure 1 ).

U.S. refiners have increased diesel fuel production and export primarily to satisfy the demand by European markets. In 2013, the United States exported 409.7 million barrels of distillate fuel oil, of which 324.4 million barrels (91%) left from Gulf Coast ports; another 37.5 million barrels (9%) left East Coast ports.

By and large, the Northeast United States represents the greatest demand for home heating oil where slightly more than 5.5 million households relied on it for primary space heating during the winter of 2012-2013. The decline may be attributed to a number of factors, including price, improvement in home energy efficiency and insulation, new construction, population shift, availability of alternative heating fuels, and milder weather (fewer heating degree days).

This raises the question whether residential consumers may have switched from heating oil to other available fuels. The availability of natural gas depends on the availability of transmission and distribution pipelines. At least 20 interstate natural gas transmission pipelines serve the northeast region of the United States (see Figure 8 ). This pipeline system delivers natural gas to several intrastate natural gas pipelines and at least 50 local distribution companies in the region. In addition to the natural gas produced in the region, several long-distance natural gas transmission pipelines supply the region from the Southeast through Virginia and West Virginia, and from the Midwest through West Virginia and into Pennsylvania. Canadian imports come into the region principally through New York, Maine, and New Hampshire. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies enter the region from Canada through Highgate Springs, VT, and from other countries through Everett, MA (although these supplies have been declining). As shown in Figure 8 , service to the far northeastern states is limited. Natural gas produced from Pennsylvania's Marcellus shale, which could serve the Northeast, did not begin to come on line until after 2008, and the pipeline infrastructure to deliver this gas has not expanded in the New England states.", "However, as a percent of overall domestic demand for natural gas, the Northeast region has remained nearly steady, varying between 20% and 22% since 2000. After 2000, the Northeast demand varied somewhat through 2006, and then leveled off in the years since and returned to a level barely above 2001-2002 (see Figure 9 ). If heating oil users were switching to an alternative heating fuel, it was not apparent that natural gas was the choice. Residential use of kerosene also declined. Bottled gas (propane) also serves as a heating fuel. However, the price of residential propane rose from $1 per gallon in 2000 to over $2.80 per gallon in 2012, suggesting that it did not offer a more economical alternative.

Both states also saw dramatic declines in heating oil demand, suggesting that some switching to electricity for heating may have occurred over the same time period (see Figure 4 ).

The LIHEAP statute provides for two types of funding: regular funds (sometimes referred to as block grant funds) and emergency contingency funds. Regular funds are allocated to grantees based on a formula, while emergency contingency funds may be released to one or more grantees at the discretion of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services based on emergency need. ", "Regular LIHEAP funds are allocated to the states according to a formula that has a long and complicated history. (Tribes and territories receive funds through set-asides.) In 1980, Congress created the predecessor program to LIHEAP, the Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP), as part of the Crude Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act ( P.L. 96-223 ). Because Congress was particularly concerned with the high costs of heating, funds under LIEAP were distributed according to a multi-step formula that benefitted cold-weather states. In 1981, Congress enacted LIHEAP as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( P.L. 97-35 ), replacing LIEAP. However, the LIHEAP statute specified that states would continue to receive the same percentage of regular funds that they did under the LIEAP formula (this is sometimes referred to as the \"old\" LIHEAP formula). ", "When Congress reauthorized LIHEAP in 1984 as part of the Human Services Reauthorization Act ( P.L. 98-558 ), it changed the program's formula by requiring the use of more recent population and energy data and requiring that HHS consider both heating and cooling costs of low-income households (a change from what had largely been a focus on the need for heating assistance). The effect of these changes meant that, in general, some funding would be shifted from cold-weather states to warm-weather states. To prevent a dramatic shift of funds, Congress added two \"hold-harmless\" provisions to the formula. The percentage of funds that states receive under the formula enacted in 1984 is sometimes referred to as the \"new\" formula."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Citizens Energy Oil Heat Program", "paragraphs": ["Citizens Energy Corporation (also known as Joe-4-Oil) offers heating oil assistance through vouchers for 100 gallons per heating season.

Although steady price increases appear to correlate with declining demand, consumers may have responded by using less heating oil. Some residential consumers may have switched to electricity, natural gas, bottled gas, kerosene, or wood. A rise in electricity sales could suggest some displacement of heating oil, but could also correlate with increased population and new home construction. Both housing stock and occupancy rates increased over the 2000 through 2011 timeframe, suggesting an increased demand for residential heating. However, more energy-efficient and better-insulated new houses could have replaced older units. Newer, more efficient oilheat furnaces could have replaced older units. Congress also authorized the National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA) in the 2000 Energy Act to inform consumers about cleaner and more efficient oilheat equipment (see Appendix B ). ", "The Northeast's heating oil demand has declined 47% since 2000, reflecting an overall decline in petroleum products demand nationally. In response to the 1999-2000 heating oil price spike and supply shortage, Congress authorized a 2 million-barrel Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHHOR) to meet roughly 10 days of the Northeast's demand (see Appendix B ). At that time (2000), the Northeast annually consumed nearly 5.2 billion gallons (123.7 million barrels). The winter heating season typically begins October 1 and may last through May 31\u2014some 243 days. Based on that assumption, the rate of consumption could reach half a million barrels per day, and thus consume the Reserve in as few as four days (the most extreme case when the heating oil supply is cut off). Under the current average consumption rate of 70.9 million barrels annually, the Reserve could last as long as a week. Heating fuel shortages are more likely to occur toward the end of the heating season, which lengthy or late-season cold spells may exacerbate. During such episodes, homeowners have the recourse of purchasing diesel fuel (although at a higher price), as do homeowners who run out of heating oil before their scheduled deliveries.", "In its 13-year history, NHHOR has only released fuel in response to distillate fuel shortages during natural disasters, and not in response to a market dislocation. (The overall short supply of transportation fuels and blocked roads in the regions affected by Superstorm Sandy and winter snowstorms may have also prevented commercial fuel deliveries to residential heating customers.) While the NHHOR release demonstrated the utility of maintaining a distillate stockpile, it was not based on the conditions of a heating oil supply shortage. The 2000 Energy Policy Conservation Act amendment ( P.L. 106-469 ) that established NHHOR had only authorized the Energy Secretary to sell NHHOR stock in the event of a dislocation in the heating oil market resulting from an interruption, or circumstances that constitute a regional supply shortage. The amendment did not include a provision for the type of contingency that arose after Sandy, however. Congress may move to consider the need for clarifying the Energy Secretary's authority to release NHHOR stocks for emergency contingencies. ", "NHHOR does not appear to have influenced heating oil prices the way that the threat of releasing crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve might influence crude oil prices. Commodity traders are likely to bid up heating oil futures contracts early in the season, if long-term weather forecasts call for a colder winter. Heating oil futures contracts will also reflect crude oil price futures. Observers may interpret these trading patterns as speculative bidding that is driving prices higher. However, to guarantee and lock in future supplies, heating oil brokers may be compelled to enter higher bids. ", "Independent retail marketers tend to respond to more local market conditions and shorter timeframes. Price increases (or decreases) reflect the marketer's expectation of the cost to replace their current fuel stocks in order to stay in business. In authorizing NHHOR, policy makers sought to avert the \"price gouging\" reported to occur prior to and during fuel shortages. In defense of marketers, consumers only become aware of impending shortages through a price signal, that is, a price spike. No more direct signal exists to inform consumers of the need to conserve, and no more immediate mechanism exists to allocate at least a minimum amount of fuel while discouraging hoarding. The reluctance of the Secretary of Energy to tap NHHOR may have influenced consumers to conserve fuel as prices escalated over time (very much in line with overall energy conservation policy). The presence of NHHOR may have instilled some confidence that a supply shortage would be temporary. In the aftermath of Sandy, however, NHHOR supported a federal disaster response effort, not as a response to a market dislocation as policy makers had conceived its role.", "The Northeast region's reduced dependence on heating oil and the increased availability of alternative heating fuels raise the question of whether DOE should continue maintaining NHHOR, and whether Congress should continue to monitor the region's heating oil supply.", "Appendix A.

The acute conditions drew the concern of many Northeastern lawmakers because 69% of the U.S. households that used heating oil were located in the Northeast. The region continues to rely on heating oil as a source of home heating, but at a sharply reduced level.

The intent of defining a dislocation was to make the threshold for use of the regional reserve high enough so that it would not discourage oil marketers and distributors from building up heating oil stocks. The President could also authorize a release of the NHHOR in the event that a \"circumstance exists (other than the defined dislocation) that is a regional supply shortage of significant scope and duration, the adverse impacts of which would be 'significantly' reduced by use of the NHHOR.\"", "Drawdowns", "During mid- and late December 2000, heating oil prices breached the 60% differential. However, this was due to a sharp decline in crude prices rather than to a rise in home heating oil prices. In fact, home heating oil prices were drifting slightly lower during the same reporting period. Although the 60% differential was satisfied, other conditions requisite to authorizing a drawdown of the NHHOR were not met. ", "A general strike in Venezuela that began in late 2002 resulted, for a time, in a loss of as much as 1.5 million barrels of daily crude supply to the United States. With refinery use lower than usual because of less crude reaching the United States, domestic markets for home heating oil had to rely on refined product inventories to meet demand during a particularly cold winter. Prices rose, and there were calls for use of the NHHOR; still, the price of heating oil fell significantly short of meeting the guidelines for a drawdown. ", "Neither the 2000 heating oil price spike nor the 2002 Venezuela strike led to a determination to draw down NHHOR.", "May 2007 Sale", "DOE announced on May 24, 2007, that it would sell approximately 35,000 barrels of home heating oil from the NHHOR. The Reserve's current five-year storage contract for the Providence, RI, storage location was to expire September 30, 2007, and market conditions had caused new storage costs to rise to a level that exceeded available funds. Revenue from the sale was used to supplement funds for the award of new long-term storage contracts that began October 1, 2007. The sale of heating oil from the Reserve's site commenced June 13, 2007, using an interactive online bidding system, and bidding closed on June 14. The 35,000 barrels sale represented less than 2% of the NHHOR authorized capacity of 2 million barrels of heating oil. ", "Sale and Exchange for Ultra Low Sulfur Oil", "During February 2011, DOE conducted a turnover of the roughly 2-million-barrel Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve for the purpose of converting its high sulfur (2,000 parts per million) stocks to cleaner-burning ultra-low sulfur distillate (15 parts per million). On February 3, DOE sold nearly 1 million barrels stored at the Hess First Reserve Terminal in Perth Amboy, NJ. On February 10, DOE sold another 1 million barrels from two storage sites in Connecticut: Hess Groton Terminal and the Magellan New Haven Terminal. DOE received approximately $227 million from the two sales and used the receipts to purchase ultra-low sulfur distillate during the summer of 2011. (DOE realized $114.40/barrel or $2.72 per gallon, compared to $2.80 per gallon wholesale price for U.S. No. 2 Distillate.) ", "Superstorm Sandy, October 2012", "In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy struck the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and the Great Lakes region with devastating winds, rain, snow, and tidal surges. President Obama responded by declaring that the storm had created a severe energy supply interruption and directed the Department of Energy to transfer emergency fuel from the Reserve to the Department of Defense (DOD) for its use in emergency operations and support for those in the region affected by the storm. At the time, transportation fuel was in short supply. The Defense Logistics Agency\u2014Energy transferred fuel from the Hess Terminal in Groton, CT, and distributed it to state, local, and federal responders in the New York/New Jersey area. Although designated a heating fuel, it may have served as a transportation fuel for DOD diesel-fueled vehicles providing logistical support for hurricane relief efforts, or as a heating fuel for relief centers.", "Following a major snowstorm that hit the Northeast in November 2012 and compounded relief efforts there, DOE received and granted two more requests for NHHOR fuel. ", "In total, the Reserve released over 120,000 barrels (more than 5 million gallons) of fuel to support emergency relief efforts. Under its agreement with DOE, DOD replenished the Reserve with an equal volume of ultra-low sulfur diesel. Sandy and the subsequent snowstorm marked the first time that emergency withdrawals were made from the NHHOR.", "The 2000 Energy Policy Conservation Act amendment ( P.L. 106-469 ) that established NHHOR had only authorized the Energy Secretary to sell NHHOR stock in the event of a dislocation in the heating oil market resulting from an interruption, or circumstances that constitute a regional supply shortage. The amendment did not include any provision for the type of contingency that arose after Sandy, however."], "subsections": []}]}}
