Other bills would provide an ad hoc COLA of a specified percentage or require the use of a different measure of price change to determine the COLA. Alternative measures of price change, such as the experimental Consumer Price Index for the Elderly (CPI-E), are proposed on the basis that the CPI-W may not accurately reflect the spending patterns of the Social Security beneficiary population, especially the elderly who tend to allocate a greater share of their total spending to healthcare than the rest of the population.

Others point out, however, that the population aged 65 and older as a group is not uniformly economically vulnerable. They also argue that a one-time payment is not necessary because beneficiaries received an unusually high COLA in 2009 (5.8%) and were protected against deflation in a subsequent period.

It has also been argued that all BLS inflation measures, including the CPI-E, understate the rate of improvement in the quality of healthcare and that incorporating healthcare quality improvements would reduce measured changes in the price of healthcare.

Prices fell in subsequent months in 2008 so that the annual CPI-W change for calendar year 2008 was somewhat lower. In other words, Social Security recipients benefitted from a one-time spike in energy prices during 2008. In addition, ARRA provided a one-time $250 payment to Social Security and SSI beneficiaries, retired railroad workers, and recipients of benefits from certain programs run by the VA. In 2009, some persons also benefitted from a Recovery Rebate tax credit on their 2008 federal income tax returns ($600 for unmarried persons, $1,200 for married couples) if they did not receive the economic stimulus payment in 2008 or their rebate was higher when calculated using their 2008 financial information.

It looks at the age distribution of beneficiaries' reliance on their Social Security benefits. For measuring reliance on Social Security benefits, the Social Security Administration tabulations use beneficiary units, defined as either married couples living together in which at least one member is aged 65 or older, or non-married persons aged 65 or older. Table 3 shows that the older one gets, the greater the reliance on, or proportion of income from, Social Security benefits.

In the second quarter, output increased at an annual rate of 1.7%.", "One tool available to improve the pace of economic recovery is to increase government spending on items which can be expected to boost economic activity. Government spending can take various forms: federal investments on infrastructure, goods and services, aid to state and local governments, or transfer payments to individuals to increase the income available to them. Other fiscal policy options that serve to increase demand include reducing taxes on individuals and/or firms. For a fiscal stimulus to be effective, there is consensus that it needs to be timely, well-targeted, and temporary. Thus, spending ought to be targeted at those who are liquidity constrained\u2014those who would spend it immediately and not save it. It should be temporary to increase output (in periods of relatively low economic activity) in the short run but not increase a long run-deficit. Government spending creates additional income, which in turn creates additional spending, resulting in a cumulative impact on the economy that is a multiple of the original amount of spending. For example, extending unemployment benefits would more than likely encourage immediate spending because unemployed individuals are, in general, cash-starved and likely to spend any additional benefits received.", "CBO published recent estimates on categories of government spending and other fiscal policy options that can be expected to provide such a boost to the economy. These temporary expenditures are assumed to be deficit-financed and will add to government debt in the short run. Table 4 lists the fiscal multipliers associated with several policy options. A multiplier is defined as the change in units of output (or GDP) as a result of a change in one unit of spending. Thus, a multiplier of 1.9 for government spending on unemployment benefits implies that a $1 increase in this type of spending will increase total economic activity by $1.90. The higher the multiplier, the more effective the fiscal stimulus. The ranges between the high and low values of the multiplier in the table are designed to encompass most economists' views.", "As can be seen in Table 4 , the top three categories of fiscal policy options expected to have the highest impact are increasing aid to the unemployed, reducing employers' payroll taxes, and reducing payroll taxes for employers who increase their payroll. While there is much debate on the exact sizes of these multipliers, there is considerable agreement that additional government spending can work only if the recipients quickly spend the money that they receive. Therefore, additional one-time payments can generate additional demand only to the extent that the recipients spend the additional income. In their 2010 report on policy options, CBO states that many of the elderly save at rates similar to those in the working-age population, resulting in this policy having a moderate impact on output. As a result, Social Security beneficiaries are not expected to increase spending as a result of a one-time payment as much as would beneficiaries of several other government spending options. This explains why spending on unemployment benefits has a higher impact on total economic activity (higher multiplier) than a one-time payment to Social Security beneficiaries, many of whom are likely to save the additional money. The modest additional spending for providing a one-time payment in lieu of a Social Security COLA (roughly $13 billion as described in Budget Impact section later) along with the moderate expected impact (or \"bang for the buck\") is likely to result in a small economic stimulus.", "An expansion in debt due to a fiscal stimulus is expected to increase output and employment. Once output and employment reach their full potential, fiscal restraint in the form of additional taxes or reduced spending would have to be imposed to reverse the accumulation of government debt, or future output will grow more slowly than otherwise. According to the CBO study, there is no contradiction in expanding government spending today and imposing restraint several years later. CBO estimates that the presence of large current unused capacities (underused buildings and offices, the high unemployment rate) has resulted (as of February 2010) in the nation's output being about 6% less than its full potential."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Means Testing", "paragraphs": ["Means testing the one-time payment could be viewed as a way to target the payments to those in greatest financial need and to strengthen the economic stimulus effect of the payments (on the basis that low-income beneficiaries would be more likely to spend the money quickly).

In addition, lawmakers would have to determine the income threshold for a means test, which could be a contentious matter for practical and political reasons (ideally, the income threshold would be set at a level that would effectively target the payments without excluding a large share of the beneficiary population).
