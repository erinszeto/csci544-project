{"id": "RS22538", "title": "Unemployment Compensation: The Cornerstone of Income Support for Unemployed Workers", "released_date": "2008-07-21T00:00:00", "summary": ["A variety of benefits may be available to unemployed workers to provide them with income support during a spell of unemployment. When eligible workers lose their jobs, the Unemployment Compensation (UC) program may provide income support through the payment of UC benefits. Many workers who have exhausted their rights to regular UC benefits may have their unemployment insurance benefits extended for up to 13 additional weeks through the temporary Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program. In addition, the Extended Benefit (EB) program may extend UC benefits at the state level if certain economic situations within the state exist. This report briefly summarizes the UC program, its authorization, appropriations, benefit determination, and funding.

UC benefits may be extended at the state level if certain economic situations under the Extended Benefit (EB) program within the state exist.", "The UC program has a direct impact on almost every business in the United States as most businesses are subject to state and federal unemployment taxes. An estimated $7.4 billion in federal unemployment taxes and $36.1 billion in state unemployment taxes were collected in FY2007. In FY2007, the federal appropriation for the UC program was $3.7 billion. In FY2007, states spent an estimated $31.4 billion on UC benefits. Approximately 133.4 million jobs are covered by the UC program. In March 2008, 3.2 million unemployed workers received UC benefits in a given week and the average weekly UC benefit amount was $291.", "Originally, the intent of the UC program, among other things, was to help counter economic fluctuations such as recessions. This intent is reflected in the current UC program's funding and benefit structure. When the economy grows, UC program revenue rises through increased tax revenues while UC program spending falls as fewer workers are unemployed. The effect of collecting more taxes than are spent dampens demand in the economy. This also creates a surplus of funds or a \"cushion\" of available funds for the UC program to draw upon during a recession. In a recession, UC tax revenue falls and UC program spending rises as more workers lose their jobs and receive UC benefits. The increased amount of UC payments to unemployed workers dampens the economic effect of earnings losses by injecting additional funds into the economy.", "Other programs that may provide workers with income support are more specialized.

The EUC08 program allows states to determine which benefit is paid first. Thus, states may choose to pay EUC08 before EB or vice versa. States balance the decision of which benefit to pay first by examining the potential cost savings to the state with the potential loss of unemployment benefits for unemployed individuals in the state. It may be less costly for the state to choose to pay for the EUC08 benefit first as the EUC08 benefit is 100% federally financed (whereas the EB benefit is 50% state financed).
