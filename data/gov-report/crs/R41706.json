Among the overarching issues that Congress contended with in the FY2012 appropriations process were the extent to which the federal R&D investment could grow in the context of increased pressure on discretionary spending and how available funding would be prioritized and allocated. The appropriations legislation was incorporated into two bills, the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-55) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. 112-74). P.L. 112-55, included the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Act; the Commerce, Justice, State and Related Agencies Act; and the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Act, and was passed by Congress on November 17, 2011, and signed into law two days later. P.L. 112-74, incorporating the nine remaining appropriations bills, was passed by Congress on December 17, 2011, and signed into law by President Obama on December 23, 2011. Prior to enactment of these bills, government operations into FY2012 were funded through a series of continuing appropriations acts.", "President Obama requested $147.911 billion for R&D in FY2012, a $772 million (0.5%) increase from the FY2010 actual R&D funding level of $147.139 billion. At the time the President's FY2012 budget was released, action had not been completed on FY2011 full-year funding so the President's budget compared the FY2012 request to FY2010 appropriations. On April 15, 2011, the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10) was signed into law. Division A of the act provided FY2011 appropriations for the Department of Defense; Division B provided full-year continuing funding for FY2011 for all other agencies at their FY2010 levels unless otherwise specified in the act.", "President Obama's request sought increases in the R&D budgets of the three agencies targeted for doubling over 7 years by the America COMPETES Act, and over 10 years by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 and by President Bush under his American Competitiveness Initiative, as measured using FY2006 funding as the baseline. Although President Obama supported a 10-year doubling in his FY2010 budget, his FY2012 budget was intentionally silent on a timeframe. Congress appropriated $12.529 billion in FY2012 for the targeted accounts, an increase of $207 million (1.7%) over FY2011 funding of $12.323 billion, and $1.417 billion (-10.2%) less than the President's request.", "For more than a decade, federal R&D has been affected by mechanisms used to continue appropriations in the absence of enactment of regular appropriations acts and to complete the annual appropriations process.

However, widespread concerns about the federal debt and recent and projected federal budget deficits drove difficult decisions involving prioritization of R&D within the context of the entire federal budget and among competing priorities within the federal R&D portfolio. The U.S. government supports a broad range of scientific and engineering research and development. Its purposes include addressing specific concerns such as national defense, health, safety, the environment, and energy security; advancing knowledge generally; developing the scientific and engineering workforce; and strengthening U.S. innovation and competitiveness in the global economy. Most of the R&D funded by the federal government is performed in support of the unique missions of the funding agencies. The federal government has played an important role in supporting R&D efforts that have led to scientific breakthroughs and new technologies, from jet aircraft and the Internet to communications satellites and defenses against disease.", "Congress plays a central role in defining the nation's R&D priorities as it makes decisions with respect to the size and distribution of aggregate, agency, and programmatic R&D funding. During the course of the FY2012 appropriations process, some Members of Congress expressed concerns about the level of federal R&D funding in light of the current federal fiscal condition, deficit, and debt. As Congress acted to complete the FY2012 appropriations process it faced two overarching issues: the extent to which the federal R&D investment can grow in the context of increased pressure on discretionary spending and how available funding will be prioritized and allocated. ", "President Obama's proposed FY2012 budget, released on February 14, 2011, included $147.911 billion for R&D in FY2012, a 0.5% increase over the actual FY2010 R&D funding level of $147.139 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the President's FY2012 R&D request represented a decrease of 2.2% from the FY2010 level. This report provides government-wide, multi-agency, and individual agency analyses of the President's FY2012 request as it relates to R&D and related activities, and Congressional appropriations actions.", "Among its provisions, the President's proposed FY2012 R&D funding maintained an emphasis on increasing funding for the physical sciences and engineering, an effort consistent with the intent of the America COMPETES Act ( P.L. 110-69 ) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 ( P.L. 111-358 ). These acts proposed to achieve this objective by authorizing increased funding for three agencies with a strong R&D emphasis in these disciplines: the Department of Energy Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology's core laboratory research and R&D facilities construction funding. Appropriations provided to these agencies have, in aggregate, fallen short of the levels authorized in these acts. (See \" Multiagency R&D Initiatives \" for detailed information.)", "More broadly, in a 2009 speech before members of the National Academy of Sciences, President Obama put forth a goal of increasing the national investment in R&D to more than 3% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). President Obama did not provide details on how this goal might be achieved (e.g., how much would be funded through increases in direct federal R&D funding or through indirect mechanisms such as the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit ); however, doing so likely would have required a substantial increase in public and/or private investment. ", "In addition, advocates for increased federal R&D funding\u2014including President Obama's science advisor, John Holdren\u2014raised concerns about the potential harm of a \"boom-bust\" approach to federal R&D funding (i.e., rapid growth in federal R&D funding followed by much slower growth, flat funding, or even decline). The biomedical research community experienced a variety of challenges resulting from such a circumstance following the five-year doubling of the NIH budget that was completed in FY2003. With the NIH doubling came a rapid expansion of the nation's biomedical research infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratories, equipment), as well as rapid growth in university faculty hiring, students pursuing biomedical degrees, and grant applications to NIH. After the doubling, however, the agency's budget fell each year in real terms from FY2004 to FY2009. Critics assert there have been a variety of damages from this boom-bust cycle, including interruptions and cancellations of promising research, declining share in the number of NIH grant proposals funded, decreased student interest in pursuing graduate studies, and reduced employment prospects for the large number of biomedical researchers with advanced degrees. According to then-NIH Director Elias Zerhouni, the damages have been particularly acute for early- and mid-career scientists seeking a first or second grant.", "Analysis of federal R&D funding is complicated by several factors, including inconsistency among agencies in the reporting of R&D. As a result of these factors, the R&D agency figures reported by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and shown in Table 1 , may differ somewhat from the agency budget analyses that appear later in this report.", "Another factor complicating analysis of the President's FY2012 budget request was the proposal for a Wireless Innovation (WIN) Fund, a part of the Administration's Wireless Innovation and Infrastructure Initiative. Under the President's request, the WIN Fund was to receive $3 billion over seven years (FY2012-FY2018) from receipts generated through electromagnetic spectrum auctions. According to the President's request, the WIN funds were to support research, test beds, and applications development to support leading-edge wireless technologies and applications for public safety, Smart Grid, telemedicine, distance learning, and other broadband capabilities and to facilitate spectrum relocation. Under the President's budget, if the WIN Fund was established, several agencies would have received funding for these purposes, among them the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Commerce, and the National Science Foundation.

The House approved the amount requested for the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program and the National Defense Sealift Fund. The House appropriated $5 million for RDT&E in the Inspector General's Office. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1.018 billion for RDT&E in the Defense Health Program and the amount requested for RDT&E in the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided $1.267 billion in Defense Health Program RDT&E; $407 million, as requested, for the Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program; and $5 million for RDT&E by the Inspector General's Office. ", "For OCO-related RDT&E, the House appropriated $437 million, supporting much of the Administration's request. It provided $10 million less than requested for the Air Force's Unmanned Endurance UAV program, but provided $50 million in funding the Air Force's Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Innovation program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $582 million for OCO-related RDT&E, nearly $200 million more than requested. $105 million of that increase was a result of transferring the Navy's MQ-4 UAV Title IV funding to the OCO funding. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Congress appropriated $526 million for OCO-related RDT&E. This included a $59 million transfer from JIEDDO to the Air Force for the continued development of an endurance unmanned aerial vehicle and a $50 million increase for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance innovations by the Air Force. ", "RDT&E funding can be broken out in different ways. Each of the military departments request and receive their own RDT&E funding. So, too, do various DOD agencies (e.g., the Missile Defense Agency and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), collectively aggregated within the Defensewide account. RDT&E funding also can be characterized by budget activity (i.e., the type of RDT&E supported). Those budget activities designated as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development, respectively) constitute what is called DOD's Science and Technology Program (S&T) and represent the more research-oriented part of the RDT&E program. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 focus on the development of specific weapon systems or components (e.g., the Joint Strike Fighter or missile defense systems), for which an operational need has been determined and an acquisition program established. Budget activity 6.6 provides management support, including support for test and evaluation facilities. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. ", "Congressional policymakers are particularly interested in S&T funding since these funds support the development of new technologies and the underlying science. Ensuring adequate support for S&T activities is seen by some in the defense community as imperative to maintaining U.S. military superiority. The knowledge generated at this stage of development can also contribute to advances in commercial technologies.", "The FY2012 Title IV baseline S&T funding request was $12.246 billion (not including the $100 million for the Wireless Innovation Fund), about $1.060 billion (8%) less than the total obligational authority available for Title IV baseline S&T in FY2010, but $113 million above that available in FY2011. Given the unspecified reductions to DARPA and the Defensewide account in general, it is not possible to determine how much the House actions supported S&T. However, without these reductions, the House Appropriations Committee had recommended $12.180 billion for S&T, less than the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $12.193 billion for S&T. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided $12.438 billion for S&T.", "Within the S&T program, basic research (6.1) receives special attention, particularly by the nation's universities. DOD is not a large supporter of basic research, when compared to NIH or NSF. However, over half of DOD's basic research budget is spent at universities and represents the major contribution of funds in some areas of science and technology (such as electrical engineering and material science). The FY2012 request for basic research ($2.078 billion) was roughly $263 million (14%) more than what was available for Title IV basic research in FY2010. The House appropriated $2.098 billion, a net increase of $20 million above the request, much of which went to increases for university research. However, the House appropriated $15 million less than requested for the National Defense Education Program. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $2.081 billion for basic research. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 provided $2.116 billion for basic research. This included an increase above the requested levels for the following: $20 million for Army University and Industry Research Centers at Historically Black Colleges, $20 million for Navy competitive university research and $8 million for Navy nanotechnology research, and $12 million for Air Force research in cybersecurity.

The proposed transfer from DNDO was denied.", "In late 2010, the S&T Directorate announced a reorganization and released a new strategic plan. The reorganization reduced the number of direct reports to the Under Secretary and was accompanied by a change in budget structure, with most of the previous budget lines combined into two new categories: Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) and Acquisition and Operations Support. According to DHS, the new strategy and organization will result in more robust partnerships with other DHS components, a smaller number of larger projects, and more emphasis on transitioning technology into the field rather than long-term research. The House and Senate committee reports both objected to the new budget structure. The House report described the RDI budget category as \"all-encompassing ... too large and vague.\" The Senate report stated that the new structure \"reduces transparency and accountability.\" The conference report stated that the new RDI category \"will enable S&T to more quickly shift resources ... between research activities\" and \"should ... partially offset the impact of an overall funding reduction,\" but it directed S&T to submit a quarterly \"detailed breakout\" of RDI projects \"for accountability and visibility.\"", "The construction of NBAF would likely result in increased congressional oversight for several years. For construction of NBAF and decommissioning of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), which NBAF is intended to replace, the FY2012 budget justification projected a need for $691 million in total appropriations between FY2012 and FY2017. In the appropriations acts for FY2009 through FY2011, Congress authorized DHS to use receipts from the sale of Plum Island to offset NBAF construction and PIADC decommissioning costs.

Each homeland security appropriations act from FY2007 through FY2011 included a requirement for secretarial certification before full-scale ASP procurement. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills for FY2012 included a similar requirement. In February 2010, DHS decided that it would no longer pursue the use of ASPs for primary screening, although it will continue developing and testing them for use in secondary screening. Although the FY2012 request included funds to purchase and deploy 44 ASPs for secondary screening, the director of DNDO subsequently stated that DNDO will deploy 13 ASPs that it has already purchased but will \"end the ASP program as originally conceived.\" The House committee report expressed an expectation that DNDO will not deploy ASPs prior to certification, even for secondary screening, but noted that radiation portal monitor funding in the House-passed bill \"is not restricted\" to previous-generation systems.

The same act eliminated any explicit mention of radiological and nuclear countermeasures from the statutory duties and responsibilities of the Under Secretary for S&T. Congress may consider whether the proposed transfer of DNDO's research activities to the S&T Directorate is consistent with its intent in the SAFE Port Act. Congress may also choose to consider the acquisition portion of DNDO's mission. Most of DNDO's funding for Systems Acquisition was eliminated in FY2010, and that year's budget stated that \"funding requests for radiation detection equipment will now be sought by the end users that will operate them.\" In contrast, the FY2012 request for Systems Acquisition included funding for ASPs that would be operated by Customs and Border Protection, as well as human-portable radiation detectors for the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection, and the Transportation Security Administration.

The conference agreement on the act ( H.Rept. 112-331 ) gave NIH total discretionary funding of $30.8 billion, virtually unchanged from the FY2011 level (see Table 8 ). However, this total does not reflect an across-the-board rescission of 0.189%. The Obama Administration had requested discretionary budget authority of $31.8 billion for NIH, an increase of $1,062 million (3.3%) over FY2011. In late September 2011, bills from the Senate Appropriations Committee had recommended total discretionary funding of $30.6 billion, slightly below the FY2011 level, while House bills would have provided $31.8 billion, equal to the request. Further details on congressional action follow the discussion of the request below. ", "NIH's organization consists of the Office of the NIH Director and 27 institutes and centers. The Office of the Director (OD) sets overall policy for NIH and coordinates the programs and activities of all NIH components, particularly in areas of research that involve multiple institutes. The institutes and centers (collectively called ICs) focus on particular diseases, areas of human health and development, or aspects of research support. Each IC plans and manages its own research programs in coordination with the Office of the Director. As shown in Table 8 , Congress provides a separate appropriation to 24 of the 27 ICs, to OD, and to a Buildings and Facilities account. (The other three centers, not included in the table, are funded through the NIH Management Fund.)", "Funding for NIH comes primarily from the annual appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies (Labor/HHS), with an additional amount for Superfund-related activities from the appropriations bill for the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies (Interior/Environment). Those two bills provide NIH's discretionary budget authority. In addition, NIH receives mandatory funding of $150 million annually that is provided in the Public Health Service (PHS) Act for a special program on diabetes research, and also receives $8.2 million annually for the National Library of Medicine from a transfer within PHS. Each year from FY2002-FY2011 (but not in FY2012), Congress provided that a portion of NIH's Labor/HHS appropriation be transferred to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. The transfer, in recent years about $300 million, has been part of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. The total funding available for NIH activities, taking account of add-ons and transfers, is the program level. Because the \"NIH program level\" cited in the Administration's FY2012 budget documents does not reflect the Global Fund transfer, Table 8 shows the program level both before and after the transfer. Discussions in this section refer to the program level after the transfer.", "NIH and other HHS agencies and programs that are authorized under the PHS Act are subject to a budget tap called the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. Section 241 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7238j) authorizes the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to assess the effectiveness of federal health programs and to identify ways to improve them. The set-aside has the effect of redistributing appropriated funds for specific purposes among PHS and other HHS agencies. Section 205 of the FY2010 Labor/HHS appropriations act capped the set-aside at 2.5%, instead of the 2.4% maximum that had been in place for several years. The provision was carried forward for FY2011 under P.L. 112-10 . The FY2012 budget proposed to increase the set-aside to 3.2%. NIH, with the largest budget among the PHS agencies, becomes the largest \"donor\" of program evaluation funds, and is a relatively minor recipient. By convention, budget tables such as Table 8 do not subtract the amount of the evaluation tap, or of other taps within HHS, from the agencies' appropriations.", "FY2012 President's Budget Request. Under the FY2012 request, NIH said it would focus on implementing a new translational medicine program as well as emphasize three other broad scientific areas including advanced technologies, comparative effectiveness research, and support for young investigators. For the new program, NIH proposed to create the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) to catalyze the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. To do so, NIH planned to abolish the existing National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) and transfer its programs to various other parts of NIH, including transferring the Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) program to NCATS. The FY2012 request proposed $485 million for CTSA, a program which funds a national consortium of medical research institutions that work together to accelerate treatment development, engage communities in clinical research efforts, and train clinical and translational researchers. NCATS was to also take charge of the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program; the request planned to double support for TRND in FY2012 to $50 million. In FY2011, TRND was funded on an NIH-wide basis. ", "Another proposal for NCATS was that it incorporate the new Cures Acceleration Network (CAN), which was authorized but not funded in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 , P.L. 111-152 , as amended). The purpose of CAN is to support the development of high need cures and facilitate their FDA review. The ACA authorized $500 million for FY2010 and such sums as may be necessary for subsequent fiscal years for CAN. The law also specified that other funds appropriated under the Public Health Service Act may not be allocated to CAN. The NIH request proposed $100 million for CAN in FY2012. If CAN received funding, NIH would determine which medical products are \"high need cures,\" and then make awards to research entities or companies in order to accelerate the development of such high need cures. ", "In addition to the new program, NIH emphasized three scientific areas in its plans for FY2012: ", "1. Technologies to Accelerate Discovery. NIH would continue to support development and application of advanced technologies (such as DNA sequencing, microarray technology, nanotechnology, new imaging modalities, and computational biology) to increase understanding of complex diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and enable development of more effective therapies. 2. Enhancing the Evidence Base for Health Care Decisions. NIH would use comparative effectiveness research methodologies to assist in developing individually tailored treatments (personalized medicine) by testing candidate therapies in a group of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) caring for more than 13 million patients. 3. New Investigators, New Ideas. NIH would emphasize two of its programs that support young scientists. The NIH Director's New Innovator Award program provides first-time independent awards to outstanding investigators; the Administration requested $80 million to support these awards in FY2012. The second program, called the NIH Director's Early Independence Program, supports talented junior scientists, allowing them to by-pass the traditional postdoctoral training period and move directly to an independent research career. NIH requested $8.4 million for this program in FY2012. ", "Research Project Grants. Of the funds appropriated to NIH each year, more than 80% go out to the extramural research community in the form of grants, contracts, and other awards. The funding supports research performed by more than 325,000 scientists and technical personnel who work at more than 3,000 universities, hospitals, medical schools, and other research institutions around the country and abroad. The primary funding mechanism for support of the full range of investigator-initiated research is competitive, peer-reviewed research project grants (RPGs). ", "In the FY2012 request, total funding for RPGs, at $16.9 billion, represented about 53% of NIH's proposed budget. The request would support an estimated 36,852 RPG awards, 248 more grants than in FY2011. Within that total, 9,158 would be competing RPGs, 441 more than in FY2011. (\"Competing\" awards means new grants plus competing renewals of existing grants.) For noncompeting (continuation) RPGs, the FY2012 budget provided an inflation-adjustment increase of 1%.", "Other Funding Mechanisms. The FY2012 request included an increase over FY2011 for research training stipends for individuals supported by the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards program. The budget request would have raised funding for the program by $13 million to $794 million, allowing NIH to support 16,831 full-time training positions, 29 more than in FY2011. Changes were also proposed in the request for other funding mechanisms within the NIH budget. Support for r esearch centers would increase by $42 million (1.4%) to $3.036 billion. R&D contracts were proposed for a $151 million (4.9%) increase to $3.245 billion (excluding the funding proposed for transfer to the Global HIV/AIDS Fund). The NIH intramural research program would have gained $94 million (2.9%) for a total of $3.382 billion. Research management and support had a requested increase of $19 million (1.3%) to a total of $1.538 billion. Operations of the Office of the Director were proposed for a large increase of $118 million (19%) for a total of $742 million. The appropriation for Buildings and Facilities would increase by almost $76 million (152%) to $126 million.", "Also funded through the OD account is the NIH Common Fund, which supports research in emerging areas of scientific opportunity, public health challenges, or knowledge gaps that deserve special emphasis and might benefit from collaboration between two or more institutes or centers. For FY2012, the President requested $557 million for the Common Fund, up $14 million (2.6%) from FY2011. ", "Congressional Action on FY2012 Appropriations. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1599 , its FY2012 Labor/HHS/Education bill, on September 22, 2011 ( S.Rept. 112-84 ). The bill recommended $30.5 billion for NIH, a decrease of $190 million (-0.6%) from the FY2011 level of $30.7 billion and $1,250 million below the request. In addition, the committee released a draft bill for Interior/Environment appropriations that would have provided $80 million for NIH (see Note h on Table 8 ). The committee approved NIH's plan to abolish NCRR and create NCATS, though funding recommended for NCATS and all the other components was lower than requested under the realignment. The NCATS appropriation would have included $20 million for the Cures Acceleration Network and would have maintained level funding for the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. The committee criticized NIH for not providing a formal, timely request for the restructuring proposal. Funding for the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside was maintained at 2.5%. The committee included $299 million in the appropriation for transfer to the Global HIV/AIDS Fund.", "The House Appropriations Committee did not report a Labor/HHS bill for FY2012, but the chairman of the subcommittee introduced H.R. 3070 on September 29, 2011, accompanied by a detailed funding table (see Note c on Table 8 ). The bill would have provided $31.7 billion for NIH, the same level as the request and an increase of $1,160 million (3.8%) over FY2011. In addition, the House committee included $79 million for NIH in its Interior/Environment appropriations bill (see Note h on Table 8 ). H.R. 3070 did not provide for the creation of NCATS or the elimination of NCRR. It would have funded all the existing NIH components at the same level as the request, except that $100 million would have shifted from Office of the Director to NCRR. The Director was told to ensure that at least $488 million be provided for the CTSA program, and that up to $2 million could be used for an advisory board to plan for the Cures Acceleration Network. The bill required support of at least 9,150 new and competing RPGs, maintenance of an allocation ratio of 90% to 10% in support of extramural versus intramural activities, funding for the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside at 2.4%, and would have prohibited any funding of patient-centered outcomes research (comparative effectiveness research). No funding was included for transfer to the Global Fund.", "The final conference agreement enacted in P.L. 112-74 gave NIH $30.690 billion in Labor/HHS funding (Division F) and an additional $79 million in Interior/Environment funding (Division E), for a total of $30.769 billion in discretionary budget authority. Although that amount is only $2 million above the FY2011 level of $30.767 billion, it actually gave NIH $299 million (1.0%) more than in FY2011 to spend on its own programs. The FY2011 appropriations required NIH to transfer $297 million to the Global HIV/AIDS Fund, whereas the FY2012 appropriations did not designate any funds for transfer. Funding for the PHS Evaluation Set-Aside was maintained at 2.5%.", "With the FY2012 appropriations, Congress approved NIH's plan to create NCATS, abolish NCRR, and distribute NCRR's programs to NCATS and other NIH entities. In Table 8 , funding for NCATS and the other realigned programs is displayed for the Senate bill and the enacted FY2012 appropriations, but the columns for FY2011, the FY2012 request, and the House bill display amounts reflecting NIH's original alignment (i.e., they have not been made comparable for the NCATS-related shifts in funding). A table in the explanatory statement accompanying the FY2012 conference report ( H.Rept. 112-331 , pp. 1135-1136) displays the comparable adjustments for FY2011 (which are budget-neutral) and allows comparison with the FY2012 amounts for all the institutes and centers. Analysis of the table indicates that the $299 million increase provided in the FY2012 appropriations was allocated as follows: $76 million boosted the Buildings and Facilities account to $126 million (requested after a large cut in FY2011; $60 million went to two specific increases discussed below (CAN and IDeA); and the $163 million balance was divided proportionally among all the institutes, centers, and the Office of the Director, with each receiving an increase of 0.54%.", "In the explanatory statement accompanying the conference report, the conferees gave detailed instructions on the implementation of certain aspects of NCATS. They stressed that the role of NCATS is to research ways to re-engineer and streamline the process of therapeutics development. NCATS was directed to foster partnerships between extramural researchers, industry, and government entities to speed commercialization of new therapies through a market-based approach. Funding for two NCATS programs was specified in bill language: at least $488 million from all NIH funds for the CTSA program (a $30 million increase) and up to $10 million for the Cures Acceleration Network. The conferees gave NIH instructions to further study the use of the CAN authority and to survey other federal and private sector activities relating to CAN. They also expressed disappointment with the informal way that NIH had requested the NCATS/NCRR reorganization and mentioned concerns that NIH had not properly involved the Scientific Management Review Board in evaluating the merits of the proposal. They pointed out that another reorganization being contemplated by NIH\u2014a possible merger of the institutes concerned with research on drug abuse and alcohol abuse\u2014should draw on lessons learned from the creation of NCATS.", "The conferees also made comments on selected other NIH programs, particularly stressing that NIH ensure support of the extramural research community by funding as many new and competing research project grants as possible at a reasonable award level. Extramural research should be maintained at about 90% of the NIH budget, with basic research retaining its current (unspecified) share. The Institutional Development Awards (IDeA) program was given a $50 million increase (22%), and NIH was encouraged to broaden the eligibility criteria for these research capacity and infrastructure grants.

In fusion energy sciences, the request proposed reducing the U.S. contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) to $105 million (from $135 million in FY2010). Despite a slip of several years in the expected start-up date for ITER, DOE budget documents for FY2012 stated that \"the costs associated with the schedule delays to date ... are manageable within the existing ... [total project] cost range\" of $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion. This statement, however, predated the March 2011 Fukushima earthquake and tsunami, which damaged component test facilities in Japan and may result in additional delays. The House, Senate, and final bills all included significantly less than the Administration's request for basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research, and to a lesser extent, nuclear physics. All three bills provided $20 million for the new energy innovation hub and the requested amount for the existing one. The Senate bill would have provided $65 million less than the request for fusion energy sciences, but the House bill and the final bill both included slightly more than the request. The final appropriation for ITER was \"not more than\" the requested amount.", "The request for DOE national security R&D was $4.175 billion, a 12.3% increase from $3.718 billion in FY2011.

The requests for nuclear weapons R&D and nonproliferation and verification R&D included $168 million and $56 million respectively to fund contractor pension payments resulting from the transition of management contracts at Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. The House bill would have provided $3.725 billion for national security R&D, including $123 million less than the request for the naval reactors program and $76 million less than the request for advancing the science of weapons certification. It included a total of $147 million for the Los Alamos and Livermore pension liabilities. The Senate bill would have provided $54 million less than the request for naval reactors. The Senate report directed DOE not to fund design, preparation, or execution of a \"scaled experiment,\" one element of the Administration's proposal for advanced weapons certification. The final appropriation for naval reactors was between the House and Senate amounts. For contractor pension liabilities, the final bill included a total of $224 million, the same as the request.", "The request for DOE energy R&D was $4.856 billion, up 59.2% from $3.049 billion in FY2011. Most energy efficiency and renewable energy subprograms were to increase by between 50% and 200%, with the exception of R&D on hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, which were to increase by just 2.5%. \"Consistent with the Administration's policy to phase out fossil fuel subsidies,\" the request included no funds for natural gas technologies or unconventional fossil energy technologies. The request for nuclear energy was a 4% increase from FY2011. The request proposed to increase the funding of the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy (ARPA-E) more than threefold, to $650 million (including $100 million in mandatory funding from a proposed Wireless Innovation Fund supported by the proceeds of spectrum auctions). The House bill would have provided $2.731 billion for DOE energy R&D, including $1.570 billion less than the request for energy efficiency and renewables and $25 million more than the request for fossil energy R&D. The Senate bill would have provided $2.755 billion, including $1.245 billion less than the request for efficiency and renewables, $195 million less than the request for fossil energy R&D, and $170 million less than the request for nuclear energy. Both bills would have provided about half the request for electricity delivery and reliability R&D and less than half the request for ARPA-E. The final bill included more than either the House or Senate bill, though still less than the request, for ARPA-E and for energy efficiency and renewables.

Since 2006 federal policymakers have sought to increase support for research in the physical sciences and engineering. To that end, they sought to double aggregate funding for the NSF, NIST laboratories and construction accounts, and the DOE Office of Science (collectively, the \"targeted accounts\"), which many policymakers perceive as key to U.S. innovation and competitiveness. The current status of the doubling path is discussed in detail in this report in the \" Presidential Initiatives \" section.", "Another issue raised in the general debate about funding for NSF focused on the Foundation's ability to effectively manage its grants. This is relevant to R&D policy because much of the Foundation's R&D funding is distributed via the grant process. In a House hearing, NSF's Inspector General Allison C. Lerner testified that\u2014among other issues\u2014the Foundation faced ongoing challenges in ensuring that grant recipients comply with grant terms and conditions. According to Lerner's testimony, the NSF attributes this problem, at least in part, to staffing constraints. Lerner postulated that, \"If the Foundation's budget continues to grow, the resulting increase in awards to monitor will compound this challenge.\" ", "Research and Related Activities (RRA) is the largest account at the NSF. It is also the largest source of R&D grants and funding at the Foundation.

Among other things, P.L. 112-55 allows the NSF to transfer up to $50.0 million from RRA to the Foundation's main construction account and permits the NSF to use RRA funds to reimburse other federal agencies for support of the U.S. Antarctic program. If the NSF exercises this authority, the actual amount available to RRA activities in FY2012 would be reduced. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increasing the RRA account by $91.5 million (1.7%) over the FY2011 Current Plan level. As initially passed by the Senate, H.R. 2112 would have reduced the RRA account by $66.9 million (1.2%) from the FY2012 Current Plan level.", "In addition to the provisions specifically included in the conference report on the bill ( H.Rept. 112-284 ), the report also approves report language included in H.Rept. 112-169 or S.Rept. 112-78 that is not changed by the conference in its report. The conference report on H.R. 2112 (which became P.L. 112-55 ) endorses Administration-proposed reductions to RRA programs in FY2012\u2014except for the proposed changes to the Radio Astronomy program.

Relative to the FY2011, the FY2012 request would have shifted (by 1.2%) the EHR portfolio in the direction of graduate support. This is relevant to R&D policy because (1) graduate students are a significant component of the U.S. R&D workforce, and (2) because graduate student enrollment in science and engineering (S&E) fields appears to be increasing, which may increase demand for the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) and thereby increase caseload pressure on this account.

The ARS also includes the National Agricultural Library, the primary information resource on food, agriculture, and natural resource sciences. The ARS laboratories focus on efficient food and fiber production, development of new products and uses for agricultural commodities, development of effective biocontrols for pest management, and support of USDA regulatory and technical assistance programs. The President requested $1.138 billion for ARS in FY2012, slightly above the FY2011 enacted level. The FY2012 appropriation provides $1.095 billion for the ARS, $38.6 million below the FY2011 enacted level and $43.1 million below the request. The conference report supports the closure of 12 research laboratories at 10 locations and directs ARS to submit a report to the House and Senate Appropriation Committees no later than January 20, 2012, concerning the disposition of these laboratories. Neither the FY2011 continuing resolution nor the FY2012 appropriation provide funding for ARS buildings and facilities.", "In FY2012, funding from discontinued ARS projects will be redirected to agency research priorities including the conversion of agricultural products into biobased products and biofuels; development of production systems to provide a sustainable balance of crop production, carbon soil sequestration, and net greenhouse gas emissions; development of new measures to control bovine tuberculosis and bovine respiratory diseases; domestic and global market opportunities; new varieties and hybrids of feedstocks; and new healthier foods with decreased caloric density. Other areas of support include funding for research on non-traditional agents and their possible use in food, and for epidemiological and ecologic studies. In addition, the FY2012 appropriation includes support for research at Regional Biofuels Feedstocks Research and Demonstration Centers and for research to develop integrated, sustainable management systems to improve food production and security.

In the FY2012 appropriation, NIFA is to support larger and longer-term research efforts on issues related to the viability of agriculture. NIFA is responsible for developing partnerships between the federal and state components of agricultural research, extension, and institutions of higher education. NIFA distributes funds to State Agricultural Experiment Stations, State Cooperative Extension Systems, land-grant universities, and other institutions and organizations that conduct agricultural research, education, and outreach. Included in these partnerships is funding for research at 1862 land-grant institutions, 1890 historically black colleges and universities, 1994 tribal land-grant colleges, and Hispanic-serving institutions. Funding is distributed to the states through competitive awards, statutory formula funding, and special grants. The FY2012 appropriation provides $1.202 billion for NIFA, $12.3 million (-1.0%) below the FY2011 enacted level and approximately equal to the request. Conferees stated that they were not in agreement with the Administration's request concerning the termination of extramural research. Conferees also expressed concern about the focus of research programs supported through the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) and maintained that USDA's support should be directed solely on the highest priority agricultural research as determined by Congress. ", "One of the stated primary goals in the President's FY2012 request was for NIFA to emphasize and prioritize competitive, peer-reviewed allocation of research funding. For this reason, the Administration requested funding for the development of new grant management tools. Funding for FY2012 includes support for grant management, as well as for programs that are more responsive to critical national issues such as agricultural security, local and regional emergencies, zoonotic diseases, climate change, childhood obesity, pest risk management, and development of biofuels that contribute to agricultural productivity and sustainability. The act also provides funding for programs that support minority-serving institutions and their recipients.", "NIFA is responsible for administering the agency's primary competitive research grants program, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative. In addition to supporting fundamental and applied science in agriculture, USDA maintains that the AFRI makes a significant contribution to developing the next generation of agricultural scientists by providing graduate students with opportunities to work on research projects. A focus of these efforts is to provide increased opportunities for minority and under-served communities in agricultural science. The FY2012 appropriation provides $264.5 million for AFRI, approximately equal to its FY2011 enacted level. AFRI funding is to be directed towards alternative and renewable energy research to develop cost-effective feedstocks for biofuel production. Funding also includes support for global climate change research to develop mitigation capabilities for agricultural production; support for an integrated food safety research program that would have the potential for improving the understanding of disease-causing microorganisms; and funding for international food security and nutrition and obesity prevention research. The act supports initiatives in agricultural genomics, emerging issues in food and agricultural security, the ecology and economics of biological invasions, and plant biotechnology. In addition, it is anticipated that water research will extend beyond water quality to include water availability, reuse, and conservation.", "The FY2012 appropriation provides $77.7 million for the Economic Research Service, $8.3 million below the request and $4.1 million below the FY2011 enacted level.

Several actions under the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), also received some attention. Congressional concerns regarding these issues were prominent areas of debate during oversight and deliberation of EPA's S&T funding levels. Some Members expressed concerns related to these actions during hearings and markup of EPA's FY2012 appropriations, and authorizing committees have been addressing EPA regulatory actions through hearings and legislation.", "P.L. 112-74 included several administrative and general provisions affecting EPA actions and authorities.

Because of the differences in the scope of the activities included in these accounts, apt comparisons before and after FY1996 are difficult. Although the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reports historical and projected budget authority (BA) amounts for R&D at EPA (and other federal agencies), OMB documents do not describe how these amounts explicitly relate to the requested and appropriated funding amounts for the many specific EPA program activities. The R&D BA amounts reported by OMB are typically significantly less than amounts appropriated/requested for the S&T account.
