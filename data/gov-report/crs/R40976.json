Thus, this report uses the term \"earmark\" to encompass both a \"congressional earmark\" as used in the House rule and a \"congressionally directed spending item\" as used in the Senate rule. Under both chambers' rules, an earmark is a provision in legislation or report language that meets certain criteria. First, it is included primarily at the request of a Member. Second, it provides, authorizes, or recommends a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority (1) to an entity, or (2) to a specific state, locality, or congressional district.

In some cases, other information also has been included, such as an account within an agency, or the recipient, purpose, or location of the earmark. ", "For FY2008-FY2010, the explanatory statement for the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill states that neither the bill text nor the accompanying explanatory statement contain earmarks as defined in House and Senate rules. Consequently, most of the discussion in this report focuses on the other 11 appropriations bills, for which Congress disclosed earmarks for each fiscal year. ", "This report does not address earmarks disclosed for bills other than the 12 regular, annual appropriations bills for FY2008-FY2010.

For instance, no distinctions are drawn based on the indicated requester. Some of the items identify the requester as one or more Members, others note only the President, while still others indicate the President and Members. Similarly, the counts of earmarks include those items in the disclosure lists for which no funding level was indicated.", "Observers of the budget process frequently focus on earmarks that were originated by Congress. However, earmarking is not solely a congressional activity. Observers also have identified earmarking conducted by the President and others in the executive branch during budget formulation and execution, both at their discretion and through interactions with Congress. There is no source that defines and comprehensively identifies executive branch earmarks. Nevertheless, some of the FY2008-FY2010 congressional disclosure lists identify earmarks as requested solely by the President, or by the President and one or more Members. A discussion of these earmarks disclosed for FY2010 is presented below in the section on \" Congressionally Disclosed Earmarks Requested by the President ,\" and for FY2008-FY2010 in the section on \" Recent Earmark Trends: FY2008 to FY2010 .\"", "The tabulations in this report reflect the value of the earmarks in the disclosure lists, although subsequent actions could have altered them. For instance, rescissions of funds might have reduced the amounts identified as earmarked. Additionally, some of the earmarks may not have been provided to recipients who did not comply with conditions or requirements.

First, a series of tables and graphs depicts data for FY2010, the most recent fiscal year for which data are available for all enacted appropriations bills. Second, another series of tables and graphs compares earmarks for FY2010 with earmarks for prior years back to FY2008, the first year for which Congress published earmark disclosure lists under chamber rules. The tables and graphs contain data on the number and dollar value of the earmarks disclosed for each appropriations bill. They also identify the portion of each bill's total appropriation and non-mandatory funding that was earmarked.
