At the end of the consultation, NMFS issues a biological opinion (BiOp) addressing whether the FCRPS action would jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or damage its critical habitat. If jeopardy is found, NMFS is required to develop reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) to the proposed action in order to avoid jeopardy.", "NMFS can recommend mitigation measures to avoid jeopardy, but protective measures for fish often come at a cost in terms of energy generation or irrigation supply from FCRPS. This tension between natural resources and energy production and irrigation is at the heart of conflict in the Columbia Basin.", "Beginning in 1992, NMFS issued a series of BiOps, nearly every one of which courts have found inconsistent with the ESA. Since 2000, federal courts have rejected all or part of NMFS's four prior BiOps and their supplements. While courts have consistently demanded changes to the BiOps, they also allowed portions of each BiOp to stay in place so that FCRPS operations could continue while the federal agencies attempted to remedy the BiOps.", "Most recently, in May 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon held that NMFS's 2014 supplemental BiOp (2014 Supplement) did not comply with the ESA. The court cited flaws in NMFS's conclusion that protected species could be \"trending toward recovery\" even if the overall population levels remained critically low. The court also called NMFS's habitat improvement data \"too uncertain\" and found that NMFS did not properly analyze the effects of climate change.", "The district court also held that the FCRPS action agencies (the Corps, BPA, and Reclamation) violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement in connection with their proposals for operation of the FCRPS. Although it found the 2014 Supplement to be arbitrary and capricious, the court did not vacate the BiOp.

Many also assert that these populations will be subject to increasing stress from factors related to climate change such as higher water temperatures, changes in ocean conditions, and lower river flows. Actions intended to aid the recovery of these stocks generally fall into one of four categories, known as \"the 4-H's\": habitat, harvest, hatchery, and hydrosystem.

Historically, many parts of the Columbia River watershed have been degraded by logging, mining, farming, and development. Although legitimate economic activities, they have often caused unintended negative consequences for salmon populations. Salmon habitat has been fragmented and degraded by water diversions, obstacles to habitat by structures such as culverts and dams, and loss of vegetation adjacent to rivers and in watersheds. The RPAs specify actions related to upriver habitat where salmon spawn and down-river estuary habitat where salmon transition to their ocean phase. Actions to improve habitat include increasing stream flows, reducing water temperature, removing barriers to habitat, and increasing pools, spawning gravels, and side channel habitats.", "Other habitat actions include efforts to remove the salmon's predators, including California sea lions. Sea lions generally prey on the salmon congregating at the fish passage facilities, although it is suspected that they also consume salmon in other parts of the Lower Columbia River. In 2015, the Corps' monitoring program estimated that sea lions at the Bonneville Dam consumed 10,859 salmonids between January 1 and May 31, 2015, which accounts for 4.3% of the adult salmonid passage. To reduce predation on upstream migrating adult salmon, NMFS authorized Washington, Idaho, and Oregon to lethally take (i.e., kill) California sea lions that gather seasonally below Bonneville Dam. Individuals and animal rights groups challenged the take authorization in multiple lawsuits, but NMFS's latest authorization from 2012 survived the most recent court challenge, which has led to ongoing efforts to capture and euthanize California sea lions.", "Other predators include the pikeminnow, which feed on juvenile salmon and steelhead. BPA sponsors a program that pays for each pikeminnow caught in the Columbia River. For 2016, there is a reward of $5 to $8 per pikeminnow of at least 9 inches and a $500 reward per tagged fish.

Commercial and recreational fisheries in the Columbia River are co-managed by the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, four treaty tribes, and other tribes that traditionally fished these waters. All fisheries are subject to review by NMFS for compliance with the ESA. Generally, managers have attempted to minimize the harvest of wild fish, especially listed populations, through a variety of actions. Harvest actions focus on limiting harvest or harm to listed species by requiring selective fishing gear or timing harvest periods to focus fishing on hatchery stocks. In mark-selective fisheries, the adipose fins are clipped on hatchery juveniles so fishermen can differentiate returning hatchery fish from wild adults.

Hatcheries also may alter the genetic diversity of specific stocks. ", "According to the Hatchery Scientific Review Group, a congressionally funded scientific review panel, hatchery management alone will not lead to the recovery of the endangered salmon and steelhead in the Pacific Northwest, but must be done as part of a broader strategy that incorporates actions affecting habitat, harvest rates, water allocation, and other components of the human environment. According to the NMFS Hatchery Listing Policy, under certain circumstances hatchery fish may be considered when estimating the populations of fish for listing determinations (i.e., when deciding whether an ESU might be threatened or endangered)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Fourth \"H\": Hydrosystems", "paragraphs": ["Finally, hydrosystem actions that promote species recovery have concentrated on improving the survival of juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead as they migrate past dams and through reservoirs. Hydrosystem actions include structural and operational changes at the dams, such as the addition of juvenile bypass systems and surface-oriented passage routes; the collection and transportation of juveniles in barges and trucks past the dams; the installation of structures to guide fish toward safer passage routes; and water releases either to speed travel down the river or provide safer passage past a dam. Although some federal salmon and steelhead protection measures have been in place for nearly 70 years\u2014Bonneville Dam was constructed in 1938 with a fish ladder to allow upstream passage of returning adult salmon \u2014the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) codified a fish protection program to mitigate losses associated with the FCRPS.", "Four options are available to allow downstream migration of fish at a hydropower dam: spill over the dams; pass through the turbines; bypass the dams via a barge or truck; or bypass back into the river. Some actions intended to benefit salmon, such as spilling water to help juveniles pass safely downstream, come at a cost in terms of energy production. Such actions may significantly increase power rates in the region. Additionally, spill can increase juvenile fish mortality due to injury or disorientation caused by gas bubble disease, making fish susceptible to predation. Although gas bubble disease may occur when fish are exposed to gas supersaturation, especially during vulnerable or sensitive life stages, research suggests that harm to migratory juvenile or adult salmonids depends on characteristics of the site or reach adjacent to the dam.", "Often migration can be assisted by \"fish ladders\" that allow the fish to pass upstream around the dams or bypasses that allow juveniles to avoid passing through turbines. However, dams also may change the ecology of rivers including food webs and physical conditions, especially in cases where large reservoirs are created. Although fish may be successful in passing around dams, reservoirs decrease the river's flow and may delay fish movement, expose fish to more predation, and increase water temperature to potentially lethal levels. Reservoirs also may inundate spawning and shoreline areas that were formerly productive spawning and rearing habitat.", "As an alternative to altering dam operations to make them more favorable to salmon, some parties advocate partially or entirely removing four dams on the Lower Snake River in Washington. They believe this is the only way to ensure survival of the Snake River salmon and steelhead populations. Dam removal could also result in economic benefits to various fishing and recreation interests. Proponents of dam removal argue that the four Lower Snake River dams do not produce a significant amount of power and assert that these dams cause significant harm to listed species. They claim that removal of the Snake River dams would reduce federal expenditures and revitalize local economies. Opponents note that dam removal would only benefit four of the 13 listed salmon and steelhead populations in the Columbia Basin, and the federal agencies should focus on all of the basin's listed salmonids. According to BPA, the Lower Snake River dams are an important part of the Northwest's power supply. Additionally, dam removal would preclude downstream barge transport of wheat from Idaho. ", "Dam removal, especially for older dams, may become an economic necessity if dam relicensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires expensive modifications to provide for fish passage. The removal of Condit Dam on the White Salmon River, a Columbia River tributary above Bonneville Dam, began with initial breaching on October 26, 2011, and its complete removal the following year. Removal of Condit dam has reopened habitat above the former dam to steelhead and salmon for the first time in nearly 100 years. Reportedly, Chinook salmon and steelhead have spawned in areas above the removed structure.

This revised approach resulted in a downlisting of certain fish, such as steelhead trout, from endangered to threatened.", "Two suits were filed in two federal district courts challenging the final HLP. A suit in the Western District of Washington addressed the HLP's application to steelhead (the \"steelhead case\"), and a suit in the District of Oregon challenged its effect on salmon (the \"salmon case\"). ", "In the steelhead case, a diverse set of plaintiffs challenged both sides of the hatchery argument: one group argued that hatchery steelhead should be considered distinct from wild steelhead, while another argued that NMFS should make no distinction between places of origin. The district court concluded NMFS erred in downlisting steelhead based on the condition of the entire ESU\u2014both hatchery and wild\u2014rather than focusing on the \"benchmark of naturally self-sustaining populations that is required under the ESA[.]\" ", "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that portion of the district court's ruling and concluded that the final HLP complied with the ESA. The Ninth Circuit gave discretion to NMFS's analysis and concluded that the downlisting was based on \"substantial ... scientific data, and not mere speculation[.]\" ", "In the salmon case, NMFS distinguished between hatchery stocks of salmon and wild or \"natural\" salmon. The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the ESA required hatchery salmon and wild salmon to be treated equally for listing purposes when they are included in the same ESU, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

The authorization was revoked in November 2010, following a Ninth Circuit decision that the permit for lethal removal was contrary to law. The court found that NMFS could not justify killing California sea lions when their take of the salmon was shown to be no larger than that of commercial fishing; NMFS had described the effect of commercial fishing as \"minor\" and \"minimal\" in past statements.", "In May 2011, NMFS authorized states to euthanize up to 85 California sea lions, but withdrew that authorization in July 2011, in response to a lawsuit. Following a second application process, NMFS reissued Letters of Authorization in March 2012 to Washington, Oregon, and Idaho allowing the states to remove up to 92 animals. ", "A group of plaintiffs, including the Humane Society, challenged the 2012 authorization in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia arguing that it did not comply with the Ninth Circuit's decision. On review (and after the case was transferred to the District of Oregon), the Ninth Circuit sided with NMFS in this legal bout, finding that, although the plaintiffs raised \"valid concerns,\" the 2011 authorization was sufficiently grounded in scientific data to explain the need to euthanize.", "With the legal challenge resolved, states have since lethally removed sea lions under the 2012 authorization. Between 2008 and 2015, the Departments of Fish and Wildlife for the states of Oregon and Washington have removed 102 California sea lions. Of those removed, 15 were placed in a zoo or aquarium, 87 were euthanized by lethal injection, and seven died in captivity.", "The 2012 letter of authorization expired on June 30, 2016, and, on January 27, 2016, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho submitted an application for a five-year extension. NMFS agreed that the states' applications showed \"sufficient evidence of the [predation] problem[,]\" and it issued a new letter of authorization on June 30, 2016."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
