The impending expiration of caps imposed by the Balanced Budget Act coincides with when modernization programs can be expected to experience the most growth, but does not necessarily offer sufficient relief to avoid program cuts or other funding approaches.", "To meet its modernization requirements, the Air Force may need to revise that topline, defer or delay other programs (including possibly reducing the quantity of aircraft already in procurement), or find other sources of funding to carry all its plans to fruition. Some specific options may include (but are not limited to)", "raising the Air Force topline (and/or the aviation modernization share); pusharounds or reductions in Air Force programs and activities other than modernization; reducing annual quantities of the F-35A; further retarding the growth of R&D programs; deferring the KC-Y follow-on tanker; funding the long-range strike bomber through a non-Air Force budget.", "The report examines these options in further detail."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["We must modernize the Air Force.

", "In addition, the Air Force continues to procure variants of the C-130 cargo aircraft and a relatively small number of remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPA, as the Air Force refers to unmanned aerial systems).", "Together, these five programs account for $67.2 billion over the FY2016-2020 Future Years Defense Program (FYDP). In FY2016, the four procurement programs (F-35A, KC-46, C-130, and RPA) account for 99% of the Air Force's aircraft acquisition budget; LRS-B is 5% of the Air Force overall research and development (R&D) budget, but 60% of the budget for Advanced Component Development & Prototypes.

The FY2016-2020 FYDP also includes initial funding for", "JSTARS recapitalization, to develop a successor for the E-8 intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, with a projected entry into service of FY2022; a new combat rescue helicopter (CRH) to retrieve downed airmen and other personnel, to succeed the HH-60G; a Presidential Aircraft Replacement (PAR) program to develop and acquire a replacement for two VC-25 aircraft popularly referred to as Air Force One; and a new advanced trainer aircraft, called the T-X, to replace T-38 trainers designed in the 1950s.", "Perhaps notably, no funded plan exists for recapitalizing the E-3 AWACS fleet, based on the same airframe as the KC-135 and E-8. The current plan also includes no funding for the long-expected CVLSP helicopter replacement program. Any such programs would add to the outyear funding issue discussed below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Budget Challenge", "paragraphs": ["The total investment required for these nine programs, combined with the budgetary restrictions in place as a consequence of the Balanced Budget Act of 2013 ( P.L. 113-67 ), or BBA, poses a significant challenge to Air Force budgeters. Because defense budget exhibits project only five years into the future, however, that challenge may not be immediately evident. A more detailed explanation follows.", "As Figure 1 shows, projected program spending for F-35A and KC-46 procurement is substantial and steady, while RPAs add a relatively small share and spending on the C-130 declines over time. (As this report went to press, the Air Force announced a plan to acquire 75 more MQ-9 Reaper RPAs; the cost of that acquisition is not reflected in these figures.)", "The major R&D programs offer a different picture. Spending for the LRS-B, following its recent contract award and entering its engineering and manufacturing development phase, is projected to triple over the course of the FYDP. The newer programs begin with relatively low spending in the current FYDP; the challenge will come if those programs proceed to advanced development and eventually procurement. With F-35A and KC-46 slated to continue for many years (and, in KC-46's case, a successor KC-Y programmed to immediately follow), procurement spending on established programs will continue to be substantial. How will the future Air Force procurement budget accommodate the new programs as well?", "LRS-B complicates the picture further. It is funded (at least through the current FYDP) in the R&D budget, where both the program's size and its increasing budget requirements will place pressure on the newer programs. At some point, LRS-B may shift from R&D to the procurement budget, but that appears to be somewhere beyond FY2020 at the earliest\u2014which is when CRH, PAR, T-X, and JSTARS Recap might also be expected to move from R&D to procurement, exacerbating the rivalry for resources.", "The net effect of starting these new programs atop a full procurement budget is a classic \"bow wave\" of procurement, with increasing numbers of programs with growing budgets all trying to fit within a fixed budget topline at the same time while building requirements for increased future funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why Doesn't It Look Like a Bow Wave?", "paragraphs": ["One might expect the chart of a procurement \"bow wave\" to show expenses increasing in the outyears. Figure 1 and Figure 2 both show an increase in FY2018 and FY2019, then a drop for FY2020. Also, the increases for FY2018 and FY2019 do not appear very large in Figure 1 . If an Air Force modernization bow wave exists, why doesn't it show more vividly on the charts?", "There are three reasons. Two are substantive; one is purely graphical.", "First, because the FYDP includes only six years' data (the year currently executed, the requested year, and the following four years), the effects of the bow wave are difficult to portray, as the highest development and procurement costs of the new starts and LRS-B would take place after FY2020. What is seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2 can be considered the seeds of the challenge, with the full effects coming in the years beyond the chart.", "Second, the Air Force has been managing its current programs to remain under its topline budget cap. This has the effect of flattening all spending, as programs that might otherwise grow are constrained, extended, and/or delayed (\"moved right,\" in budget parlance) to keep the modernization accounts under their caps. It is not unreasonable to hypothesize that absent the caps, the program budgets might show greater growth.", "The purely graphical reason that Figure 1 appears to show virtually flat spending is that the sums for the current procurement programs (F-35A, KC-46, C-130, and RPA) are so large that even significant variations in the smaller programs are visually minimized. By omitting the larger established programs, Figure 2 shows the shape of those newer programs more clearly.", "It may be tempting to say that because the Air Force has been able to fit its current major procurement and R&D programs into its budget, there is no current modernization budget challenge. In response, one could note that some of those programs, like T-X and CRH, have been delayed from when they were initially required, leading to additional costs to keep the older aircraft that would otherwise have been replaced operating past their designed service lives. Those costs come from the operations and maintenance budgets, and are thus not reflected here, but keeping modernization programs under a current cap does result in costs elsewhere in the Air Force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Changes Are Coming?", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the most significant potential change in the Air Force's budgetary landscape is the end of the BBA-mandated budget caps in FY2021. The end of caps does not mean that the Air Force will get more money, but the R&D programs appear all to be timed such that the bulk of their funding requirements will come after the caps end.\u00a0Whether this is a deliberate strategy on the part of the Air Force or a coincidence of timing is unclear, but it appears that the Air Force is gambling that the budget caps will not be extended or replaced.", "Even with the current caps, normal program growth and program changes (like the eventual transfer of LRS-B and other R&D programs from the R&D budget to the procurement budget) will increase the competition for procurement dollars. The F-35A and KC-46 programs will continue for decades, offering little prospective relief. And until its possible transfer, the significant growth of LRS-B within the smaller R&D advanced development budget may seriously challenge the newer programs' development schedules.", "Also, as Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, current Air Force plans result in a surge in modernization spending in FY2018 and FY2019. Recently, the DOD Comptroller stated that \"there'll probably be some slowdowns in some modernization programs\" in the FY2017 budget submission from their projected level to accommodate other Air Force priorities.

Whether the Air Force ultimately receives an increased topline or not, it is possible to move funds from other programs and activities to fund modernization, as the service has already been doing. The different sources of funds impose various costs. For example, reducing operations and maintenance funding to fund modernization can reduce the current readiness of Air Force units. Retiring or reducing older fleets (as the Air Force has proposed to do with the A-10 attack aircraft) may lead to real or perceived capability gaps. Deferring other major programs (like nuclear modernization) may also create real or perceived capability gaps.

The Air Force intends to acquire 60 F-35As per year. Some commentators have proposed reducing the annual buy to 48 per year, which would free up approximately $1 billion per year for other priorities, either within the roughly $15 billion modernization budget or elsewhere in the Air Force. Those figures do not take into account any costs that would be incurred for extending the life of aircraft the F-35A is intended to replace; capability gaps created through the delayed introduction of more modern aircraft; the increased cost of other F-35 models to other services and allies resulting from a reduced annual buy; and/or the resulting match between U.S. capabilities and adversary air and air defense systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retard Program Growth Further", "paragraphs": ["As noted earlier, the Air Force has already deferred some new starts to keep its modernization programs within a constrained topline. Further delaying or restricting the growth of T-X, JSTARS Recap, CRH, and/or PAR could help synchronize outyear program growth so that they are not all peaking at the same time as LRS-B or each other. However, these programs exist because older platforms are becoming increasingly expensive to maintain and operate. Further deferring them would continue those costs while extending systems\u2014often many decades old\u2014with declining capability. This is even more relevant in the case of LRS-B, as the B-52s it is intended to replace are already programmed to remain in service longer than any operational combat aircraft in history.

Depending on the success of KC-46, the condition of the remaining air tanker fleet, and the number of aircraft requiring refueling (which may be determined in part by which other options the Air Force may take), it may be possible to defer KC-Y for some years. However, doing so could create capability gaps, decrease industrial base capability, and increase the costs of eventual KC-Y aircraft.

This was based on two arguments: (1) that the strategic deterrence mission of the SSBN(X) was a national mission, not unique to the Navy, and (2) that funding the procurement of SSBN(X)s outside the Navy's shipbuilding budget would preserve Navy shipbuilding funds for other Navy shipbuilding programs.
