The MOU would support the Navy's goal of deploying a \"Green Strike Group\" by the end of 2012, and \"Great Green Fleet\" by 2016 fueled in part with a 50/50 blend of hydrotreated renewable jet fuel (biofuel). The Navy proposes to use authority under the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) to develop a domestic industrial capacity to supply biofuel. In its FY2013 Congressional Budget Request, the Department of Energy (DOE) requested authority to transfer funds to the DPA Fund, offering the justification that it will support the MOU with the technical expertise to move pilot-scale demonstration projects to larger-scale production in support of the Navy's Green Fleet Goal. Agriculture, Energy, and the Navy expect to fund this initiative at $510 million in aggregate over three years.", "In the past, Congress has found it in the interest of national defense preparedness for government to assure that a domestic industrial capacity exists to produce fuel. Congress set aside the (now depleted) Naval Oil Reserves and Oil Shale Reserves to provide for the Navy's fuel requirements. Congress later promoted alternative fuel from coal through the U.S. Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act of 1944 to aid the execution of World War II, and to conserve and increase national oil resources. The act authorized the Secretary of the Interior to construct, maintain, and operate plants producing synthetic liquid fuel from coal, oil shale, and agricultural and forestry products. During the Korean War, the DPA authorized the President to have liquid fuels processed and refined for government use or resale, and to make improvements to government- or privately-owned facilities engaged in processing and refining liquid fuels when it would aid the national defense. In 1980, Congress amended the DPA to authorize the President's purchase of synthetic fuels for national defense. Most recently, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the Secretaries of the Interior and Defense, to develop a program to accelerate the commercial development of strategic unconventional fuels, including but not limited to oil shale and tar sands resources within the United States. Except for exploiting the Naval Oil Reserve, policies that directed alternative fuel development for national defense interests have had to challenge newly discovered petroleum resources that presented clear economic advantages over alternative fuels.", "Domestic crude oil production in the United States has increased over the past few years, reversing a decline that began in 1986. The United States is now a net exporter of refined petroleum products. Over the next 10 years, continued development of unconventional oil resources, in combination with the ongoing development of offshore resources in the Gulf of Mexico may push domestic crude oil production to a level not seen since 1994, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.", "An important policy question for Congress may be whether a domestic biofuel industry is necessary for national defense, and whether proceeding under the authority of the DPA offers the necessary stimulus. A domestic biofuel industry may satisfy concerns for a secure, domestic, alternative fuel source independent of unstable foreign petroleum suppliers. However, adding biofuel to the military's supply chain does not relieve logistical issues with delivering fuel to forward operating areas, where fuel supply issues have been more about vulnerability than availability."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["During the spring of 2011, the Secretaries of Energy, Agriculture, and the Navy entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to \"assist the development and support of a sustainable commercial biofuels industry.\" The objective is the \"construction or retrofit of multiple domestic commercial or pre-commercial scale advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries.\" The refineries would have the capability to produce advanced biofuels as \"drop-in\" replacements for petroleum-based fuels.

Conventional ships consume diesel fuel marine (DFM or NATO equivalent F-76, also referred to as ship's bunker fuel) which has been used in all shipboard propulsion plants (diesel, gas turbine, and steam boiler) since 1975. Naval aircraft consume primarily JP-5 jet fuel (MIL-DTL-5624 U or NATO code F-44) developed for use in military aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers where the risk of fire is a great concern, particularly in the confined spaces of the hanger deck. The fuel is kerosene-based, and has a relatively higher flash point (140 \"F) than other aviation turbine fuels (commercial Jet A and or military JP-8). JP-5 is also suitable for use as ship turbine fuel.

Hydrotreated refers to the process of cracking vegetable or animal oil through the addition of hydrogen into kerosene-range jet fuel. The process is similar to refining processes for upgrading petroleum.", "Department of Defense (DOD) fuel consumption varies from year to year in response to changes in mission and the tempo of operations. In FY2011, DOD consumed 124.3 million barrels of refined petroleum products domestically, and another 96.6 million barrels overseas. In contrast, the United States consumed slightly more than 6 billion barrels of refined petroleum products during calendar year 2011, of which DOD domestic consumption represented roughly 2%. DOD overseas spending on ships' bunker fuel exceeded domestic spending\u2014$2.7 billion for 7.5 million barrels from 73 ports in 50 countries, versus $239 million for 2.4 million barrels from 67 domestic ports.", "The Defense Logistics Agency\u2013Energy (DLA-E) purchases fuel for all of DOD's services and agencies, both in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside (OCONUS). In practice, DLA-E typically awards fuel contracts based on the lowest cost to the point of delivery, typically for lengths of one year in a one-step process under the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). It internally transfers (sells) the fuel to its DOD customers with a small markup to cover its operational costs. DOD customers in turn pay DLA-E through their annual appropriations for Operation and Maintenance (O&M). The DWCF permits DLA-E to take advantage of price breaks for large quantity purchases, and in most years provide DOD customers a stabilized price for all products during that fiscal year. DOD has the capability to meet contingency fuel needs through the petroleum war-reserve stock that DLA-E maintains at its Defense Fuel Supply Points throughout the United States, as well as abroad. DOD relies on both NATO partners and alliances with regional partners to supply fuel for overseas operations. ", "DLA-E authority to procure fuel extends from authority originally granted to the Navy. Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a77229 (Purchase of Fuel), \"... the Secretary of the Navy may, in any manner he considers proper, buy the kind of fuel that is best adapted to the purpose for which it is to be used.\" Section 7229 superseded 34 U.S.C. \u00a7580 which had been interpreted as authorizing the Armed Services Petroleum Purchasing Agency to negotiate contracts for the purchase of fuel, not only when acting as a procuring activity for the Navy, but also when filling the consolidated fuel requirements of the armed forces. However, DLA-E now relies on the general procurement authority under 10 U.S.C. \u00a72304 (Contract: competition requirement), since this gives DOD the authority to buy almost any kind of supply or service.", "DOD projects that its budget authority and outlay for fuel will decline 3% from the FY2013 base year and remain essentially level through FY2017. For the period FY2008 through FY2010, the Navy consumed about 10.9 million barrels of JP-5 annually. However, over the same FY2008-FY2010 period, Navy fuel spending declined from $4.75 billion to $3.73 billion. In FY2011, DLA-E spent $1.57 billion to purchase 12.6 million barrels of (Navy) JP-5 jet fuel. In 2011, the U.S. government purchases of F-76 military-grade diesel ranged from $2.19 to $2.75 per gallon, and JP-5 jet propellant ranged from $1.55 to $2.87 per gallon. In 2009, DLA awarded small contracts for hydrotreated renewable fuel (HRJ-5 jet fuel) that ranged in price from $66 to $149 per gallon.

In a 1920 naval appropriation bill, Congress gave the Secretary of the Navy the power \"to conserve, develop, use and operate the same in his discretion, directly or by contract, lease, or otherwise, and to use, store, exchange, or sell the oil and gas products thereof, and those from all royalty oil from lands in the naval reserves, for the benefit of the United States.\"", "Petroleum Reserve No. 3 in central Wyoming, the site of the infamous Teapot Dome, embroiled the Navy and Interior Department Secretaries in a 1920s scandal over a noncompetitive lease agreement made with an influential oil company executive. The Teapot Dome scandal ended with the indictment of federal officials involved and, more significantly, transformed federal leasing into a process based on open competitive bids. As the national defense needs changed, Congress opened the oil reserves to private production and eventually sold them.

In 1980, Congress amended Section 305 of the Defense Production Act ( P.L. 96-294 , Energy Security Act) to authorize the President's purchase of synthetic fuels for national defense. President Carter then directed the Secretary of Defense to determine the quantity and quality of synthetic fuel needed to meet national defense needs. Congress further amended the Defense Production Act to offer financial assistance in producing synthetic fuel from coal, oil shale, tar sands, and heavy oils by establishing the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corporation ( P.L. 96-294 , the United States Synthetic Fuels Corporation Act of 1980).

The Navy and the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves Office (NPSRO) started large-scale evaluations of oil shale's suitability for military fuels in the early 1970s, and conducted extensive tests of oil-shale distillates processed into gasoline, JP-4 (a highly volatile military jet fuel reserved for cold weather operations), JP-5 jet fuel, DFM/F-76, and a heavy fuel oil used in military and commercial equipment.", "In the late 1970s, the Air Force became interested in evaluating oil shale's suitability for producing JP-4 jet fuel and awarded contracts to develop technology for producing oil shale-derived JP-4 jet fuel. Air Force research may have demonstrated oil shale's unsuitability for making JP-4. At best, oil shale produces mostly middle-range petroleum distillates suitable for upgrading to kerosene and diesel fuel, while JP-4 is closer to lighter, gasoline-naphtha. The Air Force generally phased out JP-4 in the early 1990s in favor of kerosene-based JP-8.", "By the mid-1980s, the House began considering a bill to abolish the Synthetic Fuels Corporation with the Synthetic Fuels Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1985 ( H.R. 935 ). In the debate of the bill (H.Rept. 99-196), the Energy and Commerce Committee linked abolishing the Corporation to reducing the federal deficit and viewed purchasing oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as a far more cost effective defense against another oil embargo than subsidizing synthetic fuels. Congressional criticism also focused on conflicts of interest among the Corporation board members, high salaries for staff, lack of interest on the part of private industry, and the possibility of huge subsidies going to profitable oil companies. The minority view noted that as late as 1983, the DOD had certified that it needed synthetic fuel to meet national defense needs.

This pursuit ended when Congress enacted the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ), in which Section 526 (Procurement and Acquisition of Alternative Fuels) effectively proscribed any federal effort to purchase alternative or synthetic fuels with lifecycle greenhouse emissions that exceeded emissions of fuels derived from conventional petroleum; a proscription likely to exclude coal-derived and other unconventional resource-derived fuels from facilities that do not capture and sequester carbon emissions.

However, there is presently no operating domestic commercial-scale production facility for an advanced biofuel, although some are under construction. Proponents argue that advanced biofuels are the preferred renewable fuel alternative because advanced biofuel feedstocks might not compete with traditional food crops used for food and feed. However, there may still be competition for resources to cultivate the feedstock (e.g., land and water). Proponents of advanced biofuels argue that it will add to the United States' energy security. However, others assert that economic and technical barriers will prevent advanced biofuels from entering mainstream consumption for some time to come. Furthermore, the use of agricultural land for advanced biofuel production was a key sticking point as EPA considered public comment about this aspect of advanced biofuels production eligibility for the Renewable Fuels Standard. Others question whether the federal government should be involved in advanced biofuel production at all. ", "Some proponents who support advanced biofuels generally question the form that federal involvement should take. For example, some question whether the Navy, using Defense funding, should be the testing ground for advanced biofuels\u2014particularly aviation biofuels\u2014that at present cost significantly more than conventional fuels. Some analysts and government officials counter that argument by reporting that DOD is the single largest consumer of oil in the United States and therefore represents a relatively significant share of total national petroleum use, and that DOD relies \"far too much on sometimes politically unstable foreign sources of fossil fuels.\"", "The advanced biofuel industry appears to be most focused on demonstrating that the technology exists to produce advanced biofuels at commercial scale. Another important consideration for the advanced biofuel industry at this moment is the planning and development of other production factors (e.g., feedstock supply, infrastructure) which will play a role in a stable advanced biofuel market\u2014the ultimate goal for the industry. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biofuel as a National Defense Need", "paragraphs": ["Generally, military/operational fuel supply problems present logistical challenges that may fall under the process of peacetime planning or \"deliberate planning\"\u2014the process of preparing contingency plans for military action. A domestic biofuel industry, fostered through DPA authorities, would appear to address the contingency of a long-term petroleum supply disruption, assuming that North American production and resources have declined precipitously and shifted reliance to imported crude oil. At present, the United States imports 49% of its petroleum, which includes crude oil (roughly 40%) and refined products. Canada provides the United States with 25% of its imports, and could likely increase the amount depending upon the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline.", "However, in the case of short-term disruptions, the United States maintains the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as part of an obligation to the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreement. The SPR's utility in meeting Department of Defense (DOD) needs is limited by volume of jet or diesel fuel a refinery can produce from a barrel of oil. On average, Gulf Coast refineries yield only 6% to 8% kerosene-jet fuel per barrel of oil. That is, a 42-gallon barrel of oil yields at most 3 to 4 gallons of jet fuel when refined. Were it not for motorists, truckers, and airlines purchasing most of the remaining products refined from a barrel of crude oil, the cost of refining jet fuel exclusively for military use would be considerably higher. (This would assume little or no value in upgrading the leftover portion of the barrel). That is, consumers, not taxpayers, effectively subsidize the military jet fuel production.", "The policy question writ large is whether a biofuel industry is necessary for national defense. If the answer is yes, then the Defense Production Act may be the appropriate authority for the Navy to proceed with its MOU. Proponents of a domestic biofuel industry view it as necessary in guaranteeing a fuel supply for the needs of the Navy, presuming that the future availability of both domestic and international petroleum resources are may be uncertain. Projections of North American fossil energy supply would call the proponent's argument into question. Just a few years ago, fears of \"Peak Oil\" production drove policy discussions on U.S. energy security. However, domestic crude oil production has increased over the past few years, reversing a decline that began in 1986. The United States is now a net exporter of refined petroleum products. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that U.S. crude oil production increased from 5.1 million barrels per day in 2007 to 5.5 million barrels per day in 2010. Over the next 10 years, EIA sees continued development of tight oil, in combination with the ongoing development of offshore resources in the Gulf of Mexico, pushing domestic crude oil production in the EIA Reference Case to 6.7 million barrels per day by 2020, a level not seen since 1994. Even with a projected decline after 2020, EIA projects that U.S. crude oil production will remain above 6.1 million barrels per day through 2035. U.S. refineries consumed just over 5.4 billion barrels of crude oil in 2011, or approximately 14.8 million barrels per day.", "Biofuel proponents would also argue that spending U.S. dollars on imported crude oil supports foreign adversaries or props up corrupt regimes. However, out of all the major oil exporting nations, currently the U.S. State Department lists only Iran as a terrorist country, and the United Nations Security Council trade sanctions in place (UNSC Resolution 1929) significantly restricts Iran's oil exports. ", "No matter whether fuels are domestically or foreign sourced, certain logistical challenges arise with delivering or acquiring fuel in overseas operational areas. For example, during U.S. operations in Afghanistan, insurgent forces frequently attacked over-the-road fuel convoys and that caused numerous U.S. and contractor casualties as well as equipment and fuel losses. Despite the fuel convoys' vulnerability, DLA-E generally found fuel sources to be available; though the sources' alliances and loyalties may have been questionable, the transactions may have gained some regional cooperation. Refueling in foreign ports also introduces certain vulnerabilities, as tragically illustrated by the al-Qaeda attack on USS Cole at Aden, Yemen, in October of 2000; the unforeseen consequence of State Department efforts to cultivate U.S.-Yemeni ties. Relying solely on at-sea refueling for fleet units worldwide would also introduce challenges requiring a substantial increase in the number of Military Sealift Command oilers in service. For routine operations, the Navy can expect to keep only about one third of its 14-oiler force at sea at any given moment. The four or five oilers routinely deployed cannot indefinitely sustain a seagoing fleet of three to four carrier battle groups and three to four amphibious readiness groups deployed worldwide, plus a number of naval units steaming independently. Therefore, decisions on whether to refuel Navy ships at sea or in foreign ports depends on both the tactical calculus of committing scarce fleet oilers and the political calculus of \"showing the flag\" by sending fleet units into port. To some extent, then, this offers an opportunity for the exercise of relatively inexpensive diplomatic \"soft power\" by the United States in the form of contracts with local companies for the supply of marine fuel. ", "DOD might argue that it faces financial, operational, as well as strategic risks from its reliance on petroleum-based fuels, as detailed in the CRS Report R42558, Department of Defense Energy Initiatives: Background and Issues for Congress , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]. The financial risks include rising fuel costs over the long term, and increasing price volatility in the short term. Operational risks include the diversion of resources to the task of moving fuel to the battlefield, fuel requirements restraining the mobility U.S. forces and the combat effectiveness of U.S. equipment, and the vulnerability of fuel supply lines to disruption. Strategic challenges include getting fuel to the area of operations, and DOD's role in ensuring the global free flow of oil. The Navy might argue that investing in a domestic biofuels industry would insulate the Navy from the effects of volatile crude oil prices, decrease its reliance on foreign oil exports from politically unstable or hostile regimes, as well as enhance U.S. energy independence and energy security by creating a reliable energy source. In testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations underscored the pressure on readiness accounts from increased fuel prices, adding that ''every $1 increase in the price per barrel of fuel results in approximately $31M of additional cost annually above our budgeted level.''", "The Navy has a lower dependence on petroleum than other services because its aircraft carriers and submarines are nuclear-powered. In FY2010, the Navy met 59% of its overall energy needs from petroleum, 22% from nuclear-powered ships, and 19% from electricity (for shore operations). The Navy nuclear reactor program, an outcome of the Defense Production Act, not only validated nuclear power, but also paved the way for commercial nuclear power and provided the first trained reactor operators. With the exception of the Navy's nuclear power program, policies designed to replace petroleum-based fuels with fuels derived from alternative resources in the past have given way when newly discovered petroleum resources presented clear economic advantages. That risk remains even if the Biofuel MOU is funded.", "Whatever advantages biofuels may convey, the Navy is not without recourse in acquiring them directly by the customary acquisition process, as limited quantity procurements have already demonstrated. At $26 per gallon, the $510 million the Navy seeks to fund the MOU would purchase 467 thousand barrels of HRJ-5. Assuming that private interests successfully developed biofuel plants under DPA funding, they would still have to submit competitive bids on future fuel contracts under current procurement rules.
