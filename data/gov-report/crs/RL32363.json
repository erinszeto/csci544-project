Thirty-five states reported that they haveexercised the option to provide TANF to LPRs present in the United States before August 1996.

There were, however, some exceptions as noted above. The level of immigrantenrollment in assistance programs is affected by the restrictions imposed under the 1996 welfarereform law, by states' choices to extend or deny coverage when given the option and, to somedegree, by individuals' perception of their eligibility status and their election to participate or not. Among the public at large, confusion remains over what classes of noncitizens are eligible for whichprograms, in part because the 1996 welfare law used the phrase \"qualified alien\" -- not a term inimmigration law -- that encompasses a variety of classes of noncitizens who must meet additionalspecified conditions. Moreover, despite narrowly drawn regulations from the former Immigrationand Naturalization Service (now the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Departmentof Homeland Security) on what constitutes \"public charge,\" many believe that receiving publicbenefits may adversely affect a noncitizen's immigration status or potential to sponsor immigrationpetitions for family members.
