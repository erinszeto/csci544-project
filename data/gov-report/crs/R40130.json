Under Medicaid, an individual's enrollment in an employer plan is considered cost-effective if paying the premiums, deductible, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations of the employer plan is less expensive than the state's expected cost of directly providing Medicaid-covered services. To meet the comprehensiveness test under Medicaid, states are required to provide coverage for those Medicaid-covered services that are not included in the private plans. In other words, they must provide \"wrap-around\" benefit coverage. It has proved prohibitive for many employer plans and states to meet all of these requirements. To circumvent these restrictions, most states operating SCHIP or Medicaid premium assistance programs do so under waivers. ", "CHIPRA 2009 would create a new state plan option for providing premium assistance. States would have the option to offer premium assistance for Medicaid and SCHIP-eligible children and/or parents of Medicaid and/or SCHIP-eligible children where the family has access to employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) coverage, if the employer pays at least 40% of the total premium (and meets certain other requirements). Under CHIPRA 2009, a state offering premium assistance could not require SCHIP-eligible individuals to enroll in an employer's plan; individuals eligible for SCHIP and for employment-based coverage could choose to enroll in regular SCHIP rather than the premium assistance program. The premium assistance subsidy would generally be the difference between the worker's out-of-pocket premium that included the child(ren) versus only covering the employee. For employer plans that do not meet SCHIP benefit requirements, a wrap-around would be required. ", "For the child's coverage using premium assistance, no cost-effectiveness test would be required regarding the cost of the private coverage (plus any necessary wrap-around) relative to regular SCHIP coverage. CHIPRA 2009 would establish a separate test for family coverage. If the SCHIP cost of covering the entire family in the employer-sponsored plan is less than regular SCHIP coverage for the eligible individual(s) alone, then the premium assistance subsidy could be used to pay the entire family's share of the premium. In states that offered premium assistance, CHIPRA 2009 would require states and participating employers to do outreach. Finally, states would be permitted to establish an employer-family premium assistance purchasing pool for employers with less than 250 employees who have at least one employee who is a SCHIP-eligible pregnant woman or at least one member of the family is a SCHIP-eligible child. The Senate version states that the new premium assistance provisions under Medicaid, not SCHIP, would apply to children enrolled in a Medicaid-expansion SCHIP program.

Finally, CHIPRA 2009 would expand the scope of penalties for not paying the tobacco-related tax, clarify the statute of limitations, and mandate a study of tobacco smuggling.", "These provisions in the Senate version of H.R. 2 are essentially identical to the House version, with very small increases in tax rates across the tobacco products. However, the Senate version proposes to increase the tax on small cigars to the same level as cigarettes immediately;", "federal cigarette taxes would be increased to $1.0066 per pack; small cigars would have their taxes increased to the same level as cigarettes; large cigars would be subject to a tax of 52.75% of sales price with a maximum of $0.4026 per cigar; chewing tobacco would be increased to approximately $.03 cents per ounce (and $0.5033 per pound); snuff would be increased to $.09 per ounce ($1.51 per pound); pipe tobacco would be increased to $.18 per ounce ($2.8311 per pound); roll-your-own tobacco would be increased to $1.55 per ounce ($24.78 per pound). The definition of roll-your-own tobacco would be expanded to include tobacco that could be used to make cigars. The large increase in roll-your-own tobacco reflects concerns that this tobacco might substitute for cigarettes; cigarette papers taxes would rise from $1.22 per 40, to $3.15; cigarette tubes would rise from $2.44 to $6.30.
