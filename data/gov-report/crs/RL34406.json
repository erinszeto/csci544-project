Let's examine this in the QDR and in the nuclear posture review and then make a decision on where we go with the next generation bomber.

I mean, it's pretty clearly articulated in the 2006 QDR. And that's actually what helped shaped many of your decisions with respect to some of these decisions that you made recently.

He did not cite how much money could be allocated to bolstering these areas. One senior defense official said as much as $140 million could be needed to hold together design teams for a new bomber.", "A July 2009 report on the defense industrial base from the Aerospace Industries Association stated that", "aerospace and defense contractors require substantial financial resources and infrastructure to sustain their unique production and engineering capabilities. One of the most significant factors in assuring that this industry remains viable over the long term will be its ability to retain minimum sustaining technical capabilities in advanced military aircraft design and development....", "While core design teams might survive for a few years between programs without R&D funding, they cannot survive in perpetuity. Interruptions in design and development activity will ultimately have serious consequences\u2014intended or unintended\u2014that will change the composition and technical capabilities and the aerospace and defense workforce itself. While industry can \"work around\" such interruptions with adaptations, such as increased teaming, changing the roles of primes and suppliers and other innovations, the overall corporate business base for the enterprise will be challenged and minimum core capabilities begin to atrophy.", "Reconstituting lost production, design and engineering capabilities could take many years. This has been seen on the few occasions when systems like the B-1 and [the] C-5 [airlift aircraft] endured significant production gaps. The current defense program of record pursued by this and previous administrations of both political parties has already led to the decline of critical capacities in areas such as rotorcraft and long-range bomber design. Industrial capability can often be regenerated but only with considerable time and expenditure. DoD should be conscious of those costs when making strategic posture decisions in order to understand the constraints that those decisions might place on future leaders just as attention is paid to effects on end strength and force structure....", "Because of past program decisions and regardless of the scenario chosen, re-establishment of a long-range strike (LRS) capability will require substantial effort. From an industrial base perspective, the U.S. bomber program has been characterized over the last 40-50 years by an on-again, off-again production pattern that is dramatically different from that of tactical aviation, for example.", "The history of Air Force bomber production over the last several decades is highly instructive in this regard. The B-52 was produced by the hundreds during the 1950s and 1960s. Following that production run, the history of the bomber shows the cancellation of the B-70 in the mid-1960s; a limited FB-111 buy; the start, cancellation and restart of the B-1 program (100 deployed aircraft); and, finally, a very limited production of 21 B-2 stealth bombers, truncated from an original planned buy of 132 in the \"two-bomber\" program of the 1980s. Given that the last B-2 was delivered to the Air Force in the mid-1990s and no follow-on bomber designs have been in production since then, the industrial base is not optimized to provide new capability in long-range strike in a manner it can for other aerospace products.", "Irregular Warfare", "LRS platforms have seen extensive use in irregular warfare, particularly in Afghanistan. While this is the least stressing scenario for the long-range strike force due to generally permissive air environments, emerging concepts of operations take advantage of the weapons flexibility and long loiter times unique to long-range aircraft. Use of LRS in other irregular operations will depend on the target set and the requirement for long-endurance assets with multiple payloads.", "From an industrial perspective, a focus on irregular warfare that did not include renewed LRS design and/or production would result in a loss of U.S. capability to create such systems. Given the higher costs, lower workforce and financial imperatives of doing business today, it is unlikely that a firm would decide to absorb losses for as long as Rockwell did on the B-1B program discussed earlier. Rather, that experience might be a \"lesson learned\" that would encourage companies to cut their losses quickly and dispose of costly assets that are not earning revenue.", "Current/Near-Peer", "This case includes today's use of LRS in irregular warfare and adds the requirements to support a near-peer contingency, particularly the requirement to penetrate sophisticated hostile air defense environments. As high-end air defense systems proliferate, the requirement for stealth, sophisticated electronic warfare capabilities and managing a greater array of weapons increases. This is true wherever such air defense systems exist. Because many sophisticated systems are also mobile, a mission might not require attack within a hostile country to encounter such a system. Near-peer states could deploy them to protect targets in third nations or other disputed territories. Therefore, this scenario would require more sophisticated and modern LRS platforms than those needed for irregular warfare. Design of LRS systems for a near-peer contingency would also be complicated by unique requirements for nuclear capability.", "Because the gap in design and production following the end of the B-2 program has led to considerable reductions in LRS design and development capabilities, industry is ill-prepared to replace these capabilities quickly. The recent decision to delay the long-range strike program beyond a 2018 initial operating capability will have further important industrial base ramifications. The previous program of record assumed development and production timelines of roughly 10-12 years. The deferral of a long-range strike program now risks stretching out development and production timelines even further.", "Power Projection", "The most stressing case for LRS is a power projection scenario with most or all LRS assets based in CONUS. It combines the requirements of the irregular and near-peer cases with a need for significantly greater numbers of aircraft in order to yield the same presence over target areas due to long flight and recovery cycles.", "In all three scenarios the age of most current LRS platforms and the low numbers of newer ones lead to a need for new systems in order to maintain LRS capability over the long term. That is particularly true for power projection due to the increased flight hours that would accrue to aircraft that are in many cases already over 45 years old.", "An industrial base to meet even modest LRS requirements does not now exist. Long-range strike programs require the cultivation and retention of large military airframe design and manufacturing know-how along with the ongoing evolution of other key technologies and disciplines, such as stealth, composite materials and advanced avionics. Additionally, technical issues related to electronic warfare and the integration of weapons strike capabilities must also be addressed.40 Design teams will have to be retained at a minimal level. But beyond any low-level design commitment, once a policy decision is made to eventually \"ramp up\" the program, industry will have to make conscious decisions to expand engineering and production teams as designs progress from concept development to advanced technology development and, ultimately. to system design and demonstration.", "A successful, long-range strike program will require a decade or longer commitment of time, assets and fiscal resources. Less than a handful of aerospace contractors are capable of being prime contractors for such a program. With very few major fixed-wing aircraft programs in development or on the horizon, dedicated corporate capital investments in long-range strike would be difficult, if not impossible, to justify without a clear demonstration of a government-backed policy and program commitment to the program over the long term.", "All of this activity will necessarily occur over a much longer time frame than the five-year case for the B-1B case described above.

Once solely a nuclear deterrent, the Air Force has re-focused the B-1's capabilities through modernizing its current conventional lethality.", "A perfect example of the B-1's potential was realized by adding an Advanced Targeting Pod to the platform's sensor suite. In an exceptional display of acquisition effectiveness, in 2007 the Air Force and our corporate partners responded to AFCENT's highest Urgent Operational Need requirement by energizing a fast-track development and procurement timeline. With the help of supplemental funding, by June 2008 the 34 th Bomb Squadron from Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota was able to deploy a full complement of Sniper-equipped B-1 bombers to support both OEF and OIF operations without a single break in daily combat operations. The program continues in 2009 to outfit the remaining fleet and incorporate laser-guided weapons as well as integrating pod data directly into the avionics system, allowing for direct machine-to-machine transfer of targeting data. As stated by the Combined Force Air Component Commander, \"The Sniper pod on the B-1 Bomber is amazing.\"", "This new capability means the B-1 is even more in demand for current operational taskings. The non-stop overseas contingency operations are taking a toll on the overall fleet. Currently in FY09, the Air Force is addressing five different issues which would have meant potentially grounding aircraft if they were not addressed. As a baseline to many of these sustainment modifications, the Air Force also embarked on its largest cockpit and communications modernization for the B-1 since its inception. Begun in 2005, the B-1 Fully Integrated Data Link (FIDL) program infuses a tactical Link-16 data link and a Joint Range Extension (JRE) Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) data link into an entirely overhauled modern cockpit. This system of modifications removes legacy monochrome displays and incorporates a series of color multifunction displays capable of displaying a wide array of fused data at all crew stations. Although the B-1 FIDL program has suffered several setbacks, through the continued persistence of Air Force and Congressional support the program is now turning the corner and progressing toward completion. This upgrade will not only help protect the B-1 parts from obsolescence, it will evolve an already capable conventional platform into a networked provider of precision firepower.

Aft wing sweep settings - the main combat configuration\u2014are typically used during high subsonic and supersonic flight, enhancing the B-1B's maneuverability in the low- and high-altitude regimes. The B-1B's speed and superior handling characteristics allow it to seamlessly integrate in mixed force packages. These capabilities, when combined with its substantial payload, excellent radar targeting system, long loiter time and survivability, make the B-1B a key element of any joint/composite strike force.

The B-1B's offensive avionics system includes high-resolution synthetic aperture radar, capable of tracking, targeting and engaging moving vehicles as well as self-targeting and terrain-following modes. In addition, an extremely accurate Global Positioning System-aided Inertial Navigation System enable aircrews to autonomously navigate globally, without the aid of ground-based navigation aids as well as engage targets with a high level of precision. The recent addition of Combat Track II radios permit an interim secure beyond line of sight reach back connectivity until Link-16 is integrated on the aircraft. In a time sensitive targeting environment, the aircrew can receive targeting data from the Combined Air Operations Center over CT II, then update mission data in the offensive avionics system to strike emerging targets rapidly and efficiently. This capability was effectively demonstrated during operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.", "The B-1B's self-protection electronic jamming equipment, radar warning receiver (ALQ-161) and expendable countermeasures (chaff and flare) system complements its low-radar cross-section to form an integrated, robust onboard defense system that supports penetration of hostile airspace.

Chaff and flares are employed against radar and infrared threat systems.", "B-1 capabilities are being enhanced through the completion of the Conventional Mission Upgrade Program. This program has already improved lethality by adding the ability to carry up to 30 cluster munitions (CBU-87, -89, -97), a Global Positioning System receiver, an improved weapons interface that allows the carriage of Joint Direct Attack Munitions guided weapons and advanced secure radios (ARC-210). Survivability is enhanced through the addition of the ALE-50 Towed Decoy System which decoys advanced radar guided surface-to-air and air-to-air missile systems.", "The CMUP adds improved avionics computers which allow the employment of additional advanced guided precision and non-precision weapons: 30 Wind-Corrected Munitions Dispensers (CBU-103, -104, -105 WCMD), 12 AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapons or 24 AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile. The B-1 will be able to carry and employ any mix of these weapons (a different type of weapon in each of the three weapons bays). The B-1 will also be the first platform to carry the extended range version of the JASSM. These modifications significantly increase B-1 combat capability.", "Future planned modifications build on this foundation provided by the new avionics computers. Radar sustainability and capability upgrades will provide a more reliable system in addition to an ultra high-resolution capability that may include automatic target recognition features.

A key goal of the roadmap was to set forth a plan for converting the bomber fleet from a nuclear-centric force to a force with more of a conventional mission focus. The newly formed Air Combat Command (ACC) implemented the roadmap by funding upgrades needed to enhance the bomber force's conventional weapons delivery capability, by developing a bomber concept of operations to more effectively incorporate the bomber into conventional operations, and by shifting training away from the nuclear mission and towards missions conducted in a conventional theater air campaign. The 1992 roadmap concluded that a bomber force of 95 B-52Hs, 96 B-1Bs, and 20 B-2s (211 heavy bombers in all) would meet current and future requirements. The roadmap also declared the B-1 as the \"backbone of the conventional bomber force\" and that future bomber investments would focus on B-1 conventional enhancements. ", "1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR)", "DOD's 1993 Bottom-Up Review (BUR) of U.S. defense plans and programs called for a U.S. military force structure that would permit the United States to conduct two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts. The 1993 BUR called for a force of 100 heavy bomber aircraft to conduct the first regional conflict and for an overall bomber force of 184 aircraft. The 1993 BUR echoed the 1992 roadmap's recommendations to upgrade the bomber fleet to enable bombers to carry the latest advanced conventional munitions. Some observers voiced concerns over the reduction in bomber numbers called for in the 1993 BUR. The ACC commander at the time stated that the nation needed about 180 operational bombers to handle two major regional conflicts, plus additional non-operational aircraft for backup inventory, attrition reserves, and flight testing.", "1994 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR)", "The 1994 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) endorsed decision in the 1992 roadmap to reorient the B-1B to a conventional-only role. It called for a force of 66 B-52s and no more than 20 B-2s to support the nuclear mission. If requirements for bombers were set by nuclear missions alone, such a force would permit the B-52 force called for in the 1993 BUR to be reduced by another 28 aircraft. The 1994 NPR acknowledged the B-52's limited survivability in high-threat environments and relegated the aircraft in nuclear operations to a role of delivering standoff-ranged air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs).", "1995 DOD Heavy Bomber Force Study", "The 1995 DOD Heavy Bomber Force Study was a classified study initiated by congressional direction. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, Paul Kaminski, presented an unclassified summary of the study to the National Security subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in May 1995. The study concluded the following:", "the currently planned bomber force of 181 aircraft was sufficient to handle two nearly simultaneous major regional contingencies; procuring additional advanced guided munitions was more cost effective than procuring 20 additional B-2s; the planned bomber force with accurate guided munitions would provide a prudent hedge against threat uncertainties; and planned B-1 conventional upgrades were more cost effective than procuring 20 additional B-2s.", "The study stressed the value of shorter-range tactical aircraft, noting that \"once all the tactical air forces are in place and fully employed\u2014the bomber contribution shrinks to a small portion of the overall aggregate force.\" ", "A 1996 GAO report on bombers took exception to the Heavy Bomber Force Study, along with the 1992 roadmap, the 1993 BUR, and the 1994 NPR, stating that DOD's requirement for 181 bombers was overstated given DOD's other ground-attack capabilities and the unified commanders in chief plans for using bombers. GAO agreed with DOD's desire not to procure additional B-2s, but judged that a reduction or elimination of the B-1 fleet was warranted with minimal risk.", "1997 Quadrennial Defense Review", "DOD's 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) produced no major changes to the recommended bomber fleet. The QDR recommended sustaining the bomber fleet at 187 aircraft, including 71 B-52Hs, 21 B-2s, and 95 B-1Bs. While the QDR acknowledged that additional B-2s would help the United States in the initial phase of a major regional conflict, the QDR judged that it would not be cost-effective to procure additional B-2s in light of other pressing needs. A congressionally mandated independent bomber review, chaired by Brent Scowcroft, was highly critical of the 1997 QDR's decision not to procure additional B-2s. Unlike the 1996 GAO report on bombers, which called for reducing bomber numbers in light of, among other things, the capabilities of tactical aircraft, Scowcroft's review stated that the \"Pentagon's preference for short-range instead of long-range air power raises a puzzling contradiction.\" The Scowcroft study stated that the long-range bomber fleet is well suited to the demands of the new security environment and that long-range air power will be increasing important in coming decades. The Scowcroft study concluded that \"current plans for the long-range air power force were woefully deficient,\" and called for Congress to, at a minimum, fund at least one additional B-2 squadron of nine aircraft.", "1999 USAF White Paper on Long-Range Bombers", "The 1999 USAF White Paper on Long-Range Bombers modified aircraft requirements slightly by increasing the B-52 \"attrition reserve\" by five aircraft to compensate for sustainment issues. The new requirement is 76 B-52s, 93 B-1s, and 21 B-2s, with 130 bombers being \"combat-coded\" for operational taskings. The study presented a replacement aircraft timeline, as requested by Congress the previous year, calling for a new bomber to reach Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by 2037. The study endorsed the Air Force's focus on modifying the current bomber fleet.", "2001 QDR and 2001 Long-Range Strike White Paper", "The 2001 QDR called for a force of 112 \"combat-coded\" bomber aircraft. Following the completion of the 2001 QDR, the Air Force updated its 1999 White Paper on Long-Range Strike. The updated 2001 white paper called for a 34-aircraft reduction in \"combat-coded\" bombers and a total bomber force of 157 aircraft. To arrive at this force structure, the paper stated that 33 B-1s and 17 B-52s would be retired by the end of 2002. Retirements and other alignments would result in an overall fleet of 76 B-52s, 60 B-1s, and 21 B-2s. The 96 \"combat\" aircraft called for in the white paper were 16 less than the 112 \"combat-coded\" aircraft called for in the 2001 QDR. The Air Force stated that savings from retiring B-1s would be invested in remaining B-1s, and that \"it is far more cost-effective to upgrade current bombers than it is to procure new aircraft.\" The white paper stated that prior conclusions about bomber service lives might no longer be valid due to operational and force-structure changes. The white paper noted that B-52s no longer fly regularly at low-level and stated that bomber fleet reductions would provide funding for fleet-wide improvements. The paper stated that these developments might lead some to conclude that requiring a bomber by 2037 was premature.", "2002 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR)", "The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review called for a force 76 B-52s and 21 B-2s for nuclear missions. The study supported Air Force plans at the time for a new bomber in the 2040 time frame, but also stated that \"a need for additional or improved bomber capabilities could, however, move the 'need date' closer to the present.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}}
