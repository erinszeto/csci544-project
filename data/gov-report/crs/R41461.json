The qualifying violent felonies are those specifically enumerated within the section\u2014murder, rape, violent robberies, extortion, among others\u2014as well as unenumerated felonies, that is, any state and federal 10-year felony that involves the fact or risk of physical violence. The qualifying serious drug offenses are those punishable by imprisonment for 10 years or more under state or federal law. The section creates an exemption where defendants can prove that an otherwise qualifying conviction involved neither the fact nor risk of injury.", "Defendants have regularly challenged the constitutionality of the section and whether their felony convictions constitute convictions for qualified offenses. The question of when a felony should be considered an unenumerated serious violent felony has proven perplexing, but recent Supreme Court construction of the term in another context may be illuminating. The Court has said in Johnson, Chambers, and Begay that for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) a violent felony is one that involves the purposeful, aggressive use of force, capable of inflicting physical pain or injury upon another.", "Constitutional challenges have been to no avail, at least thus far. Defendants have argued without success (1) that requiring the defendant to prove to a judge by clear and convincing evidence, the inapplicability of an injury free conviction offends the due process and jury trial principles identified in Apprendi and its progeny; (2) that the section results in the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment; (3) that the mandatory sentencing provision impermissibly intrudes upon the constitutional prerogatives of the federal courts in violation of the separation of powers doctrine; (4) that application of the section results in punishment for prior convictions in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, and in some instances of the constitutional prohibition on ex post facto laws; and (5) that, under some circumstances, application of the section constitutes a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.", "The text of section 3559(c) is appended."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["A defendant convicted of a federal \"serious violent felony\" must be sentenced to life imprisonment under the so-called three strikes law, 18 U.S.C. 3559(c), if he has two prior state or federal violent felony convictions or one such conviction and a serious drug offense conviction.", "In the recently enacted hate crime provisions, Congress instructed the United States Sentencing Commission to report to it on the operation of such mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.

The purpose of the requirement \"is to ensure the defendant is aware before trial that he faces possible sentence enhancement as he assesses his legal options and to afford him a chance to contest allegations of prior convictions.\" As long as that dual purpose is served, however, a want of meticulous compliance or complete accuracy will not preclude enhanced sentencing.

Among the enumerated offenses, arson offenses do not qualify as predicate offenses, if the defendant can establish by clear and convincing evidence that he reasonably believed the offense posed no threat to human life and that it in fact did not. Moreover, neither robbery, attempted robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, nor solicitation to commit robbery qualify, if the defendant can establish by clear and convincing evidence that the offense involved neither the use nor threatened use of a dangerous weapon and that no one suffered serious bodily injury as a consequence of the crime.

", "The question of what constitutes a conviction for an unenumerated \"serious violent felony\" under section 3559(c) seems to have proven as perplexing as what constitutes a \"violent felony\" conviction under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). Recent Supreme Court construction of the term \"violent felony\" in the ACCA may provide clarification for future cases arising under section 3559(c). In Johnson , Chambers , and Begay , the Court has made it clear that the ACCA's reference to violent felonies refers to purposeful, aggressive use of force capable of inflicting physical pain or injury upon another. One circuit, however, has noted that conviction for a \"serious violent felony\" includes a state escape conviction, notwithstanding the holding in Chambers that held in another context that a failure-to-report offense lacked the intentional, aggressive use of force necessary to qualify as a violent felony.

The caveat reflects a pre- Apprendi decision, Alm e ndarez-Torres , in which Court held that the fact of a prior conviction might be treated as a sentencing factor to be determined by the sentencing court without offending the defendant's right to grand jury indictment, or by implication his right to a jury trial and conviction only on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.", "Pointing to the Apprendi caveat or Alm e ndarez-Torres or both, the lower federal appellate courts have rejected the contention that section 3559(c) offends constitutional norms when it authorizes a sentencing court to determine whether a defendant has prior predicate offense convictions sufficient to trigger the section's mandatory minimum provisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Injury Exception", "paragraphs": ["Almendarez-Torres does not speak to the validity of assigning sentencing courts the task of determining whether a defendant has shown by clear and convincing evidence that his robbery or arson convictions involved offenses free of physical injury or free of the involvement of dangerous weapons.

The Supreme Court precedents provide some limited support, but are not as helpful as they might be. In Solem , the Court held that the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole under a state recidivist statute constituted a cruel and unusual punishment when based on three relatively minor property offenses. In Graham , it held that imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole constituted a cruel and unusual punishment when imposed upon a child for a nonhomicide offense. Yet in between the two, in Harmelin and Ewing a divided Court found no Eighth Amendment impediment to imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a serious drug offense or to imposition of a lengthy prison term under a state three strike statute following serious property offense convictions.
