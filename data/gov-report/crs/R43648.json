Although such allocations are in part the result of the prior appropriation doctrine in western water law and are consistent with the expectation of a \"junior\" water user in times of drought, tensions over water delivery reliability have been exacerbated by reductions in deliveries even in non-drought years. Such reductions are significant because much of the California urban and agricultural economy operates under junior water rights, and reductions in water allocations can cause significant disruption and economic losses, particularly in drought years. At the same time, fish populations throughout the Central Valley have dramatically declined due to water diversions and other factors, and this has been accompanied by significant losses for fishing communities and others dependent on fish and wildlife resources. The state and federal governments have been working to address water supply reliability and ecosystem issues through the Bay-Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP); however, the plan is not complete and remains controversial.", "On February 5, 2014, the House enacted H.R. 3964, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act. It is similar to a bill in the 112th Congress that also passed the House (H.R. 1837, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Reliability Act). The bill would, among many other things, amend the Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992 (CVPIA) to potentially reduce some water allocations for fish and wildlife and redirect them to other purposes (i.e., agricultural and municipal and industrial uses). It would preempt \"any\" (including state and federal) law pertaining to operation of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP) and California's State Water Project (SWP). It would also substitute for those laws operational principles from a 1994 interim agreement, known as the Bay-Delta Accord, which some believe would provide more reliable water supplies for federal and state water contractors. It would also repeal certain components of a 2010 law authorizing a settlement agreement for the San Joaquin River, and would make numerous other changes.", "Proponents of H.R. 3964 argue that implementation of the CVPIA and the San Joaquin River Settlement, coupled with state and federal environmental laws (e.g., the federal Endangered Species Act, its state equivalent, and state regulations implementing the federal Clean Water Act), have compounded the impact of drought on water deliveries. Opponents argue that the bill would harm the environment and resource-dependent local economies, particularly coastal communities. Some also argue that it would undermine efforts to resolve environmental and water supply reliability issues through development of the BDCP.", "Issues for Congress include the extent to which the bill changes decades of federal and state law, including state and federal environmental laws, and at what benefit and cost. For example, there are tradeoffs embedded in the bill's preemption of state water law, including fish and wildlife protections, as a means to increase the water deliveries to some irrigation contractors and municipalities. These changes might benefit water contractors in some areas, but potentially reduce environmental protections and improvements and the industries they support (e.g., recreational and fishing industries) in others. Congress may also consider the potential extent to which the bill would relieve water supply shortages, particularly in drought years. While much attention has been paid to the effects of federal and state environmental laws on reductions in water supplies south of the Bay-Delta, many factors affect pumping restrictions and the overall water allocation regime for CVP contractors. How H.R. 3964 would in practice affect these factors is uncertain."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["This report provides summary and analysis of H.R. 3964 , the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act, as passed by the House of Representatives on February 5, 2014.

Each title addresses a different aspect of California water policy. ", "Title I , Central Valley Project Water Reliability. Overall, Title I would make numerous changes to management and operation of the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), primarily by amending the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Among other things, it would alter CVPIA in the following ways: broaden the purposes for which water previously dedicated to fish and wildlife can be used (by removing the directive to modify CVP operations to protect fish and wildlife with dedicated fish flows and making this action optional); add to the purposes a provision \"to ensure\" water dedicated to fish and wildlife purposes is replaced and provided to CVP contactors by the end of 2018 at the lowest \"reasonably achievable\" cost; changing the definitions of fish covered by the act; broaden purposes for which Central Valley Project Restoration Fund (CVPRF) monies can be used; reduce revenues into the CVPRF; mandate that the CVP be operated under a1994 interim agreement, the Bay-Delta Accord; and mandate development and implementation of a plan to increase CVP water yield by October 1, 2018. Title II , San Joaquin River Restoration. Title II would direct the Secretary to cease implementation of the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Agreement, which was agreed to in 2006 and authorized under the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (SJRRS) in 2010. It would declare that the new legislation satisfies all obligations of the Secretary and others to keep in good condition any fish below Friant Dam, including obligations under the California Fish and Game Code, the state public trust doctrine, and the federal ESA. It would also remove the salmon restoration requirement in the SJRRS that was authorized in P.L. 111-11 . Title III , Repayment Contracts and Acceleration of Repayment of Construction Costs . This title would direct the Secretary of the Interior, upon request from water contractors, to convert utility-type water service contracts to repayment contracts, and then allow accelerated repayment of those outstanding repayment obligations. Irrigation repayment obligations for the CVP for 2012, the last year for which such data are readily available, total approximately $1.18 billion; municipal & industrial (M&I) repayment obligations for 2012, the last year for which such data are readily available, total approximately $121 million. Allowing this accelerated (or early) repayment would allow irrigators to be exempt from certain Reclamation requirements sooner than under current repayment schedules. Title IV , Bay-Delta Watershed Water Rights Preservation and Protection . Title IV would provide assurances of water rights protections for those with water rights senior to the CVP, including Sacramento River Valley Settlement Contractors. It would also direct a new shortage policy for certain north-of-Delta CVP water service contracts, which would aim to limit maximum reductions to these supplies. Title V , Miscellaneous . Title V declares that the unique circumstances of coordinated operations of the CVP and California State Water Project (SWP) \"require assertion of Federal supremacy to protect existing water rights throughout the system\" and that as such shall not set precedent in any other state. Title V also declares that nothing in the act shall \"affect in any way\" the State of California Proclamation of State Emergency and associated executive order issued by the Governor on January 14, 2014.

The act set protection, restoration, and enhancement of fish and wildlife on par with other project purposes (such as delivering water to irrigation and M&I contractors), dedicated a certain amount of water for fish and wildlife purposes (e.g., 800,000 acre-feet of Sec. 3406(b)(2) water and certain levels for valley refuges), established fish restoration goals, and established a restoration fund (Central Valley Project Restoration Fund) to pay for fish and wildlife restoration, enhancement, and mitigation projects and programs. It also made contracting changes and operational changes. The CVPIA was quite controversial when enacted and has remained so, particularly for junior water users whose water allocations were ultimately limited due to implementation of the act and other subsequent factors, such as revised biological opinions protecting certain threatened and endangered species.

The 1956 act provides for contracts to have a provision allowing conversion of water service contracts (9(e) contracts) to repayment contracts (9(d) contracts), and provides that contractors who have repaid obligations shall have a \"first right\" to a stated share of project water for irrigation \"(to which the rights of the holders of any other type of irrigation water contract shall be subordinate) ... and a permanent right to such share or quantity ... \", subject to state water rights laws and provided \"[T]hat the right to the use of water acquired under the provisions of this Act shall be appurtenant to the land irrigated and beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure, and the limit of the right.\" This would give water service contractors long-term certainty over water supplies from the CVP. Finally, this section would also direct that all projects include a provision that parties are charged only for water actually delivered.

These mitigation requirements are sometimes employed for transfers that have been determined to affect third parties. This section would also add a new subsection to Section 3405 of CVPIA, which would allow for transfers that could have been made before enactment of CVPIA to go forward without being subject to the requirements of that act's requirements for water transfers. Section 104 would also add language that specifies that water use related to the CVP must only be measured by contracting district facilities up to the point where surface water is commingled with other water supplies.

Section 105 would further direct that any such flows shall be provided from the 800,000 acre feet of water for fish and wildlife purposes under Section 3406(b)(2) of the CVPIA (also known as \"(b)(2) water\").

Currently under CVPIA, the Secretary is allowed to reduce (b)(2) deliveries by up to 25% when agricultural deliveries of CVP water are reduced.

Specifically, Section 114 would direct the Commissioner of Reclamation, along with Oakdale and South San Joaquin Irrigation Districts, to develop and implement a pilot program to remove non-native striped bass, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, black bass, and other non-native predator fish from the Stanislaus River.

The inclusion of these fish could lessen some ESA restrictions compared to current levels. Section 110 would expand the CVP service area to cover a portion of Kettleman City. The Secretary is directed to enter into a long-term contract with the Kettleman City Community Services District for up to 900 acre-feet of CVP water; however, similar to other areas, actual deliveries would depend on annual allocations by Reclamation.

This tradeoff may also be applicable to some of the more controversial sections of the bill, such as directing renewal of existing contracts (Section 103), which could be viewed on one hand as an attempt to circumvent future NEPA review, but on the other hand as a way to guarantee supplies of water and streamline the regulatory process.

Since the Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River became fully operational in the late 1940s, much of the river's water has been diverted for agricultural uses. As a result, approximately 60 miles of the river became dry in most years, making it impossible to support Chinook salmon populations upstream of the Merced River confluence. In 1988, a coalition of environmental, conservation, and fishing groups advocating for river restoration to support Chinook salmon recovery sued the Bureau of Reclamation. A U.S. District Court judge subsequently ruled that operation of Friant Dam was violating state law because of its destruction of downstream fisheries. Faced with mounting legal fees, considerable uncertainty, and the possibility of dramatic cuts to water diversions, the parties agreed to negotiate a settlement instead of proceeding to trial on a remedy regarding the court's ruling.", "A settlement agreement was reached in the fall of 2006.

The quantity of water used for restoration flows and the quantity by which water deliveries would be reduced are related. However, the relationship would not necessarily be one-for-one due to flood flows in some years and other factors that affect water flows. Under the Settlement Agreement, no water would be released for restoration purposes in the driest of years; thus, the Settlement Agreement would not reduce deliveries to Friant contractors in those years. Additionally, in some years, the restoration flows released in late winter and early spring may free up space for additional runoff in Millerton Lake, potentially minimizing reductions in deliveries later in the year\u2014assuming Millerton Lake storage is replenished. Consequently, how deliveries to Friant water contractors might be reduced in any given year depends on many factors.", "Regardless of the specifics of how much water might be released for fisheries restoration versus water diverted for off-stream purposes (such as irrigation), there will be impacts to existing surface and groundwater supplies in and around the Friant Division Service Area.

Section 201 of H.R. 3964 would repeal the San Joaquin River Restoration and direct the Secretary of the Interior to \"cease any action\" to implement the stipulated Settlement Agreement on San Joaquin River Restoration. Section 202 would amend the \"Purpose\" section of P.L. 111-11 to change the purpose of that act from \"implementation of the Settlement\" to \"restoration of the San Joaquin River.\" Section 203 makes alterations to the definitions in P.L. 111-11 , including adding new terms for 'Restoration Flows,' 'Water Year' and 'Critical Water Year' that are referenced in other sections (see below). It also strikes most of the other terms originally defined in P.L. 111-11 ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restoration Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Section 204 of Title II would make a number of significant changes to the restoration settlement authorized under Section 10004 of P.L. 111-11 . Among other things, it would remove several provisions from P.L. 111-11 that authorize physical restoration of the San Joaquin River such as channel and structural improvements. It also employs the new definition for \"Restoration Flows\" provided in Section 203. Pursuant to the new definition, the additional water released or bypassed from Friant Dam must not result in a target flow entering the Mendota Pool below 50 cubic feet/second (cfs), except in a Critical Water Year (also defined in Section 203). This approach contrasts with the Settlement, which calculates Restoration Flows based on a water year type.", "Section 204 would also direct the Secretary to develop and implement within one year a \"reasonable plan\" to fully recirculate, recapture, reuse, exchange, or transfer all restoration flows (defined as a target of 50 cfs entering Mendota Pool, 62 miles below Friant Dam). It would also provide such flows to contractors within the units of the CVP that relinquished such restoration flows. This would allow for restoration water supplies to be replenished for users, thus potentially increasing their water supplies. However, it is unclear where this replenished water would come from and how it would be distributed to users. It would also direct the Secretary to identify impacts associated with implementation of modified restoration flows and create and implement mitigation actions to address those impacts before restoration flows begin. It is not clear how impacts would be defined, nor how they would be addressed by this section. ", "Finally, Section 204 would also preempt and supersede state law from providing more restrictive requirements than what is contained in the bill. It includes a qualified preemption of Section 8 of the Reclamation Act of 1902 (which establishes deference to state law, as long as state law is not inconsistent with the act's purposes) and specifically \"preempts and supersedes any State law, regulation, or requirement that imposes more restrictive requirements or regulations on the activities authorized under this part.\" It does, however, make an exception for certain state water quality rules. Section 207 of the bill would provide that certain obligations under California state law and the federal ESA as they pertain to fish below Friant Dam are satisfied by carrying out P.L. 111-11 . This provision refers to the basis of the Stipulated Settlement Agreement, in that a federal court had found that Reclamation was in violation of state law by not protecting and keeping in good condition fish below Friant Dam. This language would deem those state obligations, as well as those under the federal ESA, to be met.", "Several other provisions would make significant changes to the implementation of the SJRRSA. Examples of these changes include:", "Section 208 would amend Section 10008(a) of the P.L. 111-11 to provide protections to third parties and allow CVP contactors to bring action against the Secretary for injunctive relief or damages, or both, for failure to comply with the new requirements of Section 10004(a)(3) of P.L. 111-11 . In addition to creating a mechanism to mitigate impacts, this section would also set up a process for filing claims for damages. Both provisions would provide support to water users affected by a reduction in flows. Section 209 would significantly alter the authorization of appropriations under Section 10009 of P.L. 111-11 , including repealing the authorization of $250 million in discretionary appropriations for implementation of the settlement. It would also remove other directions and references to repealed sections of P.L. 111-11 . Section 210 would make limited changes to Section 100010 of P.L. 111-11 , which pertain to repayment contracts and accelerated repayment. It would remove references to the settlement and conform references to changes made under Sections 203 and 204 of H.R. 3964 pertaining to the new definition for \"restoration flows.\" Section 211 would repeal in its entirety Section 10011 of P.L. 111-11 , which addresses implementation issues associated with the re-introduction of Central Valley spring run Chinook salmon. Under that section, Congress had previously provided specific instructions in regards to congressional intent for the introduction of these fish under the Endangered Species Act. Section 212 would alter the authority provided in P.L. 111-11 for the Secretary to provide financial assistance for certain water supply projects related to San Joaquin River restoration. The authority would be amended as to reference the newly defined restoration flows defined under Section 203. Section 213 would repeal P.L. 111-11 's authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to provide financial assistance to the California Water Institute for a study to conduct a study regarding the coordination and integration of sub-regional integrated regional water management plans into a unified Integrated Regional Water Management Plan.

Typical \"repayment contracts\" were made for terms of 40 or 50 years, with capital costs amortized over the long-term period and repaid in annual installments (without interest for irrigation investments and with interest for M&I investments). According to one account, because the CVP is a \"financially integrated\" system, a different type of contract was used, known as a \"water service contract.\" Under water service contracts, contractors pay a combined capital repayment and operations and maintenance (O&M) charge for each acre-foot of water actually delivered. This water service payment is different from repayment contracts, in that under repayment contracts the annual repayment bill is due regardless of how much water is used in a given year. Repayment contracts tend to be the norm outside of California; however, some other projects do have some water service contracts. Water service contracts in the CVP were also typically written for 40-year terms. However, in 1992, with the passage of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA, Title 34 of P.L. 102-575 ), contract terms were reduced to a maximum of 25 years.", "Another early tenet of reclamation law still in existence is a limit on how much land one can irrigate with water provided from federal reclamation projects. The idea behind the limitation was to prevent speculation and monopolies in western land holdings and to promote development and expansion of the American West through establishment of family farms. Over the ensuing decades, several attempts were made to increase the acreage limitation, and in 1982, pursuant to the Reclamation Reform Act (RRA, P.L. 97-293 ), the original acreage limitation of 160 acres was raised to 960 acres. Scholars and others have written extensively on enforcement issues resulting from the 960-acre limit. It has remained, on one hand, an unpopular provision among large landholders who do not want limits on their land, particularly in the Central Valley where large industrial farms are more common than other areas of the West. On the other hand, it is a key rallying point for taxpayer groups, environmentalists, and others who have opposed using federally subsidized water to irrigate large swaths of land. Under current law, once a repayment contract is paid out, the contractor no longer is subject to the 960-acre limit or other provisions of RRA (e.g., full-cost pricing for water).

Section 301 would authorize and direct the Secretary, upon request, to convert any agricultural water service contracts (known as 9(e) contracts) to repayment contracts (known as 9(d) contracts), as well as M&I water service contracts to repayment contracts. It would direct that under such conversions, the Secretary would require repayment either in lump sum or accelerated prepayment of a contractor's remaining construction costs, thus accelerating the process and advantages associated with full project repayment. It would also authorize the Secretary to similarly convert contracts for municipal water. The section would reiterate current law regarding the elimination of an obligation to pay full-cost pricing rates or abide by the acreage (ownership) limitations of Reclamation law once the repayment obligation is met. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["It is not clear how many contractors within the CVP might take advantage of these provisions and opt to prepay or accelerate their payments. Current CVP contract rates are based on a target repayment date of 2030; however, because the project is technically not complete, adjustments are made annually to capital cost obligations. Current CVP rate books (updated in 2012) show outstanding repayment obligations of approximately $1.15 billion for irrigation contracts and $147 million for M&I contracts. Presumably, districts interested in prepaying or accelerating repayment would need to obtain a loan or issue a bond to raise capital to make the payment, unless they have cash or other relatively liquid assets on hand. Because the federal repayment amount in agricultural contracts is akin to a no-interest loan for irrigation contracts, a district would have to weigh the financial costs of new financing with the operating and opportunity costs of continuing to remain under reclamation ownership and full-cost pricing rules. The added permanency of the water contract provided for under proposed Title I of this bill (i.e., directed renewal of 40 years, upon request, and potentially without NEPA review), might make such prepayment more attractive. On the other hand, if under Title I a water service contractor could also enjoy such benefits anyway (due to the renewal language and administration under the 43 U.S.C. 485h-1 ), it is not clear that the added benefits of being able to use Bureau of Reclamation water on more land and elimination of other requirements would outweigh the financial and administrative costs of new financing. One other incentive to prepay is the reporting requirements required for landowners.

They entered into Sacramento River Settlement Contracts with Reclamation, which guarantee these contractors a certain amount of \"base supply water\" (some users also contract out for \"project water\"). \"Exchange Contractors\" are the other primary class of senior water rights holders. This refers to water users (south of the Delta) who diverted water from the San Joaquin River prior to construction of Friant Dam. These users exchanged their direct diversion of river water for water delivered from the Delta via the CVP Delta-Mendota canal.

Section 402 would provide that in implementing the ESA, water supply reductions for Sacramento Valley Settlement Contractors must adhere to water rights priorities as stipulated in those contacts. Section 403 would place new limits on water supply reductions for Sacramento River watershed water service contractors, subject to the seniority provided to Settlement Contractors under Section 402. These limits on reductions would be similar to those provided to senior water contractors and wildlife refuges. For example, under this section, the Secretary of the Interior in operation of the CVP would have to deliver not less than 75% of Sacramento River watershed water service contractors' contracted water supply in a \"dry\" year (no such protection would be provided for water service contractors outside of this area). Currently, these water service contractors have no minimum guarantee of water deliveries in dry years. The section also provides protections for M&I water contractors. Section 404 would direct the Secretary to ensure \"that there are no redirected adverse water supply or fiscal impacts to those within the Sacramento River watershed or to the State Water Project arising from the Secretary's operation of the [CVP]\" to meet legal obligations imposed by or through a state or federal agency, including but not limited to the ESA or H.R. 3964 , or actions or activities implemented to meet \"the twin goals of improving water supply or addressing environmental needs of the Bay Delta.\" The latter clause appears to be a reference to ongoing state and federal efforts to develop a Bay-Delta Conservation Plan [BDCP] and the state's implementation of a Delta action plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["While Title IV would protect northern and other senior water rights holders (senior to those rights or permits belonging to the CVP), it does not appear to provide the same level of protection to water users in the Delta or others whose water rights may be more junior to the CVP, but perhaps senior to others.

Further, the bill would not limit the authority provided by the Proclamation to allow the SWRCB to modify and standards or operational constraints adopted to implement the Bay-Delta Accord so as to make additional water supplies available to service areas during a state of emergency. Under the Emergency Order, the Governor authorizes the SWRCB to expedite and streamline water transfers, expedite funding for water supply projects and water conservation projects, notify water right holders that they might be directed to cease or reduce diversions based on water shortages, modify requirements as they relate to reservoir releases and to implementing a water quality control plan, among other things. Section 503 includes language that would adjust a Wild and Scenic River boundary for the Merced River, potentially allowing for increased storage at Exchequer Dam.

The bill would also alter the way the state of California implements its own state laws with regard to operation of the CVP and SWP and non-native fisheries. ", "H.R. 3964 is primarily aimed at addressing decreased water deliveries to California's CVP and SWP contractors, particularly those south of the Delta, since passage of the CVPIA in 1992. The bill would allow water to be delivered to contractors that would likely become available due to changes in restrictions in environmental and other laws. It would result in greater water deliveries by preempting federal and state law, including fish-and-wildlife protections and other CVP operational mandates, which are all tied to the coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP. It is unclear what impacts such changes would have on other water users in the state. Title IV of the bill attempts to provide protections for California's senior water right holders, particularly those in the Sacramento Valley watershed and in \"area-of-origin\" areas. A key remaining unknown consequence is the significance of the bill's use of the fixed 1994 Bay-Delta Accord as a basis rather than current (and evolving) in-Delta water quality standards and biological opinions under the federal ESA. The current water quality standards impose water flow restrictions and appear to be a contributing factor to annual pumping restrictions in the Delta, along with ESA requirements.", "The exact amount of water the bill would make available to certain users under various scenarios is unclear. While much attention has been paid to the effects of federal and state environmental laws on reductions in water supplies south of the Delta, the extent to which the bill would relieve current and ongoing water supply shortages, particularly in drought years, is uncertain. Limited increases in deliveries for water contractors may be garnered from a prohibition or alteration of some state and federal environmental restrictions (including the State's Public Trust Doctrine and other laws proposed under the bill. However, the legislation does not appear to fundamentally change some of the other factors driving water shortages and delivery curtailments in the Delta, including the fundamental tenet of state water rights during times of shortage. Indeed, under some drought scenarios junior water rights holders may face curtailed water deliveries (i.e., regardless of environmental restrictions), while senior water rights holders continue to receive water. Additionally, another significant factor in recent pumping restrictions in the Delta is the state water quality control plan, which includes salinity and flow requirements under California State Water Resources Control Board Decision 1641 (also known as \"D-1641\"). This decision in some cases dictates the timing and quantity of water deliveries south of the Delta. It is unclear the extent to which water quality standards that would be required under the Bay-Delta Accord would correlate with the current requirements under D-1641. Such correlation (or lack thereof) could have a potentially significant effect on the extent of water exports in a given year. ", "Longer term consequences of the legislation may also be of interest to Congress. Unlike some other proposals, H.R. 3964's provisions would be in effect beyond the current drought, and would continue in perpetuity absent future changes to the statute. Effects of the legislation on other ongoing plans, such as the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP), are unknown but could be significant. Some have argued that if ESA and state protections in the Bay-Delta are removed as proposed, there would be less need for the BDCP, a habitat conservation plan. The precedent of legislation may be of interest, as well. Among other things, the waiver of ESA and state laws in order to provide increased water deliveries for federal project contractors would be a significant departure from the previous deference to these laws. ", "H.R. 3964 goes to the heart of the water supply issue in California by proposing to prohibit \"any\" state or federal law (including the public trust doctrine) from reducing water supplies beyond those allowed in the Bay-Delta Accord. It would also declare federal supremacy over water management to \"protect existing water rights throughout the system.\" However, some argue that the bill would undermine efforts to achieve the \"co-equal\" goals of \"providing for a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Bay-Delta ecosystem,\" which is the foundation of state and federal efforts in development of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. Therefore the overall approach of the legislation, as well the extent to which it would alter the existing water management regime in California, may elicit ongoing debate."], "subsections": []}]}}
