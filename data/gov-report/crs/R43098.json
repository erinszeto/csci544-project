In addition, sound financial management of these transactions is necessary to ensure that transactions are not double-counted by the agencies involved in the transactions, and that each account accurately reflects the amount of available budget authority. Failure to properly record transfers or reprogramming transactions could lead to under- or over-estimating the amount of budgetary resources available, miscalculations in budgetary planning, and overspending at either the account or the PPA level. This, in turn, may pose challenges for congressional oversight of budget execution and agency operations.
