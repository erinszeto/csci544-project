At any rate, any proposals that involve new budgetary outlays could be challenged as adding to an already large federal deficit, and/or burdening consumers with higher costs.

In November 2007, the all-milk price hit a record $21.90 per hundredweight (cwt.). In 2008, milk prices remained high, but feed prices rose rapidly, creating concern for dairy farmers. The financial danger was a further escalation of feed prices or a price reversal in dairy product prices. Product prices have, in fact, dropped. Feed costs have declined some, but not enough to offset the drop in milk prices.

The ratio averaged 2.01 in 2008, the lowest since at least 1985 and down from 2.81 in 2007, a year with record-high milk prices. Thus far in 2009 (January-September), the ratio has averaged 1.56, down from the 10-year average of 2.90. A ratio near 3 or higher is considered positive for milk production.

In July 2008, the farm price of corn peaked at $5.47 per bushel, up nearly $2 per bushel from a year earlier. Alfalfa prices followed suit, with farm prices reaching $180 per ton in August compared with $135 a year earlier.

The early policies addressed three main problems: (1) producers lacked bargaining power with milk buyers; (2) producers suffered from volatile or low prices; and (3) market participants encountered severe shortages/gluts resulting from marketing a highly perishable commodity (fluid milk). The policy response resulted in the development of two major government activities that still function today: federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) and the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP). While both FMMOs and the DPPSP have their roots in the 1930s and 1940s, the programs have changed modestly over the years as the industry structure and markets changed. ", "Two other components of U.S. dairy policy are relatively new programs. First, the 1985 farm bill established the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to counter foreign competitor subsidies. Second, the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program was established in the 2002 farm bill as a government payment for dairy farmers in times of low milk prices. Like U.S. crop programs, the MILC program pays dairy producers when prices decline below a specified level. ", "The following sections describe each of these four components and how they relate to the current market situation.

This program is similar to long-time subsidy programs for crops (e.g., wheat, corn, and soybeans) that pay farmers when farm prices drop below certain levels. USDA's Farm Service Agency implements the MILC program.", "Under MILC, participating dairy farmers nationwide are eligible for a federal payment whenever the minimum monthly market price for farm milk used for fluid consumption (Class I; see discussion on \" Milk Marketing Orders \") in Boston falls below $16.94 per cwt. Eligible farmers then receive a payment equal to 45% of the difference between the $16.94 target price and the lower monthly market price. The payment quantity is limited to 2.985 million pounds of annual production (equivalent to about a 160-cow operation). Since the inception of the MILC program, large dairy farm operators have expressed concern that the payment limit has negatively affected their income. For larger farm operations, their annual production is well in excess of the limit, and any production in excess of that receives no federal payments. ", "To address the issue of rising feed costs, the 2008 farm bill includes a provision that adjusts upward the $16.94 target price in any month when feed prices are above a certain threshold. The law requires USDA to calculate monthly a National Average Dairy Feed Ration Cost based on a formula that USDA currently uses to calculate feed costs. In any month that the average feed cost is above $7.35 per cwt., the $16.94 target price will be increased by 45% of the difference between the monthly feed cost and $7.35. ", "For the latter half of 2007 and all of 2008, farm milk prices remained well above the MILC trigger price, precluding the need for any MILC payments. However, milk prices have since declined below the trigger for MILC payments. The Class I Boston farm milk price for February 2009 (advance pricing) was $13.97 per cwt. With the adjustment for feed costs raising the trigger to $17.33 per cwt., MILC payments were activated for the first time in two years at a payment rate of $1.51 per cwt. (($17.33 - $13.97) times 45%). The payment rate rose to $2.01 per cwt. in March. Given current prospects in the futures markets for milk, corn, and soybeans, payments are expected to continue during 2009, but at smaller rates. Individual producers must select which month to begin receiving payments, based on their projection of potential payment rates and the possibility of hitting the production payment limit. As of October 26, 2009, total MILC payments distributed to date were $775 million ( Table 1 ). ", "The timing of the payments has caused some concern for producers this spring. While milk price data become available during the payment month, data needed for the feed cost adjustor are not available until USDA publishes monthly average feed prices in Agricultural Prices at the end of the next month.

Historically, the supported farm price for milk is intended to protect farmers from price declines that might force them out of business and to protect consumers from seasonal imbalances of supply and demand. ", "USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) supports milk prices by its standing offer to purchase surplus nonfat dry milk, cheese, and butter from dairy processors. Whenever market prices fall to product support levels, processors generally make the business decision of selling surplus product to the government rather than to the marketplace. Consequently, the government purchase prices usually serve as a floor for the market price, which in turn indirectly supports the farm price of milk for all dairy farmers. The effectiveness of the dairy price supports depends on removal of products from the market and placement into government storage.", "The Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP) as authorized by the 2008 farm bill requires USDA to purchase products at the following minimum prices: block cheese, $1.13/lb.; barrel cheese, $1.10/lb.; butter, $1.05/lb.; and nonfat dry milk, $0.80/lb. Under previous law, the support price for farm milk was statutorily set at $9.90 per cwt., and USDA was given the administrative authority to establish a combination of dairy product purchase prices that indirectly supported the farm price of milk at $9.90. Although the 2008 law does not specifically state that the overall support price is $9.90 per cwt, each of the mandated product prices in the law is equivalent to the existing product purchase prices, so farm milk prices effectively continue to be supported at $9.90.", "In late 2008 and 2009, after several years of relative inactivity, the price support program resumed purchases when dairy product prices approached support levels. As of September 11, 2009, USDA estimated that it purchased 111 million pounds of nonfat dry milk under the program in 2008 and expects to purchase 379 million pounds in 2009, along with small amounts of butter and cheese (including amounts exported under the Dairy Export Incentive Program).

Federal orders, which are administered by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, were instituted in the 1930s to promote orderly marketing conditions by, among other things, applying a uniform system of classified pricing throughout the market. Some states, California for example, have their own state milk marketing regulations instead of federal rules. ", "FMMOs also address how market proceeds are distributed among producers delivering milk to federal marketing order areas. Producers are affected by two fundamental marketing order provisions: the classified pricing of milk according to its end use, and the pooling of receipts to pay all farmers a blend price.", "Federal orders regulate dairy handlers (processors) who sell milk or milk products within a defined marketing area by requiring them to pay not less than established minimum class prices for the Grade A milk they purchase from dairy producers, depending on how the milk is used. This classified pricing system requires handlers to pay a higher price for milk used for fluid consumption (Class I products) than for milk used in manufactured dairy products such as yogurt, ice cream, and sour cream (Class II), cheese (Class III), and butter and dry milk products (Class IV). These differences between classes reflect the different market values for the products.", "Blend pricing allows all dairy farmers who ship to the market to pool their milk receipts and then be paid a single price for all milk based on order-wide usage (a weighted average of the four usage classes). Paying all farmers a single blend price is seen as an equitable way of sharing revenues for identical raw milk directed to both the higher-valued fluid market and the lower-valued manufacturing market.", "Manufactured class (Class II, III, and IV) prices are the same in all orders nationwide and are calculated monthly by USDA based on current market conditions for manufactured dairy products. The Class I price for milk used for fluid consumption varies from area to area. Class I prices are determined by adding, to a monthly base price, a \"Class I differential\" that generally rises with the geographical distance from milk surplus regions in the Upper Midwest, the Southwest, and the West. Class I differential pricing is a mechanism designed to ensure adequate supplies of milk for fluid use at consumption centers. The supply of milk may come from local supplies or distant supplies, whichever is more efficient. However, local dairy farmers are protected by the minimum price rule against lower-priced milk that might otherwise be hauled into their region.", "Over the years, dairy farmers have supported minimum prices afforded by FMMOs because they help balance marketing power traditionally held by processors. In contrast, dairy processors generally oppose them. Mandated minimum prices, they say, do not allow for timely adjustments in a rapidly changing market and can leave product manufacturers in unprofitable situations.

Similarly, some farmers do not favor raising support prices because \" ... it has the strong potential to send the wrong signal to the market to increase or at least maintain, rather than to decrease, production.\" As a result, modifications to enhance producer incomes could exacerbate the milk supply and price situation. At any rate, any proposals that involve new budgetary outlays could be challenged as adding to an already large federal deficit and/or burdening consumers with higher costs.", "Proponents of additional action point out that many producers are facing significant income loss and that without additional assistance, they may not survive financially.

The program paid participating farmers to remove more than 1 million dairy cows from milk production, or about 9% of the U.S. dairy herd in 1985. Participating farmers were barred from the dairy industry for five years. The program temporarily reduced the nation's milk production capacity and was designed to ease farmers' transition to a lower price support level that was also included in the 1985 farm bill. ", "One concern with pursuing another buyout is raised by the beef industry. Beef producer groups note that dairy cow slaughter under the 1980s program added beef to total meat supplies, which reduced beef and cattle prices. Under the Dairy Termination Program, USDA purchased beef for other programs as a way to lessen the price impact on the beef and cattle markets. ", "The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) currently operates its own, producer-funded dairy buyout program called Cooperatives Working Together (CWT). It has purchased and removed from dairy production 276,000 cows representing more than 5 billion pounds of annual milk production during its first six herd retirement rounds, which began in 2003. In early February, the NMPF said it was not pursuing a new federal program. ", "On May 1, 2009, the CWT closed its seventh round of bidding for dairy cow purchases. Dairy cow culling reportedly slowed in March and April as farmers who had applied for the program awaited the results. CWT announced in mid-May that it had accepted bids representing nearly 101,000 cows and almost 2 billion pounds of milk production capacity, CWT's largest single herd retirement program to date. Herd culling occurred over the summer months. On July 10, 2009, CWT announced its eighth round, which was completed September 24, 2009. Compared with previous rounds, the bid period was shortened to two weeks in order to have a more immediate impact. In this round, CWT accepted bids on 74,114 cows, representing 1.5 billion pounds of milk. Also, nearly 3,000 bred heifers were sent to processing plants. Most recently, on October 1, 2009, CWT announced yet another round, with bids due by October 15.", "A herd buyout-related bill was introduced in Congress on July 23, 2009.

The National Farmers Organization (NFO) and other farm groups have proposed adding funds to increase the amount of Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) payments, which resumed in February 2009. The groups contend that adding payments to the existing income support program provides a necessary addition to dairy farmer income. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to increase MILC payments. However, opponents of this option argue that additional payments could slow the supply adjustment process needed to bring the dairy market back into balance. Congressional leadership has reportedly been reluctant to act on the proposal because the move would be considered as re-opening the 2008 farm bill, which would likely result in a multitude of requests from other groups seeking changes.", "Earlier in 2009 , the National Milk Producers Federation proposed several administrative changes to the price support program, such as loosening packaging requirements and expanding the list of eligible products. Such changes would likely remove additional products from the market and provide some additional support to prices.

Provisions for expedited rulemaking are expected to allow USDA to make the additional payments in a timely manner. ", "The bill does not specify how the Secretary should allocate the funding for direct payments among producers. This issue is a source of contention because the eventual distribution method used by the Secretary will determine which size of farm will receive the most benefits. Under the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, for comparison, the payment quantity is limited to 2.985 million pounds of annual production (equivalent to about a 160-cow operation), as specified in the 2008 farm bill.", "The idea for an additional dairy appropriation originated in the Senate-passed bill, which included an amendment for an additional $350 million in FSA salaries and expenses, ostensibly for dairy disaster assistance through an increase in dairy product price supports. Amendment proponents in Congress expected that the additional funding, if used for the price support program, would raise minimum purchase prices another $0.05 per pound for nonfat dry milk and $0.09 per pound for cheese from levels USDA announced on July 31, 2009. The House-passed appropriations bill did not have a similar provision.", "The National Milk Producer Federation (NMPF), representing dairy farmers, favors direct purchases, while the National Farmers Union supports higher purchase prices. NMPF contends removing surplus products would raise overall price levels and provide benefits through higher market prices that would be nearly four times greater than the value of benefits derived from either higher purchase prices under the DPPSP or additional direct farmer payments. In contrast, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) favors other options to minimize market impacts, including additional MILC payments and government purchases of a wide variety of products rather than a large-scale purchase of a single product such as cheese. IDFA also argues against higher purchase prices that, they say, would increase costs for food processors and encourage additional milk production, exacerbating the milk surplus problem.

U.S. dairy producers in the 48 contiguous states currently pay a 15-cent per cwt. assessment on all milk produced to fund a national dairy producer program for generic dairy product promotion, research, and nutrition education. Authorization for the program stems from the Dairy Producer Stabilization Act of 1983 (7 U.S.C. 4501-4514). The 2002 farm bill (Section 1505) amended the act requiring that the assessment also be collected on all imported dairy products. After consulting with the Office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the Secretary of Agriculture determined that a mandatory dairy import assessment was not permissible, since Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the domestic assessment. According to USDA, the exemption treats some domestic producers more favorably than importers, thereby violating U.S. trade obligations. ", "To remedy the situation, Section 1507 of the 2008 farm bill extends the domestic assessment to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. The statutory change is designed to make the definition of the United States consistent with the definition used by the USTR and U.S. trading partners, thus allowing the assessment on imported products. The enacted 2008 farm bill also sets the assessment on imports at 7.5 cents per cwt. ", "The import assessment is supported by most dairy producer groups because importers \"benefit from domestic dairy promotion efforts without contributing to programs aimed at growing the U.S. market.\" However, milk producers in Alaska and Hawaii were opposed to any definition change that required them to contribute to the program. Dairy importers and processors are opposed to the import assessment, contending that it is an unfair tax on imported products which they say could be challenged as trade-distorting in the World Trade Organization, regardless of whether Alaska and Hawaii are included. The argument is that because some imported products are subject to quantity limits under tariff rate quotas, importers will not benefit from the assessment in terms of building additional demand for their product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Producer-Handler Exemptions in Federal Milk Marketing Orders", "paragraphs": ["In May 2009, USDA held a public hearing on proposals to amend federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) regarding producer-handler provisions. Producer-handlers are dairy farmers who process milk from their own cows in their own plants and market their packaged fluid milk and other dairy products themselves. ", "Currently, dairy farmers who qualify as producer-handlers under federal milk marketing orders are exempt, as handlers, from the pricing and pooling provisions of the orders. The provisions require handlers to pay minimum prices to dairy farmers for milk depending on its use (e.g., fluid milk, cheese). The pooling process redistributes revenue among producers from across a marketing area (10 regions in total) so that all producers receive the same \"blend\" price. Thus, as handlers, the producer-handlers can produce and sell their milk without being required to participate in the pool, and therefore not be subject to paying minimum prices as other handlers must do. As a result, producer-handlers may have a cost advantage over other handlers. This possibility helped motivate proposals to eliminate the producer-handler exemption.", "The proposed changes would eliminate or modify who is exempt from federal marketing orders. Some of the proposals allow for continued exemptions for producer-handlers based on the size of the operation, ranging from milk production of 450,000 pounds of milk per month (equivalent to about a 275-cow operation) to 3 million pounds per month (about 1,750 cows). Nationwide, about 15 producer-handlers fall into that range of production. Three other firms are larger yet.", "On October 21, 2009, USDA issued a recommended decision that would limit exemption from pooling and pricing provisions of federal orders to those producer-handlers with total route disposition of fluid milk products of 3 million pounds or less per month. After a 60-day comment period, USDA will issue a final decision. A referendum is then conducted among individual producers (or as represented by cooperatives) and, if approved by two-thirds of producers, the amendment to the order is made effective by final rule in the Federal Register . A negative vote on an amended order would eliminate the order."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
