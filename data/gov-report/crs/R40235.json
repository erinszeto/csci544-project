Assessments of quality end-of-life care are often based on family and patient satisfaction. Factors associated with perceptions of higher quality care include expressions of patients' wishes, discussions of families' spiritual needs, documentation of a living will, and family presence at the time of death.

More than a century later, in 2004, average life expectancy for both sexes had increased by 28.6 years to 77.8 years of age. Increases in average life expectancy since the early 1900's have been largely attributable to reductions in child mortality. Since the1950s, increases in average life expectancy have been both a result of improvements in the prevention and control of chronic diseases as well as advances in medical interventions and pharmaceuticals. While important differences in longevity still remain across certain demographic groups (e.g., gender, race, socioeconomic status), increases in average life expectancy mean that more Americans are experiencing living and dying in \"old-age.\" As a result, many older Americans may need long-term care services and supports to address increasing frailty and loss of physical or cognitive functioning, chronic degenerative diseases, or terminal illnesses that may also lead to the need for end-of-life care in advanced age."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Age Distribution", "paragraphs": ["The past century has also seen a dramatic growth in both the size and proportion of the population age 65 and older.

In the early half of the 20 th century, most Americans died from infectious diseases. For example, in 1900 the leading causes of death were pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea and enteritis. Thus, for the majority of the U.S. population, death was experienced rapidly and with a great deal of certainty. Due to achievements in modern medicine in the first half of the 20 th century (e.g., vaccination, antibiotics) and changes in personal behavior, diseases that may have been fatal in the past now are effectively managed for years. As a result, many Americans are living longer with chronic conditions or degenerative diseases, but also dying from them. In 2006, heart disease was the leading cause of death among Americans, followed by cancer, and stroke. Many of these chronic conditions give rise to the need for continuing health care and can be resource intensive, generating significant costs for treatments and/or the need for long-term care (e.g., dialysis, transplant surgery, respiratory therapy, and personal care) and end-of-life care. Death in the early 21 st century for most Americans can be characterized by a gradual onset of disease that leads to a slow decline in an individual's health and ability to maintain their functional independence, ultimately resulting in a dying process that can be longer in duration and much less predictable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Location and Timing of Death", "paragraphs": ["Other changes that affect end-of-life care in the United States include the location and timing of death. In the early 20 th century most deaths occurred in the home. Over the century that trend reversed to one where death largely occurs in an acute care setting. Estimates using data from the most recent national survey that looks at demographic trends in mortality found that in 1993 the majority of deaths among all age groups in the United States occurred in hospitals (58%), while 22% occurred in the home, and 20% occurred in a nursing home. Further evidence suggests that the location of death can vary substantially by underlying cause of death. In a 2001 study of over 1.74 million nontraumatic deaths of persons age 65 and older, two-thirds of individuals whose underlying cause of death was dementia died in a nursing home (67%), compared to 21% whose underlying cause of death was cancer and 28% who had some other condition that resulted in death. However, some experts believe that with the greater availability of home and community-based services and home hospice services the trend may be reversing among those who know they are dying, increasing the proportion of those who die at home. Moreover, evidence suggests that family members of loved ones who died in a private home with hospice services were more likely to report a favorably dying experience compared to those whose loved one died in an institutional setting such as a hospital or nursing home.", "The increase in deaths occurring in institutional settings is also a reflection of medical and technological advances that can permit life to be extended. These advancements, particularly related to life-prolonging treatments, have created a range of outcomes for individuals and for society. Yet, \"many people have become fearful that the combination of old age and modern medicine will inflict on them a dying that is more protracted and, in some ways, more difficult than it would have been a few decades ago.\" On the other hand, \"while an overtreated dying is feared, the opposite medical response\u2014abandonment\u2014is likewise frightening.\" The ability to strike the appropriate balance between treatment and non-treatment can prove difficult for health providers and policymakers alike.", "Technological advances in health care present individuals, families, and medical professionals with difficult decisions about the timing of the dying process. As a result of the complexities surrounding decisions regarding medical treatment to extend life, medical professionals have exerted more influence over the decision making process. For example, 95% of general hospitals surveyed in 1999 and 2000 offered ethics consultation or were starting up a consult service. More recently, public attitudes have shifted toward encouraging active participation of individuals and families in medical decision making regarding end-of-life care. This trend is likely to continue with the aging of the baby-boom generation.", "Another technology-associated factor that emerges in public policy discussions is that the cost of health care at the end of life\u2014and throughout life\u2014has increased. In turn, this increase has raised questions about the appropriate distribution of expensive health care resources across the lifespan. Further complicating this policy discussion is data indicating regional variation in spending intensity at the end of life. Some have suggested that provider reimbursement, rather than patient care, may drive this spending.

For many, conversations about death may be uncomfortable or even feared and thus avoided or deemed taboo. Still, only through the contemplation of one's own mortality can a person formulate and articulate his or her wishes. One concept that is working toward changing individuals' attitudes about death is the idea that one can achieve a \"good\" death. The notion of a good death has been described in a number of ways, including one that is: free from pain and suffering; reasonably consistent with clinical, cultural and ethical standards; in the company of loved ones; following the opportunity for reconciliation; arriving with reasonable warning; and reflective of peace, meaning, or transcendence significant to the individual.", "However, observers have noted that the U.S. health care system may work against the good death concept through health care provider's use of combative language when referring to death and disease. For example, death is often described as an enemy with the fight against disease characterized as a battle. Health care providers' desire to forestall death may be a positive attribute, or at least understandable. However, one consequence of the use of this type of language is that allowing death is perceived as akin to loss or failure:", "Physicians realize, of course, that the mission of vanquishing death is finally futile, but often they ... are quite determined to do all that is possible to postpone the event. Sometimes this objective so dominates care that patients undergo therapies whose effects do not actually advance their own goals and values.", "In some cases, individuals might want health providers to assist in the fight against disease and ultimately death. However, in other cases, they might be better served by health providers' efforts to enhance their quality of life, and then acting as guides during transition into death. A 1997 IOM committee tasked with studying end-of-life care in the U.S. concluded that serious problems in providing quality end-of-life care remain. Specifically, the committee identified errors of omission, where health providers fail to provide care that is known to be effective in alleviating pain and providing comfort at the end of life, as well as errors of commission, or care that is known to be ineffective and may be harmful.

Members of a palliative care team typically include physicians, nurses, social workers, and psychologists, with additional assistance from chaplains, nutritionists, rehabilitation therapists, pharmacists, and other professional disciplines. According to one study, the prevalence of hospital palliative care programs in the United States has steadily increased since 2000, with 53% of hospitals reporting a palliative care program in 2006 compared to 25% in 2000. However, the authors also found wide variation in access to palliative care services based on several factors including hospital size, public versus for profit hospital status, and medical-school affiliation.", "Professional interest in advancing training and education in palliative care among the medical community has also taken shape. The 1997 IOM study recommended changes in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education for health professionals to ensure practitioners have the \"relevant attitudes, knowledge, and skills to care well for dying patients.\" The IOM study also recommended that palliative care should become a defined area of expertise, education, and research, if not a medical specialty. Nearly a decade later, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ARMS) voted to establish Hospice and Palliative Medicine as a new medical subspecialty in 2006.

However, hospice care is focused on terminally ill patients, who no longer seek curative medical treatment, and who, generally, are expected to live for about six months or less.

In the late 1970s, the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) published a report citing hospice as a viable concept of care for terminally ill people and their families that provides humane care at a reduced cost. A year later, the Health Care Financing Administration (now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) started hospice demonstration projects across the nation. The purpose of these projects was \"to assess the cost effectiveness of hospice care and help determine what a hospice program was and what services could be provided.\" In the early 1980s, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-248 ) established Medicare coverage for hospice care. To be eligible for the Medicare hospice benefit beneficiaries must be certified by their attending physician, and the hospice physician, as being terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or less if the disease follows its \"normal course.\" Today, most states also provide hospice Medicaid coverage.

These discharges may be due to an extended prognosis or desire to seek curative treatment. Among all deaths in the United States in 2007, NHPCO estimated that 39% were patients under the care of a hospice program. This estimate is similar to earlier estimates of Medicare decedents use of the hospice benefit. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), in 2005, roughly 40% of Medicare decedents used the hospice benefit under the Medicare program, up from 27% in 2000.

Other sites of care comprised a much smaller share of end-of-life costs. Spending for outpatient and skilled nursing facility services each comprised about 15% of end-of-life costs. Home health spending was 5% and hospice spending accounted for 4% of end-of-life costs. Note that this data measures end-of-life care over the last two years of a Medicare decedent's life. While inpatient hospital services accounted for the majority of Medicare spending at the end of life, costs for inpatient hospital care are also the largest spending category for Medicare in general, comprising 30% of total Medicare spending in 2007. Thus, this data may not measure greater usage of inpatient hospital expenses at the end of life, but rather more expensive care that is generally provided in a hospital setting.", "Some have argued that health care costs are lower when hospice care is substituted for intensive care in a hospital. At the individual level, spending can depend on the circumstances of each patient, including the nature and course of the disease, access to curative and palliative care, the presence of family or other social support system, and the patient's own religious or personal views of death. At the aggregate level, the differences may depend on the time period over which costs are measured. When measured over the last six months of life, the cost of hospice care has been shown to be between 10% to 17% less expensive than the cost of intensive care in a hospital setting. The same study, however, found that savings from hospice use was not as great when health care spending is viewed over an individual's last full year of life (rather than just the last six months). When measured over this longer time period, the savings from using hospice care declines to between 0% to 10%. This is because patients with terminal illnesses may have expensive cancer treatments or experience high medical costs from the treatment of chronic degenerative diseases which could lead to higher health care costs prior to receiving hospice care.", "Yet, even within a hospice setting, spending per user has increased. Between 2004 and 2005, hospice spending per user increased by nearly 8%, as overall spending on hospice care grew more than double that rate by 18%.

During the same time period, Medicare enrollment increased 1.7% and per capita spending increased 6.9%. As previously mentioned, one reason for the increase in hospice expenditures is that length of hospice stays have increased. Increased lengths of stays may be attributed, in part, to changes in patient mix which has resulted in a higher share of patients having conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, nonspecific debility, and congestive heart failure.

The Supreme Court ultimately decided that the state may require clear and convincing evidence of her wishes, and as her guardians did not have sufficient proof, the nutrition and hydration could not be withdrawn. While the Supreme Court did not technically decide the issue as to whether the Missouri court could have acted contrary to a clear and convincing expression of Nancy Cruzan to withdraw medical procedures, it did presume that such a right existed under the Fourteenth Amendment.
