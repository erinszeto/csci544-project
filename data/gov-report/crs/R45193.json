Historically, the agricultural insurance market has been underdeveloped compared to other insurance markets. Agricultural insurance can be difficult to price due to \"unique challenges, including shortness of data, and highly variable losses from year to year, which are often geographically correlated.\" Early providers of crop insurance faced a number of challenges that limited the availability and types of insurance products and helped shape the government's decision to intervene in the market. Many of the challenges of agricultural insurance can be described in five broad categories:", "1. La ck of crop data and actuarially based rates . This was \"one of the most serious handicaps\" that confronted private crop insurers in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Although data availability and rating methodologies have improved, they still pose significant challenges due to uncertainty in yield reporting and evolving climate risks. 2. Production and price variations . Farm income can be unstable because it is primarily determined by the combination of variable production and fluctuating commodity prices. Farm production varies due to pests, weather, natural disasters, and other risks. Agricultural commodity prices are influenced by many factors, including supply and demand in domestic and international markets. Prices of these farm commodities tend to be more volatile year to year and day to day than prices of most nonfarm goods and services. 3. Geographically correlated risks . Pooling of risk is a key insurance concept in which a large number of individuals contribute premiums to a common fund to insure particular risks. Insurers use the common fund to pay indemnities to those who experience covered losses. In theory, when an insurer sells policies to many individuals with \"less than perfectly correlated risks, the total portfolio is less risky than the average of the individual policies.\" This is because when an insurer spreads uncorrelated risks across the insurance pool, the probability of all insureds having a loss from those uncorrelated risks at the same time can be extremely low. Geographically correlated risk refers to a single event causing simultaneous losses in a particular geographic area, such as droughts, floods, and other natural disasters. Compared to uncorrelated risks, correlated risks are more likely to result in very high losses across an insurer's portfolio. Agricultural production is vulnerable to numerous geographically correlated risks, as well as several uncorrelated risks. The private market has successfully insured some uncorrelated risks, such as hail and fire, but historically it has had challenges insuring the geographically correlated risks that affect agriculture. 4. Multiple peril vs. single or named peril . Prior to the federal crop insurance program, private insurers were unsuccessful with crop policies that covered multiple perils and revenue. In contrast to named-peril policies that cover only risks specifically listed in the policy, multiple-peril policies cover all risks within broadly defined categories. Early multiple-peril policies incurred losses that \"greatly exceed[ed]\" premium income and were especially difficult for insurers operating in small geographic areas. Revenue insurance added the challenge of absorbing losses from large price declines. 5. Adverse selection and moral hazard . Adverse selection and moral hazard \"are often cited as major causes of private insurance market difficulties\" in the agricultural sector. Adverse selection refers to higher-risk farmers being more likely to purchase insurance than lower-risk farmers at the same premium rate. It largely stems from an insured having more information about the risk of loss than the insurer. Moral hazard refers to the general tendency of an insured party to take on greater risk once insured. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inception and Growth of the Federal Crop Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["According to a USDA publication from 1938, the federal government spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars to assist farmers in the wake of crop failures\" from around 1923 to 1938. USDA maintained that \"the public, through the Government, could well afford to bear the administrative expense of an insurance program which would help farmers to stand on their own feet as an alternative to providing direct relief in time of crop disasters.\" ", "In 1936, on the heels of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, the President's Committee on Crop Insurance recommended a plan of \"all-risk\" (multiple-peril) crop insurance. In 1938, Congress enacted the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (P.L. 75-43), which created FCIC, a wholly owned government corporation. Initially, FCIC self-insured and administered federal crop insurance policies without the involvement of private insurance companies\u2014that development would not come about until 1980. ", "In the early years of federal crop insurance, polices were available for only a few principal crops (mainly corn, barley, oats, sorghum, wheat, cotton, and rice) and in a limited number of counties. Partly as a consequence of the program's limited scope, only a small proportion of planted acres were enrolled. The program largely continued in this way until 1980, when major changes\u2014including the introduction of federal premium subsidies and the participation of private insurance companies\u2014led to a substantial increase in enrollment. The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (7 U.S.C. \u00a71501 et seq. ), modified by subsequent farm bills and other legislation, is the permanent statutory authority for the program as it exists today. Figure 2 outlines key modifications to the program from 1938 to 2014.", "Between 1980 and 2015, acres enrolled in crop insurance grew from 26.6 million acres (12% of eligible acres) to about 238 million acres (86% of all acres), excluding hay, pasture, range, and forage and separately livestock and nurseries. During that time frame, the number of crops insured increased from 28 to 123. The types of policies offered also increased over this period from one\u2014yield insurance\u2014to over 20, including yield, revenue, margin, and whole farm revenue, among others. ", "Participation in the federal crop insurance program increased as a share of total planted acres from 1981 to 2017 ( Figure 3 ). A spike in enrollment followed the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (\"1994 Act,\" P.L. 103-354 ) in response to a provision in the 1994 Act requiring producers to enroll in crop insurance to be eligible for a variety of other federal farm programs. ", "As a further incentive to participate, the 1994 Act also created the catastrophic (CAT) coverage level, for which FCIC pays 100% of the premium and producers pay a minimal administrative fee. About half of the acres enrolled in 1995 were for CAT coverage. ", "Following the spike in insured acres in 1995 to approximately 73% of total eligible planted acres ( Figure 3 ), participation dipped with the passage of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (\"1996 farm bill,\" P.L. 104-127 ), which repealed the provisions making federal crop insurance coverage an eligibility requirement for other farm programs. The participation slump following the 1996 farm bill proved to be temporary as participation generally increased from 1998 to 2017. The increasing level of participation during this period could be attributed in part to the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 (ARPA, P.L. 106-224 ), which significantly increased premium subsidy levels. This reduced the portion of policy premiums paid by farmers and made crop insurance more affordable.

From 2007 to 2016, annual delivery costs (A&O and CAT LAE) averaged about $1.5 billion, which was about 15% of total premium ( Figure 12 ). ", "The largest single delivery expense reported by AIPs is compensation to crop insurance agents. Crop insurance agents are largely independent agents who sell policies for multiple AIPs. Because RMA determines premium rates, AIPs cannot compete for business based on price. Instead they tend to compete by establishing relationships with agents and on customer service. Thus, it is in an AIP's interest to hire successful agents. This has made the federal crop insurance agent market competitive.", "The 2011 and subsequent SRAs set limits on the amount AIPs are allowed to pay agents. Specifically, AIPs may not pay more than 80% of A&O and CAT LAE by state as base commission to agents. However, an AIP may pay compensation up to 100% of A&O and CAT LAE by state if certain conditions are met. There is no limitation on how much any given agent may receive so long as it is within the maximum amount allowable per state. In other words, an AIP could pay one agent 80% of the A&O it received in a particular state so long as it did not pay commissions to any other agent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Underwriting Gains and Losses", "paragraphs": ["Customary insurance vocabulary does not precisely fit the unique characteristics of the federal crop insurance program because of its public-private cost-share structure.

Together these three policies accounted for approximately 88% of total liabilities in the federal crop insurance program.", "Individual-Yield Policy Type: APH, YP, and Others", "Individual yield policies insure an individual producer's historical yield at a specific price, which RMA sets every spring prior to planting based on projected market prices. RMA offers two main types of yield policies: APH policies and YP policies. They are similar but use different methodologies to determine projected prices. ", "Both APH and YP policies use a producer's historical yield guarantee, the APH. RMA determines a producer's APH using records submitted by the producer. With a few exceptions, RMA requires a minimum of four years of records and will accept records for up to 10 years. Acceptable records include sale receipts and storage records. For most crops, the APH is a simple average of the historical yields. ", "If producers do not have four years of records, RMA substitutes a transition or \"T yield\" for the missing years. T yields are based on the 10-year average county yield. Growers with no records are assigned 65% of the T yield as their APH yield. If producers provide acceptable records for less than four years, they can receive between 80% and 100% of the T yield for the missing years depending on how many years they provide. ", "For APH policies, RMA determines the projected price using a variety of tools depending on the crop. For YP policies, RMA determines the projected price from commodity exchanges using the methodology published in the applicable Commodity Exchange Price Provisions (CEPPs). For corn and soybeans, the projected price is the average Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME, formerly Chicago Board of Trade) daily price in February for the December-futures contract of the same year for corn and the November-futures contract for soybeans ( Figure B-1 ).", "For both APH and YP policies, producers select coverage levels between 50% and 75% (up to 85% in some areas) of their APH yields and between 55% and 100% of the projected prices. Indemnities are triggered only if actual yields fall below the yield guarantee. The higher the coverage level, the lower the premium subsidy rate. RMA offers CAT coverage to individual producers at 50% of the APH yield and 55% of the projected price for an administrative fee of $300 per crop per county.", "Yield and price guarantees equal the selected coverage levels times the APH yield and projected price, respectively. An indemnity is triggered only if actual yields fall below the yield guarantee. Indemnities equal the difference between the yield guarantee and the actual yield times the price guarantee times the number of acres insured.", "Individual-Revenue Policy Type: Revenue Protection and Others", "RMA offers several revenue policies. The individual Revenue Protection policy (RP) is the most prevalent revenue product. RP policies insure against loss of revenue (equal to production times price). These policies use an individual producer's APH yield and the higher of either a \"projected price\" or \"harvest price\" (as defined by the applicable CEPPs) to set a revenue guarantee.", "In the case of corn and soybeans, the projected price is the average CME daily price in February for the December-futures contract of the same year for corn and the November-futures contract for soybeans ( Figure B-2 ). The harvest price is the average CME daily price in October for the December-futures contract for corn of the same year and the November-futures contract for soybeans. ", "For RP policies, indemnities are triggered if an individual producer's \"actual\" revenue is lower than the revenue guarantee. The revenue guarantee is the product of the APH yield guarantee and the projected or harvest price (whichever is higher), times the level of guarantee selected (between 65% and 85%). \"Actual\" revenue is the product of the producer's actual yield and the harvest price. It does not use the actual price the producer receives for the crop. RMA does not offer CAT coverage for RP policies.

RMA also offers a less expensive variation of this policy called RP with Harvest Price Exclusion, which uses only the projected price.", "Other Policies ", "In addition to individual revenue and yield policies, the federal crop insurance program offers several other types of policies, such as whole-farm revenue protection and margin insurance products.
