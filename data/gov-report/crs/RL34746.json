As shown in Figure 1 , there is a minimum demand for electricity that occurs throughout the day. This base level of demand is met with \"baseload\" generating units which have low variable operating costs. Baseload units can also meet some of the demand above the base, and can reduce output when demand is unusually low. The units do this by \"ramping\" generation up and down to meet fluctuations in demand.", "The greater part of the daily up and down swings in demand are met with \"intermediate\" units (also referred to as load-following or cycling units). These units can quickly change their output to match the change in demand (that is, they have a fast \"ramp rate\").

A lower heat rate equates with greater efficiency and lower variable costs. Other things (most importantly, fuel and environmental compliance costs) being equal, the lower a plant's heat rate, the higher it will stand in the economic dispatch priority order. Heat rates are inapplicable to plants that do not use combustible fuels, such as nuclear and non-biomass renewable plants.", "As an illustration of economic dispatch, consider a utility system with coal, nuclear, geothermal, natural gas combined cycle, and natural gas peaking units in its system:", "Nuclear, coal, and geothermal baseload units, which are expensive to build but have low fuel costs and therefore low variable costs, will be the first units to be put on line.

Combined cycle units, which are very efficient but use expensive natural gas as a fuel, will meet intermediate load. These cycling plants will ramp up and down during the day, and will be turned on and off dozens of times a year.

However, if wind or solar generation is available when demand is low (such as a weekend or, in the case of wind, in the evening), the renewable output could displace coal generation.", "Power systems must meet all firm loads at all times, but variable renewable plants do not have firm levels of output because they are dependent on the weather.

By converting the waste heat from the combustion turbine into useful electricity the combined cycle achieves very high efficiencies, with heat rates below 7,000 btus per kWh (compared to around 9,000 btus per kWh for new pulverized coal plants). This high efficiency partly compensates for the high cost of the natural gas used in these plants.", "Modern combined cycle plants, which evolved in the 1990s, have a relatively low construction cost and modest environmental impacts; can be used to meet baseload, intermediate, and peaking demand; can be built quickly; and are very efficient.

According to EIA, combined cycle plants will account for 29% of all capacity additions between 2008 and 2015. However, this forecast may understate actual combined cycle plant additions. The EIA estimates that coal plants will account for almost a quarter of new capacity built through 2015, the equivalent of about 170 new coal-fired generating units. It is questionable whether this much coal capacity will actually be built because of public opposition to new coal plants and the cost of the plants. Utilities reportedly canceled 16,577 MW of planned generating capacity in 2007, of which 84% was coal-fired. According to a Department of Energy (DOE) report, only 12% (4,500 MW) of the coal capacity planned in 2002 to be built by 2007 was actually constructed.

By 2008 the plans for new coal-fired capacity had dropped to 738 MW, primarily \"due to environmental concerns at the State level.

The cost increases have been attributed to many factors, including:", "High prices for raw and semi-finished materials, such as iron ore, steel, and cement. Strong worldwide demand for generating equipment. China, for example, is reportedly building an average of about one coal-fired generating station a week. Low value of the dollar. Rising construction labor costs, and a shortage of skilled and experienced engineering staff. An atrophied domestic and international industrial and specialized labor base for nuclear plant construction and components. In the case of wind, competition for the best plant sites and a tight market for wind turbines; in the case of nuclear plants, limited global capacity to produce large and ultra-large forgings for reactor pressure vessels. Coincident worldwide demand for similar resources from other business sectors, including general construction and the construction of process plants such as refineries. Much of the demand is driven by the rapidly growing economies of Asia.", "The future trend in construction costs is a critical question for the power industry. Continued increases in capital costs would favor building natural gas plants, which have lower capital costs than most alternatives. Stable or declining construction costs would improve the economics of capital-intensive generating technologies, such as nuclear power and wind. At least some long-term moderation in cost escalation is likely, as demand growth slackens and new supply capacity is added. But when and to what degree cost increases will moderate is as unpredictable as the recent cost escalation was unforeseen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financing Power Plant Projects", "paragraphs": ["Even relatively small power plants cost millions of dollars.

State utility commissions set electric rates designed to maintain the financial health of the utility, assuming it operates prudently. The commission also must approve proposals by the utility to build new power plants. Publicly-owned utilities (POUs) : A POU is a utility that is an agency of a municipality, a state, or the federal government. Electric cooperatives are also considered to be POUs. Like IOUs, POUs have guaranteed service territories and face limited competition. Most POUs are small, provide only distribution service, and have limited financial and management resources. But larger and some smaller POUs also own and operate power plants, sometimes as co-owners of projects where an IOU or independent power producer is the lead developer. Examples of POUs with large amounts of generation include the Tennessee Valley Authority and the municipal utilities serving the cities of Los Angeles and San Antonio. POUs set their own rates and make their own decisions to build power plants. Independent Power Producers (IPPs) : IPPs are merchant developers and operators of power plants that sell wholesale power to utility and industrial buyers. Within limits they can sell power at whatever price the market will bear. IPPs face more financial risk than regulated utilities\u2014they do not have guaranteed service territories and can face intense competition for power sales\u2014but can also earn larger profits. IPPs make their own decisions to build power plants.", "All three types of entities play a major role in the electric power industry ( Table 1 ). The lines between the entities can blur. Holding companies that own IOUs can also own IPPs. POUs sometimes own large shares of power projects developed by IOU or IPPs.", "The cost of the money used to finance power projects varies significantly between IOU, POUs, and IPPs. A POU will normally finance a project with 100% debt at a low interest rate. The rate is low because interest paid on public debt is exempt from federal or state income taxes, and because public entities have a very low risk of default (failure to make debt payments), much lower than for private businesses. Typical municipal bonds have ratings in the middle or upper tiers of investment grade debt.", "Privately owned IOUs and IPPs finance power projects with a mix of debt and equity. Debt is more costly to these companies than to POUs because it is not tax exempt and because they usually have lower credit ratings. The electric utility industry as a whole has a credit rating in the lower tier of the investment grade category (BBB). IPP debt often falls in the speculative category and has a higher interest rate than IOU or POU issues.", "Investors expect private developers to make a significant equity contribution to a project. Reliance on equity versus debt varies by company and project. The cost analysis used in this study assumes that IPPs and IOUs rely on, respectively, 40% and 50% equity (see Table D -1 ), except in the case where federal loan guarantees are available (see discussion of \" Government Incentives \", above). Equity is more expensive than debt, and is more expensive for IPPs than IOUs because IPPs typically face more competition and financial risk.", "In summary:", "Because POUs can finance a power project with 100% low-cost debt they can build power plants more cheaply than IOUs or IPPs. However, because of the small size of most POUs they do not have the financial or management resources to take on large and complex projects by themselves, so POUs often partner on projects where an IOU or IPP is the lead developer. IOU's typically have lower financing costs than IPP's because they have lower costs of debt and equity.

EIA attributes the gap between actual and forecasted gas prices to a host of factors:", "As regulatory reforms that increased the role of competitive markets were implemented in the mid-1980s, the behavior of natural gas was especially difficult to predict. The technological improvement expectations embedded in early AEOs [Annual Energy Outlooks] proved conservative and advances that made petroleum and natural gas less costly to produce were missed. After natural gas curtailments that artificially constrained natural gas use were eased in the mid-1980s, natural gas was an increasingly attractive fuel source, particularly for electricity generation and industrial uses. Historically, natural gas price instability was strongly influenced by natural gas resource estimates, which steadily rose, and by the world oil price. More recently, the AEO reference case has overestimated natural gas consumption due to the use of natural gas wellhead price projections that proved to be significantly lower than what actually occurred.", "EIA's analysis illustrates how the confluence of technological, regulatory, resource, and domestic and international market factors make fuel forecasts so problematic. Fuel price uncertainty is especially important in evaluating the economics of natural gas-fired combined cycle plants.

Over the long term, EIA expects nuclear fuel prices to increase in real terms from $0.58 per mmbtu in 2007 to $0.77 per mmbtu in 2023, and then slowly decline.

In practice, air permit emissions are negotiated case-by-case between the developer and state air authorities.

Circuit vacated the Bush administration's Clean Air Mercury Rule, which would have allowed new coal plants to comply with mercury emission limits by purchasing mercury allowances. Because of the court's action, coal plant mercury emissions are now categorized as a hazardous air pollutant. If the decision stands, it will trigger a requirement for all coal plants, old and new, to install mercury control equipment that meets a Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) standard. EPA has not yet defined a MACT standard for mercury, but state air officials will probably require new plants to meet tight mercury emission limits.", "The technology and costs for controlling sulfur, NOx, particulate, and mercury emissions are briefly described below.

Commercial technologies can remove 95% to 99% of the SO 2 formed by burning coal in pulverized coal plants, and over 99% of the sulfur in IGCC synthesis gas before it is burned. To the degree that a new pulverized coal unit or IGCC plant releases SO 2 to the atmosphere, it must buy SO 2 emission allowances. Because SO 2 emissions by plants with controls are so small, allowances are not a major expense compared to the other costs of running a power plant. At mid-2008 allowance and fuel prices, the annual cost of SO 2 allowances for a coal plant burning eastern coal would be on the order of $1 million, compared to over $220 million just for fuel. The cost of the control equipment is more significant. An SO 2 control system will account for about 12% of the capital cost of a new pulverized coal plant and 29% of non-fuel operating costs ( Table 2 ). (It is difficult to isolate environmental control costs for an IGCC plant because emissions control is largely integral with cleanup of the synthesis gas that is necessary, irrespective of environmental rules, prior to combustion.) Mercury. Some pulverized coal plants can achieve 90% removal of mercury as a co-benefit of operating SO 2 and particulate control equipment. Other plants will have to install a powdered activated carbon injection system (accounting for about 1% of the plant's capital cost and 9% of non-fuel operating costs). IGCC plants would remove 90% to 95% of the mercury from the synthesis gas using another technology also based on activated carbon. NOx. Commercial technologies can reduce NOx emissions to very low levels for pulverized coal and IGCC plants. Depending on a plant's location, it may have to purchase NOx emission allowances. As in the case of SO 2 allowances, because the controlled emission rates for new plants are so low the total cost of allowances is small compared to other plant operating costs. The cost of the control equipment for a pulverized coal plant is about 2% of capital expense and 9% of non-fuel operating costs. Particulates. Primary particulates are controlled using removal systems that have been a standard feature of pulverized coal plants for many years. Removal efficiencies exceed 99%.

In addition to being critical to the cost of gas-fired power, natural gas prices are also one of the most uncertain elements in this analysis. As discussed earlier in this report, natural gas prices have been exceptionally difficult to forecast. If the United States becomes more dependent in the future on imports of liquefied natural gas, the domestic and international natural gas markets will be increasingly linked, adding an additional element of uncertainty to the natural gas price outlook.", "Underestimates of natural gas prices were pervasive among government and private forecasters in the 1990s and contributed to over-investment in gas-fired generating capacity. If future gas prices are higher than assumed in this report's Base Case, the economics of gas-fired generation could change substantially. The gas market has historically been volatile. Gas prices increased more than 200% from the early 1990s through 2007, and annual increases sometimes exceeded 50% ( Figure 7 ).", " Figure 8 illustrates the Base Case gas price projection and an alternative that ramps up to a level 50% higher than in the Base Case. In the Base Case the annualized cost of power from a natural gas combined cycle plant is $61.77 per Mwh. With a 50% higher gas price, the combined cycle power cost is $77.05 per Mwh. At this power cost the combined cycle is substantially more costly than pulverized coal or geothermal power, and has a clear economic advantage only over the solar technologies ( Table 9 , column 4). On the other hand, even with this much higher fuel price projection, the cost of power from the combined cycle is still comparable to that of wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal generation; and while pulverized coal and geothermal power have lower costs, as discussed above the former is increasingly hard to build for cost and environmental reasons, and the latter is limited to small plants at western sites. Therefore, even with a 50% increase in fuel prices, the gas-fired combined cycle is still a competitive option for new generating capacity.", "Another perspective is to determine the increase in the Base Case natural gas price projection required for the cost of power from the natural gas combined cycle plant to equal the cost of power from an alternative technology. This is illustrated in Table 10 . The table shows that the price of gas would have to be between 62% to 69% higher than in the Base Case for the cost of power from a combined cycle to equal the projected cost of electricity from nuclear, wind, or coal IGCC technologies (column 3).

This is because the combined cycle has a relatively low capital cost and a high capacity factor.", " Table 11 shows that the power cost of the combined cycle is about half as sensitive to changes in capital costs as the other generating technologies. The implication is that continued rapid escalation in the cost of building power plants will favor the economics of combined cycles. This is illustrated by Table 12 . In the Base Case (Column 3), the power costs of wind, nuclear, and IGCC coal are about a third higher than the combined cycle. In the high capital cost case (Column 4) the difference widens to almost 50%. On the other hand, decreases in capital costs, whether the result of market forces or government incentives, would reduce the cost of power from the other technologies about twice as much as for the combined cycle.

The least expensive options include zero-carbon emission technologies: Geothermal ($59.23 per Mwh), nuclear ($83.22) and wind ($80.74). The natural gas combined cycle plant without carbon capture is competitive with the other options, even with allowance costs, at $77.21 per Mwh.

Newer technologies may be less costly and more efficient, but these are still in development.", "The CO 2 allowance price projection is adapted from the EIA \"core\" case forecast from its analysis of S. 2191 .

All allowances must be purchased (i.e., there is no free distribution of allowances to power plants). Fuel prices are the same prices used in the Base Case (see Table D-4 ). As in the Base Case, the only financial incentives included are the nuclear production tax credit and the investment tax credit for solar and geothermal plants. From a financing standpoint, units with carbon controls are assumed to be high risk projects that incur financing costs equivalent to below investment grade interest rates. This assumption is made because units coming on-line in 2015, as assumed for this study, would be part of the first wave of power plants with carbon controls.", " Table 14 , below, shows estimates of the levelized cost of power for a carbon capture case.", "The results indicate:", "The power costs for coal plants using control technologies are high compared to the Base Case. The costs in the carbon case range from $100.69 per Mwh to almost $120 per Mwh (column 10), compared to $63.19 per Mwh for a pulverized coal unit in the Base Case ( Table 14 , column 10). This illustrates the impact of the high capital costs and efficiency penalties of current carbon capture technologies. With the imposition of carbon costs on fossil plants, three of the least expensive options are zero-carbon technologies: Geothermal ($59.23 per Mwh), nuclear ($83.22) and wind ($80.74). Because geothermal plants are limited to specific sites in the western states, nuclear power (a baseload technology) and wind power (a variable renewable resource) are the zero carbon options with relatively low costs and wide latitude for plant sites. A fourth relatively low-cost technology is the natural gas combined cycle plant without carbon capture ($77.21 per Mwh including allowance costs). The relatively low cost is due to the technology's low capital cost, high capacity factor, and relatively low emissions of CO 2 per megawatt-hour of power generated. As shown in Table 14 , the natural gas combined cycle plant without carbon capture incurs allowance costs of $13.06 per Mwh, which is 61% less than the pulverized coal plant cost of $33.80 per Mwh (column 6). In other words, for every dollar of allowance costs incurred by a coal plant without capture technology, the combined cycle incurs only about 40 cents in costs. Solar thermal power ($100.32 per Mwh) has a lower cost than fossil plants with carbon capture technology, but is still estimated to be about 20% more expensive than nuclear and wind power.", "The relatively low cost of power from the natural gas combined cycle plant is in part a function of the fuel price. As noted above, the carbon capture analysis uses the same fuel price projections as in the Base Case. It is possible that in a carbon-constrained world demand for gas will increase, driving up prices. As shown below in Table 15 :", "A 12% increase in the price of gas would equalize the cost of electricity from the combined cycle plant without carbon capture with wind power (column 3); A 20% increase would equalize the power cost of the combined cycle plant and the nuclear plant; The price of natural gas would have to more than double for the power cost of the gas-fired combined cycle plant to equal the cost of coal power with carbon controls, or increase by 75% to match the cost of solar thermal power.", "This scale of natural gas price increases has precedent. As shown in Figure 7 , between the early 1990s and 2007 the market price of natural gas increased by about 200%.", "As discussed above, the cost and efficiency impacts of current carbon capture technologies are high, and improved technologies are under development.

A subset of the projects in the database were used to estimate overnight costs. Projects were excluded for many reasons, including because the projects were too old to reflect current construction costs, did not use standard technology, were extreme high or low outliers and no information was available to explain the costs, or had other unusual characteristics (e.g., some plants reduced costs by purchasing used or surplus equipment). The remaining projects were sorted by technology (e.g., nuclear, wind, etc.). The reported cost per kilowatt of capacity for the projects in each group were then averaged to estimate the overnight cost for each technology.", "To the extent possible the information for the database was taken from information filed by utilities with state public service commissions. The advantage of using this source is that utilities seeking permission to construct new plants are often required to disgorge cost details. With these details the project cost estimate can be adjusted to exclude IDC and other expenses not directly associated with the cost of the plant, such as major transmission system upgrades distant from the plant site.", "When utility commission filings for a project were not available, as was almost always true for IPP and POU projects, other public sources were used, including press releases and trade journal articles. In most cases it was possible to determine whether or not a cost estimate included IDC. However, it was rarely possible, with or without utility commission filings, to determine how much cost escalation was built into a project estimate. Because it was not possible to extract the escalation costs from the project estimates, as a rough correction the financial model assumed no cost escalation to avoid a double count. The model does compute the IDC charges.", "The 161 projects in the database includes information on 119 United States power plant projects.
