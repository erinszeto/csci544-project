In addition to providing inpatient, outpatient, and a range of other medical care services, the VHA provides and purchases long-term care services. The VA is one of two federal payers of long-term care services (the other being Medicaid).", "Since the 1960s, the VA has been authorized to provide nursing home care to eligible veterans in various settings, including VA facilities, private nursing facilities contracted by the VA, and state veterans homes (P.L. 88-450). These nursing home benefits were further expanded in subsequent legislation (P.L. 91-101 and P.L. 93-82). In 1999, the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117) required the VA to provide such benefits to veterans needing nursing home care due to one of their service-connected conditions, as well as veterans who overall have a service-connected disability rating of 70% or more, who need the care for any condition, service-connected or not. In addition, the law required the VA to maintain staffing and level of services for institutional care not less than the FY1998 level; the law also required non-institutional long-term care services as part of the VA medical benefits package.", "About 9.1 million veterans (43% of all veterans) were estimated to be enrolled in the VHA in FY2016. Although the overall number of veterans in the United States has declined since FY2000, the number of veterans enrolled in the VHA has increased significantly in that same time period. In FY2000, just over 4.9 million veterans were enrolled in the VHA; by FY2016 that number was estimated to have increased 86%, to 9.1 million enrollees. This increase is due, in part, to the growing number of veterans with service-connected disabilities, as well as more liberal enrollment policies. Among veterans with a service-connected disability, the proportion who have a disability rated as 70% or more service-connected (and therefore eligible for VA paid nursing home care) has also increased.", "VA long-term care programs are administered at the VA facility level, with some variability in how programs are administered. Each VA facility offers certain mandatory programs and may offer several optional programs as well. Eligibility for VA long-term care programs depends on eligibility for VA health care, which is based primarily on \"veteran status\" resulting from military service. Once enrolled, veterans' eligibility for long-term care services depends on several factors, including veterans' need for the service (as determined by the VA), whether the service is institutional or non-institutional, and (for certain programs), veterans' service-connected status.", "Institutional settings may include both inpatient acute care and nursing home care. However, the majority of VA long-term care provided in institutional settings occurs in nursing home facilities, such as VA Community Living Centers (CLCs), community nursing homes, and state veterans homes. Non-institutional care includes outpatient and ambulatory care settings, as well as care that occurs in the home or another community-based setting. Non-institutional services include", "home-based primary care, community residential care, geriatric evaluation, palliative care, adult day health care, homemaker/home health aide care, respite care, home skilled care, home hospice, and veteran-directed home and community-based services and medical foster homes (at some facilities).", "Some long-term care services are provided directly by VA staff, whereas others are purchased from providers outside of the VA. Long-term care expenditures are a small but not insignificant part of the VHA total medical care budget, at just over one-tenth of the VHA's budget. In FY2015, the VHA spent $7.4 billion (13% of its total appropriated funding for medical care, which was $55.8 billion) for veterans' long-term care. Institutional care accounted for almost $5.3 billion, or 71% of VA's total long-term care spending, while non-institutional care accounted for $2.1 billion, or 29%. The majority of VHA institutional care spending (64%) was for VA Community Living Centers (CLCs), nursing facilities owned and operated by the VA.", "This report provides an overview of VA long-term care services, including legislative highlights, eligibility, organizational structure, descriptions of services (both institutional and non-institutional care), and expenditures.

The Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA) renders final decisions on appeals regarding veteran benefits claims.", "The VHA, the largest and most visible operating unit, is predominantly a direct service provider of primary and specialty care, similar in many ways to a large private sector health care system. However, some aspects of the VHA are very different from a private health care system. Not only does the VHA employ health professionals to provide health care services directly, but the VHA also purchases care for certain veterans from community health providers. Further, the VHA provides social services and other supportive services\u2014such as housing assistance, home health aide services, and adult day health care\u2014that are rarely tied to private sector health care providers or financed by private health insurance or Medicare. Beyond the provision of health care and other support services to veterans and eligible family members, the VHA is statutorily required to conduct medical research into the special health care needs of veterans, to train health care professionals, to serve as a contingency back up to the Department of Defense (DOD) medical system during a national security emergency, and to provide support to the National Disaster Medical System and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as necessary.", "In addition to providing inpatient, outpatient, and a range of other medical care services, the VHA has been authorized by Congress since the 1960s to provide nursing home care to eligible veterans in VA facilities, private nursing facilities contracted by the VA, and state veterans homes.

Toward the end of FY1964, within the scope of existing statutory authority, the VA began making plans to implement a nursing home care program with 2,000 beds in VA hospitals \"for those veterans who have obtained maximum hospital benefits, [but] are too physically disabled for domiciliary care, and still have a need for nursing care which for various reasons cannot be provided in the community.\" In August 1964, P.L. 88-450 authorized, among other things, 4,000 beds for nursing home care. It further authorized care in private or public nursing homes for no more than six months at VA expense for VA patients who had received maximum hospital benefits but who still needed long-term nursing home care. If the veteran needed permanent nursing home care for more than six months, the veteran would be placed in a VA nursing home rather than a private nursing home. P.L. 88-450 also authorized the VA to make per diem payments to state veterans' nursing homes for the care of eligible veterans. In enacting P.L.88-450, Congress recognized the growing need for nursing home care for World War II veterans in future years, and at the same time recognized the need for VA to move patients from expensive hospitals settings (when they no longer needed hospitalization) to less expensive nursing home settings for longer-term convalescence.", "P.L. 91-101, enacted in 1969, amended P.L. 88-450 and eliminated the six-month limitation on care at a contracted community nursing home for veterans who were previously hospitalized in a VA hospital for a service-connected disability. For all other veterans, the six-month limitation applied, but the VA was authorized to extend the time period at its discretion. The Veterans Health Care Expansion Act of 1973 ( P.L. 93-82 ) further liberalized eligibility for contracted community nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions and authorized the VA to provide nursing home care to veterans in contracted community nursing homes without having to be admitted to a VA hospital first.

In addition, long-term care programs are not fully integrated into the healthcare system at many VA facilities. Despite a continuum of offerings, services are not available universally and access often is restricted. Many facilities do not have mechanisms for coordinating long-term care services, relying on episodic admissions to individual programs.

This act, among other things, mandated nursing home care for veterans with a service-connected condition in need of such care and for veterans with nonservice-connected conditions who are 70% or more service-connected disabled. Among other things, it also required the VA to provide non-institutional care, such as home-based care and adult day health care, to all enrolled veterans. In his signing statement, President Clinton stated:", "This bill is especially significant for its approach in the provision of enhanced extended care services to veterans. It firmly establishes that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) should accord the highest priority for nursing home care to the most severely disabled veterans and those needing care for service-connected disabilities.

After veteran status has been established, the VA next places an applicant into one of two categories.

Service-connected disability means that such disability was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in active service.

As shown in Figure 2 , just over 4.9 million veterans (19% of all veterans) were enrolled in the VHA in FY2000; by FY2016, that number was estimated to have increased 86%, to 9.1 million enrollees. This increase is due, in part, to factors such as enrollment in newer veterans from Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND), a larger number of female veterans, and economic conditions, among other factors.

This likelihood is due, in part, to VHA eligibility policies based on service-connected conditions. Moreover, VHA policies regarding mental health screening, for example, lead to higher rates of diagnosis. In addition, veterans who access the VHA also tend to be older, less socioeconomically well off, and less healthy than veterans who do not rely on the VA for care.", "The VA health care system faces the challenge of providing care to those aging with disability as well as those aging into disability. Veterans of all ages may need long-term care, both younger veterans with disabilities and aging veterans. Moreover, the number of veterans with a service-connected disability, defined as a disability caused by injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active military service, is increasing. The VA determines whether veterans have service-connected disabilities, and for those with such disabilities, assigns ratings from 0% to 100% (in increments of 10%) based on the severity of the disability. As shown in Figure 3 , nearly 2.5 million veterans had a service-connected disability in FY2003; by FY2013, that number had increased to over 3.7 million. Moreover, the number of veterans who are rated in the highest disability rating group (i.e., veterans with 70% to 100% service-connected disabilities) has increased. Among those veterans with service-connected conditions, about 2 in 10 veterans (18%) were rated as having 70% to 100% service-connected disabilities in FY2003, compared with 3 in 10 veterans (30%) in FY2013.

There are currently 18 VISNs, which vary regarding the number of sites of care, the types and number of facilities, and the geographic size of the network's region. Each VISN has a VISN Director, who has oversight of the VA facilities within that VISN and directly supervises the facility director at each facility.

This care may be provided in a VA Community Living Center (CLC), a Community Nursing Home (CNH), or a State Veteran's Home.", "The VA has 135 Community Living Centers (CLC) associated with VAMCs across the country that provide nursing home level of care. CLCs are staffed by VA employees and may provide rehabilitation, custodial, and hospice care to veterans. Some CLCs may offer specialty services, such as a specialized dementia unit. In the mid-2000s, this program underwent a change in the model of care, renaming the facilities from Nursing Home Care Units to Community Living Centers to evoke a more homelike atmosphere and acknowledge that CLCs are the veterans' home. In addition to the name change, the VA launched a system-wide program to promote cultural transformation, including a more person-centered approach, more homelike interior design, and more resident choice related to daily schedule of meals, sleep and wake times, and bathing. CLCs are inspected by the VA's Office of the Inspector General and the Long-Term Care Institute.", "While not all VAMCs have CLCs, all are required to operate a Community Nursing Home (CNH) program. Under this model, the VA has contracts with community nursing facilities to provide care to veterans. The VA inspects the nursing facility initially and then reviews quality annually, and VA clinical staff make monthly visits to each nursing facility where veterans have been placed to monitor the care being provided. The VA Community Nursing Home Coordinator makes arrangements for placement of eligible veterans and acts as a liaison for the nursing facility.", "The third setting for VA nursing home care is in a State Veterans Home (SVH) . SVHs are owned and operated by the state in which they reside, and eligibility requirements are determined by the state of jurisdiction. The state may apply for grants from the VA to cover some of the cost of infrastructure, and the SVH may receive a per diem that covers approximately one-third of the cost of the veteran's care. The VA also surveys the SVH annually. Each state operates SVHs differently, but may offer various levels of care in addition to nursing home, such as domiciliary (independent living), assisted living, and adult day health care.", "In addition to providing long-term care in these settings, VA facilities may choose to provide respite, hospice, and palliative care, as well as geriatric evaluation programs, to eligible veterans in an institutional setting. As previously mentioned, veterans are eligible for 30 days of respite care per calendar year, in general; if needed, this care may be provided in an institutional setting (such as CLC or CNH), depending on resource availability, to give the family caregiver a break from caregiving. The clinical criteria for veterans receiving institutional respite care is the same as for home respite; however, this program may be limited in certain VA facilities \u00a0 depending on resource or bed availability. In addition, hospice care may be provided to veterans in an institutional setting. For example, veterans receiving home hospice whose care needs can no longer be managed at home may move into a VA CLC to receive hospice care for a short time, while their symptoms are managed, or while they are actively dying. In some cases, the VA may also pay for inpatient hospice care in other institutional settings, such as community inpatient hospice facilities. Also, palliative care may be offered in institutional settings; some CLCs may have palliative care units, or a VA may have a palliative care team that consults at the bedside of veterans in a hospital intensive care unit. Similarly, geriatric evaluation teams may consult with veterans residing in acute inpatient settings.

It is important to note that total medical care obligations for state nursing homes identified in Table 6 , as well as per diem costs, account only for VA's portion of the total cost of care in state homes. States and veterans are also responsible for a share of the total costs of care in these settings.", "Moreover, most VHA institutional spending pays for long-stay care.

Compared with other VA institutional settings, CLCs have higher per diem costs, on average, but also have a greater proportion of short-stay residents. Short-stay residents are more likely to need post-acute or rehabilitative care, which is often more resource-intensive than custodial nursing care provided to long-stay residents. Table 6 compares FY2015 short-stay versus long-stay per diem costs by institutional setting. As shown in the table, average per diem rates for CLC short-stay in 2015 were greater than their average long-stay rates. According to the VA, CLCs may provide specialized care for veterans with mental or behavioral health conditions, as well as certain programs for those with dementia or spinal cord injuries. In addition, CLC per diem costs account for other direct and indirect VA expenditures such as physician and other skilled medical staff, medical education and research, and overhead expenditures related to VA national programs.

Further, the number of veterans who have disabilities that are rated as 70% or more service-connected, and therefore are eligible for VA-paid nursing home care, has increased. This growth may lead to more veterans needing access to long-term care services in order to remain in the community, as well as a greater number of veterans eligible for nursing home care at VA's expense. However, the current policy discussion has primarily focused on reforming access to care within the VA health care system, particularly in relation to primary and specialty care. The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-146 ), as amended, required two different external assessments of the VA. The first was an independent assessment of the VA offering multiple broad recommendations for next steps for the VA. The second assessment, conducted by the Commission on Care, made various recommendations regarding the future of the VA in a report published in July 2016. Both sets of recommendations acknowledge the challenges associated with an increasing number of aging and disabled veterans, but they were largely silent on how such demographic implications will affect the demand for VA long-term care services. The VA's capacity to meet the needs of aged and disabled veterans over time depends on its ability to provide that care directly, but also to purchase care from the community. ", "This challenge raises several questions for policymakers: In the context of VA health system reform, are there access issues to be considered for long-term care as well as for specialty and primary care areas? How can the VA maximize quality and efficiency, recognizing that access to long-term care services and care coordination across acute and long-term care may prevent the frequency or need for more expensive care, such as acute inpatient stays or emergency department visits? Does the VA have the right size and mix of geriatric and extended care health professionals to meet the demands of the disabled and aging veteran population both now and in the future? Does the VA have the flexibility it needs to negotiate with community partners who provide much of VA's home and community-based care? "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Institutional vs. Home and Community-Based Services", "paragraphs": ["Over the past two decades, federal financing and delivery of long-term care, particularly for the largest federal payer of LTSS (Medicaid) has shifted toward the provision of care in home and community-based settings rather than institutional care. In FY1995, the proportion of Medicaid LTSS spending on institutional care was 82%, with 18% spent on home and community-based services (HCBS). Almost 20 years later, the proportion of Medicaid LTSS spending on institutional care has decreased to 47%, with more than half of spending (53%) on HCBS (data for FY2014). Medicaid's shift toward more HCBS occurred with various administrative efforts and activities, as well as financial incentives and broader statutory authority from Congress for states to provide such services. In part, Medicaid HCBS expansion was prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C. , which held that the institutionalization of people who could be cared for in community settings was a violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The movement to expand HCBS has occurred alongside the shift to more patient-centered and consumer-driven models of care, which seek to honor the preferences of the individual. Most individuals express a strong preference for remaining in their homes and communities rather than in institutions.", "Similarly, the VA has expressed a desire to move toward \"a more balanced offering of home and community-based services.\" However, in FY2015, 29% of VA long-term care spending was on non-institutional care versus 71% of spending on institutional care. One issue that may affect the balance of long-term care services offered is VA's statutory requirement to provide nursing home care to veterans with 70% or more service-connected disability, as well as the requirement to provide nursing home care to veterans who are service-connected and need care for their service-connected disability. Thus, similar to federal Medicaid statute, which requires states to provide nursing home care to certain eligible beneficiaries, the VA operates under a mandate to provide such care to certain veterans.", "Moreover, the current design of the State Veterans Home (SVH) program generally favors institutional care over HCBS. As stated previously, under this federal-state partnership, the VA provides grants to states to build, modify, or acquire nursing home, domiciliary, and adult day health care facilities\u2014a federal grant to the state may not exceed 65% of the total project cost. In addition to providing grants to states for facility construction, the VA provides a fixed per diem to states for each veteran who receives care in a state veteran's home. Thus, under the current program design, states generally have an incentive to continue to maintain long-term and extended care facilities rather than explore non-institutional alternatives. ", "According to the VA, HCBS is less costly than facility-based options and growth in LTSS expenditures can be moderated by moving toward the provision of more HCBS. However, in the aggregate LTSS spending can be moderated only if HCBS spending increases as institutional spending decreases. VA's requirement to maintain a specific level of long-term care beds and staffing, as well as the mandate to provide institutional care to certain veterans, may create barriers to shifting care to HCBS. To efficiently use the institutional resources it has, the VA must keep the institutional beds occupied. Further, whether beds are occupied or not, the cost to maintain the physical infrastructure of facilities owned and operated by the VA is a consideration. Current contracting requirements may limit the VA's ability to purchase institutional care in the community, thereby offsetting the need for institutional settings owned and operated by the VA. Such requirements may also limit the VA's capacity to provide care to veterans in their communities. Unless VA institutional spending can be reduced, spending on more HCBS may be an additional cost to the VA rather than a shift in cost.", "This issue raises several questions for policymakers: What is the right proportion of VA LTSS spending on institutional versus non-institutional care? Does the VA have the appropriate number of CLC beds offering the right types of care? Does the VA have the ability and flexibility needed to partner with community long-term care facilities to provide care to veterans in their communities and potentially reduce demand for VA-owned and operated CLCs?

Veterans who have Medicare or private health insurance may seek services not covered by those plans from the VA, such as adult day health care or respite care. Although the VA offers some long-term care services similar to Medicaid (e.g., home health aides to assist with personal care), unlike Medicaid, the VA does not require veterans to spend down assets or meet strict income guidelines to receive long-term care. Conversely, some eligible veterans may elect other coverage options and choose to receive their health care in the community due to personal preference, proximity, or more timely access to a provider. Veterans' reliance on VA health care varies; some veterans rely solely on the VA, whereas others use the VA intermittently for certain health care services. This discrepancy presents a challenge for the VA in understanding current demand, and predicting future demand, for health care services.

This raises several questions for policymakers: Where are there inefficiencies or duplication that could be limited or coordination that could be enhanced? When, or for what services, should veterans access Medicaid, Medicare, and the VA? What do the VA and CMS know about veterans dually enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid and the VHA, or enrolled in all three programs, that could inform care coordination?

Only veterans in Priority Group 1 (those who have been rated 50% or more service-connected) and veterans who are deemed catastrophically disabled by a VA provider are never charged a copayment, even for treatment of a nonservice-connected condition. For veterans required to pay long-term care copayments, these charges are based on three levels of nonservice-connected care, including copayments for inpatient, non-institutional, and adult day health care. However, actual copayments may vary depending on a veteran's financial situation. For example, P.L.114-315, the Jeff Miller and Richard Blumenthal Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2016 exempted Medal of Honor recipients from paying LTC copayments for both service and nonservice connected LTC.", "Certain VA long-term care programs have associated costs other than a VA copayment.

The out-of-pocket cost varies by geographical area and amount of care needed. There is no additional VA copayment. Similarly, veterans who reside in State Veterans Homes may have out-of-pocket costs; this varies from state to state and is often on a sliding fee scale.
