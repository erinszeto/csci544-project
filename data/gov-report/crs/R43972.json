This decline is a reversal of sustained growth in federal R&D funding for more than half a century, and has stirred debate about the potential long-term effects on U.S. technological leadership, innovation, competitiveness, economic growth, and job creation. Concerns about reductions in federal R&D funding have been exacerbated by increases in the R&D investments of other nations (China, in particular); globalization of R&D and manufacturing activities; and trade deficits in advanced technology products, an area in which the United States previously ran trade surpluses.

Under current federal tax law, three provisions directly affect new business formation and business investment in R&D: (1) an expensing allowance for qualified research expenditures under Section 174 of the tax code, (2) a non-refundable tax credit for increases in qualified research expenditures above a base amount under Section 41, and (3) a partial exclusion for capital gains from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock held by the original investor for five or more years under Section 1202. ", "The credit and expensing allowance and tax credit encourage companies to invest more in qualified research than they otherwise would by lowering the after-tax cost of that research. Some analysts and lawmakers argue that the current credit's incentive effect is weaker than it should be.

Nevertheless, many observers argue that a general increase in STEM abilities among the U.S. workforce could benefit the nation's economy, defense, health, and welfare. On the other hand, some scholars oppose the use of education policy to increase the supply of STEM workers, either because they perceive such policies as overemphasizing the economic outcomes of education at the expense of other values (e.g., personal development or citizenship) or because they perceive the labor market as the more efficient lever in signaling demand for STEM skills.", "Analysts differ in their conclusions about the scope, scale, and emphasis of federal STEM education policy.

The FY2015 budget request sought to reduce the number of investments further, to 109 (totaling $2.920 billion).

However, the RFS has been under scrutiny for various reasons, including delayed issuance of final annual usage requirements by the EPA. These delays have created significant uncertainty for stakeholders, with the result that some of the advanced biofuel targets are not being met, and that some view the compliance system as not being transparent. An overarching issue is that the policy may require more biofuel to be produced than can be used given the existing motor fuel distribution infrastructure and the limited fleet of passenger vehicles that are built to run on higher percentage blends of biofuels.

", "Congress continues to be interested in the performance of NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey in building and operating U.S. Earth-observing satellites. Congress has been particularly interested in the agencies meeting budgets and time schedules so that critical space-based observations are not missed due to delays and cost overruns. Congressional scrutiny has focused recently on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS), designed to provide daily measurements from polar orbit that inform weather forecasts and storm predictions. JPSS has experienced delays and higher costs than originally projected. JPSS is currently scheduled to launch in 2017. A potential problem is the possibility of a gap in coverage from the polar-orbiting weather satellite system. The current system of polar-orbiting weather satellites includes the Suomi-NPP satellite\u2014now filling the operational gap until the JPSS spacecraft is operational. The Suomi-NPP mission only life extends to 2016; there is a risk that its instruments will fail before JPSS is launched, which will result in a gap in polar-orbiting weather satellite coverage. ", "On February 11, 2013, NASA launched Landsat 8, a remote sensing satellite jointly operated by the U.S. Geological Survey and NASA. Landsat 8 is the latest in a series of Earth-observing satellites that began on July 23, 1972, with the launch of Landsat 1. Landsat has been used in a wide variety of applications, including land use planning, agriculture, forestry, natural resources management, public safety, homeland security, climate research, and natural disaster management, among others. A question for Congress is, should there be a Landsat 9? More generally, should Congress support the development of another moderate resolution land-imaging satellite, and what are the alternatives?", "For Further Information", "[author name scrubbed], Specialist in Energy and Natural Resources Policy ( [email address scrubbed] , [phone number scrubbed])", "CRS Report R40594, Landsat: Overview and Issues for Congress , by [author name scrubbed]"], "subsections": []}]}]}}
