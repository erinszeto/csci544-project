The 4% of GDP Debate", "paragraphs": ["For several months leading up to action on the FY2009 defense funding legislation, a number of senior military officers, as well as research groups and advocacy organizations, argued that defense spending needs to be substantially higher in the next few years to avoid drastic cuts in major weapons programs or in the size of the force. Many have called for a baseline defense budget, not including war-related costs, pegged to about 4% of Gross Domestic Product\u2014an amount that would be anywhere from $70 to $180 billion per year higher over the next few years than the Administration plan.", "Senior leaders of the military services were particularly vocal in arguing for substantial increases in the defense budget. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Michael Mullen, has, for some time, urged 4% of GDP for defense. For the previous two years, the Chief of Staff and Secretary of the Air Force argued that the Air Force needs an average of $20 billion more each year for the next several years in weapons acquisition accounts. Senior Army officials pointed out that the Army budget, including war costs, has grown to over $230 billion. Though it may come down some, they say, if forces in Iraq and elsewhere are brought home, several more years of spending at near that level will be needed to repair, replace, and upgrade equipment consumed by the war-time pace of operations. For their part, Navy leaders now calculate that the long-term shipbuilding plan they have proposed for the past few years will, in the future, cost an average of $20 billion a year in FY2007 prices, an increase of about 40% over earlier estimates.", "These arguments for a substantial increase in the defense budget, however, come at a time when, by historical standards, military spending appears to be very robust. Between FY1998, when the post-Cold War decline in defense spending reached its zenith, and FY2008, the baseline Department of Defense budget, not including war costs, increased by almost 40% above inflation (see Table 6 ). After adjusting for inflation, the requested FY2009 baseline DOD budget was more than $100 billion, or about 20%, greater than the average during the Cold War (measured from the end of the Korean War in FY1954 through FY1990). Requested funding for weapons acquisition (procurement plus R&D) in FY2009 was more than $45 billion\u2014or about one-third\u2014higher than the annual Cold War average.", "The disconnection between the size of the budget and the appeals for more money appears even more striking when amounts that have been appropriated for war costs are added to the equation. On top of a baseline DOD budget that grew from $255 billion in FY1998, in current year prices not adjusted for inflation, to almost $520 billion in FY2008, supplemental appropriations for war-related costs climbed from $19.4 billion in FY2001, as an initial response to the 9/11 attacks, to $63 billion in FY2003, the year of the Iraq invasion, to an estimated $189 billion in FY2008. While large portions of the supplementals have been consumed by war-related operating costs, substantial amounts have also been devoted to buying new equipment, particularly for the Army and the Marine Corps. Although the bulk of this acquisition has been for force protection, communications, and transportation, the effect has been to modernize much of the basic equipment stock of both services, in effect augmenting their baseline budgets.", "The fact that so large a level of spending appears to the military services to be so inadequate has several explanations\u2014and the policy implications are, accordingly matters of varying interpretation. Reasons include the following.", "Future baseline budgets are widely expected to decline: The Administration plan to balance the federal budget by FY2012 includes limits on defense as well as non-defense spending. White House budget projections accommodate an increase of about 5% above inflation in the FY2009 DOD budget, but project a cumulative decline of about 3% between FY2009 and FY2012. Many unofficial projections of the deficit situation are less sanguine than the Administration's, so many analysts expect, at best, a flat baseline defense budget for the foreseeable future. Increased costs in part of the budget, therefore, will necessarily come at the expense of resources available in other areas. Supplemental appropriations are expected to decline as well: Although plans to withdraw from Iraq are uncertain, the military services expect that supplemental appropriations will come down within a few years. Costs for training and equipment maintenance that have been covered in supplementals, then, will migrate back into the baseline budget at the expense of other programs, and money to further upgrade ground forces will have to be found elsewhere. Costs of military personnel have grown dramatically in recent years: Since the end of the 1990s, Congress has approved substantial increases in military pay and benefits, including pay increases of \u00bd percent above civilian pay indices in seven of the past eight years, three rounds of \"pay table reform\" that gave larger raises to personnel in the middle grades, increased housing allowances to eliminate on-base and off-base disparities, DOD-provided health insurance for Medicare-eligible military retirees (known as \"TRICARE\" for Life), concurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans disability benefits that had earlier been offset, elimination of a reduction in retiree survivor benefits that had occurred at age 62, and large increases in enlistment and reenlistment bonuses and special pays. Although bonuses and some other payments may decline in the future, most of the past increases in pay and benefits have been built into the basic cost of personnel. CRS calculates that uniformed personnel now cost 40% more, after adjusting for inflation, than in FY1999. Operating costs continue to grow above base inflation: Historically, military operation and maintenance budgets, which pay for everything from personnel training, to weapons repairs, to facility operations, to health care, have increased relative to the size of the force by about 2.5% per year above inflation. These increases are not as large as in some areas of the civilian economy, such as health care, but they do not reflect gains in productivity that are common in other sectors of the economy. Continued growth in operating costs, which is now widely seen as a fact of life in defense planning, erodes the availability of resources for weapons modernization and other priorities. Increasing generational cost growth in major weapons programs: It is generally expected that new generations of weapons will be more expensive than the systems they replace as weapons technology advances. The rate of generational cost growth, however, is becoming a matter of increasing concern within the Defense Department. New stealthy aircraft, multi-mission ships, advanced space systems, and networked missiles, guns, and vehicles appear to be getting more expensive than their predecessors at a greater rate than in the past. Unless budgets increase more rapidly than costs, trade-offs between the costs of new weapons and the size of the force may be required. Poor cost estimates: The difficulties engendered by accelerating inter-generational weapons cost growth are exacerbated by poor cost estimation. The Government Accountability Office has documented frequent, substantial increases in costs of major defense systems compared to original development estimates. A side-effect of inaccurate cost projections is to exacerbate instability in the overall defense budget, which entails inefficient production rates for major weapons programs and increased costs due to changing production plans. New requirements based on the lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have led to very large increases in equipment requirements for ground forces, particularly for force protection, communications, and transportation. National Guard combat units that earlier were equipped with older systems cascaded from active units are now seen as part of the rotation base that require equally modern equipment. And full sets of current equipment are also expected to be available not only for next-to-deploy units, but also for units as they begin to reset from overseas rotations. A key lesson of the war is that what used to be called \"minor procurement\" for ground forces was substantially under-capitalized. A broader range of national security challenges: A common presumption before 9/11 was that forces trained and equipped for traditional conflicts between national armies would be able to cope with what were seen as less demanding other challenges such as stability operations. Now the view is that forces must be designed not only for traditional conflicts, but for insurgencies and other irregular wars, support of allies, threats of catastrophic attacks by non-state actors with weapons of mass destruction, and entirely new kinds of disruptive attacks on specific U.S. and allied vulnerabilities. The effect has been to broaden requirements without, necessarily, an attendant offsetting reduction in older force goals.", "When these factors are taken as a whole, it is not so surprising that military planners discover some shortfalls. But, for Congress, it may not be so obvious that the principle answer is simply to provide more money for defense. As a practical matter, the arguments for more money that senior military leaders have begun to lay out appear most likely to become matters of debate in Congress once the next Administration takes office. The next Secretary of Defense, and the 111 th Congress, may, very early on, face a contentious debate about defense resources.", "More money is one alternative. Other alternatives may include backing away from plans to add 92,000 active duty troops to the Army and Marine Corps; shifting resources among the military services to reflect new challenges rather than allocating them roughly the same proportions every year; reviewing requirements for expensive new technologies in view of the presence or absence of technologically peer or near peer competitors; and shifting resources from military responses to global threats toward non-military means of prevention. The defense budget environment, however, appears likely to be troubling enough that it will force some attention to these matters earlier in the term of the next President rather than much later."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Issues in the FY2009 Base Budget Request", "paragraphs": ["Following is a brief summary of some of the other issues that may emerge during congressional action on the FY2009 defense authorization and appropriations bills, based on congressional action in prior years and early debate surrounding the President's pending request."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Military Pay Raise", "paragraphs": ["The budget includes $2 billion to give military personnel a 3.4% pay raise effective January 1, 2009, an increase that would keep pace with the average increase in private-sector wages as measured by the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index (ECI), as required by law.

Highlights of Compromise Final Version of FY2009 Defense Appropriations in the FY2009 Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act (H.R. 2638)", "paragraphs": ["Neither the House nor the Senate ever held full committee markups of an FY2009 defense appropriations bill, neither committee issued a report on the bill, and neither chamber considered a bill on the floor and debated amendments. Instead, what is in effect a conference agreement on FY2009 defense appropriations, along with agreements on military construction/VA and homeland security appropriations, was considered as Division C of H.R. 2638 , the FY2009 Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance and Continuing Appropriations Act.", "In all, the FY2009 defense appropriations bill provides $477.6 billion in new appropriations for the Department of Defense and related agencies, which is $4.0 billion below the Administration request, and which, in turn, reflects the House and Senate Appropriations Committees' allocations of funds to the each chamber's defense subcommittees under Section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act (see below for a discussion of the annual budget resolution and Section 302 allocations).", "For most programs, the defense appropriations bill ultimately determines the level of funding Congress provides. The defense authorization bill recommends amounts to be appropriated, but, with few exceptions, the final amount of new budget authority actually made available is determined in appropriations bills. Appropriations bills may provide more or less than amounts in the authorization, may eliminate funds for programs approved in the authorization, and may provide funds for \"new start\" programs not approved in an authorization bill. The main exception is that defense authorization bills generally include statutory language that (1)\u00a0establishes end-strength levels for uniformed personnel in each of the military services and reserve components and (2) sets amounts for pay and benefits of uniformed personnel. The appropriations bills, therefore, do not usually determine the amount of a military pay raise, though they normally include funds for military personnel accounts based on pay rates, bonuses, benefits, and end-strength established in the annual defense authorization.", "On military personnel matters, the House-Senate agreement on the FY2009 defense appropriations bill provides funds for a 3.9% increase in base pay for uniformed personnel, reduces funding to reflect lower-than planned strength levels in some of the services, and establishes a new health professionals scholarship program. The bill also includes a general provision, Section 8116, that provides $72 million in FY2009 for a program to provide up to $500 per month in additional compensation to personnel kept on active duty beyond the end of their normal enlistment periods under a \"Stop Loss\" order. The provision does not, however, require that a specific amount be paid.", "On major weapon programs,", "The agreement provides $1.5 billion of the $2.5 billion requested for a third Navy destroyer of the DDG-1000 class. The House and Senate negotiators directed the Navy to use the funds as an initial increment of funding for the ship and to request the remaining $1 billion increment in the FY2010 budget. The agreement also requires the DOD Joint Requirements Oversight Council, comprised of Deputy Chiefs of the military services, to review the Navy's decision to reduce DDG-1000 acquisition and resume production of smaller DDG-51 destroyers. The measure eliminates $59 million in advance procurement for the DDG-1000 program and adds $200 million in advance procurement to preserve the option to build additional, DDG-51s. In effect, the bill keeps both the DDG-1000 and DDG-51 production lines open, for now, deferring a decision as to how to proceed. On other shipbuilding issues, the bill adds $830 million as the first half of split funding to procure an additional, 10 th of the class, LPD-17 amphibious ship; provides $1.02 billion, $100 million more than requested, for the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) program, rescinds $337 million in earlier LCS funding, and directs that funding be allocated to two ships with contract awards as soon as possible; cuts $170 million from the $348 million requested for a replacement for LHA class amphibious ships and shifts funds from the National Defense Sealift Fund (NDSF) to the Navy shipbuilding account, where the ability to reallocate funds is more constrained; and adds $79 million to the $1.3 billion requested in advance procurement for Virginia-class attack submarines in order to facilitate production of two boats per year beginning in FY2010. The agreement provides $6.3 billion, the amount requested, to the Navy and the Air Force for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, but trims procurement from 16 to 14 aircraft and allocates $430 million for alternate engine development\u2014a perennial congressional addition to the Administration request. The bill provides $2.9 billion, as requested, to purchase 20 Air Force F-22 fighters and adds $523 million for advance procurement of an additional 20 aircraft in future years. The additional amount is to keep the production line open and allow the next Administration to decide whether to purchase more than the 181 aircraft now planned. The bill shifts $62 million requested in procurement and $832 million requested in R&D for the KC-X tanker replacement program into an already established \"Tanker Replacement Fund,\" which is a no-year transfer account which sets no limit on the number of years for which funds remain available and from which funds can be shifted as needed to other accounts. The bill also rescinds $72 million in previously appropriated funds for the tanker program from Air Force R&D and $239.8 million from the Tanker Replacement Fund. The bill provides $3.6 billion for the Army's Future Combat System, adding $26 million to accelerate unmanned air and ground vehicle acquisition, and moving funds between programs to reflect recent Army adjustments to the program to accelerate near term elements. On satellite and other space programs, many of which have suffered long delays and large cost growth in recent years, the bill adds $150 million for a fourth, current-generation Advanced EHF communications satellite, cuts $75 million from the $843 million requested for the Transformational Communications Satellite (T-SAT) program, transfers $152 million into the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle program, and cuts $163.5 million from launch vehicle for a second Navy MUOS fleet communications satellite program to reflect delays. These are fewer changes than in past years, when the Space-Based Radar and T-SAT programs were often cut substantially. The imposition of fewer congressional cuts on space programs may reflect efforts by the services to be less technically ambitious in pursuing new space systems. The bill adds $750 million for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) programs, including $360 million for 24 C-21 aircraft equipped with sensor suites, $20 million for MQ-9 UAVs for special operations forces, and $13 million for additional medium UAVs. Secretary of Defense Gates has acknowledged disputes with the Air Force, in particular, in allocating sufficient ISR resources to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "On other matters", "The agreement provides $350 million, $150 million less than requested, for the \"Global Train and Equip\" program, originally established by Section 1206 of the FY2006 national defense authorization act (and still commonly referred to as Section 1206 authority). The Secretary of Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, may use Section 1206/Global Train and Equip funding to provide a wide range of security and other assistance to foreign nations. The joint explanatory statement accompanying the bill asserts bluntly that the State Department, rather than the Department of Defense should be responsible for training and equipping foreign military forces and that the Administration should request future funds in the State Department budget. The bill also trims $123 million from the $389 million requested in military personnel and operation and maintenance accounts for the newly established Africa Command (AFRICOM). The cut in AFRICOM funding reflects the same sentiment as the reduction in Global Train and Equip funding. While the AFRICOM reduction is not as steep as in the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee version of the bill, and the joint explanatory statement expresses support for AFRICOM, the statement also insists that the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) should \"play a more important role in this new organization supported with the appropriate manpower and funding required.\" The joint explanatory statement includes a critique of Air Force management of major acquisition programs, citing in particular recent numerous breaches of limits on cost growth under the Nunn-McCurdy amendment, a provision of law first enacted in 1981 (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2433) which requires notification of Congress when major acquisition programs exceed specific cost thresholds. The statement requires the Secretary of Defense to report by March 31, 2009, on steps to reform Air Force practices. The joint explanatory statement also cites inaccurate cost estimates in many other major programs and requires the Defense Department to report on which programs since 2004 did not use cost estimates by the independent DOD Cost Analysis Improvement Group (CAIG) and to explain why. The bill also directs the Defense Department to provide funding for the Acquisition Workforce Development Fund, established by the FY2008 defense authorization act, in the regular appropriations process."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}]}}
