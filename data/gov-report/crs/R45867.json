While the public health community generally views ENDS as a safer alternative for adult cigarette smokers, there is concern that increased use of ENDS among youth may undo the years of tobacco control efforts that have successfully reduced cigarette smoking among both youth and adults.

Public health stakeholders have been concerned about youth access to tobacco products more broadly and expressed support for raising the minimum age of access for tobacco products from 18 to 21 years of age.

The public health community generally views them as a harm reduction tool for adults who specifically smoke cigarettes. Harm reduction refers to the replacement of a more harmful activity with a less harmful one when elimination of the activity is difficult or infeasible. ENDS have the potential to reduce harm among adult cigarette smokers who have experienced difficulty quitting, as the aerosol from ENDS \"contains fewer numbers and lower levels of most toxicants than does smoke from combustible tobacco cigarettes.\" ", "Yet the data are complex regarding the effectiveness of ENDS as a harm reduction or cessation tool for adults who smoke cigarettes. As of early 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) concluded that \"there is general agreement that the number, size, and quality of studies for judging the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as cessation aids in comparison with cessation aids of proven efficacy are limited, and therefore there is insufficient evidence to permit a definitive conclusion at this time.\" Further, the long-term health effects associated with use of ENDS are still largely unknown, and FDA has not yet approved any ENDS products as cessation devices.

Research studies suggest that this change has occurred, in large part, as a result of access to flavored ENDS products. The availability of flavored ENDS products has created tension between industry and the public health community. Industry-funded research suggests that availability of flavored ENDS may be more appealing to adult cigarette smokers (in comparison to nonsmoking teens) and could help adult cigarette smokers quit cigarette smoking. Conversely, one systematic review of the literature found that both youth and adults enjoy flavors in e-cigarettes. However, the authors of this review stated that \"in terms of whether flavored e-cigarettes assisted [adults] quitting smoking, we found inconclusive evidence.\" In combination, numerous studies have documented that flavors entice youth to initiate and continue using tobacco products, including ENDS. Further, the NASEM concluded that there is substantial evidence that ENDS use among youth increases the risk of such youth ever using cigarettes, leading to concern that tobacco control efforts that have successfully reduced cigarette smoking among both youth and adults will be diminished.

For example, FDA would prioritize enforcement of distribution and sale requirements in retail locations where certain flavored ENDS products may be most accessible to youth, such as in convenience stores and gas stations that do not have adult-only sections. In September 2019, FDA announced that it would finalize this guidance document \"in the coming weeks,\" with the intention of clearing \"the market of flavored e-cigarettes to reverse the deeply concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette use.\" Delays in guidance finalization led to a Congressional hearing on December 4, 2019 to investigate the cause for delay. In January 2020, FDA released the final guidance document, with some changes compared to the draft guidance. Specifically, the March 2019 draft guidance focused enforcement of premarket authorization requirements based on how and where ENDS products are sold, while the final guidance focuses enforcement of premarket authorization requirements based on ENDS product characteristics (e.g., cartridge-based products).

FDA is also required to update its regulations by June 20, 2020 to reflect the new federal minimum age of tobacco purchasing, as well as the federal minimum age verification requirement (age verification required for individuals less than 30 years of age). The final rule is required to take effect by September 20, 2020. While public health stakeholders view this development in a positive light, some are concerned that the tobacco industry supported this initiative to avoid other measures that could also curb tobacco use\u00e2\u0080\u0094including ENDS use\u00e2\u0080\u0094among youth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Remote Sales", "paragraphs": ["Related to the issue of youth access to tobacco products\u00e2\u0080\u0094including ENDS\u00e2\u0080\u0094some have identified remote sales (i.e., non-face-to-face sales) as an opportunity for minors to illegally purchase tobacco products, due to difficulties in enforcing purchasing restrictions through this medium. While the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-154 ) placed certain restrictions on remote sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, it did not outright prohibit them.

As has been proposed previously, Congress may also consider amending the PACT Act to extend its provisions to other tobacco products beyond cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, such as ENDS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ENDS: User Fees", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned, FDA does not collect user fees from ENDS manufacturers and importers. Given recent concerns around ENDS products, CTP has dedicated a portion of its user fees paid by other tobacco product manufacturers and importers to address ENDS-specific issues. Therefore, some stakeholders have suggested that manufacturers and importers of ENDS products be subject to tobacco user fees to offset costs associated with FDA's current and future ENDS-specific activities. However, FDA has determined that it currently does not have the authority to assess user fees from ENDS manufacturers and importers because Congress did not specify an enumerated class for ENDS products and did not provide a framework by which FDA could potentially assess user fees for ENDS products. ", "Based on FDA's interpretation, in order for ENDS manufacturers to be subject to the tobacco product user fees, Congress would need to provide FDA with the statutory framework for doing so. For example, Congress may consider amending both the FETRA formula and Section 919 of the FFDCA. However, ENDS products are not currently subject to federal excise taxes, and such taxes are a critical component of the FETRA formula (see \" User Fees \"). Therefore, if Congress were to amend FETRA and the FFDCA to explicitly provide FDA the authority to assess user fees on ENDS manufacturers and importers, Congress would likely need to amend the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to make ENDS products subject to federal excise taxes. Another option for Congress may be to create a new, separate ENDS user fee program. ", "There has been recent congressional and executive branch interest in requiring ENDS manufacturers and importers to pay user fees. Legislation has been introduced in the 116 th Congress that would either amend the FFDCA's current user fee structure by striking the FETRA provisions to allow for assessment of ENDS user fees, or create a new, separate ENDS user fee program. The FY2021 President's budget request also proposes requiring ENDS manufacturers and importers (along with manufacturers and importers of certain other deemed products) to pay $100 million in user fees starting in FY2021. However, based on FDA's current interpretation, user fees could not be collected from ENDS manufacturers and importers without first enacting authorizing legislation.", "Appendix A. The IQOS Tobacco Heating System", "The IQOS Tobacco Heating System (IQOS) is commonly referred to as a \"heat-not-burn\" tobacco product. This new technology differs from ENDS technology because it aerosolizes the tobacco plant itself, rather than a tobacco-derived e-liquid. FDA has determined that the IQOS meets the definition of a cigarette and, as such, is subject to additional FFDCA requirements and regulations specific to cigarettes, such as advertising restrictions.", "The IQOS is composed of three main components: ", "The IQOS Heatstick is a filtered, noncombusted cigarette. A Heatstick is designed to be electrically heated to release nicotine-containing aerosol. The nicotine is derived from a reconstituted tobacco sheet made from ground tobacco powder. The IQOS Holder is an electrically powered and rechargeable unit that holds and warms the Heatstick. The Holder is used for a single Heatstick for about six to seven minutes, after which the Holder needs to be charged and the used Heatstick is discarded. The IQOS Charger recharges and cleans the Holder after each use. ", "Given the novel technology of the IQOS, some industry stakeholders see this product as a potential precedent for the premarket review process that ENDS products will eventually undergo. On May 15, 2017, FDA received PMTAs from Phillip Morris International (PMI) for the IQOS Tobacco Heating System (IQOS). PMI filed four PMTA applications for the IQOS. Three PMTA applications were for the Heatstick\u00e2\u0080\u0094two of which were for menthol flavored heatsticks\u00e2\u0080\u0094and one PMTA application was for the Holder and Charger. ", "Nearly two years later, on April 30, 2019, FDA authorized the IQOS Tobacco Heating System for marketing through these PMTAs. Based on the substantial back and forth between PMI and FDA to elicit the information needed for the complete PMTA applications, there is concern that small ENDS manufacturers may not have the resources to engage in the PMTA process in the future. There is also concern that FDA may need additional resources to accommodate the inevitable influx of lengthy ENDS PMTA applications.", "Appendix B.
