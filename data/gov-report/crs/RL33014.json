(171) However,the plaintiffs claimed that BLM should have either created a new EIS or a supplemental EIS (SEIS)to sufficiently address the cumulative environmental impacts of the existing wells combined withthe impacts of the newly approved wells. (172) Plaintiffs asserted that new information shedding light on theenvironmental impacts of CBM development had become available since the issuance of the originaldocuments. (173) Plaintiffs also argued that BLM had violated FLPMA by approving CBM development that allegedlydid not conform to the RMP. (174) The defendants moved to dismiss, and the United StatesDistrict Court for the District of Colorado denied the motion. (175) ", "Several IBLA decisions also address similar issues. In the 2003 matter of Wyoming OutdoorCouncil , the IBLA ruled that BLM had not taken the NEPA-mandated \"hard look\" at water qualityissues associated with CBM development in one area. (176) The IBLA found the BLM's water quality analysis to beinadequate because it was based on only one CBM well sample and neither of BLM's EAs addressed\"any deleterious impact of CBM discharge water due to its chemical composition.\" (177) The IBLA also foundthat BLM should have considered the cumulative environmental impacts of the new wells combinedwith some nearby wells that met \"the geographical proximity test for inclusion in a cumulativeimpacts analysis.\" (178) ", "In the 2004 matter of Western Slope Environmental Resource Council , the IBLA stated:", "[T]he appropriate time for considering the potentialimpacts of oil and gas exploration and development is when BLM proposes to lease public lands foroil and gas purposes because leasing, at least without [no surface occupancy stipulations], constitutesan irreversible and irretrievable commitment to permit surface-disturbing activity. (179)", "The IBLA went on to hold that the appellants had not proven that the environmental impacts of CBMdevelopment in the disputed area would be different from the impacts of conventional oil and gasdevelopment. (180) Even though the unique environmental impacts of CBM had been recognized in some cases, theIBLA emphasized that the appellants had not met their burden of proof in this particular case. (181) Evidence indicatedthat the disputed coalbeds were located far beneath the surface and that there was a \"lack oftransmissivity of the coal.\" (182) According to the IBLA, this evidence suggested that CBMextraction in this area would not produce a large amount of water, thus limiting the environmentalimpacts that would occur.
