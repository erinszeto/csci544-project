Rehnquist, whodefended it as a means of improving compensation for lifetime federal judges. However, the Senate committeelanguageto lift the ban generated controversy, with various news media editorials and some Senators and House Membersspeakingout in opposition. Their criticisms included the view that allowing honoraria for judges could lessen publicconfidence injudges (particularly if they were perceived as accepting money from special interests), that it would raise anothercontroversial issue--of whether Congress should lift the ban (which also had been in place since 1989) on its ownMembers receiving honoraria, and that a more appropriate means of increasing judicial income, if called for, wouldbe byraising judges' salaries.
