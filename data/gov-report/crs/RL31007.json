The Senate approved an increase of $47.0 million above the request for BER. Onenew initiative is being proposed this year, theGenomes-to-Life project, within BER, that follows from the human genome sequencing project. The new projectwould make use of DOE computational andadvanced imaging capabilities to examine the behavior of proteins encoded by DNA, and to build computer modelsof cellular behavior. The House-passed billwould fully fund this project. The Senate approved a $10 million increase over the request for this initiative.

The Senate approved funding to meet the full request for these centers andexpressed its strong support for the program. The finalbill included $3 million to begin engineering and design for these three nanoscience centers. DOE also requestedlevel funding for the advanced scientificcomputing and networking initiative, announced last year, that are housed in the Advanced Scientific ComputingResearch (ASCR) program. The House andSenate bill provided the full request for the Advanced Scientific Computing program. The final bill, however,reduced this amount by $5 million below therequest.

Its central goalis to maintain the safety and reliability of the U.S.nuclear stockpile without nuclear testing. In a 1994 statement that is still in effect, the Department of Defense, asthe customer of DOE's nuclear weapons, did notrequire DOE to undertake \"new-design nuclear warhead production,\" but required DOE to \"[d]emonstrate capabilityto refabricate and certify weapon types in[the] enduring stockpile\" and \"[m]aintain capability to design, fabricate, and certify new warheads.\"", "Stockpile stewardship consists of all activities in NNSA's Weapons Activities program, for which $5,300.0 million was requested and $5,429.2 million wasappropriated for FY2002, compared to $5,006.2 million appropriated for FY2001.

FY2002 activities include refurbishment of the W87 warhead forthe MX (Peacekeeper) missile, developmentengineering to modify the fins on certain B61 bombs, studies to examine aging of the secondary stage(thermonuclear component) of other B61 bombs, a study onlife extension and upgrades to the W80 cruise missile warhead, and engineering on the W76 warhead for Trident missiles to extend the warhead's life, upgradecertain components, and refurbish elements of the nuclear explosive package. Conferees expressed concern thatthe Administration's Nuclear Posture Review,which was nearing completion when the conference bill was passed, could result in funds spent by NNSA in earlyFY2002 being \"wasted effort.\" Accordingly,the conferees instructed NNSA to minimize use of FY2002 Weapons Activities funds for \"weapon-uniqueinvestments.\" They expressed particular concern aboutrefurbishing the W80 warhead given that DOD had not budgeted any funds to extend the life of the air-launchedcruise missile, which carries the W80, andaccordingly required advance approval by the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees for using FY2002funds for long-term life extension of thatwarhead.", "Campaigns.

Pits are the fissile cores of nuclear warheads that trigger thethermonuclear secondary stage. The UnitedStates has been unable to produce pits for use in stockpiled weapons since 1989, when DOE suspended pitproduction at Rocky Flats Plant (CO). As a result, theUnited States has been unable to make all-new nuclear warheads of existing or advanced new designs. Thecampaign supports two pit projects: installation of alow-capacity pit production facility, and supporting R&D, at Los Alamos National Laboratory; and planningfor a higher-capacity pit facility. R&D, procurement,and construction costs for the two projects might total some $5 billion over two decades. The appropriated amountincludes $213.0 million, which NNSA toldCongress in September 2001 was the projected FY2002 cost for the program; $2.0 million for pit activities notspecifically supporting the W88 warhead for theTrident II missile; and $4.0 million for preconceptual design activities for the higher-capacity pit facility.", "In earlier action on this issue, the House Appropriations Committee recommended the requested amount for FY2002, but asserted that DOE cannot show \"that ithas a viable plan to manufacture and certify pits on the schedule dictated by national security needs,\" criticized theproject as \"years behind schedule and hundredsof millions of dollars over the original cost estimate,\" and stated that it will judge NNSA's success on how well thepit project succeeds. The SenateAppropriations Committee recommended increasing funding by $109.2 million to $237.7 million.

On the otherhand, industry critics have raised concerns that NRC's new procedures may result in relaxed safety oversight.", "For most of the past decade, NRC's budget has been offset 100% by fees on nuclear power plants and other licensed activities, including the DOE nuclear wasteprogram. The nuclear power industry had long contended that the fee structure required nuclear reactor owners topay for a number of NRC programs, such asforeign nuclear safety efforts, from which they did not directly benefit. To account for that concern, the FY2001Energy and Water Appropriations Bill includedan NRC proposal to phase down the agency's fee recovery to 90% during the subsequent 5 years - two percentagepoints per year. As a result, 96% of theFY2002 NRC appropriation - minus $23.7 million transferred from the Nuclear Waste Fund to pay for licensingactivities involving the proposed YuccaMountain, Nevada, nuclear waste repository - is to be offset by fees on licensees. However, the bill approved bythe Senate would have required that fees coveronly half of the $10 million added to the NRC request to pay for reviews of new licenses, permits, and certifications. The Energy and Water Conferees did not goalong with the Senate position, so the enacted bill requires that fees recover 96% of the additional $10 million, aswith the rest of the NRC budget."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "For Additional Reading", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CRS Issue Briefs", "paragraphs": ["CRS Issue Brief IB88090.
