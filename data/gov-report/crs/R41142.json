Although state and local governments are traditionally responsible for the majority of facilities in public K-12 schools and postsecondary institutions, the federal government also provides some direct and indirect support for school infrastructure.

For example, there are grant programs for schools with a high population of students who are Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, Indians, children of military parents, individuals with disabilities, or deaf. Funding is also available to schools affected by natural disasters or located in rural areas. And there are programs to encourage the development of charter schools.

Bonds issued for certain purposes are tax-exempt because the interest payments are not included in the bondholder's (purchaser's) federal taxable income. This exemption allows these bonds to be issued at lower interest rates but still provide competitive returns. State and local governments may also issue tax credit bonds, which allow the holder to claim a federal tax credit equal to a percentage of the bond's par value (face value) for a limited number of years. Meanwhile, issuers of tax credit bonds typically pay no interest to bondholders.

Impact Aid programs were enacted under P.L. 81-815, P.L. 81-874, and P.L. 81-875 to fund school construction in federally affected areas, areas affected by federal activities, and facilities damaged by major disasters. From FY1989 through FY2001, in response to Supreme Court rulings regarding the provision of equitable services to private school students, local educational agencies (LEAs) received federal assistance for capital expenses, including mobile educational units (20 U.S.C. \u00a77279 et seq.).", "Attempts to increase federal assistance for needed improvements to school infrastructure continued in the 1990s. The Education Infrastructure Act of 1994 was enacted as Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act by the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-382 ) to provide direct federal assistance for the renovation and construction of public elementary and secondary schools, among other things.

A revolving loan fund was established to make higher education academic facilities loans by P.L. 89-429.

The programs were intended to increase the enrollment capacity of institutions of higher education (IHEs). If, within 20 years of its completion, an academic facility constructed with funds from the grant program for undergraduate academic facilities or for graduate academic facilities ceased to be controlled by a public or nonprofit institution or ceased to be used as an academic facility, the federal government is required to recover a proportionate share of the grant.

The Higher Education Amendments of 1986 also authorized the establishment of the College Construction Loan Insurance Association (also known as Connie Lee) as a private, for-profit corporation. Connie Lee succeeded the Academic Facilities Loan Insurance program. The function of Connie Lee was to", "guarantee, insure, and reinsure bonds, debentures, notes, evidences of debt, loans, and interests therein, the proceeds of which were to be used for an education facilities purpose; guarantee and insure leases of personal, real, or mixed property to be used for an education facilities purpose; and issue letters of credit and undertake obligations and commitments as Connie Lee deemed necessary.", "Congress was concerned that deteriorating facilities would affect the quality of higher education and that financially sound postsecondary institutions whose debt was not investment grade did not have the necessary access to long-term capital. Both the U.S. Department of Education and the Student Loan Marketing Association (also known as Sallie Mae) became significant shareholders of Connie Lee. The 1986 Amendments also authorized Sallie Mae (20 U.S.C. \u00a71087-2) to directly or indirectly finance higher education academic facilities. Connie Lee and Sallie Mae were eventually privatized under the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997 ( P.L. 104-208 ). There were several explanations for privatizing Connie Lee:", "The federal government's share in Connie Lee was declining. Other investors and insurers were providing loans for higher education facilities as a result of the federal government's success. The statutory language authorizing Connie Lee prevented it from expanding its market. General federal policy encouraged the downsizing and privatizing of previous government operations, as appropriate. Partial federal ownership of Connie Lee provided the impression that the federal government would be liable in case of Connie Lee's financial difficulties.", "In the late 1980s, the Administration also requested no new monies for the higher education facilities programs except what would be necessary to service previous obligations. The reasons given were that federal support of higher education facilities was inappropriate; the programs displaced the traditional role of state and local governments and private enterprise; the programs were duplicative and complicated; and the programs were too costly. Academic Facilities Construction Grants were last funded in FY1986.
