While the CWA sought initially to provide states with technical assistance, it has been amended several times to accomplish other goals. In 1956, Congress adopted legislation (P.L. 84-660) that created the Construction Grants Program, which provided grants directly to local governments for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants. Subsequent amendments expanded the grants program in order to aid communities in meeting the goals and performance requirements of the act. In addition, amendments adopted in 1972 require construction contractors to pay at least locally prevailing wages on projects \"for which grants are made\" under the CWA. This requirement is included in Section 513 of the CWA.", "In 1987, Congress again amended the CWA ( P.L. 100-4 ) to phase out the Construction Grants Program and establish the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Program. Under the loan program, Congress appropriates funds to states for capitalization grants. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allocates the funds to the states based on a formula included in the CWA. States provide a matching amount equal to 20% of the capitalization grants they receive from the program. The states then make loans or provide other financial assistance to local governments for the construction of wastewater treatment facilities. As local governments repay the loans to states, the states loan the money to other local governments\u2014hence, the revolving nature of the program.", "The 1987 amendments also added Section 602(b)(6) to the CWA.

Although Congress has not updated the section of the CWA that authorizes appropriations for the SRFs, it has appropriated funds for capitalization grants each fiscal year since 1994.", "After FY1994, questions arose over whether the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirements also expired. In 1995, EPA issued a memorandum in which it said that projects that began construction after the end of FY1994 did not have to comply with the requirements of Section 602(b)(6). The Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL-CIO disagreed with EPA's interpretation of the law. The BCTD argued that Davis-Bacon coverage applied to projects funded by the SRFs as long as Congress continued to appropriate funds for the program. The BCTD asked DOL to rule that Davis-Bacon requirements continued to apply to projects that began after FY1994 and were funded with assistance from the SRFs.", "In June 2000, EPA and the BCTD proposed a settlement agreement that would require states to ensure that prevailing wages were paid for work performed on projects funded through the SRF program \"for as long as grants are awarded to the states.\" EPA indicated that it was \"persuaded of the appropriateness of the view that CWA section 513 imposes a continuing, independent obligation on the Agency to ensure that Davis-Bacon Act requirements apply to the grants made under the CWA for treatment works, including capitalization grants.\" Under the agreement, the BCTD would also agree to avoid further legal action before DOL or any other federal agency.", "The final settlement agreement between EPA and the BCTD appeared in the Federal Register in January 2001. The agreement was to take effect in July 2001.

It was reported in September 2001 that EPA was delaying implementation of the settlement agreement until October 1, 2001. It does not appear that the settlement agreement was ever implemented.
