Congress faces important questions about what sort of relationship the United States should have with China and how the United States should respond to China's \"rise.\" After more than 30 years of fast-paced economic growth, China's economy is now the second-largest in the world after that of the United States. With economic success, China has developed significant global strategic clout. It is also engaged in an ambitious military modernization drive, including development of extended-range power projection capabilities. At home, it continues to suppress all perceived challenges to the Communist Party's monopoly on power.", "In previous eras, the rise of new powers has often produced conflict. China's new leader Xi Jinping has pressed hard for a U.S. commitment to a \"new model of major country relationship\" with the United States that seeks to avoid such an outcome. The Obama Administration has repeatedly assured Beijing that the United States \"welcomes a strong, prosperous and successful China that plays a greater role in world affairs,\" and that the United States does not seek to prevent China's re-emergence as a great power. China, for its part, has pledged to follow \"the path of peaceful development.\" Washington has wrestled, however, with how to engage China on issues affecting stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Issues of concern for Washington include the intentions behind China's military modernization program, China's use of its paramilitary forces and military in disputes with its neighbors over territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea, and its continuing threat to use force to bring Taiwan under its control. With U.S.-China military-to-military ties improving but still fragile, Washington has struggled to convince Beijing that the U.S. policy of rebalancing toward the Asia Pacific is not intended to contain China. The two countries have cooperated, with mixed results, to address nuclear proliferation concerns related to Iran and North Korea.", "While working with China to revive the global economy, the United States has also wrestled with how to persuade China to address economic policies the United States sees as denying a level playing field to U.S. firms trading with and operating in China. High on the U.S. agenda is commercial cyber espionage that the U.S. government says appears to be directly attributable to official Chinese actors. Other economic concerns for the United States include China's apparent backsliding on its World Trade Organization commitments, its weak protections for intellectual property rights, and its currency policy. In recent months, the United States has strengthened cooperation with China on efforts to combat climate change, while continuing to work with China on the development of clean energy technologies. Human rights remains one of the thorniest areas of the relationship, with the United States pressing China to ease restrictions on freedom of speech, internet freedom, religious expression, and ethnic minorities, and China's leaders suspicious that the United States' real goal is to end Communist Party rule.", "This report opens with an overview of the U.S.-China relationship, recent developments in the relationship, Obama Administration policy toward China, and a summary of legislation related to China in the 113th Congress. The report then reviews major policy issues in the relationship. Throughout, the report directs the reader to other CRS reports for more detailed information about individual topics. This report will be updated periodically. A detailed summary of 113th and 112th Congress legislative provisions related to China is provided in appendices."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of U.S.-China Relations", "paragraphs": ["As China's economic and strategic clout has grown over the last three decades, the United States' relationship with China has expanded to encompass a broad range of global, regional, and bilateral issues. With China's economy now the second largest in the world, Washington seeks Beijing's cooperation in rebalancing the global economy and sustaining global growth. It hopes that China, a fellow permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, will help block the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea and assist in resolving the crisis in Syria. The United States also seeks to encourage China to contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific, including in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea. With the United States focused on restoring its economic strength, Washington is seeking to achieve a so-called level playing field for U.S. firms that trade with and operate in China; to address cyber intrusions allegedly originating from China that target commercial and military secrets; and to stem violations of U.S. intellectual property rights in China. With the United States and China now the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, Washington seeks Beijing's cooperation in addressing climate change. Finally, while engaging with China's authoritarian Communist government, the United States also seeks to promote human rights and the rule of law in China, including in the ethnic minority regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. ", "Hanging over the relationship is the larger question of whether, as China grows in economic and military power, the United States and China can manage their relationship in such a way as to avoid debilitating rivalry and conflict that have accompanied the rise of new powers in previous eras. On a visit to the United States in February 2012, Xi Jinping, who became China's top leader later in the year, said he had reached a consensus with President Obama and Vice President Biden that the two countries would establish a \"new path of cooperative partnership between major countries featuring harmonious coexistence, sound interactions and win-win cooperation.\" Some principles for this \"new model\" of U.S.-China relationship are already in place. The Obama Administration has repeatedly assured China that it \"welcomes a strong, prosperous and successful China that plays a greater role in world affairs,\" and China has stated that it \"welcomes the United States as an Asia-Pacific nation that contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.\" But building a relationship that avoids rivalry and conflict remains a work in progress. Many observers in both Washington and Beijing note deep mistrust on both sides of the U.S.-China relationship. They note, too, that even as the United States talks of a \"new model of cooperation\" with China, it is simultaneously implementing a strategic rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific designed, in part, to reassure Asian nations concerned about the strategic implications of China's growing power in the region. (See \" Forging a \"New Model of Cooperation\" and \" The Policy of Strategic Rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific \" below.)", "Xi and his Chinese leadership colleagues assumed their Communist Party posts at the Party's 18 th Congress in November 2012, and added other posts, in Xi's case the state presidency, at the opening session of the 12 th National People's Congress in March 2013. Xi is expected to serve as president for two five-year terms, until 2023. In their early months in office, Xi and his colleagues have signaled a strong desire to strengthen the U.S.-China relationship. Xi quickly accepted President Obama's invitation to the June 2013 presidential summit, which offered the opportunity for extended conversation but none of the pomp and circumstance that Chinese leaders have often demanded for their visits to the United States. China's new leaders have shown greater willingness to pressure North Korea over its nuclear program. They have agreed to enter into a phase of \"substantive\" negotiations with the United States over a bilateral investment treaty, dropping some conditions that had stalled negotiations in the past. With the U.S. government charging that cyber intrusions into U.S. government and private networks are attributable to official Chinese actors, they agreed to establish a high-level working group on cybersecurity. They have also committed China's military to an ambitious schedule of high-level exchanges and modest operational cooperation with the United States military. China has agreed to work with the United States to combat global climate change by reducing the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and signed on to a significant joint statement on climate change. ", "Nonetheless, the U.S.-China relationship remains dogged by long-standing mutual mistrust. That mistrust stems in part from the two countries' very different political systems. Many in the United States are uncomfortable with China's authoritarian system of government and sometimes brutal suppression of dissent and see continued Communist Party rule in a post-Cold War world as an anachronism. Some in China believe that when the United States presses China to ease restrictions on freedom of speech and internet freedom, improve its treatment of religious practitioners and ethnic minorities, and respect the legal rights of its citizens, the United States' real goal is to destabilize China and push the Communist Party from power.", "Although the U.S. and Chinese economies are heavily interdependent, with two-way trade of $536 billion in 2012, the two countries' different economic models have contributed to mistrust. The state plays a major role in the Chinese economy and state-owned corporations dominate the ranks of China's biggest businesses. Unlike the U.S. economy, China's economy has also in recent decades depended heavily on exports and investment, rather than consumption, for growth. Points of contention in the bilateral economic relationship include the United States' allegations of Chinese cyberespionage targeting U.S. corporations and government agencies, the related issue of China's inability or unwillingness to prevent violations of foreign intellectual property by Chinese entities, Chinese policies that appear to discriminate against foreign firms, and China's currency policy. For their part, PRC officials have criticized the United States for its high levels of consumption, long-term debt, expansionary monetary policy, and alleged barriers to Chinese investment in the United States.", "Mistrust is particularly pronounced on security matters. The U.S. government sees China's military modernization as aimed, in part, at constraining the U.S. military's freedom of movement in Asia and deterring U.S. intervention in the event of Chinese use of force against Taiwan. An immediate concern is that China's use of coercion in disputes with its neighbors over territory in the East China Sea and the South China Sea could undermine the stability upon which the prosperity of the region depends. For their part, some in China's government have been unnerved by the late 2011 announcement of a U.S. policy of strategic rebalancing toward Asia, seeing it as emboldening China's rivals in territorial disputes and seeking to constrain the activities of the Chinese military. The most long-standing source of grievance for China on the security side of the bilateral relationship is U.S. policy toward Taiwan, which many in China see as intended to thwart the PRC's unification with Taiwan, a cherished PRC goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Developments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "June 7-8, 2013: The Presidential Summit in Rancho Mirage, CA", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, President Obama and China's President Xi met June 7-8, 2013, for an unusual informal-style summit at the Sunnylands Estate in Rancho Mirage, CA. It was their first face-to-face meeting since Xi took office as General Secretary of China's Communist Party in November 2012 and as State President in March 2013. Without the rapidly arranged summit, the two presidents would not have been scheduled to meet until the G-20 meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, in September 2013. The two men held nearly eight hours of discussions over the two days, a length of time that allowed them to explore a wide range of topics. For the Obama Administration, one highlight of the meeting was what then-National Security Advisor Tom Donilon described as \"quite a bit of alignment\" in the two leaders' positions on North Korea's nuclear program. After the summit, Donilon also reported that China now \"acknowledged\" U.S. concerns about what Donilon termed \"cyber-enabled economic theft\" by entities in China.

The United States government subsequently requested that the Hong Kong government arrest Snowden. According to White House spokesman Jay Carney, Hong Kong authorities acknowledged receipt of the U.S. request on June 17, 2013, and then, on June 21, 2013, requested additional information about the U.S. charges. While the U.S. government was \"in the process of responding\" to the request for additional information, and after the United States government had informed Hong Kong that it had revoked Snowden's U.S. passport, according to Carney, Hong Kong authorities on June 23, 2013, allowed Snowden to board a commercial flight to Moscow, apparently honoring a temporary travel pass provided to Snowden by the consul at the Embassy of Ecuador in London.", "Carney indicated that the White House believed the Chinese central government in Beijing was involved in the decision to allow Snowden to leave Hong Kong. \"[W]e are just not buying that this was a technical decision by a Hong Kong immigration official,\" Carney told reporters. \"This was a deliberate choice by the government to release a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant, and that decision unquestionably has a negative impact on the U.S.-China relationship.\" A series of Administration officials have since professed themselves \"disappointed\" by China's handling of the case.\" According to Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, \"The Hong Kong SAR government has handled the Snowden case in accordance with law, and its approach is beyond reproach.\"", "For more information, see CRS Report R43134, NSA Surveillance Leaks: Background and Issues for Congress , by Marshall Curtis Erwin and [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "July 10-11, 2013: The 5th Round of the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue", "paragraphs": ["The fifth round of the two countries' premier dialogue mechanism, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), took place in Washington, DC, on July 10 and 11, 2013.

", "At the same time, the Administration's China policy has focused on ways to ensure that China's rise is, indeed, peaceful, and that it does not undermine the stability of the world's most economically dynamic region or the integrity of the international system. The Administration has sought to encourage China to abide by international norms, in part through engagement in multilateral fora. At the same time, the Administration has stepped up its engagement in Asia as part of its policy of strategic rebalancing, seeking to \"give comfort to countries uncertain about the impact of China's rise and provide important balance and leadership,\" in the words of a former senior Obama Administration official. The Administration has stated that human rights is a priority in the relationship, but some observers believe that U.S. government advocacy on rights issues has taken a back seat to the focus on trying to shape Chinese behavior in the economic, security, and environmental arenas. ", "Recognizing that China is more than the Chinese Communist Party and the government bureaucracy, the Administration has expanded its public diplomacy, particularly its electronic outreach, in order to engage more directly with the Chinese public. It has also overhauled its visa processing services, to facilitate more travel to the United States by Chinese officials and the Chinese public alike.

", "The military component of the Administration's rebalancing strategy was outlined in a January 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance. The Guidance described plans to strengthen U.S. treaty alliances in the region\u2014with Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand\u2014and to expand cooperation with \"emerging partners\" in order to \"ensure collective capability and capacity for securing common interests.\" The Guidance specifically stated that the United States was \"investing in a long-term strategic partnership with India\"\u2014a country with which China fought a war in 1962 and with which China continues to have territorial disputes and a wary relationship\u2014\"to support its ability to serve as a regional economic anchor and provider of security in the broader Indian Ocean region.\" In a paragraph related to China, the document pledged that the United States would work with its allies and partners \"to promote a rules-based international order that ensures underlying stability and encourages the peaceful rise of new powers, economic dynamism, and constructive defense cooperation.\" Chinese commentators quickly noted that the document grouped China and Iran together as countries that \"will continue to pursue asymmetric means to counter our power projection capabilities.... \"", "Under the rebalancing policy, the Administration has announced a series of moves including new troop rotations to Australia, naval deployments in Singapore, and military engagements with the Philippines; stepped up its engagement with regional multilateral institutions; expanded relations with such \"emerging powers\" as India, Indonesia, and Vietnam; pursued a new relationship with Burma; and pushed to expand free trade with Asian nations through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Confirming the Administration's continued commitment to the rebalancing at the start of President Obama's second term, then-National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon stated in November 2012 that the vision for Asia driving the rebalancing strategy was for a region \"where the rise of new powers occurs peacefully, [where] the freedom to access the sea, air, space, and cyberspace empowers vibrant commerce, where multinational forums help promote shared values, and where citizens increasingly have the ability to influence their governments, and universal human rights are upheld.... \" ", "A common criticism of the rebalancing policy is that it may be unnecessarily antagonizing China while leading U.S. allies and partners\u2014among them the Philippines, Japan, and Vietnam\u2014to believe that they have more U.S. support in their disputes with China than the United States is actually prepared to offer. Those who subscribe to this criticism believe that the rebalancing is over-focused on military elements and may be eroding already limited U.S.-China strategic trust and feeding regional instability, rather than minimizing it. Other critics suggest that the military side of the rebalancing may be insufficiently robust, resulting in a U.S. policy that is the equivalent of \"speak loudly and carry a shrinking stick.\" (For discussion of China's reaction to the rebalance, see below, \" China's Reaction to U.S. Strategic Rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific \".)", "For more information, see CRS Report R42448, Pivot to the Pacific?

The desire for such a commitment appears to reflect President Xi's concern that facing myriad challenges at home, including a slowing economy and dangerously high levels of local government debt, China cannot afford debilitating rivalry with the United States. Talk of the \"new model\" relationship has come to dominate Chinese discourse about the relationship with the United States, with Chinese elites deriving reassurance about U.S. intentions from reported high-level U.S. agreement on the concept. The \"new model\" language is less prominent in U.S. discourse about the relationship with China, with senior U.S. officials sometimes portraying the concept as a Chinese proposal about which the United States still has questions, creating a potentially significant gap in expectations.", "As noted above, on a visit to the United States as vice president in February 2012, Xi reported that he had reached \"important consensus\" with his hosts, President Obama and Vice President Biden, that the two countries should \"open a new path of cooperative partnership between major countries featuring harmonious coexistence, sound interactions and win-win cooperation.\" Following his summit meeting with President Obama in June 2013, Xi re-stated the concept, saying that, \"China and the United States must find a new path\u2014one that is different from the inevitable confrontation and conflict between the major countries of the past. And that is to say the two sides must work together to build a new model of major country relationship based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation.\" President Obama used language that seemed to echo Xi's before the start of the June 2013 summit, when he said that he saw the meeting as an opportunity to discuss \"how we can forge a new model of cooperation between countries based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\" Senior Chinese officials described the two presidents as having \"reached an important agreement\" at the summit to work toward the new model of relationship, and asserted that this reported agreement has \"charted the course\" for the future of the relationship. ", "While both countries share a goal of a relationship that avoids conflict, U.S. officials have so far offered only general principles as a guide to forging such a relationship. Fielding a question about the concept during a background briefing before the June 2013 presidential summit, one senior Obama Administration official suggested that the key would be having \"the ability to work well in some areas even when we're in competition or have strong differences in other areas.\" The official cited the example of recent \"constructive cooperation\" with China on North Korea at the same time as the United States was raising concerns with China about official Chinese actors' alleged involvement in cyber-enabled theft of U.S. commercial information. Another senior Administration official, speaking on background during the same briefing, suggested that forging such a relationship would require having \"bilateral mechanisms\" in place to allow the two countries \"to deal with the greatest sources of instability and competition that could take this relationship down the pathway toward rivalry.\"", "For China, the new model of relationship involves more specific commitments. According to China's top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, at the June 2013 summit, President Xi summed up the meaning of the new model of relationship for President Obama in three sentences: \"seek no conflicts and no confrontation,\" \"have respect for each other,\" and \"conduct cooperation for win-win results.\" Yang explained that \"have respect for each other\" meant that the two countries should \"respect each other's social system and development road, respect each other's core interests and significant concerns, and make common progress through seeking common points while reserving differences.\" ", "Acquiescing to China's demand for \"respect\" on those terms would require a major reorientation of U.S. policy. China routinely uses the language of \"social system and development road\" to refer to Chinese Communist Party rule. China's demand for such respect would thus need to be reconciled with the United States' longstanding commitment to democracy promotion and universal human rights. China has defined its \"core interests,\" meanwhile, to include not just maintaining Communist Party rule, but also safeguarding China's \"sovereignty and security, territorial integrity, and national unity,\" and sustaining China's economic and social development. Sovereignty, China has made clear, refers not just to the People's Republic of China's sovereignty over the mainland China, but also the PRC's claims to sovereignty over Taiwan and disputed maritime territories in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. China's quest for U.S. respect for its core interests thus potentially challenges:", "U.S. commitments to Taiwan as described in the Taiwan Relations Act ( P.L. 96-8 ); the U.S. security treaty commitment to ally Japan over islets in the East China Sea whose sovereignty is disputed among Japan, China, and Taiwan; U.S. support for treaty ally the Philippines, which is involved in territorial disputes with China; and, in the case of Chinese use of force to assert its sovereignty claims, the U.S. \"national interest\" in peace and stability, respect for international law, freedom of navigation, and unimpeded lawful commerce in the South China Sea, where China is involved in territorial disputes with multiple countries. ", "Finally, China frequently uses the term \"national unity\" in the context of Tibetan areas of China and the Xinjiang region in China's northwest. In seeking respect for China's core interests, including safeguarding national unity, China may hope, therefore, that the U.S. government will refrain from speaking out about conditions in Tibet and Xinjiang, and foreswear meetings with Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, whom China accuses of advocating for Tibetan independence.

In the first term of the Obama Administration alone, President Obama and his then-counterpart, Chinese President Hu Jintao, met 12 times. The greater frequency of meetings is related in large part to expanded opportunities to meet on the sidelines of multilateral meetings. At one time, the only multilateral meetings regularly attended by the leaders of both countries were annual meetings of the United Nations General Assembly and, starting in 1993, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meetings. Today, the two countries' leaders also meet at G-20 summits, nuclear security summits, and since 2012, at East Asia Summits. Exchanges of visits also happen with more frequency now than in the past.

To broaden interaction to the sub-national level, the U.S. and Chinese governments in 2011 instituted a U.S.-China Governors Forum , intended to help deepen relationships between U.S. governors and Chinese provincial officials, and an Initiative on City-Level Economic Cooperation , bringing together U.S. mayors and Chinese mayors and Party Secretaries.

Security Council and have worked together successfully in that setting to pass sanctions targeting North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs, although China has also blocked some proposed Security Council actions sought by the United States, most notably a series of actions related to Syria. The Obama Administration elevated the profile of the G-20 grouping of major economies in part to have a vibrant multilateral forum for engaging with China on economic issues. In addition, the United States has sought to resolve trade disputes with China through the rules-based mechanisms of the World Trade Organization, and engaged with China on climate change through meetings of parties to the U.N.

At $114 billion, China's officially announced budget for 2013 represents an increase of 10.7% over 2012.

Chinese officials have also stated that China has neither the desire nor the capability to challenge the United States position in Asia. In comments following his summit meeting with President Obama in June 2013, President Xi Jinping pledged that, \"China will be firmly committed to the path of peaceful development.\" He also reiterated China's acceptance of the United States presence in Asia, observing, \"When I visited the United States last year, I stated that the vast Pacific Ocean has enough space for the two large countries of China and the United States.

The DOD report observed, though, that China's military modernization also appears increasingly focused on developing capabilities for extended-range power projection and operations in emerging domains such as cyber, space, and electronic warfare, as well as other missions, including anti-piracy missions, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and regional military operations.", "Of particular concern to the U.S. government are Chinese capabilities that appear aimed at allowing China to deter intervention by American forces in a conflict in the Western Pacific.

The Pentagon report described the DF-21D as giving the PLA \"the capability to attack large ships, including aircraft carriers, in the western Pacific Ocean.\" China has also test flown an indigenously produced fifth generation stealth fighter aircraft prototype, the J-20, and appears to be developing a second advanced stealth aircraft, tentatively identified as the J-31. The DOD report stated that such planes are intended to strengthen China's \"ability to strike regional airbases and facilities,\" presumably including U.S. military bases in Asia. The military development that has stirred the greatest national pride in China is the September 2012 commissioning of China's first aircraft carrier, although it has so far provided China with more symbolic than real military power. Acquired from Ukraine in 1998, it was previously known as the Varyag and is now known as the Liaoning.

Chinese commentators have been critical, too, of the flagship economic initiative of the U.S. rebalancing to Asia, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

China, along with many other developing countries, has long argued that developed nations bear the lion's share of the historical responsibility for climate change and continue to have far higher levels of emissions per capita, so they alone should be subject to legally binding commitments to reduce emissions, while developing nations' reductions should be voluntary. Chinese officials have described pressures on developing countries to accept legally binding emissions targets as an attempt to restrict those countries' rights to develop.
