Some notable provisions are in the following acts:", "The Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 prohibits various attacks on federal computer systems and on those used by banks and in interstate and foreign commerce. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA) prohibits unauthorized electronic eavesdropping. The Computer Security Act of 1987 gave the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility for developing security standards for federal computer systems, except the national security systems that are used for defense and intelligence missions, and gave responsibility to the Secretary of Commerce for promulgating security standards. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 gave the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) responsibility for developing cybersecurity policies. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 made agency heads responsible for ensuring the adequacy of agency information-security policies and procedures, established the chief information officer (CIO) position in agencies, and gave the Secretary of Commerce authority to make promulgated security standards mandatory. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) gave the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) some cybersecurity responsibilities in addition to those implied by its general responsibilities for homeland security and critical infrastructure (CI). The Cyber Security Research and Development Act, also enacted in 2002, established research responsibilities in cybersecurity for the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NIST. The E-Government Act of 2002 serves as the primary legislative vehicle to guide federal IT management and initiatives to make information and services available online, and includes various cybersecurity requirements. The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) clarified and strengthened NIST and agency cybersecurity responsibilities, established a central federal incident center, and made OMB, rather than the Secretary of Commerce, responsible for promulgating federal cybersecurity standards.", "More than 40 other laws identified by CRS also have provisions relating to cybersecurity (see Table 2 ). Revisions to many of those laws have been proposed. Many cybersecurity bills and resolutions have been introduced in the last three Congresses, more than 40 each in the 113 th and 112 th Congresses, and more than 60 in the 111 th .

Those responsibilities are complex, and this brief description is necessarily imperfect. Under current law, all federal agencies have cybersecurity responsibilities relating to their own systems, and many have sector-specific responsibilities for CI, such as the Department of Transportation for the transportation sector. In general, in addition to the roles of White House entities, DHS is the primary civil-sector cybersecurity agency. NIST, in the Department of Commerce, develops cybersecurity standards and guidelines that are promulgated by OMB, and the Department of Justice is largely responsible for the enforcement of laws relating to cybersecurity. The National Science Foundation (NSF), NIST, and DHS all perform research and development (R&D) related to cybersecurity. The National Security Agency (NSA) is the primary cybersecurity agency in the national security sector, although other agencies also play significant roles. NSA is also a member of the Intelligence Community (IC). The U.S. Cyber Command, part of the U.S. Strategic Command in the Department of Defense (DOD), has primary responsibility for military cyberspace operations.", "Some notable executive actions under existing law are described below. The George W. Bush Administration established the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) in 2008 through National Security Presidential Directive 54 / Homeland Security Presidential Directive 23 (NSPD-54/HSPD-23). Those documents are classified, but the Obama Administration released a description of them in March 2010. Goals of the 12 subinitiatives in that description include consolidating external access points to federal systems; deploying intrusion detection and prevention systems across those systems; improving research coordination and prioritization and developing \"next-generation\" technology, information sharing, and cybersecurity education and awareness; mitigating risks from the global supply chain for information technology; and clarifying the federal role in protecting CI.", "The Obama Administration has also launched several initiatives. In December 2009, the Administration appointed the first White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, popularly called the \"cyber czar,\" to orchestrate federal cybersecurity activities. However, the coordinator position has no direct control over agency budgets, and some observers argue that operational entities such as the National Security Agency (NSA) have far greater influence and authority.", "In April 2010, OMB used its authority under FISMA to implement a requirement for automated, continuous monitoring of federal information systems by agencies. In July 2010, OMB delegated operational responsibilities under FISMA to DHS, and in December 2011, it established an interagency program called FedRAMP for cloud-computing cybersecurity. The Administration has also implemented other initiatives and priorities.", "In April 2011, the White House sent a comprehensive, seven-part legislative proposal ( White House Proposal ) to Congress. Reports of a possible executive order circulated in September 2012. Although some opposition was expressed to such an action, President Obama issued Executive Order 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity , in February 2013. It expanded an existing program for information sharing and collaboration between the government and the private sector; established a process for identifying CI with especially high priority for protection; required NIST to lead a public/private effort to develop a framework of cybersecurity standards and best practices for protecting CI; and required regulatory agencies to determine the adequacy of existing requirements and the authority of the agencies to establish new requirements to address cybersecurity risks to CI. A companion presidential policy directive (PPD-21) revised other aspects of policy relating to CI security with the aim of improving integration and efficiency, among other goals.

It would also have required an annual privacy report by the DHS Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. In addition, the bill would have prohibited federal use of identifying information from specified sets of library, sales, tax, education, or medical records. The subcommittee version of H.R. 3674 would have required that two members of the NISO board of directors be representatives from the privacy and civil liberties community (the committee version), that the NISO charter and procedures include privacy and civil liberties protections, and that anonymization procedures, such as removal of personally identifiable information, be used for shared information.
