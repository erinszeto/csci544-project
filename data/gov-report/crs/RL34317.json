TIP is both an international and a domestic crime that involves violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards, and criminal law.", "In general, the trafficking business feeds on conditions of vulnerability, such as youth, gender, poverty, ignorance, social exclusion, political instability, and ongoing demand for cheap labor and sex workers. Actors engaged in human trafficking range from amateur family-run organizations to sophisticated transnational organized crime syndicates. Trafficking victims are often subjected to mental and physical abuse in order to control them, including debt bondage, social isolation, removal of identification cards and travel documents, violence, and fear of reprisals against them or their families. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), in June 2012, some 20.9 million individuals were estimated to be victims of forced labor, including TIP. The most recent estimate from the U.S. government noted that as many as 17,500 people were believed to be trafficked into the United States each year, and some have estimated that 100,000 U.S. citizen (USC) children were victims of trafficking within the United States during the course of each year.", "Human trafficking is of great concern to the United States and the international community. Anti-TIP efforts have accelerated in the United States since the enactment of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA, Division A of P.L. 106-386) and internationally since the passage of the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, adopted in 2000. Through the TVPA and its reauthorizations (TVPRAs), Congress has aimed to eliminate human trafficking by creating international and domestic grant programs for both victims and law enforcement, creating new criminal laws, and conducting oversight on the effectiveness and implications of U.S. anti-TIP policy. In March 2013, the TVPA was reauthorized through FY2017 in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Title XII, P.L. 113-4).", "The United States engages in anti-TIP efforts internationally and domestically. The bulk of U.S. anti-trafficking programs abroad is administered by the State Department, United States Agency for International Development, and Department of Labor (DOL). In keeping with U.S. anti-trafficking policy, these programs have emphasized prevention, protection, and prosecution (the three \"Ps\"). Prevention programs have combined public awareness and education campaigns with education and employment opportunities for those at risk of trafficking, particularly women and girls. Protection programs have involved direct support for shelters, as well as training of local service providers, public officials, and religious groups. Programs to improve the prosecution rates of traffickers have helped countries draft or amend existing anti-TIP laws, as well as provided training for law enforcement and judiciaries to enforce those laws. However, it is difficult to evaluate the impact of international U.S. anti-trafficking efforts since few reliable measures of TIP have been identified.", "Domestically, anti-TIP efforts also include protection for victims, education of the public, and the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenses. The Departments of Justice (DOJ), Health and Human Services (HHS), and DOL have programs or administer grants to other entities to provide assistance specific to the needs of victims of trafficking. These needs include temporary housing, independent living skills, cultural orientation, transportation needs, job training, mental health counseling, and legal assistance. Both HHS and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) administer public awareness campaigns on recognizing human trafficking victims. In addition, within the United States at the federal level, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in DOJ and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Department of Homeland Security both have primary responsibility for investigating and prosecuting traffickers.", "Some of the issues surrounding U.S. policy to combat human trafficking include whether there is equal treatment of all victims\u2014both foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, as well as victims of labor and sex trafficking; whether current law and services are adequate to deal with the emerging issue of minor sex trafficking in the United States (i.e., the prostitution of children in the United States); and whether U.S. efforts to stem human trafficking internationally are efficacious.", "In addition, the current budget situation has heightened interest in Congress on the funding and oversight of current efforts to fight TIP, to make sure that the grant programs authorized under the TVPA as amended do not duplicate efforts and that funding is being used in the most efficacious manner. Obligations for global and domestic anti-TIP programs, not including operations and law enforcement investigations, totaled approximately $82.5 million in FY2011. The TVPRA of 2013 authorized $127.75 million in global and domestic anti-TIP programs for FY2014.", "The 113th Congress has made TIP a priority. In February 2013, Congress passed S. 47 (P.L. 113-4), which amended and reauthorized the TVPA. Among other things, P.L. 113-4 modified some of the grant programs, expanded reporting requirements, created new criminal penalties for trafficking offenses, and reauthorized appropriations from FY2014 through FY2017. It is expected that Congress will consider other TIP legislation during the 113th session dealing with the child welfare system's response to minor sex trafficking, trying to limit demand for prostitution, and addressing the issue of online advertisements for the commercial sexual exploitation of minor trafficking victims.", "See also CRS Report R41878, Sex Trafficking of Children in the United States: Overview and Issues for Congress, by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R42497, Trafficking in Persons: International Dimensions and Foreign Policy Issues for Congress, by Liana Rosen."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["Trafficking in persons (TIP), or human trafficking, is both an international and a domestic crime that is often also associated with violations of labor, public health, and human rights standards.

Exploitation includes, a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.", "Often, the U.N. Protocol's definition of TIP is described as composed of three necessary elements: ", "1. the commission of specific acts (e.g., recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring, or receipt of persons); 2. the use of specific methods or means in the commission of the above-listed acts (e.g., threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or position of vulnerability, giving or receiving payments or benefits to control another person); and 3. the primary purpose of committing the above-listed acts using the above-listed means is exploitation. ", "The three-part U.N. definition clarifies that TIP is unique among other trafficking and commodity smuggling crimes, as it does not require that victims move across national borders to trigger the definition. Instead, the U.N. definition emphasizes the role of human exploitation and vulnerability as core components. A victim's consent in a trafficking scheme is irrelevant to the U.N. definition when exploitation occurs as a result of specified means of force, fraud, and coercion. Additionally, persons under the age of 18 who are recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, or received for the purpose of exploitation are considered trafficking victims.

Instead, Section 103(8) of the TVPA defines \"severe forms of trafficking in persons\" to mean: ", "(A) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or", "(B) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.", "This term, rather than the U.N. TIP definition of trafficking in persons, is applied in the context of U.S. anti-trafficking policies and programs\u2014including in the State Department annual Trafficking in Persons Report (TIP Report), which measures and ranks foreign countries' progress to eliminate severe forms of trafficking in persons. Furthermore, a country's failure to achieve minimum standards of progress in combating severe forms of trafficking in persons has the potential to trigger restrictions that prohibit poor-performing countries from receiving certain types of U.S. foreign assistance. ", "Several of the key terms used in the definition of severe forms of trafficking in persons are additionally defined or described by the TVPA, as amended, including the terms \"coercion,\" \"commercial sex act,\" \"debt bondage,\" \"involuntary servitude,\" and \"sex trafficking.\" ", "Coercion: \"(A) threats of serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; (B) any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that failure to perform an act would result in serious harm to or physical restraint against any person; or (C) the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process.\" Commercial Sex Act: \"any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.\" Debt Bondage: 7 \"the status or condition of a debtor arising from a pledge by the debtor of his or her personal services or of those of a person under his or her control as a security for debt, if the value of those services as reasonably assessed is not applied toward the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined.\" Involuntary Servitude: \"(A) any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such condition, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or (B) the abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process.\" Sex Trafficking: \"the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.\"", "The TVPA's terminology is similar to the U.N. Protocol's, as both identify force, fraud, and coercion as prohibited means or methods for obtaining the services of another person and both do not require movement of persons across national borders as a necessary precondition for identifying human trafficking. The U.S. and U.N. definitions appear to differ somewhat with respect to the concept of exploitation. Notably, one of the specified examples of exploitation listed by the U.N. definition, the removal of organs, is not present in the U.S. definition of severe forms of human trafficking. Distinctions also exist between human trafficking and human smuggling. Human smuggling typically involves the provision of a service, generally procurement or transport, to people who knowingly consent to that service in order to gain illegal entry into a foreign country. In some instances, an individual who appears to have consented to being smuggled may actually be trafficked if, for example, force, fraud, or coercion are found to have played a role."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forced or Compulsory Labor", "paragraphs": ["\"Forced or compulsory labor\" is defined by International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention No. 29 as \"all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily.\" ", "The ILO definition is used in the context of some U.S. laws.

Such criminal entities vary in terms of their leadership structure, level of organizational sophistication, transnational reach, membership size, ethnic and social composition, dependence on human trafficking as a primary source of profit, use of violence, and level of cooperation with other organized crime groups. Human trafficking operations often require the participation of unscrupulous recruiters and employment agency managers and corrupt immigration and consular officials. According to the United Nations, human trafficking can be closely integrated into legal businesses, including the tourism industry, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, and leisure and entertainment businesses. Related crimes associated with human trafficking operations have reportedly included fraud, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, bribery, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, car theft, migrant smuggling, kidnapping, document forgery, and gambling. Women in particular have been found to play a prominent role in human trafficking, compared to other violent and organized crimes, which are primarily perpetrated by men.", "Reports suggest that traffickers exploit a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures for recruiting and forcibly maintaining victims in situations of human trafficking. According to the UNODC, Balkan-based groups commonly recruit victims through deceptive promises of employment, participation in beauty contests, modeling opportunities, affordable vacations, study abroad programs, and marriage services. Similar methods are reportedly used by traffickers in Latin America. ", "In cases of forced labor trafficking, contract fraud and contract switching is prevalent. According to the State Department, migrants may accept jobs abroad with a verbal agreement, only to find that the type of work and the working conditions are drastically different upon arrival at the work location. Sometimes employers may force their employees to sign new contracts upon arrival; others may alter the contract terms without notifying employees, while others may deny employees a copy of their signed contract or provide a copy of the contract in a language not understood by the employees. Traffickers, including in particular Nigerian and Chinese groups, have been known to use debt bondage schemes on individuals who desire to be smuggled across international borders. Such irregular migrants thus become TIP victims as traffickers force them to pay back exaggerated smuggling fees. ", "Other recruitment schemes include using family members, friends, and individuals of the same nationality or gender as potential victims; such individuals may be better positioned to gain a victim's trust and, ultimately, recruit such victims through deception. In order to maintain a victim in circumstances of human trafficking, perpetrators may manipulate a victim's perception of the amount of credit and debt owed, keep victims in extreme social and community isolation, facilitate alcohol and drug addictions, threaten victims with physical violence, and instill in victims a fear of local authorities and the possibility of arrest or deportation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Global Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Estimates on the prevalence of human trafficking worldwide have varied widely (see discussion on data limitations, below).

A later U.S. government estimate cited approximately 600,000 to 800,000 people trafficked across global borders each year\u2014and if trafficking within countries were to be included in the total world figures, approximately 2 million to 4 million people were trafficked annually.

In 2005, for example, the ILO estimated that, at a minimum, some 2.45 million individuals worldwide were in conditions of forced labor as a result of human trafficking. Using a revised methodology, the ILO issued a new estimate in June 2012 on the number of victims of forced labor worldwide, concluding that some 20.9 million individuals were likely subjected to forced labor, including labor and sex trafficking as well as state-imposed forms of forced labor. According to a December 2012 UNODC report, governments worldwide identified TIP victims originating in 136 countries and exploited in 118 countries between 2007 and 2010.", "Several other researchers, academics, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have conducted studies to estimate the scope of TIP internationally. For example, the NGO Free the Slaves estimated that some 27 million people may be enslaved worldwide. ", "Analysts often emphasize several limitations in human trafficking data, which contribute to persistent questions about the true scope and severity of TIP. Limitations include differences in national definitions and political emphasis on TIP, as well as the varying nature of national criminal justice systems and the extent to which countries engage in bilateral, regional, and multilateral cooperation. Some forms of TIP may not be tracked by national data if laws against such acts are not in existence. If definitions change over time as new laws are enacted, comparing data over multiple years may be challenging. The availability and quality of national structures for victim identification, referral, assistance, and repatriation also vary.

Such conclusions are likely to reflect a bias in reporting, which is believed to result in the over-reporting of sex trafficking and the under-reporting of labor trafficking. The ILO, in contrast, estimated that approximately 22% of all forced labor trafficking cases globally in 2012 (4.5 million out of an estimated total of 20.9 million victims) involved trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation.

As part of such schemes, traffickers may employ various forms of physical and psychological deception and coercion, including threats or use of violence and manipulation through drug and alcohol dependencies.", "Estimates of the prevalence of children trafficked for sexual exploitation and forced labor, including conscription or forced recruitment to serve in armed conflicts, vary. Many estimates may also be outdated. In 2003, the United Nations reported an estimated 1.2 million children were trafficked. The ILO estimated that some 5.5 million children were victims of forced labor in 2012. A 2001 estimate by UNICEF and ECPAT suggests that as many as 2 million children may be exploited for commercial sex at any given time. The U.N. Secretary-General reported in May 2013 that as many as 50 state and non-state entities \"recruit or use children\" in situations of armed conflict.

In general, human trafficking feeds on structural vulnerabilities within a society, such as poverty, political instability, social upheaval, and crisis. Socially isolated and culturally excluded, disempowered, disenfranchised, and marginalized groups can be particularly susceptible to human trafficking. Vulnerable groups may become marginalized for reasons related to ethnic, linguistic, and religious dynamics, gender discrimination, age or youth. Globalization has also contributed to an increase in the movement of people across borders, legally and illegally, especially from poorer to wealthier countries; international organized crime, including human traffickers, has taken advantage of this freer flow of people, money, goods, and services to extend its own transnational reach.", "Limitations in the implementation and enforcement of anti-trafficking policies also contribute to the challenges in combating human trafficking, resulting in a perception that human traffickers are at low risk of detection by law enforcement and are rarely punished for their illicit activities in many parts of the world.

Some argue that as immigration and border restrictions have tightened, smuggling costs have increased and migration routes have become more dangerous, putting migrants at a high risk of trafficking. In some cases, smugglers have sold undocumented migrants into situations of forced labor or prostitution in order to recover their costs or obtain greater profits.
