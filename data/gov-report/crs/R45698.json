These differences were resolved in a House-Senate conference to create the enacted bill, which is a mix of both versions that were passed by both chambers. The enacted bill reauthorizes and amends portions of most all conservation programs; however, the general focus is on the larger programs, namely the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP).", "Most farm bill conservation programs are authorized to receive mandatory funding and are not subject to appropriation. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the conservation title of the 2018 farm bill makes up 7% of the bill's total projected mandatory spending over 10 years, which is $60 billion of the total $867 billion. The conservation title is budget neutral over the 10-year baseline; however, the 2018 farm bill is projected to increase funding in the first five years (+$555 million over FY2019-FY2023) and decrease funding in the last five years (-$561 million over FY2024-FY2028).

The House-passed bill would have repealed CSP and created a stewardship contract within EQIP, whereas the Senate-passed bill would have reauthorized CSP and reduced program enrollment. The enacted bill creates a mix of both the House- and Senate-passed bills by reauthorizing CSP and reducing program enrollment, as well as creating a new incentive contract within EQIP. Funding for CSP is shifted away from an acreage limitation under prior law to limits based on funding. EQIP is expanded and reauthorized with increased funding levels.", "The largest land retirement program\u2014CRP\u2014is reauthorized and expanded by increasing the CRP enrollment limit in annual increments from 24 million acres in FY2019 to 27 million by FY2023. To offset this increased enrollment level, the enacted bill reduces payments to participants, including cost-share payments, annual rental payments, and incentive payments. The 2018 farm bill also reauthorized and amended the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP). Most of the changes to ACEP focus on the agricultural land easements by providing additional flexibilities to ACEP-eligible entities and authorize an increase in overall funding.", "The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) is reauthorized and amended by shifting the program away from enrolling land through existing conservation programs to a standalone program with separate contracts and agreements. Under the revised program, USDA is to continue to enter into agreements with eligible partners, and these partners are to continue to define the scope and location of a project, provide a portion of the project cost, and work with eligible landowners to enroll in RCPP contracts.", "While the 2018 farm bill does not create new conservation programs, it does require that a number of existing programs direct a dollar amount or percentage of a program's funding to a resource-specific issue, initiative, or subprogram. Through these directed policies Congress has established a level of support, or required investment, to be carried out through implementation to target specific issues such as nutrient runoff or groundwater protection. The directed policy may also reduce the implementing agency's flexibility to allocate funding based on need, as well as reducing the amount available for activities under the larger program that may not meet a resource-specific provision.", "High commodity prices in years past, changing land rental rates, and new conservation technologies have led over time to a shift in farm bill conservation policy away from programs that retire land from production (CRP) toward programs that provide assistance to lands still in production (EQIP and CSP). Much of this shift occurred following the 2008 farm bill (FY2009-FY2013) and continued under the 2014 farm bill (FY2014-FY2018) as the level of total mandatory program funding for CRP was reduced relative to EQIP and CSP. Funding for easement programs (ACEP) also declined somewhat under the 2014 farm bill, but is projected to level off under the 2018 farm bill.

General enrollment provides an opportunity for landowners to enroll in CRP through a nationwide competition during a specific period of time.

While recent farm bills have increased funding for easement and partnership programs, they remain relatively small compared to three main programs\u2014EQIP, CSP, and CRP (see Table 2 and Figure 4 ). The 2018 farm bill conservation title is considered budget neutral over the ten-year baseline and generally reallocates funding among the larger existing programs.", "Over time, periods of high commodity prices, changing land rental rates, and new conservation technologies have led to a shift in farm bill conservation policy away from land retirement and toward an increased focus on working lands programs. Much of this shift occurred following the 2008 farm bill and continued in the 2014 farm bill as the level of total mandatory program funding for land retirement programs declined relative to working lands programs (see Figure 4 ). Increasingly, the separation between land retirement programs and working lands programs has become blurred by an increase in compatible use allowances for grazing and pasture use under land retirement programs. Most conservation and wildlife organizations support both land retirement and working lands programs; however, the appropriate \"mix\" continues to be a subject of debate. ", "Additionally, some conservation program supporters are divided over the relative benefits of shorter-term land retirement programs (CRP) versus longer-term easement programs (ACEP). Unlike land retirement programs, easement programs impose a permanent or longer-term land-use restriction that the land owner voluntarily places on the land in exchange for a government payment. Supporters of easement programs cite a more cost-effective investment in sustainable ecosystems for long-term wildlife and land preservation benefits. Supporters of short-term land retirement programs cite the increased flexibility and broader participation compared with permanent or long-term easement programs. The 2018 farm bill did not amend the duration of ACEP easements, but did create two new subprograms under CRP that would provide additional options for longer-term CRP contracts (30 years under CLEAR30) and shorter-term CRP contracts (3-5 years under SHIPP).", "In recent years, Congress has placed greater emphasis on programs that partner with state and local communities to target conservation funding to local resource concerns. These partnership programs leverage private funding with federal funding to multiply the level of assistance in a selected area. The 2014 farm bill repealed a number of these partnership programs and replaced them with RCPP. The 2018 farm bill amends and expands the number of partnering opportunities under RCPP, CREP, and CIG. However, based on available funding, these programs remain relatively small compared to others in the conservation title."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Regulation and Voluntary Conservation", "paragraphs": ["USDA has cited voluntary conservation practices as a way to address environmental concerns and potentially reduce the need for traditional regulatory programs. A number of provisions in the conservation title speak to the relationship between voluntary conservation measures and environmental regulation. One such provision is regulatory certainty. Regulatory certainty refers to using voluntary measures to address a specific resource concern in exchange for the \"certainty\" that additional measures will not be required under future regulations. A new regulatory certainty section in the 2018 farm bill (\u00a72503(f)) authorizes USDA to provide technical assistance under the farm bill conservation programs to support regulatory assurances for producers and landowners, under select conditions.", "The 2018 farm bill also makes existing regulatory certainty measures permanent, including the Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative, which was created in 2012 as a partnership between NRCS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). Under this partnership agreement, private landowners who voluntarily make wildlife habitat improvements on their land through NRCS conservation programs, and agree to maintain them for 15-30 years, receive in return a level of certainty they will be exempted from potential future regulatory actions related to at-risk species under the Endangered Species Act. The 2018 farm bill makes this partnership agreement permanent and allows for the initiative to be expanded to include CRP.", "Another environmental regulatory-related provision in the enacted 2018 farm bill (\u00a72410) is a sense of Congress statement encouraging watershed-level partnerships between nonpoint sources and regulated point sources to advance the goals of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a71251 et seq.)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
