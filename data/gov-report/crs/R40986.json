One of these alternatives has been to establish what might be called a \"blue-ribbon\" commission that reviews multiple agencies, operations, or policies.

Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) commissions have been cited favorably by multiple proponents of the current proposals as a procedural model for accomplishing their desired policy objectives.", "In the wake of reduced east-west tensions, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact military threat, and the Soviet Union's breakup from the late 1980s until 1991, most analysts agreed that the Department of Defense's (DOD's) base structure was larger than necessary to meet the department's needs. Nevertheless, there were differences concerning which, if any, additional bases should be closed, at what speed, and what criteria should be used for making those decisions. Significantly, the impact of a specific base closing would be keenly felt in one Member of Congress's state or district, but benefits in terms of savings could be spread widely among all citizens and taxpayers. In combination, these two factors\u2014(1) the narrowly felt pain from an individual base closing and (2) the widely diffused benefits from closing many bases to save taxpayer funds\u2014produced strong incentives for coalitions of Members of Congress to bargain in the legislative process to protect many bases from closure. ", "At the same time, there were widespread concerns that, absent restrictions and safeguards, DOD might close, or not close, bases for political reasons. In the past, high-level representatives of DOD, in soliciting congressional support for favored programs, reportedly might have implied that if a Member of Congress voted against the program, a base might be closed in the Member's district. For example, former Representative and House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey said,", "[t]he fact is, unfortunate as it is, that historically base closings have been used as a point of leverage by administrations, Republican and Democratic administrations, as political leverage over and above Members of Congress to encourage them to vote in a manner that the administration would like.", "During the late 1980s, several bills were introduced in Congress to relax statutory restrictions that made closing a base difficult. The first enacted proposal was an elaborate framework prescribed by the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (1988). The procedure established under that statute\u2014relying on the services of a commission to draw up the Secretary of Defense's recommendations and a fast-track, no-amendment vote\u2014proved so effective that a later statute, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, created three subsequent Defense Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) Commissions that operated in 1991, 1993, and 1995. ", "This occurred notwithstanding arguments against the legislation on grounds that bases were closed without the legislation, and that the legislation was an abdication of congressional responsibilities to the executive branch. That said, the statute vested considerable power in both executive and legislative branches in the creation of the commission, and transferred that control to the commission itself once it was established. ", "While the law gave the President the authority to appoint commissioners, it also stated that he \"should\" consult with the majority and minority leadership in both chambers in appointment of six of its nine members, and all commissioners were subject to the general \"advice and consent of the Senate\" requirement on all senior political appointees. The statute also spelled out the criteria under which installations were to be evaluated for realignment or closure, and both DOD and the commission were required to adhere to them in crafting their recommendations. The process required the Secretary of Defense to submit his recommendations to the commission by a date certain. The commission was then to review, accept, amend, or reject each of those recommendations and could create recommendations of its own, again by a date certain. The President was authorized only to accept the commission's entire list or return it one time to the commission for reconsideration, stating the basis of his concerns, and the statute placed a deadline on that approval. Upon the commission's resubmittal, the President could reject outright or approve the entire list. Unless Congress passed a joint resolution of disapproval within 45 days of the President's approval, the statute required the Secretary of Defense to implement all approved recommendations by a date certain\u2014six years from the date of presidential approval. ", "In mid-1997, Secretary of Defense William Cohen called for two new rounds of base closures and realignments. He explained that, while four previous rounds had achieved significant savings, it was important to continue the process of closing underutilized facilities. Despite DOD pressure, most Members of Congress were reluctant to support authorization of new base closure legislation, at least for the foreseeable future. ", "A single additional round of base closures was authorized in 2001, to be implemented in 2005 under somewhat different procedures. This new authorization retained the basic form, structure, and process of the previous three rounds, but amendments to the governing statute included, among other provisions, an increase in the number of commissioners from eight to nine (to minimize the likelihood of tie votes on individual recommendations) and the requirement for a supermajority of votes in favor of an installation closure.", "In addition to providing for a commission and expedited procedures, the BRAC statute required extensive actions to ensure that recommendations were impartial, as objective as possible, and based on expert analysis. It required that the Secretary of Defense turn over documentation used in the drafting of his recommendation list to the commission for its review. It provided for the commission to be supported by a staff of experts, and it also required that the commission's documentation be open for public review.

The legislation would have established a commission of presidentially appointed members. In turn, the commission would have been required to review all executive agencies and programs, except for DOD, and make recommendations for the realignment or elimination of agencies and programs according to some general criteria. The commission's recommendations, in the form of draft legislation, then would have been subject to expedited procedures in Congress. The sponsors compared the legislation with the BRAC process. Neither bill received further action in the 107 th Congress, but versions of the legislation attracted considerably more attention in the next two Congresses. Proponents of different versions of CARFA often compared the proposals to the BRAC commissions, except that the proposed CARFA legislation would have focused on most or all agencies and programs of the executive branch of government. Proponents also argued that the mechanism would eliminate ineffective programs. Critics of CARFA and related legislation argued the proposals would constitute abdication of congressional responsibilities, including the ability to amend legislative proposals, and transfer power to the President by delegating congressional responsibilities to presidential appointees or to appointees primarily chosen by members of the political party of a sitting President.", "A hearing was held on a Senate version of the legislation in the 108 th Congress ( S. 1668 ). In the 109 th Congress, House leadership reportedly sought to move H.R. 5766 to a floor vote.

Separately, Senator Judd Gregg, then chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, sponsored S. 3521 (109 th Congress), which included CARFA-like provisions as part of a broader budget reform package. The bill was reported with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The report argued in support of the provisions, saying that \"[p]rudent stewardship of the public's funds requires that Congress make every effort to ferret out wasteful spending and identify redundant activity.\" During committee markup, then-Ranking Member Kent Conrad proposed amending S. 3521 to strike the CARFA commission language and \"[replace] it with the bipartisan membership of the Congressional committees of jurisdiction so that they can do their job,\" instead of \"outsourcing responsibility for our nation's fiscal condition to largely unelected, unaccountable commission members.\" The amendment was defeated. After being reported, the bill received no further action.", "Notably, S. 3521 also included provisions that would have established a National Commission on Entitlement Solvency.

Each bill provides special legislative procedures to encourage expedited consideration of legislation (i.e., a commission's approved recommendations). The special procedures would, among other things, restrict the amendment process and limit floor consideration or debate. A major difference between BRAC and the fiscal commission proposals, however, is the comparative breadth of the fiscal commissions' intended scopes. Most of the fiscal commission proposals include within the commission's scope all policies that may relate to the federal fiscal balance. As such, it is not clear what policy domains, if any, might fall outside a commission's scope, when drafting legislation for commission approval. In view of the potentially far-reaching scope of a commission's recommendations, some of the fiscal commission proposals' requirements for a supermajority approval by commission members and, if a commission's recommendations were considered by Congress, supermajority vote by each chamber of Congress for initial or final chamber passage, might be viewed as controls intended to channel recommendations toward a broader consensus package.", "In contrast with BRAC legislation, the various CARFA proposals and related measures were not enacted. Like the fiscal commission proposals that are the subject of this report, the CARFA proposals generally provided for far-reaching scopes, across multiple agencies and programs. The process-related provisions of the CARFA proposals, however, seemed to garner substantial opposition. Some of the criticisms that opponents consistently raised against these proposals were arguments that appointments of commission members would have been substantially subject to the control of the President or to members of one political party. If such arguments were considered to be valid, a combination of the appointment provisions with other process-related provisions, such as simple majority voting by commission members and expedited legislative consideration by Congress, arguably might have had substantial effects on power relationships if the legislation had been enacted. In this light, one of the major differences between the fiscal commission proposals and the CARFA proposals is a movement toward appointment of Members of Congress as commission members, thereby potentially reducing the influence of the President. ", "Another difference is the use of supermajority voting requirements for the commission's recommendations and also for congressional consideration of the commission's recommendations. The supermajority requirements probably would make it necessary to achieve broader compromise, in order to approve recommendations. As with the CARFA proposals, however, it could be argued that special legislative procedures prohibiting amendments and limiting debate might affect power relationships within Congress. In addition, in comparison with use of the regular legislative process, the use of a commission\u2014even one composed primarily of Members\u2014might raise questions whether commission members would be in a position to represent all of the interests that could be considered in the regular legislative process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Potential Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["Decisions about whether to establish and how to structure a commission may have impacts on both policy outcomes and the public choice process in Congress.

Overall, rising health care costs per beneficiary and the nation's aging population seem likely to keep combined Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security costs rising faster than per capita GDP. For Medicare and Medicaid, \"excess cost growth\"\u2014the extent to which the increase in health care spending for an average individual exceeds the growth in per capita gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014is the main factor contributing to large projected increases in the two health care programs. Medicare and Social Security provide benefits to individuals who are mostly elderly. Medicaid provides benefits to individuals who are mostly non-elderly low-income people, but the elderly and disabled account for two-thirds of the program's spending.", "In a June 2009 report, CBO wrote that \"under any plausible scenario,\" increasing health care costs and the aging of the U.S. population will cause federal spending to rise rapidly under current law. More specifically, \"almost all of the projected growth in federal spending other than interest payments on the debt comes from growth in spending on the three largest entitlement programs\u2014Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\" According to CBO estimates, Medicare and Medicaid will account for 80% of this growth between now and 2035, and 90% between now and 2080. In 2003, CBO's then director Donald Marron testified that \"[l]ittle disagreement exists about the cause of [the fiscal] situation.... It stems primarily from federal policies aimed at improving the well-being of retirees, the disabled, and the chronically ill.\" CBO concluded that the current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term and that \"[s]lowing the growth rate of outlays for Medicare and Medicaid is the central long-term challenge for federal fiscal policy.\" Nevertheless, CBO separately observed an additional, complicating factor in addressing the long-term fiscal situation. \"At this point,\" according to CBO, \"experts do not know exactly how to structure such reforms so as to reduce federal spending on health care significantly in the long run without harming people's health,\" and furthermore, \"many of the specific changes that might ultimately prove most important cannot be foreseen today and could be developed only over time through experimentation and learning.\"", "For purposes of illustrating the issue of sustainability, keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, approximately its current share, and leaving revenue policies unchanged, according to CBO current-law projections, could require either drastic reductions for all spending other than that for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, or reining in the projected cost growth of these three programs. In 2006, the then-acting director of CBO stated that, \"by 2030 ... spending for those programs [Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid] is projected to reach roughly 15 percent of GDP.... If that increase happened ... the rest of the budget would have to be cut by more than half\" to keep overall spending close to its current level.\" ", "These programs present differing challenges to the long-term fiscal position of the federal government. Estimates of the long-term fiscal gap between Social Security (Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) outlays and Social Security revenues as a proportion of long-term GDP are generally much smaller than estimates of the long-term fiscal gap between Medicare (Part A, Part B, and Part D) outlays and revenues as a portion of long-term GDP. These long-term estimates of fiscal imbalances are sensitive to changes in assumptions regarding productivity growth and interest rates. Spending projections for Medicare and Medicaid are sensitive to medical inflation. Past projections that medical inflation would slow have proved to be overly optimistic.", "Long-term fiscal challenges facing the federal government are complicated by the current state of the U.S. economy. As the economy recovers strength, some may call for stabilizing the government's annual deficit as a percentage of GDP. This would require some combination of lower spending and higher revenues than currently projected and faster economic growth. On the other hand, labor and real estate markets may remain weak for the medium term, and some state and local governments are likely to face severe budgetary challenges in coming years. Some, therefore, may call for additional economic stimulus or a delay before the imposition of more austere fiscal policies.", "Views differ about the timing when action is necessary to address the long-term fiscal situation. Significantly postponing spending and revenue adjustments may nevertheless have serious economic consequences. Debt is not free and requires interest payments that strain budgets. High debt levels also could limit the government's flexibility in meeting its obligations or in responding to emerging needs of its citizens.

Numerous efforts have been pursued to study and address such concerns. Some were pursued through commissions established by Congress or the President, where the commissions were used to tap expertise and facilitate bargaining that involved significant trade-offs and high political risks. Some commissions have focused on entitlements or health care, generally. However, other efforts to study and address policy concerns about entitlements have been pursued by Congress through the regular legislative process, without the involvement of a special commission. For example, in the 111 th Congress, considerable effort has been undertaken to address health care and health insurance reform through the legislative process without the central involvement of a commission.", "Several of the fiscal commission proposals that are the subject of this report expressly highlight major entitlement programs.

The program, which began in the 1930s as a social insurance program aimed at improving the economic circumstances of the elderly following the Depression, has been modified by Congress many times over its history. Today, Social Security provides workers and their families protections against the loss of income due to retirement, disability, and death.", "Social Security's trust funds, the combined federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) trust funds, currently take in more revenue than they pay in benefits. The trust funds' income comes primarily through a 6.2.% payroll tax that is levied separately on employers and employees (for a total payroll tax of 12.4%), with additional income from interest on the trust funds' investments and income taxes paid by some beneficiaries on their benefits. The excess monies are invested in non-marketable obligations of the U.S. government that are held in the trust funds. Starting in 2016, Social Security's annual expenditures on benefits are projected to exceed tax revenue. At that time, Social Security will start to redeem its public debt obligations in order to pay full benefits until the trust fund assets are exhausted, which is projected to occur in 2037. After the trust funds are exhausted, current payroll tax rates are projected to be sufficient to pay 76% of scheduled benefits in 2038, declining to 74% of scheduled benefits by 2083. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is projected to be equivalent to about 2 percentage points of Social Security's taxable payroll; in other words, an increase in the payroll tax of roughly 2%, from 12.4% to 14.4%, would close the system's financial shortfall. Social Security's shortfall represents about 0.72% of GDP, on average, over the period from 2009 to 2083.", "A number of bipartisan commissions have addressed Social Security's financial and benefit structure, including two commissions within the last 28 years. The National Commission on Social Security Reform was established in 1981 through President Ronald Reagan's Executive Order (E.O.) 12335, in response to projections that the system would run short of funds by mid-1983. A majority of members of the commission, also known as the \"Greenspan Commission,\" agreed on a consensus package of proposals to meet the short-range deficit and about two-thirds of long-range financial requirements. In accordance with the executive order, the commission transmitted its recommendations to the President, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and both houses of Congress on January 20, 1983.

According to CBO, between FY1975 and FY2008, federal spending for Medicare rose from 0.8% of GDP to 2.7%, in part because of increased enrollment, which climbed from 25 million in 1975 to 45 million in 2008. Over the same period, total spending for Medicaid, including spending by the states, increased from 0.8% of GDP to 2.5%.", "Medicare provides federal health insurance for 45 million people who are elderly or disabled (the elderly make up about 85% of enrollees) or who have end-stage renal disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease).

The HI and SMI trust funds are overseen by a board of trustees that makes annual reports to Congress.

On March 16, 1999, the commission held its final meeting to consider and vote on a Medicare reform proposal by the commission's co-chairs. On a motion to report to Congress and the President, the commission voted with 10 ayes and 7 nays. Eleven votes were required to make formal recommendations to the Congress and the President.

However, the programs face many challenges. Even prior to the recent economic downturn, the Medicaid program's financing represented a growing share of federal and state budgets. High unemployment levels and financial challenges facing many state governments are likely to exacerbate the issue. A poor economy affects how much money states can dedicate to the programs while at the same time has the potential to vastly increase the number of individuals eligible for coverage. Yet, the programs are targeted at populations that have special health needs, or are at higher risk of being uninsured.
