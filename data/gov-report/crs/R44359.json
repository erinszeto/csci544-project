For example, Indian tribes have received discretionary Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants from DOT.", "Tribal advocates, citing the poor and unsafe condition of tribal roads, argue for a much larger tribal transportation program and more funds for highway safety programs. The FAST Act provided modest increases in funding in nominal dollars.

Cars and trucks are the primary means of transportation on these lands, although airplanes, public transportation vans and buses, snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles, boats, and other conveyances are important in some areas. The federal government supports highway transportation on Indian lands predominantly with grants and technical assistance. Most of this support is provided through the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) that is jointly administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in the Department of the Interior (DOI).", "This report discusses the TTP and other highway programs relevant to the tribes, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA's) State Highway Safety Program.

The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act ( P.L. 114-94 ), enacted in 2015, reauthorized the TTP and NHTSA's safety programs from FY2016 through FY2020. These programs are discussed in the context of the special relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, and the existing physical condition and safety performance of highways on Indian lands.

These reservations range in size from the 16 million acres of the Navajo Nation Reservation located in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah to the Pit River Tribe's one-acre cemetery in California. There are also other types of Indian lands, including state-authorized Indian reservations. Indian reservations are typically rural, sparsely populated, and remote from services, such as medical centers, schools and colleges, and large retail stores. According to the 2010 Census, about 4.8 million people live in American Indian areas and Alaska Native villages. Of these people, 1.1 million identify as American Indian or Alaska Native.", "Federally recognized Indian tribes are sovereign nations, but \"subject to the overriding authority of the United States.\" This means \"Indian tribes enjoy all the rights of sovereignty that have not been divested by Congress or that are not inconsistent with the tribes' dependent status .\" Federally recognized tribes are eligible for federal services and benefits. Since the 1970s, federal policy toward Indian tribes has favored self-determination and, more recently, self-governance. The Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA; P.L. 93-638 ) gave tribes the power to contract with the federal government to directly administer federal funds in some policy areas including health and education. Amendments to ISDEAA authorized self-governance in which tribes receive federal funds as a block grant through a compact with the federal government. These compacts allow tribes to establish their own funding priorities.", "Tribal self-determination and self-governance in transportation have been slow to develop relative to other policy and program areas. Because of its historical role in managing Indian lands, BIA administered the Tribal Transportation Program (formerly known as the Indian Reservation Roads Program) from its beginning in 1928, and funding for the program was provided through the DOI appropriations bill from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. In 1979, BIA and FHWA signed an interdepartmental agreement for stewardship of tribal roads. With enactment of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 ( P.L. 97-424 ), funding for the TTP was switched from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund. ", "Tribal priorities for road and bridge funding were given more weight in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act of 1991 (ISTEA; P.L. 102-240 ). But a turning point in tribal self-governance came in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA-21; P.L. 105-178 ), enacted in 1998, which authorized Indian tribes to administer federal road funding under contracts or compacts with BIA as permitted by ISDEAA (23 U.S.C. 202(b)(7)). ", "Another major change in the administration of the TTP came about as a result of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient, Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA; P.L. 109-59 ), enacted in 2005. SAFETEA gave tribes the power to enter into contracts with either BIA or FHWA to provide oversight. In 2013, at least 110 tribes had agreements with FHWA. The FAST Act, enacted in 2015, provides authority for tribes to enter into compacts with FHWA. In conjunction with either BIA or FHWA, many Indian tribes administer federal funds for road maintenance, road construction, and road safety through their own tribal departments of transportation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Highways on Indian Lands", "paragraphs": ["Responsibility for public road infrastructure on and to Indian reservations lies with governmental entities at all levels, tribal, federal, state, and local. This is reflected in the National Tribal Transportation Facility Inventory (NTTFI), a database of existing and proposed roads that provide access to and within Indian lands. The NTTFI is maintained by law by BIA in cooperation with FHWA (23 U.S.C. \u00a7202(b)(1)(A)). Of the 157,000 miles of road listed in the NTTFI, 31,400 miles are BIA-system roads, 26,000 miles are tribal-system roads, and 100,000 miles are state and local government roads. About 145,500 miles of roads in the NTTFI currently exist and 11,500 miles are planned or proposed.", "Comprehensive information on the characteristics and condition of roads on and providing access to Indian lands is unavailable, but data on BIA-system roads suggest that most are rudimentary and in poor condition. Although it is not unusual for rural roads to be unpaved, about 70% of BIA-system road mileage is unpaved. By comparison, about 53% of rural roads in Arizona are unpaved and 82% of rural roads in North Dakota are unpaved. BIA reports that in 2014, 17% of BIA-system road miles and 68% of bridges on this system were in \"acceptable\" condition. Unpaved roads are considered unacceptable by definition.", "FHWA's National Bridge Inventory indicates that at the end of 2014 about 14% of BIA-owned bridges were classified as structurally deficient and 6% were classified as functionally obsolete (see Table A-1 for the breakout by state). Nationally, about 10% of bridges were classified as structurally deficient and 14% were functionally obsolete at the end of 2014.", "A bridge is considered to be structurally deficient \"if significant load-carrying elements are found to be in poor or worse condition due to deterioration and/or damage, or if the adequacy of the waterway opening provided by the bridge is determined to be extremely insufficient to the point of causing intolerable traffic interruptions.\" Functional obsolescence arises if a bridge does not meet current design standards or traffic demands. Reasons for functional obsolescence include a bridge handles more traffic than it was built to carry; its lanes or shoulders are narrower than those that would be built today; the overhead clearance is inadequate; and the roadway curve in the approach to the bridge is too extreme. ", "The different deficiency rates of BIA-owned bridges and of highway bridges nationally are likely explained by these definitions. Bridges on lightly traveled routes, a category that probably includes most roads on tribal lands, tend generally to be in poorer structural condition than bridges on heavily traveled routes and are therefore more likely to be structurally deficient. Functional obsolescence is usually related to growing traffic demands, which may be more likely among bridges in urban areas than among those rural tribal lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Highway Safety on Indian Lands", "paragraphs": ["It is widely believed that motor vehicle crashes on Indian lands are substantially underreported in the NHTSA Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) database because tribes' reporting is voluntary, officials may not be trained in crash reporting, tribal record keeping may be inadequate, and computer systems may not be compatible with state systems. For this reason, and other reasons, such as the lack of vehicle miles traveled data, it is difficult to know how safe highways on Indian lands are. In a study of crashes on tribal lands in South Dakota in 2005, researchers documented 737 crashes from tribal and BIA law enforcement agencies, but only 53 of these were reported in enough detail to be included in the South Dakota Accident Reporting System (SDARS), which is the source of South Dakota data for NHTSA's FARS database. The study in South Dakota found that less serious crashes were the most underreported. Fatalities, while not reflective of all motor vehicle crashes, are more likely to be reported in crash databases.", "According to NHTSA, 316 motor vehicle crash fatalities on reservations were reported in 2013, the most recent year for which data are available. A little more than half of the victims (180) were Native Americans.", "The only national study of fatalities in motor vehicle crashes on Indian lands, conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2004, found that the number of fatalities on Indian reservations increased by 47%, from 222 in 1975 to 327 in 2002, while fatalities in the nation as a whole declined by 3%. More recent data show that although fatalities on reservations have declined since 2006, they still remain higher than in the mid-1970s. By comparison, rural motor vehicle fatalities, only available from 1977, declined by 38% between 1977 and 2013 ( Figure 1 ).", "Studies have identified a host of personal, vehicle, and environmental factors that may contribute to the safety trends on Indian lands highways compared with those on highways nationally and in rural areas. BIA's Indian Highway Safety Program (IHSP) states that \"while nationwide data continues to be an issue, it is evident from the self-reported data from the Tribes, that alcohol impaired driving, speed and non-use of seat belts play a significant role in fatal and injury crashes on the reservations.\" Other factors that have been identified include road characteristics, accident response times by emergency services, low rates of child-seat use, and pedestrian safety. A study of pedestrian safety on Indian lands by FHWA, for example, found problems due to alcohol use by drivers and pedestrians, and lack of pedestrian facilities, such as traffic control devices and other treatments.", "A survey of seat belt use funded by IHSP in 2013 found that seat belt use on reservations averaged about 70%, although rates differed across reservations from 36% to 91%. The national average of seat belt use in 2013 was 87%. An earlier study of seat belt use on reservations in 2004 and 2005 found overall seat belt use was 55%, ranging from 9% to 85%. This suggests that while seat belt use has increased on Indian reservations it remains lower than in the United States generally. According to NHTSA, one of the main factors that explains the wide variation in seat belt use is seat belt law on reservations. Seat belt use is highest on reservations with primary seat belt laws, lower where secondary laws exist, and lowest where there are no seat belt laws. Primary seat belt laws allow a law enforcement officer to stop a vehicle and issue a citation to a driver or passenger for not wearing a belt without any other violation of the law. Secondary laws allow a citation for not wearing a seat belt only when another traffic offense has been committed.", "Highway safety on Indian reservations is complicated by the interjurisdictional nature of law enforcement. Traffic laws on reservation roads are the decision of tribal government, and may vary from those that apply on surrounding nonreservation roads. Enforcement of traffic laws on reservations can involve tribal police, BIA police, state highway patrol, and sheriff's deputies. The authority each has to stop, detain, and cite motorists for traffic violations can depend on the tribal status of the driver, the seriousness of the violation, and agreements between the tribe and nontribal law enforcement agencies. For example, on some reservations a speeding nontribal motorist can be stopped and detained by a tribal police officer but that officer may not be able to issue a citation without the help of a state or local police officer. Similarly, on some reservations nontribal police officers can stop and detain tribal members for violating traffic laws but cannot issue citations unless authorized to do so by the tribe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Highway Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Tribal Transportation Program", "paragraphs": ["By far the largest federal program supporting highways on Indian lands is the Tribal Transportation Program, formerly the Indian Reservation Roads Program ( Table 1 ).
