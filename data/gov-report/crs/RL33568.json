Skylab was never intended to be permanently occupied, but the goal of a permanently occupied space station with crews rotating on a regular basis, employing a reusable space transportation system (the space shuttle) was high on NASA's list for the post-Apollo years following the moon landings. Budget constraints forced NASA to choose to build the space shuttle first. The first launch of the shuttle was in April 1981. When NASA declared the shuttle \"operational\" in 1982, it was ready to initiate the space station program.", "In his January 25, 1984 State of the Union address, President Reagan directed NASA to develop a permanently occupied space station within a decade, and to invite other countries to join. On July 20, 1989, the 20 th anniversary of the first Apollo landing on the Moon, President George H. W. Bush voiced his support for the space station as the cornerstone of a long-range civilian space program eventually leading to bases on the Moon and Mars. That \"Moon/Mars\" program, the Space Exploration Initiative, was not greeted with enthusiasm in Congress, primarily due to budget concerns, and ended in FY1993, although the space station program continued.", "President Clinton dramatically changed the character of the space station program in 1993 by adding Russia as a partner to this already international endeavor. That decision made the space station part of the U.S. foreign policy agenda to encourage Russia to abide by agreements to stop the proliferation of ballistic missile technology, and to support Russia economically and politically as it transitioned from the Soviet era. The Clinton Administration strongly supported the space station within certain budget limits.", "The International Space Station program thus began in 1993, with Russia joining the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada.

Repeated system failures and two life-threatening emergencies on Mir in 1997 raised questions about whether NASA should leave more astronauts on Mir , but NASA decided Mir was sufficiently safe to continue the program.

The number of astronauts who can live on the space station is limited in part by how many can be returned to Earth in an emergency by lifeboats docked to the station. Only Russian Soyuz spacecraft are available as lifeboats. Each Soyuz can hold three people, limiting crew size to three if only one Soyuz is attached. The plan is that crew size will grow to six once assembly is completed. ", "Each Soyuz must be replaced every six months. The replacement missions are called \"taxi\" flights since the crews bring a new Soyuz up to ISS and bring the old one back to Earth.

In January 2001, however, NASA announced that the cost would be over $30 billion, 72% above the 1993 estimate, and $5 billion above the legislated cap.

NASA subsequently began distinguishing between \"U.S. Core Complete\" (the launches through Node 2, which, prior to the Columbia tragedy, was scheduled for February 2004) and \"International Partner (IP) Core Complete\" which included the addition of European and Japanese laboratory modules (then anticipated in 2008).", "The new policy was followed by President Bush's January 2004 \"Vision for Space Exploration,\" which directs that U.S. research on ISS be restricted only to that which supports the Vision.
