Other new rural development provisions relate to broadband deployment, precision agriculture, and rural community development.", "P.L. 115-334 reauthorizes and amends a number of existing rural development programs. It adds a grant component to the Rural Broadband Access Loan Program and increases the authorization of appropriations from $25 million to $350 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. To be eligible for newly authorized grants, at least 90% of households in a service area must lack access to sufficient broadband service. The law also amends eligibility criteria for program loans, raising the percentage of households in an eligible service area that must lack access to sufficient broadband service from 15% to 50% of households. P.L. 115-334 codifies the Community Connect Grant Program and authorizes appropriations of $50 million per year for FY2019-FY2023. It also increases the authorizations of appropriations for the Emergency and Imminent Community Water Assistance Program, the Rural Decentralized Water Systems Program (formerly the Household Well Water Systems Program), and water and wastewater technical assistance and training programs. The law also amends the Cushion of Credit Program to terminate deposit authority and incrementally reduce the interest rate that accrues to borrowers.", "P.L. 115-334 amends certain definitions of rural used to determine eligibility for RD programs. It amends the definition of rural for certain housing and broadband programs to exclude incarcerated populations and the first 1,500 people residing on a military base. It also increases to 50,000 the maximum population of communities eligible for guaranteed loans under the Community Facilities and Water and Waste Disposal programs. The law reestablishes the position of Under Secretary of Agriculture for Rural Development as a permanent position within USDA, subject to Senate confirmation. USDA had eliminated the position in 2017 and replaced it with the Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development, a position that did not require Senate confirmation.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), through its Rural Development agency (RD), administers a broad portfolio of programs focused on rural housing, rural infrastructure, and rural business and employment. Congress considers reauthorizing and amending many of these programs in periodic farm bills. The most recent is the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 farm bill, P.L. 115-334 ). The 2018 farm bill generally authorizes programs and funding levels for the period FY2019-FY2023, though some provisions apply to different periods, such as FY2019-FY2025.", "Since 1973, farm bills have included a title dedicated to rural development. The Rural Development title (Title VI) of the 2018 farm bill generally addresses (1) rural infrastructure, including housing, electrical generation and transmission, water and wastewater, and more recently, broadband deployment; (2) rural economic development; and (3) rural business creation and expansion. The Miscellaneous title (Title XII) also includes certain rural development provisions related to RD personnel, federal task forces or working groups, and other federal rural development programs. Programs authorized in other titles of P.L. 115-334 may benefit rural areas, especially rural areas with economies reliant on agriculture. However, most rural development provisions in the Rural Development and Miscellaneous titles specifically target rural areas.", "A number of issues influenced the rural development provisions of the 2018 farm bill. Many rural communities have experienced decreasing populations over the last decade. In addition, some rural residents struggle to access employment opportunities, especially in high-wage jobs. The ongoing opioid crisis and an increasing number of rural hospital closures have raised concerns about the health of rural residents. Aging infrastructure, such as electric or drinking water infrastructure, also presents a challenge to some rural communities. The digital divide \u00e2\u0080\u0094lower rates of broadband access in rural areas compared to urban areas\u00e2\u0080\u0094has raised concerns that rural residents may be less able to access opportunities and services such as distance learning, telemedicine, and e-commerce. In addition, policymakers and scholars have increasingly examined regional approaches to rural economic development rather than approaches focused on individual communities.", "The 2018 farm bill includes new provisions and programs related to rural broadband deployment, health care, and community development. The law also reauthorizes and amends existing programs related to broadband deployment, other rural infrastructure, and community development. P.L. 115-334 amends multiple definitions of rural used to determine eligibility for RD programs. The law also amends programs that address regional approaches to rural economic development. Further, P.L. 115-334 repeals some rural development programs and makes technical corrections to statutory language authorizing other programs.", "This report provides a brief overview of federal rural development programs. It then analyzes issues that influenced the development of rural development provisions in the 2018 farm bill. Next, the report details new rural development programs and entities created and changes made to existing rural development programs, in P.L. 115-334 .

Three agencies comprise RD: the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, the Rural Housing Service, and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS). RD programs are largely loan and grant programs that assist communities with small populations to finance development projects.", "Many RD programs have statutory authority in the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act of 1972 (the ConAct, P.L. 87-128) or the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.). RD programs typically rely on annual appropriations for funding, but omnibus farm bills also authorize mandatory funding for some RD programs. The most recent of these, the 2018 farm bill, reauthorizes or amends existing RD programs and authorizes new RD programs by amending the ConAct, the Rural Electrification Act, or other authorizing legislation. The 2018 farm bill also authorizes some rural development programs or entities administered outside USDA. For example, the law authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a new task force on precision agriculture connectivity.

Additionally, over 1,300 nonmetropolitan counties experienced population loss ( Figure 2 ). While the overall U.S. rural population declined, rates of population change varied among rural areas. Populations declined in many rural counties dependent on agriculture and manufacturing, while populations increased in many rural counties dependent on recreation. Population decline results from a combination of out-migration, declining birth rates, and increased mortality. Research has attributed rural out-migration to many factors, including lack of employment opportunities and less access to education, health care, and cultural amenities. Congress sought to address rural population decline in the 2018 farm bill through rural infrastructure, business development, and community development.", "Historically, agriculture and rural policy were closely linked due to the high percentage of rural Americans employed in agriculture. This link has weakened due to the changing nature of rural employment. In 2017, the agriculture sector accounted for 5.6% of rural jobs, down from 6.8% in 2001. In addition, USDA estimates that approximately 80% of total farm household income in 2019 will come from off-farm activities. Manufacturing has also been an important source of employment in rural areas, being responsible for a larger share of jobs in rural counties than in urban counties. In 2017, manufacturing employed 10.8% of the rural workforce, declining from 14.1% in 2001. Congress sought to address rural employment in the 2018 farm bill through entrepreneurship, business development, broadband deployment, and access to credit.", "Rural health issues also influenced the 2018 farm bill's rural development provisions. Policymakers continue to look for solutions to address the opioid epidemic that began in the 1990s. Though this epidemic has affected urban, suburban, and rural areas, the drug overdose death rate in rural areas increased at a faster rate than in urban areas between 1990 and 2015. In addition, many scholars and interest groups have asserted that the federal government's approach to mitigating the opioid crisis in rural areas should differ from the strategy for urban areas. While federal, state, and local governments have addressed the epidemic, drug overdose rates remain high. In addition, a rise in the number of rural hospital closures has increased concerns about access to health care in rural areas. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), 64 rural hospitals closed between 2013 and 2017, more than twice as many as during the previous five-year period. These hospital closures will likely result in rural residents having to travel greater distances for emergency medical care. In the 2018 farm bill, Congress included provisions related to refinancing of rural hospital debt, funding for opioid abuse prevention and treatment, and coordination of federal rural health efforts.", "Aging infrastructure continues to be a concern for rural areas. According to GAO, \"many rural communities face significant challenges in financing the costs of replacing or upgrading aging and obsolete drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.\" Because communities typically pay for drinking water infrastructure through rates charged to users, more sparsely populated communities have difficulty financing major infrastructure construction or upgrades. Some rural communities also lack the resources to assess infrastructure needs. Similar challenges exist to upgrading and maintaining rural housing and electricity infrastructure. The 2018 farm bill includes provisions related to rural infrastructure loan and grant programs, technical assistance for infrastructure planning, and prioritizing water infrastructure funding to address a public health crisis. ", "Additionally, scholars and policymakers have asserted that access to broadband internet is important for economic and community development in rural areas. According to the most recent FCC deployment data, as of December 2017, 26% of Americans in rural areas and 32% of Americans on tribal lands lack access to broadband at speeds of at least 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload. In comparison, 1.7% of Americans in urban areas lack access to broadband at 25/3 Mbps. The 2018 farm law includes provisions related to broadband deployment, federal program coordination, and the use of broadband for precision agriculture. ", "Some scholars and policymakers increasingly support a regional approach to rural economic development. Rather than focus on individual towns or communities, which may compete for jobs and residents, a regional approach draws on the strengths and opportunities of different localities within a region and involves coordination across communities.

Section 12511 directs the FCC to establish a task force on precision agriculture . Duties of the task force include identifying and measuring current gaps in broadband internet access on agricultural land and making policy recommendations to promote broadband deployment on unserved agricultural land.", "Section 6419 authorizes USDA to make grants to eligible entities to provide technical assistance and training to support applications for Rural Business-Cooperative Service programs . Eligible entities may use grants to assist communities in planning for business and economic development needs, identifying public and private financing options, and preparing applications and materials to request financial assistance. The law authorizes appropriations of $5 million per year for the program for FY2019-FY2023. Section 6302 directs USDA to provide technical assistance to t ribal entities to improve the entities' access to RD programs. The provision requires technical assistance to address the unique challenges faced by tribal governments, producers, businesses, and tribally designated housing entities in accessing RD programs. ", "Section 12510 directs USDA to establish Tribal Promise Zones that are to receive priority consideration for federal grant programs and initiatives. Criteria for Tribal Promise Zones include unemployment rates, poverty rates, vacancy rates, household income, and the effectiveness of a competitiveness plan submitted by nominating entities. Prior to the 2018 farm bill's enactment, the federal government had designated certain tribal areas as Tribal Promise Zones under an existing Promise Zones initiative at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

Under prior law, this threshold was 15% of households. Increases the minimum acceptable broadband speeds for the program from 4/1 Mbps to 25/3 Mbps. These minimum speeds determine both eligibility criteria and buildout requirements. USDA uses the minimum speeds to determine whether areas lack sufficient broadband service and are therefore eligible for program funding (see above two bullet points). USDA also requires all loan or grant recipients to provide broadband service that meets the minimum speeds. Directs USDA to prioritize applications that serve communities with a population of fewer than 10,000 residents; serve communities experiencing out-migration; provide broadband to cropland and ranchland for use in precision agriculture; and were developed with, and received funding from, community stakeholders, among other prioritization criteria.
