{"id": "R42591", "title": "The 2014 Farm Bill: Changing the Treatment of LIHEAP Receipt in the Calculation of SNAP Benefits", "released_date": "2014-02-12T00:00:00", "summary": ["The Agricultural Act of 2014 (\"the 2014 farm bill\") was enacted on February 7, 2014. Included in the law's reauthorization of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a change to how Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) payments are treated in the calculation of SNAP benefits. This change is expected to reduce some households' monthly benefit amounts, particularly households in states that have adopted the so-called \"Heat and Eat\" practice, where states leverage a nominal LIHEAP benefit into a larger SNAP benefit. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that this change will reduce SNAP spending by approximately $8.6 billion over the 10-year budget window of FY2014-FY2023. Based on CBO's May 2013 baseline, this is approximately a 1% reduction in forecasted program spending over the 10-year period.", "SNAP law provides for both eligibility rules and, for eligible households, benefit calculation rules. The SNAP statute allows for certain deductions from income when calculating a household's monthly benefit amount; one of these deductions is the \"excess shelter deduction,\" which incorporates utility costs. If a family incurs heating and/or cooling expenses, this deduction from income can be higher than for households not incurring these expenses, allowing for a higher SNAP benefit for the household. One way households can document heating and cooling expenses is by showing receipt of LIHEAP assistance. Under prior law, any amount of LIHEAP assistance could increase benefit amounts; under the 2014 farm bill change, LIHEAP assistance will have to be greater than $20 per year in order to be included in a household's benefit calculation.", "In SNAP benefit calculation, a LIHEAP payment documents that the household has incurred heating and cooling costs. This documentation triggers a standard utility allowance (SUA), a figure intended to represent typical state-specific utility costs, which enters into the SNAP benefit calculation equation. (Most states use an SUA, but some opt not to and use only actual utility costs.) Unless the household is receiving the maximum SNAP benefit already, a household's monthly benefit can increase if the inclusion of an SUA results in an excess shelter deduction. Proof of heating or cooling expenses will trigger a higher SUA than proof of only telephone or water expenses. The higher SUA then gets factored into the calculation of a household's excess shelter deduction. In many cases, the higher the excess shelter deduction, the higher the monthly SNAP benefit will be.", "The 2014 farm bill's change is expected to impact the \"Heat and Eat\" practice. Approximately 16 states provide nominal LIHEAP benefits through a \"Heat and Eat\" practice. \"Heat and Eat\" is a phrase that the low-income and anti-hunger advocacy community has used to describe state and program policies that leverage nominal (as little as 10 cents) LIHEAP payments into an increase in households' SNAP benefits that is larger than the initial LIHEAP payment. Also, a 17th state allows SNAP applicants to benefit from an SUA if the household applies for LIHEAP. Thus, the farm bill is expected to change 17 states' administration of SNAP and is expected to reduce some households' benefit amounts.", "The 2014 farm bill's change in the law will require more than $20 a year in LIHEAP assistance in order to trigger the potential increase in benefits. The exact implementation timeline, details, and share of households affected will depend upon the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service's (USDA-FNS) interpretation and implementation of the policy, the options states choose in their implementation, and the share of households that will be able to document their heating and cooling expenses in other ways.", "Congress's final decision to change the law came after the passage of related proposals in both the House and the Senate. The 113th Congress's Senate-passed farm bill (S. 954) would have set a $10 threshold for LIHEAP payments to confer this potential advantage. The House-passed farm bill (H.R. 2642 combined with H.R. 3102) included the $20 threshold."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["After over two years of deliberations, spanning the 112 th and 113 th Congresses, the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the \"2014 farm bill\") was enacted on February 7, 2014. Within this omnibus reauthorization of dozens of agricultural and nutrition statutes, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps) was reauthorized. While the reauthorization maintained the vast majority of prior law eligibility and benefit calculation policies, the new law does change the impact of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in the calculation of SNAP monthly benefit amounts. ", "Under prior law, SNAP recipients who also receive benefits from LIHEAP may have received increased SNAP benefits, no matter the amount of LIHEAP received. Under the 2014 farm bill, LIHEAP can only impact a household's benefit if a household receives more than $20 a year. This policy contained in the farm bill conference agreement follows similar changes in the Senate- and House-passed bills, with the Senate passing a $10 threshold and the House passing a $20 threshold. ", "Because SNAP benefits are 100% federally funded and because SNAP is an open-ended entitlement, policy changes to benefit amounts or eligibility can generate substantial changes in spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that this LIHEAP-related change included in the 2014 farm bill would reduce SNAP spending by approximately $8.6 billion over the 10-year budget window of FY2014-FY2023. (Although this change is similar to the House-passed proposal, it is estimated to impact spending slightly less due to the timing of implementation. ) ", "Throughout the formulation of the new farm bill, reauthorization proposals focused on deficit reduction as well as agricultural program reforms. At issue throughout the process was whether and/or to what extent a reauthorization of SNAP should reduce program spending, affect eligibility, or affect benefit amounts. ", "Supporters of the changes to LIHEAP's treatment in SNAP have framed it as a policy to improve SNAP integrity, assuring that LIHEAP is treated uniformly across all states and according to congressional intent. Detractors argue that ending the so-called \"Heat and Eat\" practice reduces benefits for those in need. ", "In addition to the significance of this provision for the farm bill's cost estimate, the newly enacted policy is complex, and it can be difficult to untangle how the farm bill change would work and which states and households may be affected.

Under the 2014 farm bill, using LIHEAP to document heating and cooling costs is limited to payments of more than $20. ", " Figure 2 depicts an overview of LIHEAP's role in the SNAP benefit calculation, namely that receiving such energy assistance can result in a larger monthly SNAP benefit. Under the 2014 farm bill's change, it will take greater than $20 in assistance for LIHEAP to have any impact. The discussion after Figure 2 elaborates on the definitions of various deductions used in calculating SNAP benefits, potentially including LIHEAP receipt, and how they interact in the benefit calculation process.", "As shown earlier in Figure 1 , the amount of SNAP benefits that an eligible household receives is based, in part, on the maximum benefit and also in part on the household's net income. The SNAP agency computes net monthly income by subtracting certain \"deductions\" from a household's basic (or gross) monthly income. This calculation is based on the recognition that not all of a household's income is available for food purchases. Thus, a standard portion of income, plus amounts that represent costs such as dependent care expenses or high non-food living expenses, are deducted from the gross income.", "For households without an elderly or disabled member, net monthly income equals gross monthly income minus the following deductions, if applicable:", "Standard deduction: A \"standard\" monthly deduction that varies by household size and is indexed for inflation.

This deduction is capped for households that do not contain an elderly or disabled member. 2014 FARM BILL NOTE: Under prior law, households that receive LIHEAP could automatically qualify for a higher SUA, no matter the amount of LIHEAP received . The higher SUA is based on the assumption that households incur expenses for heating and cooling.

The methodology and the amounts of an SUA vary by state, and many states have several different utility allowances based upon whether a household incurs heating/cooling costs or not. An SUA often \"tips the scale\" toward enabling an applicant household to qualify for an excess shelter deduction, which in many cases will result in an increased monthly benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background on LIHEAP", "paragraphs": ["LIHEAP is a formula grant program under which the federal government gives annual grants to states, tribes, and territories (collectively referred to in this report as \"states\") to operate home energy assistance programs for low-income households. States may use funds to help eligible households pay for heating and cooling costs, for crisis assistance, and to weatherize their homes. Both renters and homeowners are eligible for LIHEAP. Federal LIHEAP requirements are minimal and leave most important program decisions to the states, including eligibility guidelines, types of assistance provided, and benefit levels.", "Regarding eligibility , states may set maximum LIHEAP eligibility for households up to 150% of the federal poverty income guidelines (or, if greater, 60% of the state median income), but they may not go below 110% of the poverty guidelines. States may also choose to make eligible for LIHEAP assistance any household of which at least one member is a recipient of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) , or certain needs-tested veterans' programs. In terms of benefits , states decide the types of assistance that households receive and the amount. For example, while all states provide heating assistance, only a portion of states provide assistance for cooling. The amount of benefits also varies; in FY2008, the most recent year for which information is available from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the average annual LIHEAP benefit for heating assistance was $293 with a range from $73 to $1,172. HHS does not have data indicating the number of households receiving payments at or below $20.", "Unlike SNAP, LIHEAP is not an open-ended entitlement, and funding is not sufficient to assist every household that is eligible for the program.

The period of certification is based on state choices within a federal framework. The new law indicates that when a new SNAP household applies for benefits, if that is 30 days after the law's enactment, the benefits will be calculated based on the $20 threshold rule, but for households already receiving SNAP it will be only when they apply to recertify that their benefit calculation will be subject to the $20 rule.
