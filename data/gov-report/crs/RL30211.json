As aresult, Foreign Operations spending measures increasingly have expanded their scopebeyond spending issues and played a major role in shaping, authorizing, and guidingboth executive and congressional foreign aid and broader foreign policy initiatives. It has been largely through Foreign Operations appropriations that the United Stateshas modified aid policy and resource allocation priorities since the end of the ColdWar.

Foreign aidspending cuts were especially sharp in FY1996 when Congress cut funding by $1.15billion, nearly 9% from the previous year. Many government and non-governmentexperts argued that these budget reductions seriously undermined U.S. foreign policyinterests and limited the ability of American officials to influence overseas events. After Foreign Operations funding levels fell again in FY1997 -- although by muchsmaller amounts -- the State Department and other executive agencies launched anaggressive campaign in to reverse the decade-long decline in the foreign policybudget. This effort coincided with congressional approval of a near $1 billionincrease for FY1998, setting Foreign Operations appropriations at $13.15 billion.

The first period was marked by a steady growth in Foreign Operationsappropriations levels during the early 1980s when the United States rapidly expandedsecurity-related aid programs in Central America, Pakistan, and to countriesproviding the U.S. with military bases. Funding peaked in FY1985 at $31.9 billion(in FY1999 dollars) followed by a sharp cut in FY1986 as the effects of theGramm-Rudman deficit reduction initiative took hold and limited federal spendingin most areas.

H.R. 3422 stipulates, however, thatnone of the funds for Kosovo are to be used for large scale infrastructure projects orbe available until the President certifies that the U.S. commitment at a late-1999Kosovo donor pledging conference does not exceed 15% of totalpledges.", "Child Survival and Disease programs -- H.R. 3422 provides a separate account, as proposed by the House, at $715 million forchildren and infectious disease activities. Overall, the revised Foreign Operationsbill increases the account from the \"base\" FY1999 appropriation of $650 million andthe amended $700 million FY2000 request.

The President's budgethad proposed accelerating to $150 million the ten-year, $100 million per year pacefor reducing U.S. assistance to the two countries that Congress began last year. Thebill increases the request by $50 million, restoring the ten-year, $100 million peryear reduction. Under the H.R. 3422 , Israel will receive $2.88 billionand Egypt $2.035 billion. In addition, the bill earmarks $225 million for Jordan, asrequested.", "In many other areas, the revised Foreign Operations bill increases spending levels that had led to the President's veto of H.R. 2606 :", "Wye River accord. H.R. 3422 provides full funding of $1.8 billion through FY2002 for the Middle East peace pledge made byPresident Clinton in late 1998. At the time, the U.S. committed $900 million forFY1999, $500 million for FY2000, and $500 million for FY2001 in additionalassistance to Israel Jordan, and the Palestinians. During a period when little progresswas made by the parties in implementing the Wye accord, Congress approved in May1999 only $100 million for Jordan in the FY1999 Supplemental Appropriations. With the more recent meetings between President Clinton and newly elected IsraeliPrime Minister Ehud Barak, the Administration once again pressed Congress toapprove expeditiously the remaining Wye accord aid pledges. H.R. 3422 further adds an additional $25 million in military aid for Egypt. Although notlinked with the Wye accords, the Administration had requested for FY2000 thatCongress approve early disbursement of some of Egypt's military aid that could bedeposited into an interest bearing account that would enhance Egypt's aid package. This would be similar to an arrangement extended for several years to Israel. Because of budget limitations and the outlay impact of early disbursement of funds,Congress rejected the proposal in H.R. 2606 . The $25 million includedin H.R. 3422 represents roughly the amount of interest Egypt wouldhave earned under the early disbursement plan.", "Aid to Russia and nuclear weapons safeguards. A top Administration priority has been $241 million for its Expanded Threat Reductionprogram, a counter-proliferation initiative in the former states of the Soviet Union. The amounts approved in H.R. 2606 for Russia and other independentstates -- $735 million -- would have jeopardized funding for the threat reductionproject, plus squeezed aid for Russia and some of the other countries in the region. H.R. 3422 adds $104 million for the account, bringing the total to $839million, and specifically earmarks $241 million for the counter-proliferationinitiative. The new bill continues other provisions from H.R. 2606 bysetting aid targets of $180 million for Ukraine, $95 million for Georgia, and $90million for Armenia. Even with the additional funding, bilateral economic aid forRussia and several other countries in the region are likely to fall below requestedlevels, and perhaps below FY1999 amounts.", "Multilateral development bank funding. Multilateral assistance, funded within title IV of the Foreign Operations appropriation receivedone of the deepest cuts under the terms of H.R. 2606 -- over $500million, or one-third less than requested. H.R. 3422 , restores $233million to title IV, including $150 million for the World Bank's InternationalDevelopment Association (IDA). Congress initially cut the $803 million request to$625 million, primarily due to disagreement with Bank policy over extending a loanto China that would involve the resettlement of poor Chinese farmers into atraditionally Tibetan area. The new Foreign Operations measure also fully funds($128 million) the African Development Fund and increases from $1 million to $4.1million resources for the U.S. to subscribe to a new African Development Bankreplenishment. H.R. 3422 also adds $16 million for the Inter-AmericanInvestment Corporation, funding that was not provided in H.R. 2606 . U.S. voluntary contributions to international organizations received an additional $13million, funds that most likely will be used to increase payments to the U.N.Development Program. The amount and terms of a $25 million Americancontribution to the U.N. Population Fund did not change under the revised ForeignOperations bill.

ESF, a bilateral economic aid channel through which the United States extends support largely forpolitical and security purposes, had been cut significantly under H.R. 2606 , except for Middle East recipients. After subtracting earmarks for Israel, Egypt,Jordan, and Lebanon, the vetoed Foreign Operations measure had reduced thePresident's request for all other ESF activities by roughly 45%. Most vulnerablewould have been aid programs in Haiti, Guatemala, Cambodia, and Indonesia, aswell as a series of regional human rights, democracy building, environment, andother global issue initiatives. H.R. 3422 restores $168.5 million to theESF account, leaving a more modest $95 million, or 17%shortfall.", "USAID operating expenses. Under H.R. 2606 , Congress approved the Senate-passed level of $495 million for the costs of staffsalaries and living expenses overseas for the primary U.S. bilateral aid agency. Agency officials argued that without higher funding, they would be forced to initiatea reduction-in-force as had occurred in 1997. Moreover, USAID continues to beplagued by ineffective financial management systems and failed attempts to replacethem.

Under the terms of the conference agreement of H.R. 2606 , Peace Corps funding was cut to $235 million, $35 millionless than the request and $5 million under FY1999 levels. H.R. 3422 restores some of the reduction by adding $10 million. The $245 million FY2000appropriation, however, will still fall short of the Administration's goal of achievinga 10,000 volunteer Peace Corps.", "In a few areas, the third Foreign Operations bill does not substantially alter funding shortfalls that had been approved in the vetoed H.R. 2606 . Themost significant, from the Administration's perspective, is debt relief for the world'spoorest nations. In the original budget request submitted in early 1999, the Presidentsought $120 million for debt reduction, including funds for U.S. participation in the World Bank/IMF managed Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiativedesigned to provide extensive reduction of debts owed to both bilateral governmentsand multilateral institutions.", "Following a G-7 agreement in June and World Bank/IMF endorsement in September to significantly expand HIPC, the President asked Congress on September21 to increase debt relief funding to $370 million in FY2000, plus $600 million forFY2001-2003. The conference agreement on H.R. 2606 included only$33 million for debt cancellation, none of which could be used for helping reducemultilateral debt. The revised H.R. 3422 increases debt relief fundingby $90 million, all of which must be used for bilateral reduction. HIPC proponentsfear that if the United States does not contribute to the multilateral portion of theHIPC initiative, other bilateral donors will follow, leaving a large funding shortfallfor HIPC implementation. Although the White House did not achieve full fundingfor debt relief, Congress agreed in a separate bill, H.R. 3425 (that is alsoenacted by reference to the Consolidated Appropriations Act), to authorize U.S.support for an IMF off-market sale of gold that would finance the Fund's ability towrite-down poor country debts.", "In perhaps the most controversial provision included in H.R. 3422 , the White House agreed to accept restrictions on international family planningpolicy that prohibit U.S. grants to private foreign non-governmental and multilateralorganizations that either perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws inforeign countries. The President can waive the restrictions for up to $15 million ingrants, but if he does, population aid funding declines from $385 million to $372.5million. The restrictions apply only to FY2000 and will expire on September 30,2000. Although the President exercised his waiver authority on November 30, 1999,and instructed USAID to minimize any adverse impact the provision might have onU.S.-funded family planning programs, the legislation represents the first time in 15years of heated congressional debate that such restrictions have been enacted intolaw. Critics of abortion restrictions are concerned primarily about the precedent thatthis sets and the effect it will have on another contentious debate in Congress nextyear when the current restrictions expire. The White House reluctantly agreed to theabortion conditions when congressional leaders refused to approve funds to pay offU.S. arrears to the United Nations unless the restrictions were also added.", "Another funding reduction in H.R. 2606 not addressed in H.R. 3422 is for the Inter-American Foundation . The IAF is a small,independent grass-roots aid organization supporting projects in Latin America since1969. Under both H.R. 2606 and H.R. 3196 , the IAF willreceive $5 million in FY2000, less than a quarter of the Administration's $22.3million request. Further, the bills authorize the President to abolish the IAF nextyear. The Foundation had been heavily criticized for recent managementirregularities and for the continuation of funding for certain NGOs that had beeninvolved in the kidnaping of Americans in 1997.", "The third Foreign Operations bill further does not include funding for two emerging foreign aid initiatives that the Administration had announced earlier itwould pursue during the final budget negotiations. Although the executive branchnever submitted formal requests, it had consulted extensively with congressionalcommittees for additional funds for Balkan reconstruction and stabilization effortsand counter-narcotics programs in Colombia. As noted above, both H.R. 2606 and H.R. 3422 provide more for Balkan andKosovo assistance than requested by the Administration earlier in 1999. But thereremains about a $300-$400 million gap between amounts provided in H.R. 3422 and what the executive wants to pledge for reconstructionneeds. Presumably, the Balkan aid package will come before Congress in 2000 aspart of a supplemental to provide additional DOD costs of peacekeeping operationsin the region. For counter-narcotics, an initiative with strong congressional support, H.R. 3422 increases spending by $20 million for FY2000. Nevertheless,this remains far short of preliminary proposals recommending $1 billion-$1.5 billionfor Colombia and the Andean region over three years.", "Two non-funding, but controversial policy issues that had been narrowly approved during House and Senate floor debate and settled by conferees in H.R. 2606 , are continued unchanged in H.R. 3422 :", "School of the Americas.

The School trains Latin American military officers, drawing onIMET for some of its operating costs, although most of its funding comes fromDefense Department money. Critics of the school contend that it has trained someof the most ruthless human rights violators among Latin American militaries,especially during the 1970s and 1980s. The Administration, which argues that theSchool's curriculum has been overhauled during the 1990s and is designed topromote the observance of human rights principles by its graduates, strongly opposedthe House amendment. Prior to releasing funds to the School, however, H.R. 3422 requires the President to issue certain certifications regardingthe curriculum at the School of the Americas.", "Silk Road Strategy Act. The new Foreign Operations bill includes the Senate-passed text authorizing aid programs for the South Caucuses andCentral Asia -- the so-called Silk Road Strategy Act. As originally offered duringSenate debate by Senator Brownback, the text would have allowed the President towaive the ban of non-humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan found in Section 907 of theFreedom Support Act. An amendment by Senator McConnell and others, however,struck the waiver provision (53-45), thereby maintaining the Section 907 restriction. The House had approved similar legislation, including retention of Section 907, ina separate bill, H.R. 1152 .", "Offsets for Higher Foreign Operations Spending. A congressional and White House priority foradditional FY2000 funding in any spending measure has been to package them insuch a way that the total amount does not exceed discretionary spending caps or drawon budget surpluses derived from Social Security payments. The $2.624 billionadd-on for Foreign Operations is offset in two ways. First, the Wye River/MiddleEast Peace package is designated as an emergency which means none of the $1.825billion will count against the discretionary caps. To offset the outlay impact of theadditional spending, something that could potentially dip into the Social Securitysurplus, H.R. 3422 limits to $1.37 billion the amount that Israel canreceive earlier than it would otherwise of its total $1.92 billion military aid transfers. For many years, Congress has approved the immediate transfer of economicassistance to Israel that could then be invested in interest-bearing accounts beforeIsrael needed the funds to service debts owed the United States. Several years ago,Congress extended this benefit by allowing the early disbursement -- and the outlay-- of $1.8 billion in annual U.S. military aid. Normally, for other countries little orno military assistance would be drawn upon in the year it was appropriated, andtherefore, would not result in any outlays. Consequently, the lower outlays estimatedunder H.R. 3422 because Israel will not receive $550 million in earlydisbursement of military aid fully offsets the outlay impact of funding for the WyeRiver accord and other foreign aid spending.

Many of these policy provisions take the form of conditions or restrictionson how the President can use money included in the spending bill. Many of theseprovisions are opposed by the Administration as excessively limiting his ability tomanage American foreign policy.

Since the end of the Cold War, a recurring debate has focusedon what should replace the anti-communist foreign aid rationale of the past 50 years. A more fundamental question raised by some, especially critics of developmentassistance, is whether the United States needs to maintain an active, globally focusedeconomic aid program. Many of these critics argue that aid can be transformed intoa smaller, more targeted, and often privatized instrument to support only the highestpriority U.S. foreign policy interests.", "Although there has been no definitive consensus on priorities, the Clinton Administration has strongly supported the retention of an activist foreign aid policywhich can be used to bolster a variety of U.S. foreign policy initiatives around theworld. In early 1994, USAID released its blueprint for a post-Cold War developmentaid policy, based around the goal of \"sustainable development,\" and its four strategiesof promoting economic growth, stabilizing global population, protecting theenvironment, and advancing democracy. More recently, USAID added a fifthstrategy aimed at developing human capacity through education.", "Since adopting these strategies in 1994, USAID has maintained that they operate as inter-linked, mutually reinforcing elements of an overall U.S. effort to promote theadvancement of market economies and democratic transitions in developing nations. Officials argue that U.S. aid is justified until countries reach a point of sustainabilitythat no longer requires external aid. Funding reductions, congressional restrictions,and fluctuating Administration priorities, however, have required USAID to alter themix of resources devoted to each of the strategies, raising questions over whether theintegrative, mutually reinforcing principles can be maintained. Congress, forexample, limited development aid for population programs in FYs1996-99 to roughlytwo-thirds of the amount provided in FY1995. (See below for more discussion onfamily planning restrictions.) Further, the State Department's Bureau of GlobalAffairs places a high priority on environment programs and presses USAID toallocate the maximum amount possible to such activities. As a result, theenvironment sector of sustainable development likely has not declined as much as itmight have otherwise.", "At the center of this issue for the past four years has been differences between Congress and the executive branch regarding funding levels for programs supportingchild survival, basic education, and efforts against HIV/AIDs and other infectiousdiseases. Despite cutting overall development aid in FYs1996-97 by about 23% fromFY1995 levels, Congress earmarked children and disease programs at amounts equalto or somewhat greater than those allocated in FY1995, making the cuts on all otherelements of sustainable development closer to 30%. Congress boosted developmentaid appropriations for FY1999 by about $20 million beyond the President's request,but lawmakers set funding targets for child survival and infectious disease activitiesat about $460 million, $85 million more than the Administration proposed.

Another aspect of the discussion regarding policypriorities of U.S. development aid is the continuing controversy regardinginternational family planning restrictions. For FY2000, the President sought $400million for USAID population programs, a $15 million increase over FY1999 levels. The principal dispute over population assistance, however, goes well beyond fundingissues, centering more directly on abortion-related activities of foreign recipients ofUSAID grants. For over a decade, Congress has engaged in contentious debates overU.S. international family planning policy, often as part of the Foreign OperationsAppropriations. Twice, congressional positions on this issue have been one of themajor reasons prompting a presidential veto.", "U.S. international family planning programs had been one of the largest growth areas of the foreign aid budget in the 1990s. From an average of about $250 millionin the late 1980s, FY1995 spending across all Foreign Operations accounts totaledapproximately $548 million. In the following years, when Congress deadlocked overabortion-related restrictions and U.S. population aid policy, a situation that blockedmovement of the entire Foreign Operations bill, lawmakers adopted interimprovisions that, among other things, strictly limited the amount of funding forUSAID family planning programs. The appropriation cap of $385 million enacted ineach of FY1997-1999 is roughly two-thirds the amount provided in FY1995. As aresult of the impasse over abortion restrictions, Congress established a delayedtimetable for making these funds available, a schedule that included monthlyapportionments or \"metering\" of the appropriation.", "A second issue in the population aid debate, and one directly connected to funding reductions and metering of the past four years, deals with abortionrestrictions and the eligibility requirements for foreign organizations receiving fundsto implement U.S.-sponsored family planning programs. During the mid-1980s, inwhat has become known as the \"Mexico City\" policy, the Reagan, and later the Bush,Administration, restricted funds for foreign non-governmental organizations thatwere involved in performing or promoting abortions in countries where they worked,even if such activities were undertaken with non-U.S. funds. Several groups,including International Planned Parenthood Federation-London (IPPF), becameineligible for U.S. financial support. In some years, Congress narrowly approvedmeasures to overturn this prohibition, but White House vetoes kept the policy inplace. President Clinton in 1993 reversed the position of his two predecessors,allowing the United States to resume funding for all family planning organizationsso long as U.S. money was not used in abortion-related work.", "During the past four years, the House and Senate have taken opposing positions on the Mexico City issue that in each case held up enactment of the final ForeignOperations spending measure. The House position, sponsored by RepresentativeSmith (N.J.) and others, supported reinstatement of the Mexico City policy restrictingU.S. aid funds to foreign organizations involved in performing abortions or inlobbying to change abortion laws or policies in foreign countries. The Senate, on theother side, has rejected House provisions dealing with Mexico City policy, favoringa policy that leaves these decisions in the hands of the Administration. Moreover,Administration officials have stated that President Clinton would veto any bills thatinclude the House-passed Mexico City restrictions, a threat he carried out in October1998 when he rejected legislation authorizing family planning programs that includedMexico City policy ( H.R. 1757 ).", "Unable to reach an agreement satisfactory to both sides, Congress has adopted interim arrangements for FY1996-1999 that do not resolve the broad populationprogram controversy, but has permitted the stalled Foreign Operations measure tomove forward. It was hoped that the arrangement, which neither side liked, wouldprovide incentives for those involved in the debate to find a middle ground. Underthe terms of the FY1999 temporary arrangement, as included in P.L. 105-277 ,Congress deleted the House-supported Mexico City restrictions, limited populationaid funding to $385 million, down from $435 million passed by the Senate, anddelayed, or \"metered\" the availability of the funds at a rate of one-twelfth of the $385million per month.", "Congress further enacted for FY1999 a ban on U.S. contributions to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA), a prohibition that had been in place during the Reaganand Bush Administrations but which was lifted by President Clinton in 1993. Atissue are UNFPA programs in China, a country where there have been continuingreports for many years of coercive family planning practices. During the mid-1990s,Congress reduced UNFPA contributions by an amount the organization spent inChina, but when UNFPA ended its China program in 1997, the controversy subsided. UNFPA, however, reinstituted activities in China soon thereafter, resulting in thewithholding in FY1998 of $5 million for UNFPA and the enactment for FY1999 ofa total prohibition on the U.S. $25 million contribution, so long as the organizationremained active in China. Nevertheless, the Clinton Administration sought $25million for the UNFPA in FY2000.

USAID maintains a policyof strict voluntarism for family planning programs it supports, and opposes the useof performance-based quota systems. The Agency says that Peru's government hasinstituted significant reforms in its family planning programs, including criteria thatensure voluntary informed consent. To reinforce U.S. policies opposing programsbased on coercive practices or quota systems, Congress adopted for FY1999 anamendment by Representative Tiahrt that more precisely defines the term, voluntary family planning programs, and establishes criteria for USAID to apply regarding thevoluntary nature of its population projects.

The bill further earmarkedUNFPA funding at $25 million, as requested. ", "The House measure, like previous bills, capped family planning assistance at $385 million. But unlike enacted Foreign Operations laws the past few years, theHouse bill would not \"meter\" the availability of these funds.

The House also adopted (221-208) acounter amendment by Representative Greenwood permitting U.S. grants to foreignNGOs as long as they do not use U .S.-provided money to perform abortions orviolate abortion laws in foreign nations. The Greenwood amendment further requiressuch organizations to support programs that reduce the incidence of abortion as amethod of family planning. Because the Smith language is more restrictiveconcerning foreign NGO eligibility for receiving USAID grants, it would be theoperative text if both amendments are enacted. Requirements in the Greenwoodprovision that NGOs support programs reducing abortions as a method of familyplanning and adhere to abortion laws in foreign countries, nevertheless, would alsoapply should conferees adopt both positions. Theoretically, however, some foreignNGOs that would be eligible recipients of USAID grants under the Greenwoodamendment would be barred from receiving U.S. population aid under the Smithrestrictions. The White House said the President would veto any bill that includedthe Smith language.", "As has been the case in the past, the Foreign Operations conference committee meeting could not resolve the House-Senate differences on the family planning issue. Senate conferees insisted that UNFPA funding remain in the bill, while their Housecounterparts agreed to drop the modified Mexico City abortion restrictions containedin the Smith amendment if the UNFPA contribution was also removed. Followingfurther negotiations, conferees agreed to continue current law regarding populationaid funding levels and abortion restrictions -- that is, $385 million, metered on amonthly basis, but the deletion of both the Smith and Greenwood amendments. Theyalso added the $25 million UNFPA earmark, with conditions that passed the Houseand Senate. ", "The revised Foreign Operations bill ( H.R. 3422 ) makes no changes to the conference agreement of H.R. 2606 regarding UNFPA fundingand conditions, but the issue of abortion restrictions became one of the last and mostcontentious issues resolved in the final budget package. When congressional leadersrefused to include U.N. arrearage payments without revised Mexico City language,the White House reluctantly agreed to the abortion restrictions. This is the first timethat Mexico City restrictions are included in legislation. Under the terms of H.R. 3422 , private foreign non-governmental and multilateralorganizations that either perform abortions or lobby to change abortion laws inforeign countries are prohibited from receiving USAID population aid grants. ThePresident can waive the restrictions for up to $15 million in grants, but if he does,population aid funding declines from $385 million to $372.5 million. Therestrictions apply only to FY2000 and will expire on September 30, 2000. Althoughthe President used his waiver authority on November 30 and the impact onU.S.-funded family planning programs is expected to be minimal, critics of abortionrestrictions are concerned primarily about the precedent that is set and the effect itwill have on another contentious debate in Congress next year when the currentrestrictions expire.", "Regional Allocations of U.S. Foreign Aid and the Request for an Africa-specific Account. Although the Middle Easthas received by far the largest proportion of U.S. assistance over the past threedecades -- 55-63% of bilateral aid appropriated in Foreign Operations spendingmeasures in most years-- allocations to other regions have fluctuated considerably,especially since the end of the Cold War. Asia, which received substantial assistancein the 1980s associated with the presence of U.S. military bases in the Philippines,had its share drop to 16% to 4% by FY1997. Latin America, where CentralAmerican governments were confronted with internal conflict, had its share dropfrom 16% to 6%. Africa's proportion remained about the same -- 7-8% -- adevelopment that disappointed those who argued that the world's poorest regionshould receive higher priority, especially with the reduction in emphasis on securityassistance. U.S. aid to the emerging democracies and market-oriented economies inEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where the United States had noprograms prior to 1990, grew to represent 14% of American bilateral assistancefunded in the Foreign Operations bill for FY1997.", " Table 6.

Thiswas particularly true in the cases of Asia and Latin America, given the Asianfinancial crises and significant U.S. interests to promote economic development inLatin America in order to counter the trend of rising illegal immigration to the UnitedStates. Foreign Operations appropriations measures the past two years haveemphasized the need to maintain or increase assistance especially to Latin America. In the case of Africa, others argued that not enough has been reallocated to offersufficient help to meet the region's unmet needs and to promote future U.S.-Africantrade opportunities.", "As the share of bilateral Foreign Operations funding for the Middle East exceeded 60%, some in Congress began promoting the view that there should besome limits to the amount provided and that if the Administration wanted to pursuenew Middle East peace initiatives using foreign aid as an implementing tool,resources should be found within existing Middle East programs and not be takenfrom other regions.", "Accordingly, for FY1998 Congress took steps to legislate a cap on Foreign Operations resources for the Middle East. At the initiative of RepresentativeCallahan, Chairman of the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee, lawmakersstipulated in the FY1998 funding measure (Section 586 of P.L. 105-118 ) that selectedMiddle East nations and regional programs could not receive more than $5.4 billionof the total appropriation. Following this, Israel put forth in January 1998 a plan tocut its aid over the next ten to twelve years. The concept behind the Israeli initiativeto decrease assistance from the United States was first raised by Prime MinisterNetanyahu in a speech before a joint session of Congress on July 10, 1996. Asoutlined to congressional and Administration officials by Israeli Finance MinisterNeeman in late January 1998, the United States would cut economic aid by $120million each year for about ten years, while increasing military assistance by $60million annually. At the end of the period, Israel would be receiving an annualappropriation of $2.4 billion in military aid but no longer receiving any economicassistance. If done over a ten-year period, U.S. aid to Israel would fall $60 millioneach year in net terms, with a total savings of $600 million by 2009. For FY1999,Congress supported the $60 million net reduction of aid to Israel, also adding asimilar $40 economic aid cut for Egypt.", "The President's FY2000 Foreign Operations request reflected several of these regional allocation views expressed by Congress in recent years. Highlights of theAdministration's recommendations include the following.", "Creation of the Development Fund for Africa Account. After a three-year absence, the President askedCongress to re-establish a separate Foreign Operations account for African aid andto increase funding slightly over FY1999 levels. Ten years ago, Congress and theAdministration launched a joint initiative to create special legislative authority forU.S. economic aid to Africa. The Development Fund for Africa (DFA -- authorizedin Chapter 10 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961) was intended to extend moreflexibility to USAID program managers and to protect aid resources for Africa frombeing transferred to other regions as new foreign policy crises unfolded. At its peak,the United States channeled about $800 million annually through the DFA. ", "Although the DFA authorization law remained in force, Congress ended the practice of a direct DFA appropriation in FY1996, funding Africa's assistance out ofworldwide development aid and child survival accounts. Following PresidentClinton's visit to Africa in 1998, during which he pledged to restore U.S. aid tohigher levels provided in previous years, the Administration has proposed a directDFA appropriation account for FY2000. The budget includes $745 million forAfrican development aid, including funds from both the DFA and Child Survivalaccounts. Combined with funds requested under the Economic Support Fund, largelyfor democracy and economic growth initiatives, and smaller amounts of militaryassistance, the FY2000 budget includes $893 million for Africa. This compares toFY1999 allocations of $883 million.", "Increased Funding for Asia. The FY2000 foreign aid budget proposed significant increases in assistance programsthroughout the Asian region. The $424 million requested is nearly $100 million, or30% higher than allocations for FY1999. This represents the largest percentageincrease sought in the FY2000 foreign aid request for any of the five major regionsunder USAID's portfolio. Much of the increased funding is for a new East Asianeconomic recovery initiative. This multi-year plan, administered by USAID, wouldsupport job creation opportunities, social safety net programs, transparency andanti-corruption activities, and regional economic recovery programs. TheAdministration plans to spend about $53 million for the initiative out of bothdevelopment aid and ESF accounts. The Administration is also proposing anexpansion of various East and South Asian regional programs aimed at meetingglobal climate change goals and deterring forest and marine/coastal zone degradation,and promoting democratization and governance initiatives in South Asia. TheFY2000 budget request further includes a new item: a $5 million program to counterviolence against women and to promote increased participation by women in thepolitical process.", "Modest Increases for Most Latin America Programs; Central America Reconstruction Supplemental. Excludingcounter-narcotics assistance and emergency Central American hurricane relief, LatinAmerica would receive a modest increase in U.S. assistance for FY2000. (TheFY1999 Omnibus Appropriation Act included a separate emergency supplementalfor drug control programs -- most of which was earmarked for Colombia -- thatdoubled the regular counter-narcotics budget.) The $735 million proposed level forthe region is roughly 8% higher than the \"base\" allocations for FY1999, afteradjusting for the supplemental drug and Central America disaster funds.

ThePresident's FY2000 foreign aid request for the Middle East reduced slightly U.S.assistance to the region -- from $5.47 billion enacted for FY1999 to $5.24 billionproposed for next year. The $230 million reduction stemmed largely fromlarger-than-expected cuts in assistance for Israel and Egypt. Many assumed whenCongress first began this downsizing in FY1999, that phased cuts would continue ata steady pace of $100 million per year for ten years. The FY2000 proposal,however, recommends a cut of $150 million: $60 million for Egypt and $90 million(net) for Israel. Administration officials say that they still intend to follow theten-year time period, but that they have not established a firm pace at which amountswould be reduced. The budget also included a $1.9 billion supplemental/advanceappropriation proposal -- to be allocated over three years -- in support of the WyeMemorandum and the next phase in the Middle East peace process. The $1.9 billionWye Memorandum proposal would provide $900 million in FY1999 and an advanceappropriation of $500 million in both of FY2000 and FY2001. Israel would receive$1.2 billion, the Palestinians and Jordan, $400 million and $300 million, respectively.

As part of the accord, two new light water nuclear reactors will beconstructed -- financed largely by South Korea and Japan -- to replace the nuclearfacilities shut down under the Agreed Framework that have the potential to producenuclear weapons grade material. While the new reactors are being built, the UnitedStates and other nations have been contributing funds to the Korean EnergyDevelopment Organization (KEDO) for the purchase of heavy fuel oil to supplementNorth Korea's power and electricity production. Administration officials previouslyestimated that annual KEDO contributions, appropriated in the Foreign Operationsbill, would total about $20-$30 million.", "The Administration's policy of engagement with North Korea and the approach outlined in the Agreed Framework have been a frequent source of controversy incongressional debates in recent years.

Under terms provided in P.L. 105-277 , the first $15 millionbecame available only after March 4, 1999, when the President certified that progresswas occurring on implementing several nuclear-related agreements with North Korea,that the DPRK was cooperating fully in the canning and storage of all spent fuel fromits graphite-moderated nuclear reactors, that North Korea had not diverted anyassistance, and that the U.S. was moving ahead with efforts to block DPRK'sdevelopment and export of ballistic missiles.", "The remaining $20 million became available June 1 following a second presidential certification that progress has been made on the nuclear and ballisticmissile issues, and that the U.S. and North Korea had agreed on the means to satisfyU.S. concerns about the DPRK's suspect underground construction. P.L. 105-277 further limited the President's \"special\" waiver authority (Section 614 of the ForeignAssistance Act of 1961), blocking its use to provide more than $35 million to KEDOin FY1999. In addition, Congress required the President to appoint a senior NorthKorea Policy Coordinator by January 1, 1999, to review U.S.-DPRK policy and todirect negotiations with North Korea. The President named former Secretary ofDefense William Perry to the position in late 1998.", "The review of North Korean policy was delayed until after a visit by Secretary Perry to North Korea in May and a separate visit by U.S. inspectors to the suspectedunderground nuclear site. In a preliminary report, the inspectors said, that althoughthey found an extensive underground tunnel complex, work had ceased, the tunnelswere empty, and there was not evidence that North Korea was in violation of theAgreed Framework. Reportedly, North Korea had been demanding payment for aU.S. inspection, something the United States rejected. Nevertheless, shortlyfollowing the mid-March announcement by the State Department that North Koreahad agreed to multiple site visits, officials said that the United States would proceedwith a bilateral pilot agricultural project designed to improve potato production inNorth Korea and contribute an additional 200,000 metric tons of food aid to helpNorth Korea deal with its continuing food shortage and widespread starvation andmalnutrition. This was followed by an another 400,000 food pledge on May 17. While officials argue that food assistance is based solely on humanitarianconsiderations and need, some observers contend there is a connection betweenarrangements to visit the suspected nuclear site and the food decision.", "Beyond issues related to conditions in last year's Foreign Operations measure and the release of FY1999 funds for KEDO, Congress considered this year theAdministration's $55 million request for KEDO payments in FY2000.

Providing debt relief to poor developing nations thatborrowed in the past from the United States, other creditor governments, andinternational financial institutions has emerged as one of the key issues in the ForeignOperations debate for FY2000, the result of several factors. First, theAdministration's initial request of $120 million was nearly four times the amountappropriated for FY1999 in support of continuing debt reduction programs and twonew activities for FY2000. Secondly, encouraged by various international campaignspromoting more expansive debt relief that will target poverty reduction, including theJubilee 2000 movement, (11) several congressionalinitiatives have been introduced in1999 that go beyond the President's FY2000 request. Further, on March 16, 1999,the White House announced more ambitious U.S. debt reduction policies for theworld's most heavily indebted poor nations. At the G-7 Summit in June, thePresident's new policy was largely endorsed by the other major creditor governments. Finally, during World Bank/IMF meetings in September the institutions endorsed theG-7 proposals for reforming the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative.", "For the past decade, the United States has engaged in various forms of debt relief for developing nations, resulting in the cancellation of about $14.4 billion offoreign debt. Much of it -- $10.1 billion -- resulted from special cases involvingkey U.S. national interests: for Egypt in 1990 ($7 billion), for Poland in 1991 ($2.5billion), and for Jordan in 1995 ($635 million). U.S. debt reduction policy for othernations based strictly on need has been guided by the principle that eligible countries must have demonstrated a strong and sustained commitment to economic policyreforms prior to receiving debt relief. Under budget rules instituted in 1992,Congress has had to appropriate funds in advance representing the costs of cancelingdebt. The cost determination methodology is based on a complicated formula thattakes into account among other things, the loan's net present value, its interest rate,and the likelihood the loan will be repaid. For especially poor countries with particularly large debt overhangs, the appropriation requirement may be quite smallrelative to the loan's face value -- perhaps 10% or less.", "When it was first introduced in 1996, HIPC was hailed as the first arrangement that included relief from debts owed to the World Bank, the IMF, and otherinternational institutions, organizations that hold over 25% of debt held by the mostheavily indebted nations. Previously, multilateral organizations had declined toparticipate in debt cancellation, arguing that it would increase their costs of raisingnew money to lend, expenses that would have to be passed on to borrowers. Forty-one countries -- mostly in Africa -- are eligible for HIPC, although only 29likely have \"unsustainable\" debt, a further criterion for being a HIPC participant. Countries deemed eligible for HIPC terms may have their bilateral public debtreduced by 80% after they have maintained a record of strong economic performancefor as much as six years. At present, Uganda, Bolivia, and Mozambique are the onlynations that enjoy full HIPC benefits.", "Strong critics of HIPC emerged, especially among non-governmental organizations and religious groups working in developing countries. They chargethat HIPC terms are not deep enough -- that 90% or 100% of bilateral debt owedshould be canceled and multilateral debt write-offs should go further -- and that sixyears is far too long a period for countries to qualify. They further believe that thenon-sustainable debt criteria, based largely on a ratio of a country's debt-to-exports,is too high and therefore excludes many countries that are also in need of debt relief. Some critics oppose the economic reform requirements and argue for unconditionaldebt reduction. A number of organizations further advocate instituting mechanismsthat would ensure that savings realized by debtor governments would be channeledinto spending on basic services, such as health and education, that would improve thequality of life of the very poor. Many of these arguments are reflected in legislativeinitiatives launched in 1999, including H.R. 1095 (Debt Relief PovertyReduction Act of 1999), H.R. 772 (Hope for Africa Act), and H.R. 2232 (Debt Relief and Development in Africa Act of 1999). Complicating enactment of such bills, however, is the large additional costs thatwould be associated with efforts to broaden, deepen, and accelerate HIPC or U.S.bilateral debt reduction policies.", "For FY2000, the President sought in February 1999 $120 million for three debt reduction activities funded under the Foreign Operations legislation. But betweenMarch and June the White House expanded U.S. debt reduction policy addressingmany of the concerns expressed by HIPC critics. The President's new initiative,much of which was endorsed by other leaders at the June G-7 economic summit inCologne, would provide deeper debt relief to more poor developing countries. Someof these steps are similar to those proposed in pending legislation -- especially H.R. 1095 -- although all congressional initiatives would expand HIPCbeyond the Administration's revised policy. Reflecting the higher costs of anenhanced HIPC initiative, the White House sent to Congress on September 21 an$850 million budget amendment to cover the anticipated U.S. costs. The revised$970 million total request over three years have the following major components:", "$110 million (plus $210 million more in FY2001-2003) to continue U.S. bilateral debt relief agreements for reforming poorcountries.", "$210 million (plus $390 million more in FY2001-2003) for U.S. contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund. While the World Bank and the IMF willfinance their own participation in HIPC, some multilateral organizations, such as theAfrican Development Bank, do not have the necessary resources to extend debt reliefto their debtors. The Trust Fund, which has received contributions of over $450million from about 19 countries, is designed to assist these international agencies toreduce debt owed by eligible HIPC nations.", "$50 million for debt relief to countries that are committed to protecting their tropical forests.
