SNAP provisions in both bills would have changed authorization requirements for retailers and some of the rules that govern participants' and retailers' redemption of SNAP benefits. Both bills would have provided additional mandatory funding for reducing SNAP trafficking (the sale of SNAP benefits for cash or ineligible goods), although the Senate bill proposed a larger amount. In terms of a household's eligibility for SNAP and the calculation of monthly benefit amounts, both bills would have identically reduced the impact of a household's receipt of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) benefits affecting the household's SNAP benefit calculation.

The House committee-reported bill would also have made changes to the nutrition assistance provided to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico.", "Both bills would have increased mandatory funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP, a major source of federal support for emergency feeding organizations), the Senate by $174 million over 10 years, and the House Agriculture Committee by $245 million over 10 years.

Both bills would have provided additional authorizations for \"farm to school\" efforts to bring local agricultural products into school cafeterias.", "Both bills proposed increases for Community Food Projects grants (the Senate by $5 million each year and the House Agriculture Committee by $10 million); H.R. 6083 also would have carved out $5 million of these grants each year for projects that encourage low-income households to purchase fruits and vegetables. The Senate bill would have added discretionary authority for a Healthy Food Financing Initiative, a financing mechanism to sustain and create food retail opportunities in communities that lack access to healthy food; and would have provided $100 million (over five years) in mandatory funding for Hunger-Free Communities Incentive Grants, which would fund programs that provide incentives for SNAP participants' purchase of fruits and vegetables; neither of these programs had been included in the House committee's bill."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The \"farm bill\" is an omnibus bill which reauthorizes dozens of agriculture and agriculture-related statutes and their programs approximately every five years.

", "SNAP bonus incentive programs currently operate in many jurisdictions, but these incentive programs do not receive federal funds for the incentives provided. The bonus incentive programs allow SNAP participants to redeem their benefits for more than \"money on the dollar.\" For example, a participant may exchange $3 of benefits for a $6 voucher to redeem at the market. USDA-FNS, however, requires that the bonus funds be non-federal dollars. Prior to 2010, markets had to apply to FNS for a waiver of the rules through the state SNAP agency. Early in 2010, USDA-FNS allowed farmers' markets that secured nonfederal bonus incentive funding to be eligible through a blanket waiver, so markets now just report to a USDA-FNS field office that they are conducting a bonus incentive program.
