These include the lack of transparency on process and documentation requirements for exporting to a given country, which could also create opportunities for corruption. For example, according to an ITC report, \"lack of clear information concerning duties and taxes on goods imported into the EU is also problematic for U.S. s mall and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs).\" In business, delays at the border caused by extensive paperwork requirements, inefficient transport or processes, and lack of coordination between various border authorities within or between countries can be costly for U.S. firms.

E-commerce platforms allow SMEs to easily reach a global customer base, but many may be hesitant to serve foreign markets because of the complexity of global shipping and delivery. Compared with larger companies, SMEs have fewer resources to deal with the regulatory hurdles of international shipments , and trade costs represent a larger proportional burden for them . R eforms to reduce these costs could therefore boost SME willingness to participat e in international trade. For example, if each country post s customs information online, SMEs c ould more easily understand export and import processes and requirements. If TFA implementation efforts were to also establish a standardized international format or template for posting required information , it c ould further reduce the burden on buyers and sellers trying to export to multiple countries.", "Reform efforts also help large multi national firms exporting large volumes or managing complex global va lue chains (GVCs) that rely on predictable, constant flow s of imports and exports . For example, the use of automation and risk management required by the TFA will allow firms to submit information in advance so that an entire shipment is not delayed upon arrival at the border while officials determine what to inspect. For express delivery firms, in particular, a shipment's smooth and rapid border crossing is crucial for providing good customer service to their customers.", "According to the WTO's 2015 annual report, trade costs in developing countries are equivalent to applying a 219% ad valorem tariff on international trade, while in developed countries the tariff equivalent is 134%.

Furthermore, the OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators (TFIs) show relatively higher results when countries' implementation goes beyond the TFA's mandatory provisions to include the non-mandatory, suggested practices.

The TFA contains a stronger emphasis on transparency, internal coordination, and procedures, perhaps reflecting a lowest common denominator to suit all WTO parties across all levels of development.

The TPP, on the other hand, simply stated: \"Each Party shall make publicly available, including online, its customs laws, regulations, and general administrative procedures and guidelines, to the extent possible in the English language.\" The emphasis on English, as opposed to \"one of the official languages of the WTO,\" as is included in TFA, reflects the strong influence of the United States in the TPP negotiation.", "In general, the TPP included more precise and enforceable terms than the TFA. For example, the TPP provided specific timelines (e.g., 150 days for issuing an advance ruling, 48 hours for release of goods, etc.) while the TFA provisions use phrases such as a \"reasonable, time-bound manner\" and \"as rapidly as possible.\" Both agreements refer to risk management, with TPP requiring use of such a system for assessing and targeting while TFA requires risk management \"to the extent possible.\" Both agreements encourage the use of international standards, with the TPP endorsing recommendations from the World Customs Organization (WCO) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
