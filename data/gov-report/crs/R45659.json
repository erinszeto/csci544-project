Some requirements are common across most programs, while others are specific to individual programs. In addition, program participants are subject to annual payment limits that vary across different combinations of farm programs. Federal farm support programs and risk management programs, along with their current eligibility requirements and payment limits, are listed in Table 1. Terms for most of these programs are applicable for the 2019-2023 crop years.", "Since 1970, Congress has used various policies to address the issue of who should be eligible for farm payments and how much an individual recipient should be permitted to receive in a single year.

Only one permanent disaster assistance program\u2014the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP)\u2014is subject to a payment limit ($125,000 per crop year). NAP is also subject to a $125,000 per crop year limit per person for catastrophic coverage.", "Supporters of payment limits contend that large payments facilitate consolidation of farms into larger units, raise the price of land, and put smaller family-sized farming operations and beginning farmers at a disadvantage. In addition, they argue that large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly. Critics of payment limits counter that all farms need support, especially when market prices decline, and that larger farms should not be penalized for the economies of size and efficiencies they have achieved. Further, critics argue that farm payments help U.S. agriculture compete in global markets and that income testing is at odds with federal farm policies directed toward improving U.S. agriculture and its competitiveness.", "Congress may continue to address these issues, as well as related questions, such as: How does the current policy design of payment limits relate to their distributional impact on crops, regions, and farm size?

Policymakers have debated what limit is optimal for annual payments, whether payments should be proportional to production or limited per individual or per farm operation, and whether the limit should be specific to each program or cumulative across all programs. Furthermore, program eligibility requirements and payment limits generate considerable congressional interest because their effects differ across regions and by type of commodities produced and because a substantial amount of annual U.S. farm program payments are at stake: Direct federal outlays have averaged $13.7 billion per year from 1996 through 2017. When federal crop insurance premium subsidies are included, annual farm payments have averaged $18.5 billion over the same period.

This is followed by a discussion of the direct attribution of payments to individual recipients for assessing whether a person's payment limit has been exceeded. Next, annual payment limits for the major categories of farm programs are examined. Much of this information is summarized in Table 1 .

However, such limits have evolved over time in both scope and amount ( Table A-1 ) as the structure of U.S. agriculture, farm policies, and commodity support programs has changed. With each succeeding farm bill, Congress has addressed anew who is eligible for farm payments and how much an individual recipient should be permitted to receive in a single year.

These consequences include, but are not limited to, farm management structure, crop choices, and farm size.

Each member of a joint operation\u2014where members need not have a common family relation or lineage\u2014is treated separately and individually for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits. Thus, a partnership's potential payment limit is equal to the number of qualifying members (plus any special designees such as spouses) times the individual payment limit. 3. Corporation. A legally defined association of joint owners or shareholders that is treated as a single person for purposes of determining eligibility and payment limits. This includes corporations, limited liability companies, and similar entities.

These exceptions are described below. Another exception to payment limits could result if the principal operator or a major partner of a farm operation dies during the course of a program year and any associated program benefits for the deceased are transferred to another farm operator or partner.

This includes any benefits obtainable under the marketing assistance loan (MAL) program, the sugar program, the dairy program, and three of the four disaster assistance programs (ELAP, LIP, and TAP). Also, benefits from crop insurance premium subsidies and indemnity payments on loss claims are not subject to any limits. Finally, any payments made under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) are not subject to payment limits.", "Title I (Subtitle B) MAL program. Benefits under the MAL program include loan deficiency payments (LDP), marketing loan gains (MLG), and gains under forfeiture or commodity certificate exchanges. Traditionally, MAL benefits in the form of LDPs and MLGs have been subject to payment limits, whereas MAL benefits derived from forfeiting to the CCC the quantity of a commodity pledged as collateral for a marketing assistance loan or from use of commodity certificates to repay a marketing assistance loan have traditionally been excluded from payment limits. However, the 2018 farm bill (\u00a71703(a)(2)) excluded all MAL benefits from payment limits. Title I (Subtitle C) sugar program. The U.S. sugar program does not rely on direct payments from USDA, and generally operates with no federal budget outlays. Instead, the sugar program provides indirect price support to producers of sugar beets and sugarcane and direct price guarantees to the processors of both crops in the form of a marketing assistance loan at statutorily fixed prices. Congress has directed the USDA to administer the U.S. sugar program at no budgetary cost to the federal government by limiting the amount of sugar supplied for food use in the U.S. market, thus indirectly supporting market prices. This indirect subsidy is implicit and not subject to budgetary restrictions. Furthermore, there is no citizenship requirement for a sugar processor, but the sugarcane and sugar beets being processed under the U.S. sugar program price guarantees must be of U.S. origin. Title I (Subtitle D) dairy program . The margin-based dairy support program was first established under the 2014 farm bill (\u00a71401-\u00a71431) without payment limits as the dairy margin protection program (MPP). The MPP was revised and renamed as the Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program by the 2018 farm bill. Under the DMC, participants benefit from two potential types of support: an implicit premium subsidy and an indemnity-like payment made when program price triggers are met. The fees or premiums charged for participating in the DMC are set in statute rather than being set annually based on historical data and market conditions. Thus, the subsidy is implicit to the premium paid with no limit on the level of participation. Similarly, any payments made under the DMC are not subject to payment limits. Title I (Subtitle E ) disaster assistance program s: ELAP, LIP, and TAP . Payments under three of the disaster assistance programs in Title I of the 2018 farm bill are excluded from any payment limits. This includes ELAP, LIP, and TAP. Title II conservation program s . Total payments under certain conservation programs are limited to the value or cost of the specific conservation measure that the program is paying for rather than a fixed limit. Under the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program and the EWP program, payments are limited to a portion of the total cost of the easement or project rather than a total funding amount. In the case of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), the 2018 farm bill allows USDA to make payments to producers in an amount necessary to achieve the purposes of the program with no limit on the total amount. Title XI crop- and livestock-related insurance premium subsidies and indemnity payments . The principal support provided for farmers under the federal crop insurance program are federal premium subsidies for both catastrophic and buy-up insurance coverage. Premium subsidies are not subject to any limit on the level of participation or underlying value. Crop insurance indemnities are payments made to cover insurable losses and thus are not subject to any payment limit. To be eligible to purchase catastrophic risk protection coverage, the producer must be a \"person\" as defined by USDA, and to be eligible to purchase any other plan of insurance (such as buy-up coverage, among others), the producer must be at least 18 years of age and have a bona fide insurable interest in a crop as an owner-operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper.

This provision also applies to an ownership interest in a legal entity received by inheritance if the legal entity was the owner of the land enrolled in an annual or multiyear farm program contract or agreement at the time of the shareholder's death.", "The new owner cannot exceed the payment amount that the previous owner was entitled to receive under the applicable program contracts at the time of death. However, the new payment limit associated with this transfer would be in addition to the payment limit of the person's own farm operation. If the new owner meets all program and payment eligibility requirements, this provision applies for one program year for ARC and PLC.

If these conditions hold, then tighter payment limits (i.e., a smaller role for government support policies and production incentives) would imply that more land would be farmed based on market conditions and less land would be farmed based on policy choices. ", "Supporters of payment limits use both economic and political arguments to justify tighter limits. Economically, they contend that large payments facilitate consolidation of farms into larger units, raise the price of land, and put smaller family-sized farming operations and beginning farmers at a disadvantage. Even though tighter limits would not redistribute benefits to smaller farms, they say that tighter limits could help indirectly by reducing incentives to expand, thus potentially reducing upward price pressure on land markets. This could help small and beginning farmers buy and rent land. Politically, they believe that large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly. In the past, newspapers have published stories critical of farm payments and how they are distributed to large farms, nonfarmers, or landowners. Limits increasingly appeal to urban lawmakers and have advocates among smaller farms and social interest groups.", "Critics of payment limits (and thus supporters of higher limits or no limits) counter that all farms are in need of support, especially when market prices decline, and that larger farms should not be penalized for the economies of size and efficiencies they have achieved.

This has important, but complex, policy implications. For example, numerous academic studies have shown that government payments are usually capitalized into cropland values, thus raising rental rates and land prices. Higher land values disfavor beginning and small farmers, who generally have limited access to capital. As a result, critics contend that there is a lack of equity and fairness under the current system of farm program payments that appears to favor large operations over small and that payment limits are really about farm size. ", "In contrast, supporters of the current system argue that larger farms tend to be more efficient operators and that altering the system in favor of smaller operators may create inefficiencies and reduce U.S. competitiveness in international markets.

An example of such a per-unit payment limit is the 85% payment reduction factor applied to base acres receiving payments under either the PLC or ARC programs. The reduction factor is applied equally across all program payments irrespective of crop choice, farm size, AGI, or total value of payments.

For example, while federal income tax data are not available for the $900,000 cap level, published data from 2013\u2014a year of record-high farm income\u2014found that only about 0.7% of all farm sole proprietors and share rent landlords reported total AGI in excess of $1 million.
