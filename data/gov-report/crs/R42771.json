These include marketing and promotion programs, crop insurance and disaster assistance, plant pest and disease protections, trade assistance, and research and extension services, among other types of miscellaneous support. The industry also benefits from fruit and vegetable purchases under various domestic nutrition assistance programs.

Recently enacted food safety reforms (FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, FSMA) placed additional regulatory requirements on certain specialty crop growers and processors to comply with safety requirements for foods that are regulated by FDA, which includes specialty crops. Under FSMA, FDA is developing mandatory food safety regulations and traceability requirements affecting farmers, packers, and processors of both domestically produced and imported foods under FDA's jurisdiction. At the farm production level, these requirements will mostly affect produce growers.", "Among other agencies, the Environmental Protection Agency sets the safe limits for pesticide residues on produce, which FDA enforces.

Despite their relatively large share of crop receipts, specialty crops occupy only about 3% of U.S. harvested cropland acres. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that retail sales of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables for at-home consumption total nearly $100 billion annually. Exports of U.S. specialty crops totaled about $14 billion in 2013, or about 10% of total U.S. agricultural exports. ", "In 2012, about 244,000 farming operations grew more than 350 types of fruit, vegetable, tree nut, flower, nursery, and other horticultural crops in addition to the major bulk commodity crops. Specialty crop production is focused in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, and Michigan; however, every state has some commercial specialty crop production within its borders. USDA data illustrate the nationwide distribution of areas producing vegetables ( Figure 1 ), fruits and tree nuts ( Figure 2 ), and floriculture crops ( Figure 3 ).", "A majority of specialty crop producers are considered specialized, which means that they receive at least half of their gross value of production from the sale of vegetables, fruits, tree nuts, or other horticultural crops. These specialized farms rely mostly on specialty crop production for their farm income, even though they may be also engaged in other forms of agricultural production. USDA reports that about 50% of all vegetable growers and 80% of fruit and tree nut growers are considered specialized; however, specialized farms account for 90%-95% of the total value of U.S. specialty crop production. Conditions may vary considerably by major production region. Specialized fruit and vegetable farms are more concentrated in the western United States, including California, Washington, and Oregon. Some farms also participate in the major commodity support programs, but these tend to be more concentrated in the midwestern states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["Specialty crops are ineligible for the federal commodity price and income support programs that benefit producers of commodity crops; however, they are eligible for other types of USDA support.

The 2014 farm bill also provided for additional program funding in some cases. Many provisions in Title X (\"Horticulture\") of the farm bill fall into the categories of marketing and promotion; data and information collection; pest and disease control; food safety and quality standards; and support for local foods. Title X also includes provisions benefitting certified organic agriculture producers, including USDA's National Organic Program. ", "Provisions supporting the specialty crop and certified organic sectors are not limited to Title X, but are also contained within several other titles of the farm bill, including the research, nutrition, and trade titles (see text box below). Many of these programs broadly apply to a range of agricultural commodities, including fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops. ", "Specialty crop producers likely also benefit from other USDA programs, available to all agricultural producers, that are not specifically highlighted in this report. These include other USDA research and cooperative extension programs, as well as USDA conservation and rural development programs, among others. ", "Precise estimates of total mandatory and discretionary sources of funding are difficult to measure, given that support for specialty crops is spread across a wide range of USDA programs and not within a price and income support program such as that available for most of the major commodity crops. Following the 2008 farm bill, an average of approximately $676 million annually (FY2008-FY2012) in mandatory program funding was authorized to be spent on specialty crops and organic agriculture, mostly through government purchases of fruits and vegetables for domestic nutrition and feeding programs ( Table 2 ). The 2014 farm bill reauthorized many of the existing farm bill provisions and also increased spending for some programs supporting specialty crops. Total mandatory spending is expected to average $773 million annually (FY2014-FY2018) for specialty crops and organic agriculture. The 2014 farm bill also provided for another roughly $302 million in average annual appropriations across certain programs. See also Table 2 . ", "Although the 2014 farm bill provided for an increase above current funding levels, total mandatory spending for specialty crops and organic agriculture will still account for a small share of estimated total farm bill spending and will remain well below spending levels for commodity crops. Mandatory spending for the major commodity crops is expected to average about $4.7 billion per year under the 2014 farm bill (FY2014-FY2018), mostly through direct price and income support. This does not reflect additional higher spending for crop insurance.

Approved private insurance companies sell and completely service the policies, but USDA reinsures potential losses and either fully or partially compensates the companies for any losses incurred. Eligible producers can receive catastrophic insurance, which is basically free except for an administrative fee. Producers can buy up their level of coverage beyond the catastrophic level and pay a premium that is subsidized by the federal government. Revenue insurance, which makes indemnity payments for income lost either from poor production or low market prices, also is available to producers of certain crops in many areas. Such insurance provides an indemnity payment when actual revenue falls below a target level of revenue. USDA decides which crops in which geographical areas will be covered by which types of insurance. The decision is made on a crop-by-crop and county-by-county basis, based on farmer demand for coverage and the level of risk associated with the crop in the region, among other factors. RMA frequently offers pilot programs with various types of coverage for new crops (particularly specialty crops) or new geographical areas. It uses the performance of these programs to inform its decision on whether to extend coverage permanently. ", "USDA estimates that 2.9 million acres of fruits and tree nuts were covered by federal crop insurance in 2011, or 73% of U.S. acreage. For vegetables, insured area was 0.9 million acres or 32% of U.S. acreage. These figures compare with an 85% coverage for major commodity crops (i.e., those under farm commodity price and income support programs). In addition, actual coverage varies depending on crop type. The share of acres insured was at least 90% for some specialty crops (oranges, prunes, and tomatoes), but less than 50% for other crops (cabbage, peppers, and fresh market beans; see Figure 4 ). ", "More than 80 types of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops are currently covered by individual federal crop insurance plans. Crops covered by individual federal crop insurance plans include almonds, apples, avocados, certain beans, blueberries, cabbage, cherries, chile peppers, citrus, cranberries, cucumbers, figs, grapes (including raisins), green peas, macadamia nuts, mint, nursery crops, olives, onions, peaches, pears, pecans, peppers, plums, pistachios, potatoes, pumpkins, prunes, raisins, stonefruit, strawberries, sweet corn, tomatoes, tropical fruit, and walnuts. ", "Other specialty crops do not have insurance available. These include asparagus, beets, broccoli, carrots (fresh and for processing), cashews, cauliflower, celery, chives, dates, eggplants, garlic, hazelnuts, leeks, lettuce, melons, spinach and other leafy greens, squash, tropical plants, and most other root plants. Some of these crops may be covered by other types of insurance coverage, such as plans based on historical farm income (e.g., whole farm insurance programs). In some cases, USDA has not pursued policies for particular commodities because producers have expressed concerns that offering insurance could adversely affect the market (i.e., because an insurance policy reduces producer risk, farmers may plant more acreage, which could drive down prices and total crop revenue). This has been a particular concern for vegetable crops and explains in part lower levels of insured vegetable acreage compared with other crops.", "Participation among specialty crop producers is relatively high in major producing states, including California (71% of total crop area), Florida (91%), and Washington (68%). Other states with specialty crop production (and their participation rates) include Michigan (73%), New York (70%), and Oregon (52%). ", "In purchasing a crop insurance policy, a producer selects a level of coverage (i.e., deductible) and pays a portion of the premium\u2014or none of it in the case of catastrophic coverage\u2014which increases as the level of coverage rises. The federal government pays the rest of the premium (62%, on average, in 2013). In FY2011, premium subsidies received by all U.S. agricultural producers totaled $7.5 billion. Of this total, specialty crops received an estimated $425 million. Reportedly, although fruits and vegetables (not including nursery crops) account for 22% of estimated 2011 U.S. crop receipts, fruits and vegetables account for less than 5% of annual crop insurance premiums. This compares to 87% of crop insurance premiums for selected commodity crops (corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton), which together account for about 58% of annual U.S. crop receipts.", "Many of the new crop insurance products introduced each year are intended to broaden coverage of fruits, vegetables, and tree nuts, and the number of products has increased in recent years ( Figure 5 ). Nevertheless, specialty crop growers reportedly face a number of challenges pertaining to expanding insurance coverage, including generally small acreages (a marketability issue compared to that for commodity crops); multiple crop varieties and farming practices (which contribute to greater complexity and cost); quality and price discovery issues; concerns about grower interest; non-weather risks; and other coverage limitations. ", "While additional policies for specialty crop growers have been introduced over the last 10 years, producer groups and some Members of Congress during the 2014 farm bill debate wanted to improve the safety net for specialty crops, in part since these crops are not eligible for farm commodity support programs. ", "For example, as specified in the enacted 2014 farm bill, USDA has introduced a revised whole farm insurance plan that reflects provisions on whole farm insurance. Whole farm policies insure revenue of the entire farm rather than an individual crop. The farm bill provisions included increasing available coverage from 80% to 85%, and a maximum liability of $1.5 million, up from $1 million. Also, eligible producers are to include direct-to-consumer marketers and producers who produce multiple agricultural commodities, including specialty crops, industrial crops, livestock, and aquaculture products. Coverage is also expanded for the value of packing, packaging, or any other similar on-farm activity.", "Prior to the 2014 farm bill, USDA had been broadening coverage for organic crops by making available organic price elections for several crops in order to reflect the higher product value and provide additional protection for producers. The 2014 farm bill extended the previous practice by requiring price elections (by 2015) that reflect actual retail or wholesale prices of organic (not conventional) crops for all organic crops produced in compliance with standards issued by USDA under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Noninsured Disaster Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Producers of any commercial crops that are not insurable under the federal crop insurance program are potentially eligible for payments up to $125,000 per person under USDA's noninsured assistance program (NAP).

In order to receive a NAP payment, a producer must experience at least a 50% crop loss caused by a natural disaster, or be prevented from planting more than 35% of intended crop acreage. For production losses in excess of the minimum, a producer receives 55% of the average market price for the commodity.

Eligible trees, bushes, and vines are those from which an annual crop is produced for commercial purposes. Nursery trees include ornamental, fruit, nut, and Christmas trees produced for commercial sale. To be considered an eligible loss, the individual stand must have sustained a mortality loss or damage loss in excess of 15% after adjustment for normal mortality or damage. The Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) provides assistance to beekeepers who might provide pollination services for specialty crop growers.

In other words, these \"direct payments\" had been decoupled from crop planting decisions. While the direct payments program was characterized as giving producers the flexibility to make planting choices based on actual market conditions instead of subsidy rules, there were restrictions. Commodity crop producers were generally allowed to plant part of their crop base acreage to alternative crops or pasture for livestock without losing their program payment; however, there was a prohibition on planting fruits, vegetables (other than mung beans and pulse crops), and wild rice on program crop base acres. ", "This planting restriction came under review in both the 2008 and 2014 farm bill. Expansion of \"planting flexibility\" policies that would further allow growers who receive federal payments to also plant fruits and vegetables on acres on which they receive benefits (base acres) is generally opposed by the major specialty crop groups.", "The purpose of the targeted restriction is to protect growers of unsubsidized fruits and vegetables from competing production on subsidized land. Planting flexibility was first initiated in the 1990 farm bill, which designated 25% of base acres as \"flex acres,\" meaning producers could grow certain crops other than the base crops on those acres. The 1990 farm bill also created the restriction on planting fruits and vegetables on program crop base acreage. The 1996 farm bill expanded planting flexibility to all of a farm's base acres, and the 2002 farm bill continued this policy. The 2008 farm bill continued the restriction but authorized a pilot project in selected states to allow fruits and vegetables grown on acreage participating in the commodity support programs to be used for processing on up to 75,000 acres. Under the pilot program, base acres were temporarily reduced for the year, but restored for the next crop year and \"considered planted\" for any future base calculations.

USDA is directed to publish regulations regarding compliance for an exemption. ", "Second, the farm bill also authorizes USDA to issue an organic check-off program for \"any agricultural commodity\" of both domestic and imported certified organic products, as defined under the Organic Foods Production Act (OFPA) of 1990. OFPA was enacted as part of the 1990 farm bill, and USDA's National Organic Program (NOP) regulations require that agricultural products labeled as \"organic\" originate from farms or handling operations certified by a state or private entity that has been accredited by USDA. Establishing an organic check-off program would involve submitting a proposal for an organic check-off program that meets the USDA's requirements; publication in the Federal Register for comment; public meetings; nominations and appointment of a board; establishment of a recommended assessment rate, budget, and marketing plan; and approval by USDA of that plan. Only after the completion of all these steps would an organic check-off program become implemented and fully operational. Establishing an organic check-off program is being promoted by the Organic Trade Association (OTA). Some oppose establishing an organic check-off program, including the Cornucopia Institute and some organic producer groups. ", "Once a proposed check-off plan is submitted to USDA\u2014and deemed by the agency to have merit following review and public comment\u2014the proposal then goes to a referendum vote. A two-thirds majority of all industry stakeholders is required for the proposed check-off plan to be adopted.", "Given these complexities, many in the industry recognize that additional time is needed before a proposed plan is submitted to USDA. The farm bill conferees acknowledged that establishing an organic check-off program would \"differ from existing check-offs, which are specific to a particular commodity\" and \"for the first time, a check-off program is not solely commodity-specific, but could be established on the basis of a specific set of production and processing practices.\" The conferees also emphasized that the law that governs check-off programs \"prohibits any advertising that may be disparaging to another commodity\" and further encourages USDA to review and revise its guidance for overseeing commodity research and promotion programs to address potential disparagement in both commodity and process-based check-off programs.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative", "paragraphs": ["The Organic Agriculture Research and Extension Initiative (OREI) provides grants to facilitate the development of organic agriculture production, breeding, and processing methods through the integration of research and extension activities.
