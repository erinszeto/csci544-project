Approximately 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and provide advisory and training support to Iraqi security forces. However, some Iraqi political groups are calling for U.S. and other foreign troops to depart, and they may seek to force Iraqi government action on this question during 2019.", "Elections and Politics. Iraqis held national elections in May 2018, electing members to Iraq's unicameral legislature, the 329-seat Council of Representatives (COR). Political factions spent months negotiating in a bid to identify a majority bloc of legislators to form the next government, but the distribution of seats and alignment of actors precluded the emergence of a dominant coalition. Meanwhile, protests and violence in southern Iraq highlighted some citizens' outrage with poor service delivery, lack of economic opportunity, and corruption. In October, the COR chose former Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) Prime Minister and former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih as Iraq's President. Salih, in turn, named former Oil Minister Adel Abd al Mahdi as Prime Minister-designate and directed him to assemble a slate of cabinet officials for COR approval. Abd al Mahdi is a consensus figure acceptable to rival factions, but he does not lead a party or parliamentary group of his own. COR members have confirmed most of Abd al Mahdi's cabinet nominees, but key political groups are at an impasse over certain ministries, including the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense.", "Iraqi politicians have increasingly reached across sectarian political and economic lines in recent years in an attempt to appeal to disaffected citizens, but ethnic and religious politics remain relevant and Iraqi citizens remain frustrated with government performance. Iraq's neighbors and other outsiders, including the United States, are pursuing their respective interests in Iraq, and their competition creates additional challenges for Iraqi leaders. Paramilitary forces have grown stronger and more numerous in Iraq since 2014, and have yet to be fully integrated into national security institutions. Some figures associated with the volunteer Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) that were organized to fight the Islamic State participated in the 2018 election and won COR seats, including critics of U.S. policy who have ties to Iran and are demanding the United States withdraw its military forces.", "The Kurdistan Region. The Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq (KRI) enjoys considerable administrative autonomy under the terms of Iraq's 2005 constitution, and the KRG held legislative elections on September 30, 2018. The KRG had held a controversial advisory referendum on independence in September 2017, amplifying political tensions with the national government, which then moved to reassert security control of disputed areas that had been secured by Kurdish forces after the Islamic State's mid-2014 advance. National government security forces and Kurdish peshmerga are deployed along contested lines of control, as leaders negotiate a host of sensitive issues.", "Stabilization and Reconstruction. Daunting resettlement, stabilization, and reconstruction needs face Iraqi citizens and leaders as they look to the future. More than 4 million Iraqis uprooted during the war with the Islamic State group have returned to their home communities, but many of the estimated 1.7 million Iraqis who remain internally displaced face significant political, economic, and security barriers to safe and voluntary return. Stabilization efforts in areas recaptured from the Islamic State are underway with United Nations and other international support, but many immediate post-IS stabilization priorities and projects are underfunded. Iraqi authorities have identified $88 billion in broader reconstruction needs to be met over the next decade.", "U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress. In general, U.S. engagement in Iraq since 2011 has sought to reinforce unifying trends and avoid divisive outcomes. The Trump Administration seeks to continue to train and support Iraqi security forces, while hoping to limit negative Iranian influence. The 116th Congress is considering Administration requests for funding to provide security assistance, humanitarian relief, and foreign aid in Iraq and may debate authorities for and provide oversight of the U.S. military presence in Iraq and security cooperation and aid programs.

Iraq's security forces are rebuilding after years of intense fighting. Notwithstanding significant U.S. and international assistance, Iraq's security forces still lack some operational, intelligence, logistical, and management capabilities needed to protect their country. More than 4 million internally displaced Iraqis have returned home, but extensive stabilization and reconstruction are needed in liberated areas. An estimated 1.7 million Iraqis remain as internally displaced persons (IDPs), and Iraqi authorities have identified $88 billion in reconstruction needs over the next decade.", "U.S. and other foreign troops remain in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and provide advisory and training support to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), including peshmerga forces associated with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). However, some Iraqi political groups\u2014including some with ties to Iran\u2014are pushing for U.S. and other foreign troops to depart; they may force formal consideration of a resolution to that effect in the Iraqi parliament. Such a resolution would likely be nonbinding (if adopted), but nevertheless could create significant political and diplomatic complications for U.S. and Iraqi leaders, and might prompt more fundamental policy reconsiderations on both sides.", "The Iranian government has viewed instability in neighboring Iraq as a threat and an opportunity since 2003, and works to influence the security sector decisions of Iraqi leaders. It also maintains ties to some armed groups in Iraq, including some units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)\u2014volunteer militias recruited to fight the Islamic State. The PMF have been recognized as an enduring component of Iraq's national security establishment pursuant to a 2016 law that calls for their integration under existing command structures and administration. U.S. officials have recognized the contributions that PMF volunteers have made to Iraq's fight against the Islamic State; they also remain wary of the potential for Iran-linked elements of the PMF to evolve into permanent proxy forces, whether they remain tied to the Iraqi state or work outside formal Iraqi government and military control. U.S. policy seeks to support the long-term development of Iraq's military, counterterrorism, and police services as alternatives to the continued use of PMF units to secure Iraq's borders, communities, and territory recaptured from the Islamic State. ", "U.S. concerns about Iranian government policies have intensified in recent years, and Iraq has become a venue for U.S.-Iranian competition. Iran's government supported insurgent attacks on U.S. forces during the U.S. presence from 2003 to 2011. Since then, U.S.-Iranian competition has remained contained and nonviolent, but there is no certainty it will remain so, as demonstrated by indirect fire attacks in 2018 on U.S. diplomatic facilities, attacks attributed by U.S. officials to Iranian proxy groups. Iraqi leaders are trying to prevent their country from being used as a battleground for regional and international rivalries and seek to build positive, nonexclusive ties to their neighbors and global powers.", "Broad U.S. efforts to put pressure on Iran extend to the Iraqi energy sector, where years of sanctions, conflict, neglect, and mismanagement have left Iraq dependent on purchases of natural gas and electricity from its Iranian neighbors. Since 2018, Iraqi leaders have sought relief from U.S. sanctions on related transactions with Iran. The Trump Administration has granted temporary permissions, and current U.S. initiatives encourage Iraq to diversify its energy relationships with its neighbors and develop more independence for its energy sector. U.S. officials promote U.S. companies as potential partners for Iraq through the expansion of domestic electricity generation capacity and the introduction of technology to capture the large amounts of natural gas that are currently flared (burned at wellheads).", "Oil production and exports are the lifeblood of Iraq's public finances and economy and have reached all-time highs. Oil export revenues provide Iraq's government with significant financial resources, but oil proceeds also have contributed to the creation of a state-centric economic model in which public sector employment and contracting have crowded out private sector activity. Public investment and reconstruction spending is financed through deficit spending, borrowing, and international aid, and Iraq's finances remain vulnerable to price changes in global oil markets. While Iraq's young, growing population and geographic location ( Table 1 ) make it an attractive market for foreign investment, bureaucratic constraints, service interruptions, corruption, and security and political concerns continue to deter some investors. The U.S. government supports Iraq's compliance with reform targets pursuant to IMF agreements and promotes an expansion of U.S.-Iraqi trade and investment ties. However, future U.S. investment prospects in Iraq may be contingent on the broader political and security relationship.", "Overall, the United States faces complicated choices in Iraq. The 2003 invasion unseated an adversarial regime, but unleashed more than a decade of violent insurgency and terrorism that divided Iraqis, while creating opportunities for Iran to strengthen its influence in Iraq and across the region. Since 2003, the United States has invested both militarily and financially in stabilizing Iraq. Since 2014, U.S. policy toward Iraq has focused on ensuring the defeat of the Islamic State as a transnational insurgent and terrorist threat. The Islamic State threat has been reduced, but Iraqi security needs remain considerable and both countries are examining the impetus and terms for continued U.S. investment in Iraq. ", "Successive U.S. Administrations have sought to keep U.S. involvement and investment minimal relative to the 2003-2011 era, pursuing U.S. interests through partnership with various entities in Iraq and the development of those partners' capabilities, rather than through extensive U.S. military deployments. U.S. economic assistance bolsters Iraq's ability to attract lending support and is aimed at improving the government's effectiveness and public financial management. The United States is the leading provider of humanitarian assistance to Iraq and also supports post-IS stabilization activities across the country through grants to United Nations agencies and other entities.", "The Trump Administration has sustained a cooperative relationship with the Iraqi government and has requested funding for FY2020 to support Iraq's stabilization and continue security training for Iraqi security forces. The size and mission of the U.S. military presence in Iraq have evolved as conditions on the ground have changed since 2017; they could change further if Iraqi officials revise their current requests for continued U.S. and international security assistance.", "The 116 th Congress has appropriated funds to provide security assistance, humanitarian relief, and foreign aid for Iraq ( P.L. 116-6 ), and is considering appropriations and authorization requests for FY2020 that would largely continue U.S. policies and programs on current terms. It remains to be seen whether Iraq and the United States will be able to pursue opportunities to build a bilateral relationship that is less defined by conflict and its aftermath. To do so, leaders on both sides will likely have to continue creatively managing unusually complex political and security challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Political and Security Dynamics", "paragraphs": ["Since the U.S.-led ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq's Shia Arab majority has exercised greater national power both in concert and in competition with the country's Sunni Arab and Kurdish minorities. While intercommunal identities and rivalries remain politically relevant, competition among Shia movements and coalition building across communal groups are now major factors in Iraqi politics. Notwithstanding their ethnic and religious diversity and political differences, many Iraqis advance similar demands for improved security, government effectiveness, and economic opportunity. Some Iraqi politicians have broadened their political and economic narratives in an attempt to appeal to disaffected citizens across the country. Years of conflict, poor service delivery, corruption, and sacrifice have strained the population's patience with the status quo, adding to the pressures that leaders face from the country's uncertain domestic and regional security environment.", "Although the Islamic State's exclusive control over distinct territories in Iraq has now ended, the U.S. intelligence community assessed in 2018 that the Islamic State \"has started\u2014and probably will maintain\u2014a robust insurgency in Iraq and Syria as part of a long-term strategy to ultimately enable the reemergence of its so-called caliphate.\" In January 2019, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told Congress that the Islamic State \"remains a terrorist and insurgent threat and will seek to exploit Sunni grievances with Baghdad and societal instability to eventually regain Iraqi territory against Iraqi security forces that are stretched thin.\" ", "The legacy of the war with the Islamic State strains security in Iraq in two other important ways. First, the Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC) and its militias\u2014the mostly Shia Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) recruited to fight the Islamic State\u2014have been recognized as enduring components of Iraq's national security establishment. This is the case even as many PMF units continue to operate outside the bounds of their authorizing legislation and the control of the Prime Minister. The U.S. intelligence community considers Iran-linked Shia elements of the PMF to be the \"the primary threat to U.S. personnel\" in Iraq. ", "Second, national and KRG forces remain deployed across from each other along contested lines of control while their respective leaders are engaged in negotiations over a host of sensitive issues. Following a Kurdish referendum on independence in 2017, the Iraqi government expelled Kurdish peshmerga from some disputed territories they had secured from the Islamic State, and IS fighters now appear to be exploiting gaps in ISF and Kurdish security to survive. PMF units remain active throughout the territories in dispute between the Iraqi national government and the federally recognized Kurdistan Region of northern Iraq, with local populations in some areas opposed to the PMF presence. ", "Amid unrest in southern Iraq during late summer 2018, the State Department directed the temporary evacuation of U.S. personnel and temporary closure of the U.S. Consulate in Basra after indirect fire attacks on the consulate and the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. U.S. officials attributed the attacks to Iran-backed forces and said that the United States would hold Iran accountable and would respond directly to attacks on U.S. facilities or personnel by Iran-backed entities.

The Sa'irun (On the March) coalition led by populist Shia cleric and longtime U.S. antagonist Muqtada al Sadr's Istiqama (Integrity) list placed first in the election (54 seats), followed by the predominantly Shia Fatah (Conquest) coalition led by Hadi al Ameri of the Badr Organization (48 seats). Fatah includes several individuals formerly associated with the Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC) and its militias\u2014the mostly Shia Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), which were recruited to fight the Islamic State.

Among Kurdish parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) won the most seats, and smaller Kurdish opposition lists protested alleged irregularities. As negotiations continued, Nasr and Sa'irun members joined with others to form the Islah (Reform) bloc in the COR, while Fatah and State of Law formed the core of a rival Bin'a (Reconstruction) bloc.", "Under an informal agreement developed through the formation of successive governments, Iraq's Prime Minister has been a Shia Arab, the President has been a Kurd, and the COR Speaker has been a Sunni Arab.", "In September, the first session of the newly elected COR was held, and members elected Mohammed al Halbousi, the Sunni Arab governor of Anbar, as COR Speaker.

Abd al Mahdi is a consensus Shia Arab leader acceptable to the rival Shia groups in the Islah and Bina blocs, but he does not lead a party or parliamentary group of his own. Some observers of Iraqi politics assess Abd al Mahdi as generally pliable and unable to assert himself relative to others who have large followings or command armed factions. COR members have confirmed most of Abd al Mahdi's cabinet nominees, but the main political blocs remain at an impasse over the Ministries of Interior, Defense, and Justice.

Unrest appeared to be amplified in some instances by citizens' anger about heavy-handed responses by security forces and militia groups. Dissatisfaction exploded in the southern province of Basra during August and September, culminating in several days and nights of mass demonstrations and the burning by protestors of the Iranian consulate in Basra and the offices of many leading political groups and militia movements.

In addition to outlining salary and benefit arrangements important to individual PMF volunteers, the law calls for all PMF units to be placed fully under the authority of the commander-in-chief (Prime Minister) and to be subject to military discipline and organization. Through early 2019, U.S. government reporting states that while some PMF units are being administered in accordance with the law, most remain outside the law's prescribed structure. This includes some units associated with Shia groups identified by U.S. government reports as receiving or as having received Iranian support.

Iraqi law does not call for or foresee the dismantling of the PMC/PMF structure, and proposals to the contrary appear to be politically untenable at present. Given the ongoing role PMF units are playing in security operations against remnants of the Islamic State in some areas, rapid, wholesale redeployments of PMF units might create new opportunities for IS fighters to exploit in areas where replacement forces are not immediately available.
