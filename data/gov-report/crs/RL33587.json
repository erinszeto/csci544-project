{"id": "RL33587", "title": "Medicare Secondary Payer: Coordination of Benefits", "released_date": "2014-05-08T00:00:00", "summary": ["Medicare is a federal program that covers medical services for qualified beneficiaries. Established in 1965 to provide health insurance to individuals age 65 and older, Medicare has been expanded to include disabled individuals under 65. Medicare now consists of four parts (A-D) that cover hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, hospice care, and other treatments. Generally, Medicare is the \"primary payer\" for medical services, meaning that it pays health claims first. If a beneficiary has other health insurance, that insurance is billed after Medicare has made payments, to fill all, or some, of any gaps in Medicare coverage. In certain situations, however, federal Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) law prohibits Medicare from making payments for an item or service when payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, by another insurer such as an employer-sponsored group health plan. Congress initiated MSP in 1980 to ensure that certain insurers met their contractual obligations to beneficiaries and to reduce Medicare expenditures, thus extending the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), private insurers designated legally primary to Medicare now pay about $8 billion in claims from Medicare recipients each year.", "In general, Medicare is the secondary payer for beneficiaries who are also covered through (1) a group health plan based on their own or their spouse's current employment; (2) auto and other liability insurance; (3) no-fault liability insurance; and (4) workers' compensation programs, including the Federal Black Lung Program. Additionally, Medicare is prohibited from covering items and services paid for directly, or indirectly, by another government entity, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (subject to certain limitations), although Medicaid is always secondary to Medicare. In cases when Medicare is the secondary payer but primary payment is delayed or in dispute\u2014for example, a medical liability lawsuit\u2014Medicare can step in to cover claims to ensure that beneficiaries do not experience a gap in coverage. Medicare must be reimbursed for these conditional payments when a primary insurer makes payment.", "To identify cases where Medicare is the secondary payer and prevent improper Medicare payments, HHS matches information about Medicare recipients against data from the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-173) requires private insurers such as group health plans, liability insurers, no-fault insurers, and workers' compensation plans to regularly submit coverage information to HHS regarding Medicare beneficiaries. In December 2012, Congress approved, H.R. 1845 (the SMART Act, P.L. 112-242), which includes provisions designed to speed up the process for settling Medicare conditional claims in liability, no-fault, and similar cases. President Obama signed the act into law in January 2013. Title II of P.L. 112-242 requires HHS to establish a secure website that beneficiaries and their representatives can access to view information on conditional payments relating to a potential settlement, judgment, or award. The law made additional changes to the MSP statute and current HHS procedures, including data reporting requirements, appeal rights, use of Social Security numbers, and statutes of limitations. Separately, HHS has been attempting to create streamlined processes for settling smaller-dollar liability and workers' compensation cases involving Medicare beneficiaries. In September 2013, HHS published interim final regulations to implement the SMART Act. This report examines the MSP system, reporting requirements, liability issues, and issues for Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Medicare is a federal program that covers medical services for qualified beneficiaries. Established in 1965 as Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, Medicare has been expanded to include qualified disabled individuals under the age of 65, persons with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and persons with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's Disease). Medicare now consists of four parts (A-D) that cover hospitalizations, physician services, prescription drugs, skilled nursing facility care, home health visits, hospice care, and other treatments. When Medicare was created in 1965, it was the primary payer for all beneficiaries except those receiving coverage through workers' compensation programs. When Medicare acts as the primary payer, it assumes responsibility for a beneficiary's medical bills, up to designated Medicare program limits. If an enrollee has other insurance, the beneficiary, physician, or other supplier can bill that insurance only after Medicare is billed to fill in possible gaps in Medicare coverage. Medicare is always primary to Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for qualifying low-income and certain disabled beneficiaries. Medicaid pays only after Medicare and group health plans have paid. ", "Beginning with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-499 ; OBRA), Congress created the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program, which spells out specific conditions under which other insurers are required to pay first and Medicare is responsible for qualified, secondary payments. MSP is designed to ensure that certain insurers make contractually required payments, reduce Medicare expenditures, and extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. ", "The 1980 OBRA made Medicare a secondary payer for medical claims involving non-group health insurance such as liability and no-fault insurance. In 1981, Congress expanded MSP to cover certain Medicare beneficiaries in employer-sponsored group health plans. MSP was further refined in the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act ( P.L. 97-248 ; TEFRA) of 1982 and other statutes. (See Appendix A .) In general, Medicare is now the secondary payer for an item or service when payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, by responsible third-party payers. (See Table 1 .) Medicare also does not cover services paid for by another government entity, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).", "MSP sometimes is confused with Medicare supplement, or Medigap, insurance policies, but the two are different. MSP spells out instances where private insurance is primary and Medicare coverage is secondary. Medigap policies, by contrast, are private policies that provide supplemental coverage for individuals who rely on Medicare as their primary payer. ", "In certain cases where Medicare is the secondary payer but primary payment is delayed, Medicare may step in to pay claims, thereby ensuring that beneficiaries do not have a break in coverage. Examples of such so-called conditional payments include cases where medical liability claims are contested in court or where employer plans are slow to make payment. For example, in a case where a Medicare beneficiary is hit by a car, the driver's insurance may be responsible for covering medical bills related to the accident, but payment could be delayed by legal proceedings. In such a case, Medicare can pay outstanding claims until a legal settlement is reached. Medicare is entitled to recover its conditional payments once a beneficiary has received a settlement, judgment, or other award. ", "MSP laws and regulations have reduced Medicare spending by an average of about $8 billion a year in recent years, including about $50 billion in savings from FY2006 through FY2012. (See Table 5 .) As Congress has expanded the scope of MSP, however, businesses and insurers have told lawmakers that the resulting paperwork requirements are onerous and that HHS has been slow to provide a final accounting of conditional payments that must be reimbursed, leading to delays in settling some liability cases. The American Bar Association has urged Congress to pass legislation to simplify the process for dealing with MSP claims for future medical bills in workers' compensation cases. HHS has responded by increasing the number of workers processing claims and settlements, reorganizing operations, and creating standardized procedures for resolving smaller claims and some workers' compensation cases. In June 2012, HHS issued a proposed rulemaking to further expedite processing of certain MSP settlements. ", "On December 19, 2012, the House approved H.R. 1845 , the Medicare IVIG Access Act. Title II of the legislation (The SMART Act) creates a new process for resolving MSP conditional payment claims to speed up resolution of liability, no-fault and similar cases. The Senate passed H.R. 1845 by unanimous consent on December 28, 2012, and President Obama signed the measure into law on January 10, 2013 ( P.L. 112-242 ). The law requires HHS to create a password-protected website that beneficiaries and their representatives can access to view information on conditional payments relating to a potential settlement, judgment, or award. The law makes additional changes to the MSP statute and current HHS procedures, including data reporting requirements, appeal rights, use of Social Security numbers, and statutes of limitations.
