{"id": "RL33377", "title": "Tax-Exempt Organizations: Political Activity Restrictions and Disclosure Requirements", "released_date": "2010-09-24T00:00:00", "summary": ["As the 2010 election cycle heats up, attention is focused on the political activities of tax-exempt \u00a7 501(c) organizations. This is due in large part to a recent Supreme Court case, Citizens United v. FEC, which invalidated long-standing prohibitions in federal campaign finance law on corporate and labor union campaign treasury spending. These prohibitions had affected \u00a7 501(c) organizations because many are incorporated and because all organizations (regardless of corporate status) could not serve as conduits for corporate or labor union treasury funds. Thus, post-Citizens United, \u00a7 501(c) organizations are among the entities operating with less restriction under federal campaign finance law. As a result, it is expected there will be increased political activity by the tax-exempt sector in 2010 in comparison with past election cycles.", "Due to this expectation, significant attention is being paid to the regulation of \u00a7 501(c) groups under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Under the IRC, the ability of \u00a7 501(c) organizations to engage in political activity, such as electioneering and lobbying, depends on the type of organization. For example, the charitable organizations described in \u00a7 501(c)(3) may not engage in any campaign activity and may only conduct a limited amount of lobbying. Meanwhile, \u00a7 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations, \u00a7 501(c)(5) labor unions, and \u00a7 501(c)(6) trade associations may engage in campaign activity (so long as such activity and any other non-exempt purpose activity is not their primary activity) and an unlimited amount of lobbying. Other types of \u00a7 501(c) organizations appear to either be subject to restrictions like those imposed on \u00a7 501(c)(3) organizations or treated similarly to \u00a7 501(c)(4), (c)(5), and (c)(6) organizations.", "While some types of organizations are permitted to engage in election-related activities under the IRC, \u00a7 501(c) organizations are subject to tax for making certain political expenditures. The tax is imposed on the lesser of the taxable expenditures or the organization's net investment income. Thus, for organizations with little or no net investment income or those making low-cost expenditures, the tax is of minimal import. For other groups, however, it might serve as a disincentive to directly engage in the activities giving rise to the taxable expenditures.", "Finally, \u00a7 501(c) organizations must report information regarding their political activities to the IRS on Schedule C of the Form 990. This information must be made publicly available by the organization and the IRS. While information on certain donors also must be reported to the IRS on the Form's Schedule B, any identifying information about those donors is generally not subject to public disclosure.", "While this report discusses the political activity limitations in the IRC, it is important to realize that organizations must also comply with applicable election and lobbying laws.

The legislative history of both provisions is sparse.", "In 1919, the Treasury Department took the position that organizations \"formed to disseminate controversial or partisan propaganda\" were not \"educational\" for purposes of qualifying for tax-exempt status under the precursors to \u00a7 501(c)(3). One consequence of this rule was that contributions to these organizations were not deductible. Several lawsuits were brought that challenged this treatment, but no clear standard emerged from the court decisions\u2014some courts denied the deduction if the organization advocated for any type of change, whereas others looked at factors such as how controversial the advocacy was or if the organization's actions were intended to influence legislation. In what is generally recognized as the seminal case, Slee v. Commissioner , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit used another rationale. In that decision, the court held that contributions to an organization were not deductible because it did not appear that the lobbying was limited to causes that furthered the organization's charitable purpose.", "With this background, Congress enacted the lobbying limitation as part of the Revenue Act of 1934. There is very little legislative history for the provision, but it appears that Congress was concerned with organizations that lobby also being able to receive tax-deductible contributions. While discussing the provision on the Senate floor, one Member complained about the deductibility of donations that were made for \"selfish\" reasons and specifically mentioned an organization with which he was apparently having problems. Although this Member apparently believed the provision was too broad in that it applied to organizations without \"selfish motives,\" other Members argued that all contributions to organizations that lobby should be nondeductible because of the difficulty in trying to distinguish between organizations that deserve the benefit and those that do not. It has also been suggested that Congress enacted the provision in order to codify the Slee decision. Although this may be true, it should be noted that the Slee test and the lobbying provision are not identical. This is because the focus of the test under Slee is whether the lobbying furthers the organization's tax-exempt purpose, whereas the focus of the lobbying provision is whether the lobbying is a substantial part of the organization's activities.", "The 1934 Act had also included a provision that would have restricted the ability of charities to participate in partisan politics. However, that limitation was removed in conference, apparently because of concerns it was too broad.", "The political campaign prohibition was enacted as part of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The provision was added by Senator Lyndon Johnson as a floor amendment. Upon introducing the amendment, Senator Johnson analogized it to the lobbying limitation; however, he mischaracterized the lobbying limitation by saying that organizations that lobbied were denied tax-exempt status, as opposed to only those organizations that substantially lobbied. The legislative history contains no further discussion of the prohibition, including whether Senator Johnson's overly-broad description of the lobbying provision and inaccurate analogy were noticed. Although Senator Johnson's motives behind the provision are not clear from the legislative history, it has been suggested that he proposed it either as a way to get back at an organization that had supported an opponent or because he wished to offer an alternative to another Senator's proposal that would have denied tax-exempt status to organizations making grants to organizations or individuals that were deemed to be subversive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lobbying by \u00a7 501(c)(3) Organizations", "paragraphs": ["The organizational definition in IRC \u00a7 501(c)(3) states that \"no substantial part\" of an organization's activities may be \"carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation\" (i.e., lobbying)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Lobbying?", "paragraphs": ["Lobbying includes activities that attempt to influence legislation by (1) contacting, or urging the public to contact, legislators about proposing, supporting, or opposing legislation and (2) advocating for or against legislation.

However, there is no bright-line test and the percentage of expenditures spent on lobbying is not necessarily determinative.

TWR argued that the lobbying limitation violated its right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment.

With respect to the First Amendment, the Court found that Congress had not prevented TWR from speaking, but had simply chosen not to subsidize it by means of the tax exemption and tax-deductible contributions.

With respect to the Fifth Amendment, the Court stated that the test to determine whether the classification was constitutionally permissible was whether it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose. Noting that legislatures have broad discretion when it comes to making classifications for tax purposes, the Court found that it was not irrational for Congress to decide not to extend the taxpayer-funded benefit of unlimited lobbying to charities because of concerns they may lobby for their members' benefit.

Another way a guide could be biased is by rating candidates, such as evaluating candidates and supporting a slate of the best-qualified candidates, even if the criteria are nonpartisan (e.g., based on professional qualifications). A voter guide could also indicate a bias by comparing the organization's position on issues with those of the candidates.
