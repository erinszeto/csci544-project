After set asides and reservations, about $48.6 billion was available for grants to states. ED is required to allocate these funds to states according to a formula that incorporates two population measures: 61% of each state's grant is based on the state's relative share of the population of individuals ages 5 to 24, and 39% of each state's grant is based on the state's relative share of the total population. State Fiscal Stabilization Funds are being provided to states in two phases. Under the first phase, about two-thirds of the available funds were awarded to states beginning in April 2009. About $11.5 billion will be awarded to states in the second phase of state grants. States were required to apply for these funds by January 11, 2010. ", "Once funds are received at the state level, the state's governor must use 81.8% of the state's allocation to support elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, and, as applicable, early childhood education programs and services. With these funds, the governor must provide, through the state's principal elementary and secondary education funding formula, the amount needed to restore state funding for elementary and secondary education in FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011 to the greater of the FY2008 or FY2009 levels. The governor is required to use the remaining 18.2% of the state allocation for \"public safety and other government services,\" which may include assistance for elementary and secondary education and public institutions of higher education (IHEs), and for modernization, renovation, and repair of public school facilities and IHEs' facilities. ", "The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund includes specific provisions related to the use of funds by local educational agencies (LEAs) and IHEs. Funds for elementary and secondary education can be used for any activity authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Adult and Family Literacy Act, or the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act), or for the modernization, renovation, and repair of school facilities, including modernization, renovation, and repairs that are consistent with a recognized green building system. Public IHEs that receive State Fiscal Stabilization Funds must use the funds for (1) education and general expenditures, and in such a way as \"to mitigate the need to raise tuition and fees for in-State students,\" or (2) modernization, renovation, or repair of IHE facilities that are primarily used for instruction, research, or student housing, including modernization, renovation, or repairs that are consistent with a recognized green building rating system. ", "In applying for funds for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants, states were required to submit applications to the Secretary that provided information required by the Secretary and provided five assurances focused on maintenance of effort requirements, equity in teacher distribution, data collection, standards and assessments, and support for struggling schools. In addition, states were required to provide baseline data demonstrating states' current status with respect to each of the five assurances and a discussion of how the State Fiscal Stabilization Funds will be used, including whether the state will use funds to meet ESEA and IDEA maintenance of effort requirements. The application for the Phase 2 grants also required states to address the five assurances, but it required substantially more information, including detailed information about data collection and public reporting of data. ", "States receiving funds under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund are required to submit a report to the Secretary based on a timetable established by the Secretary that discusses how funds were used, how funds were distributed, the estimated number of jobs saved or created using the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, tax increases that were averted, the state's progress in meeting the aforementioned assurances, increases in tuition and fees at public IHEs, changes in enrollment in public IHEs, and each modernization, renovation, and repair project funded. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal Accountability", "paragraphs": ["A longstanding principle of federal aid to elementary and secondary education is that federal funding should add to, and not substitute for, state and local education funding. That is, federal funds are awarded to provide a net increase in financial resources for specific types of educational services (such as the education of disadvantaged student or students with disabilities), rather than effectively providing general subsidies to state and local governments. All of the fiscal accountability requirements included in federal elementary and secondary education programs are intended to provide that all federal funds represent a net increase in the level of financial resources available to serve eligible students, and that they do not ultimately replace funds that states or LEAs would provide in the absence of federal aid.", "Two fiscal accountability requirements that apply to major federal K-12 education aid programs are also relevant to the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. To meet the first requirement, maintenance of effort (MOE) recipient LEAs must have provided, from state and local sources, a level of funding (either aggregate or per student) in the preceding year that is at least a specified percentage of the amount in the second preceding year. A second fiscal accountability requirement provides that federal funds must be used to supplement, not supplant (SNS) , state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of students eligible to be served under the federal program in question. SNS provisions prohibit states and/or LEAs from using federal funds (1) to provide services that state and/or local funds have provided or purchased in the past, (2) to provide services that are required to be provided under federal, state, or local law, or (3) to provide services for some students (e.g., those eligible under specific federal programs) that are provided to other students with non-federal funds.", "For the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, an FY2006 MOE based on state-source revenues for public K-12 education and higher education applies to states, but there is no SNS requirement at any level and no MOE requirement for LEAs with respect to funds provided under this program. The MOE requirement for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund program can be waived or modified by the Secretary of Education for a state for any of FY2009-FY2011 if the Secretary determines that the percentage of the total state funds available for elementary and secondary education will not be lower than the percentage made available for the preceding fiscal year. ", "In addition, under ARRA, states or LEAs may, with prior approval of the Secretary, treat State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants used for education as \"non-federal funds\" for purposes of meeting MOE requirements under any ED program for FY2009, FY2010, or FY2011. In determining whether to provide approval to allow states and LEAs to use State Fiscal Stabilization Funds as non-federal funds to meet MOE requirements, ED has indicated that it would be \"concerned\" if a state has reduced the proportion of total state revenues that are spent on education. If this proportion has been reduced, the Secretary will consider whether the reductions were due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, the extent to which available financial resources have declined, and whether there have been changes in the demand for services. ", "Required levels of state and local funding in subsequent years, however, will not be reduced as a result of states using federal State Fiscal Stabilization Funds as \"non-federal funds.\" Thus, for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011, approved states may reduce their level of spending for K-12 education without jeopardizing their eligibility for funding for IDEA and ESEA programs. However, the potential impact of this authority is not fully clear, particularly since SNS requirements would continue to apply to ESEA Title I, Part A (Education for the Disadvantaged), IDEA, and other ED programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "H.R. 2847 and the Education Jobs Fund", "paragraphs": ["As has been noted, the House-passed version of H.R. 2847 includes provisions to create an Education Jobs Fund.

These modifications, however, would represent a substantial deviation from the currently authorized uses of funds under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund and the requirements related to receiving funds. The following discussion of the Education Jobs Fund is divided into two parts to mirror the preceding discussion of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund.

No funds could be reserved by the Secretary for administration, oversight, or competitive grant programs (i.e., Race to the Top (RTTT) or the Investing in Innovation (i3) Fund). While many federal education programs administered by ED also include a set aside for the Bureau of Indian Education, the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund did not include a set aside for this purpose, nor does the proposed Education Jobs Fund.", "With respect to the use of state grants, the Education Jobs Fund is substantially different than the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. As discussed above, state grants under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund were provided to governors who had to use 81.8% of the funds to support elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The remaining 18.2% of the funds had to be used for \"public safety and other government services,\" which could include education. Under the Education Jobs Fund, funds would be used for different purposes. States would be permitted to reserve up to 5% of their grants for administrative costs related to the program, and for retaining or creating positions in the state educational agency (SEA) or the state agency responsible for higher education, and other state agency positions related to administering or supporting early childhood, elementary, secondary, or postsecondary education. However, funds used for administration could not exceed 1% of the state's total allocation under the Education Jobs Fund. ", "The Education Jobs Fund provisions specify that the states shall use the remaining funds only to make awards to LEAs and public IHEs to support elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The governor would be required to determine how much funding to provide to elementary and secondary education and higher education based on the proportional reductions in state funding for these areas. This would be similar to the requirements of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which required that the amount of funding going to elementary and secondary education versus postsecondary education be determined based on the amount needed to restore state support to the greater of the FY2008 or FY2009 levels. As with the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, funding made available for elementary and secondary education would be distributed through the state's primary funding formulas for elementary and secondary education.", "LEAs could use funds provided under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for any purpose authorized under several education acts or for modernization, renovation, or repair of public school facilities, and IHEs could use funds for education and general expenditures, mitigating the need to raise tuition and fees, and for modernization, renovation, or repair of facilities of higher education.

However, H.R. 2847 does not define \"support services\" or \"educational or related services,\" so it is unclear whether these funds could be used to retain or hire staff who have any association with early childhood, elementary, secondary, or postsecondary education (e.g., janitors, bus drivers, cafeteria workers) or whether the funds would be targeted for retaining and hiring any staff with a direct connection to the instructional process. ", "Activities defined under Section 101(31) of WIA provide wage subsidies to employers for on-the-job training. These subsidies are limited to 50% of the individual's wage rate. In addition, these arrangements must be limited in duration. When these programs are initiated under WIA, generally the local Workforce Investment Board and the employer reach an agreement on the duration of the program. Under the Education Jobs Fund provisions, it is unclear how the decision to limit the duration of the use of funds would be made in an on-the-job training situation that is not coordinated through WIA.", "Under the Education Jobs Fund, LEAs and IHEs could use funds for the modernization, renovation, and repair of public school facilities and facilities of higher education. The prohibitions related to the use of these funds under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund (Sections 14003 and 14004, respectively) would apply to use of funds for these purposes under the Education Jobs Fund.", "To receive funds under the Education Jobs Fund, a governor would still be required to submit an application to the Secretary containing information required by the Secretary based on a timeline established by the Secretary. The provisions governing the application process under the Education Jobs Fund would eliminate the assurances that states had to provide in their State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The Education Jobs Fund also would eliminate the requirement that the state provide baseline data related to the assurances. A state would continue to be required to indicate how it intends to use available funds to meet MOE requirements under ESEA and IDEA and the amount of funds that would be used for these purposes.", "If a governor does not submit an application to the Secretary by the prescribed deadline, the Secretary would have the authority to distribute the state's share of funds to another entity or entities in the state under terms and conditions established by the Secretary.

Further, states would be prohibited from using funds to reduce or retire state debt obligations. These prohibitions, however, would not apply to fund balances that are necessary to comply with state budget rules. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund did not include these prohibitions. ", "The term \"rainy-day fund\" is not defined in H.R. 2847 . While there may be a general understanding of what this term means, the bill lacks a definition, making it difficult to predict how the prohibition would be applied across states. In addition, it is unclear which state-specific rules, constitutional or statutory, would be affected by the exception allowing states to meet balanced budget requirements with fund balances. Balanced budget rules vary by state, which also makes it difficult to predict how the exception may be applied from state to state. Further, balanced budget rules generally apply to the operating budget, not the capital budget. Thus, the lack of specificity in the language creating the exception and the variety of budget rules across states would likely make it difficult to track how states use the authority granted to them through the exception.", "The inclusion of prohibitions on the use of Education Jobs Funds for rainy-day funds or debt reduction may be in response to issues that arose during the implementation of the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. The fungibility of state revenue was one of the major issues that arose as states began to use their State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants. Some states reduced their education funding to meet the MOE requirements for receiving funding and used the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants to backfill their education budgets. The funds the state would have spent on education were transferred to another purpose. Thus, in some states, the provision of State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants may not have represented a net gain in education funding. In addition, at least one state governor (South Carolina) indicated that he wanted to use the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to reduce state debt. While ED indicated that this would be illegal, the inclusion of language related to debt reduction in the Education Jobs Fund may be intended to clarify congressional intent on fund use.", "Fiscal Assurances. Under Section 442 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), individual LEAs participating in a program to which GEPA applies are required to provide the state with an application containing assurances regarding the administration of the program, the control of funds, fiscal control and accounting procedures, reporting, participation in program planning and operation, making reports publicly available, requirements related to construction, procedures for disseminating relevant research to practitioners, and the acquisition of equipment.

One notable difference between the MOE assurances required under the Education Jobs Fund and the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund is that the MOE assurances under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund had to be established separately for elementary and secondary education and for public higher education.

These bonds are called \"tax credit bonds.\" In contrast to tax-exempt bonds, most tax credit bonds (TCBs) allow the investor to claim a federal tax credit equal to a percentage of the bond's par value (face value) for a limited number of years. This tax credit percentage is set at the yield on taxable bonds at the time of issuance. Issuers of tax credit bonds typically pay no interest to bondholders. Thus, TCBs can deliver a larger federal subsidy to the issuer than do traditional municipal bonds. The subsidy to the issuer is the full taxable interest rate instead of the difference between the taxable rate and the lower tax-exempt rate as with traditional tax-exempt bonds. ", "The government entity issuing the bond is obligated to repay only the principal of the bond. The federal government effectively makes \"payments\" to the investor through the tax credits. The tax credits delivered through the bonds are unlike typical tax credits because the credit is included in taxable income as if it were interest income. The tax credit bond rate is set with the intent of compensating for this taxability. ", "The House-passed version of H.R. 2847 includes a provision that would allow QZAB and QSCB issuers to receive a direct payment from the Treasury in lieu of the investor receiving a tax credit. This mechanism is most often used for the new Build America Bonds (BABs), which were created by ARRA ( P.L. 111-5 ). Critically, however, the BAB tax credit rate (or the direct payment, if the issuer chooses) is set at 35% of the interest cost, not 100% like QZABs and QSCBs. The higher tax credit rate for QZABs and QSCBs, coupled with the greater popularity of the direct payment mechanism with both investors and issuers, could generate a sizable tax loss for the federal government when compared to current law.

For large jurisdictions, those that issue more than $30 million of bonds annually, the direct payment credit rate would be set at 45% (in contrast to the 100% credit rate for the investor credit option as under current law). For small issuers, the direct payment credit rate would be set at 65%. Thus, under the Senate version of H.R. 2847 , issuers that choose the direct payment option would incur a higher interest cost than under the House-passed legislation.
