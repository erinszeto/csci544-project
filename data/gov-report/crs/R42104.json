The RAA would modify and enact into law numerous new general procedures for rulemaking that appear in narrower form in existing law, executive orders, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) documents. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3010 on December 2, 2011. The Obama Administration has issued a Statement of Administration Policy against H.R. 3010. Some of the most significant changes the bill would make are listed here. H.R. 3010 would:", "Require agencies to adopt the \"least costly\" rule that meets \"relevant statutory objectives\" unless the benefits justify additional costs. Provide for judicial review of certain requirements and determinations, for which judicial review is not presently available or for which there is a question as to whether judicial review is available. Overhaul the current notice-and-comment (informal) rulemaking process by codifying and modifying existing requirements and instituting many procedural and substantive additions to informal rulemaking. Raise questions regarding how the RAA would interact with existing statutory requirements for cost-benefit analysis and statutory prohibitions on cost considerations. Impose new requirements on independent regulatory agencies, including cost-benefit analysis and regulatory review by OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Impact existing case law on judicial deference to agency interpretations of rules and agency guidance. Provide that interim rules shall cease to have the effect of law if such rules are not finalized or rescinded in accordance with the RAA's requirements within 270 days of publication of the interim rule or 18 months if the rule is a major or high-impact rule. Create a new category of rules, \"high-impact\" rules, and mandate trial-like formal rulemaking procedures for such rules. Require advance notices of proposed rulemaking for certain rules. Mandate the identification of costs and benefits, and assure that such benefits justify the cost, in major guidance documents and guidance that involves a novel legal or policy issue arising out of statutory mandates. Establish minimum time periods for comment in rulemakings. Grant the OIRA Administrator, in statute, increased powers and responsibilities.

The House passed H.R. 3010 on December 2, 2011, by a vote of 253-167. If enacted, the RAA would make broad changes to the federal rulemaking process. Federal agencies currently issue regulations in accordance with requirements in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as well as other statutes and executive orders that apply to rulemaking. The RAA would make the most significant legislative changes to the APA since its enactment in 1946. The RAA would modify and enact into law numerous new general procedures for rulemaking that appear in narrower form in existing law, executive orders, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) documents.", "On one hand, the RAA has been praised by industry and trade associations as legislation that would \"update the 65 year old regulatory process\" by making \"the regulatory process more transparent, agencies more accountable, and regulations more cost effective.\" On the other hand, the RAA has been criticized by government watchdog and environmental groups, such as OMB Watch, as legislation that would result in a \"radical overhaul\" of the rulemaking process, compromising \"public health, worker safety, and environmental quality goals.\" ", "The White House has issued a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) on H.R. 3010 , which announced that the President's \"senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\" The SAP states that \"the [RAA] would impose unprecedented procedural requirements on agencies that would prevent them from performing their statutory responsibilities.\" The SAP also asserts that the RAA's new procedures are \"unnecessary\" and would \"invite frivolous litigation.\"", "A comparison of the RAA to requirements in existing law, executive orders, and OMB documents indicates that although the RAA has many characteristics in common with existing statutes and executive orders, it would add many requirements to the rulemaking process. For example, the RAA would allow for judicial review of considerations for which it is not presently available. The RAA would impose new requirements on independent regulatory agencies, such as consultation with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and cost-benefit analysis. The RAA would extend many rulemaking requirements in Executive Order 12866 that currently only apply to \"significant\" rules, such as OIRA review and cost-benefit analysis, to all rules. The RAA would require agencies to provide specific information on statutory and legal considerations, costs and benefits, and alternatives to rules. The RAA would change the procedures for the issuance of agency guidance and require agencies to identify costs and benefits for major or \"novel legal or policy issue\" guidance. Additionally, the RAA would require the publication of advance notices of proposed rulemaking for \"major\" rules, \"high-impact\" rules, and rules involving \"novel legal or policy issue[s] arising out of statutory mandates\" and add a mandatory 90-day waiting period before publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking for such rules. The bill would set minimum time periods for notice and comment of 120 days for major and high-impact rules, and 60 days for other rules.", "Potential effects the RAA may have on the rulemaking process include an increased level of influence for OIRA and, by extension, the President; the potential for rulemaking to take longer than it currently does, particularly for major, high-impact, and novel legal or policy issue rules; a re-establishment of the standards for the selection of regulatory options that is based on minimizing costs rather than maximizing net benefits; the potential need for additional agency resources; a potential increase in agency use of adjudication; and the potential for increased and/or lengthier litigation. These issues are discussed below in the \" Potential Issues for Congress \" section of the report.", "The House and Senate versions of the RAA contain some minor structural differences, as well as major substantive differences in the judicial review provisions with regard to major and high-impact rules and judicial review of an agency's consideration of costs or benefits. Additionally, the House version of the RAA adds requirements for rules involving \"novel legal or policy issue[s] arising out of statutory mandates,\" and the Senate version does not contain additional requirements for such rules. Under the version of the RAA that passed the House, there would be a more explicit requirement that agencies consider \"an estimate of the net gain or loss in domestic jobs.\" The version of the bill discussed in this report is the version that was passed by the House on December 2, 2011.", "This report begins by providing a brief overview of the major requirements of the rulemaking process currently found in statutes, executive orders, and OMB documents, many of which would be changed or enacted into law by the proposed RAA. The report then discusses the RAA's proposed changes to these existing rulemaking requirements, providing a side-by-side comparison of the requirements of the RAA to these existing provisions. The \" Potential Issues for Congress \" section provides some general conclusions and analysis, and it discusses some of the potential implications of the proposed bill.

The APA established standards for the issuance of rules using formal rulemaking and informal rulemaking procedures. Informal rulemaking, also known as \"notice and comment\" rulemaking or \"Section 553\" rulemaking, is the most common type of rulemaking.", "For informal rulemaking under the APA, agencies are required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register , take comments on the NPRM, publish a final rule in the Federal Register , and provide for a 30-day waiting period before the rule can become effective. The APA specifically authorizes federal agencies to dispense with its requirements for notice and comment if the agency for good cause finds that the use of traditional procedures would be \"impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\" The APA also provides a good cause exception for the 30-day waiting period between the publication of a final rule and its effective date. ", "While the notice-and-comment procedures in the APA provide the general structure of the rulemaking process, a number of other requirements have been added to the process in the decades since the APA. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) established a process under which agencies have to consider the paperwork burden associated with regulatory and other actions. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires regulatory impact analyses for rules that will have a \"significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities\" and establishes other requirements. Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) added requirements for agencies to analyze and reduce costs associated with federal mandates upon state, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) established a mechanism through which Congress could overturn federal regulations and required that agencies submit their rules to both houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) before the rules can take effect. The Information Quality Act (IQA) required OMB to create guidance for agencies \"for ensuring and maximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information\" disseminated by agencies and required agencies to establish their own guidelines on information quality.", "In addition to the current statutory requirements for the rulemaking process, Presidents also have issued executive orders and OMB has produced documents providing requirements and guidelines for agencies to follow when issuing rules. Executive Order 12866, issued by President Clinton in 1993, calls for OIRA to review \"significant\" regulatory actions at both the proposed and final rule stage. Furthermore, agencies are required to assess potential costs and benefits for \"significant\" rules, and, for those deemed as \"economically significant\" regulatory actions, agencies are required to perform a cost-benefit analysis and assess the costs and benefits of \"reasonably feasible alternatives\" to the planned rule. Under E.O. 12866, agencies generally must \"propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits\" of the rule \"justify its costs.\" To provide guidance to agencies on what to include and consider in their cost-benefit analyses of rules, OMB issued OMB Circular A-4, a document that describes \"best practices\" of agencies' economic analyses. OMB, under President George W. Bush, also provided guidelines for agencies to follow when issuing guidance documents.", "The combination of statutory requirements, executive orders, and OMB directives comprises the bulk of the current, generally applicable requirements agencies must follow when issuing regulations. The RAA would change or enact into law a number of the requirements mentioned here. Additionally, particular agency statutes may add requirements specific to that agency, and there is a substantial body of case law interpreting existing rulemaking requirements that would be affected by the RAA. The remainder of this report will examine the main provisions of the bill and compare the changes the bill proposes with the current, generally applicable requirements and case law, where appropriate.

For example, the parts of E.O. 12866 that concern centralized review of regulations by OIRA do not apply to statutorily designated \"independent regulatory agencies.\" However, other parts of E.O. 12866 do apply to independent regulatory agencies\u2014such as the requirements that each agency (1) \"prepare an agenda of all regulations under development or review\" and (2) \"prepare a Regulatory Plan \u2026 of the most important significant regulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form in that fiscal year or thereafter.\" E.O. 12866's lack of a requirement for the review of regulations promulgated by independent regulatory agencies provides an element of independence from presidential control for these specified agencies, although some of these agencies may choose to submit their rules to OIRA anyway. Rules promulgated by independent agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, are included in OIRA's review processes under E.O. 12866.", "Certain statutes applicable to the rulemaking process also exempt independent regulatory agencies from particular requirements. For example, UMRA requires agencies other than independent regulatory agencies to write regulatory impact statements when a rule \"may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any 1 year.\" While the RAA would not extend the application of UMRA to independent regulatory agencies, similar requirements in the RAA, if enacted, would apply to independent regulatory agencies.

For example, an agency issuing a \"major\" rule would need to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) 90 days before issuing an NPRM. The RAA defines a \"major rule\" as: ", "any rule that the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [OIRA] determines is likely to impose\u2014", "(A) an annual cost on the economy of $100,000,000 or more, adjusted annually for inflation; (B) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, ", "local, or tribal government agencies, or geographic regions; ", "(C) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, ", "innovation, or on the ability of the United States-based enterprises to compete with ", "foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets; or ", "(D) significant impacts on multiple sectors of the economy.", "This definition uses some of the same terminology as the definition of a \"major rule\" under the CRA, but (A) in the RAA focuses on an annual cost instead of an annual effect (which could include benefits and costs) on the economy of $100 million or more.

Executive Order 12866 also includes factors such as the \"environment, public health or safety,\" which are not included in either the RAA or the CRA.

The term 'distributional effect' refers to the impact of a regulatory action across the population and economy, divided up in various ways (e.g., income groups, race, sex, industrial sector, geography).\" Under OMB Circular A-4, agencies are supposed to provide a separate description of distributional effects so that \"decision makers can properly consider them along with the effects on economic efficiency \u2026 you should be alert for situations in which regulatory alternatives result in significant changes in treatment or outcomes for different groups.\" It is not entirely clear how or whether OIRA would harmonize Circular A-4 with new guidance that it would be required to issue under the RAA or whether OIRA would continue to direct agencies to consider the distributional effects of a rule. ", "In sum, many of the \"considerations\" that the RAA would add to the regulatory process are similar to considerations already in place. However, they would appear to be used differently. Since the most comparable requirement for the RAA's considerations is the \"The Principles of Regulation\" section of E.O. 12866, which was subsequently reinforced by E.O. 13563, which does not cover independent regulatory agencies.

The RAA would also exempt such rules from its requirements for final rules, such as consultation with the OIRA Administrator; adoption of the rule on the basis of the best reasonably obtainable scientific, technical, economic, or other evidence and information; adoption of the least costly rule; and the requirements for the notice of final rulemaking. However, the RAA would retain its requirement that \"interpretative rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice\" include \"a concise, general statement of the rule's basis and purpose.\"", "Additionally, the APA contains a good cause exception that allows an agency to issue a rule without notice and comment. To issue a rule without notice and comment under the APA, the agency must \"for good cause find[] (and incorporate the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued) that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\" Each of these three terms or phrases has a specific meaning. Whether the agency's use of the good cause exception is proper is a fact-specific inquiry, and courts have traditionally held that this exception will be \"narrowly construed and reluctantly countenanced.\" A common use of the good cause exception is in the issuance of interim or interim final rules, which are considered final rules with the force and effect of law. Such rules are used by agencies to promulgate rules under the APA without providing the public with notice and an opportunity to comment before publication of the final rule, while reserving the right to modify the rule through a post-promulgation comment period. ", "The RAA also includes a modified good cause exception for interim rules. The RAA's good cause exception applies to its requirements for ANPRMs for major rules, high-impact rules, and rules involving novel legal or policy issues; for NPRMs; hearings for high-impact rules; and for final determinations on issues such as the rule's benefits \"meet the relevant statutory objectives and justify the rule's costs\" in the publication of the final rule. Like the APA's good cause exception, the RAA's good cause exception would apply if the agency finds that compliance \"is impracticable or contrary to the public interest.\" The RAA creates a new procedure for the \"unnecessary\" exception, discussed below, and adds an exception for \"interests of national security.\" As is true with an agency's use of good cause for interim rules under the APA, judicial review of an agency's use of the good cause exception would be available immediately upon \"the agency's publication of an interim rule.\" The RAA provides that the record for the court to consider \"shall include all documents and information considered by the agency and any additional information presented by a party that the court determines necessary to consider to assure justice.\" ", "The RAA would add a new requirement to address agencies' use of interim final rules. Under the RAA, \"immediately upon publication of the interim rule,\" agencies would need to comply with the RAA's requirements for NPRMs, hearings for high-impact rules, and for final determinations in the publication of the final rule. The RAA indicates that the interim rule may be treated as an NPRM, and that the agency \"shall not be required to issue supplemental notice other than to complete full compliance with\" the RAA's NPRM requirements. If the agency does not complete such steps and either adopt a final rule or rescind the interim rule within 270 days of publication of the interim rule, or 18 months if the interim rule was a major or high-impact rule, then \"the interim rule will cease to have the effect of law.\" Under the APA, the rescission of a rule, even an interim final rule, also requires a rulemaking, so agencies may choose to allow the time clock to run out (and let the interim rule cease to have effect), rather than conduct a rulemaking and incur the associated costs in order to rescind the interim rule.", "Like the APA, the RAA provides for the use of the good cause exception if the agency finds that notice and comment are \"unnecessary,\" but the RAA would codify examples of a good cause finding that notice and comment are \"unnecessary\"\u2014a rulemaking \"undertaken only to correct a de minimis technical or clerical error in a previously issued rule or for other noncontroversial purposes.\" The RAA would codify a modified version of \"direct final\" rulemaking, a process that agencies use to quickly and efficiently finalize rules that the agency views as \"routine or noncontroversial.\" ", "Under direct final rulemaking, the agency publishes a proposed rule in the Federal Register , with language providing that the rule will become effective as a final rule on a specific date unless adverse comment is received by the agency. If even a single adverse comment is received, as recently occurred with a Coast Guard rule, the proposed rule is withdrawn and the agency may issue its proposed rule under the APA's notice-and-comment requirements. The RAA would enable agencies to publish a final rule upon a good cause finding that notice and comment is unnecessary, but would require the agency to receive \"significant adverse comment within 60 days after publication of the rule.\" While the RAA does not define \"significant adverse comment,\" if such comment(s) are received, the agency's final rule would be treated as an NPRM and the rule would be subject to the bill's NPRM, high-impact rule hearing, and final rule determination requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "(h) Additional Requirements for Hearings", "paragraphs": ["Under the RAA, if a high-impact rule hearing is required, or if such a hearing is \"otherwise required by statute or at the agency's discretion before adoption of a rule,\" the agency must follow formal rulemaking requirements in 5 U.S.C.

Proponents of the bill have also express strong support for the expansion of OIRA review and cost-benefit analyses to more rules and to independent regulatory agencies, saying that agencies would be held more accountable by the existence of these requirements.", "On the other hand, because of these new requirements, opponents of the bill have argued that the rulemaking process could become more difficult for agencies to navigate and more time may be required for agencies to issue rules. New requirements for hearings and minimum lengths for comment periods, for example, would likely extend the length of time it takes for agencies to promulgate rules. Furthermore, the extension of judicial review to considerations for which it does not presently exist could also potentially result in increased litigation.", "Although many of the requirements for the RAA are similar to requirements that currently exist under the RFA and UMRA, some of the requirements are narrow in scope compared to the RAA's application of similar requirements. If enacted, the RAA would supplant sections (b) through (e) of 5 U.S.C. Section 553, the APA's informal rulemaking provision, but it would not replace the requirements in the RFA or UMRA. Therefore, agencies would have to conduct the analyses that are currently required of them, and they would have additional requirements to meet as well.", "Additionally, enactment of the RAA could also lead to uncertainty for regulators and regulated entities as the courts interpret the RAA's provisions, particularly with regard to provisions that provide new authorities, definitions, and requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RAA May Require Additional Time and Resources", "paragraphs": ["Another related potential ramification that could arise from enactment of the RAA is that it could be more difficult for agencies to meet statutory deadlines due to the additional requirements and the addition of a minimum length of time for comment periods. In order for agencies and OIRA to fulfill these procedural requirements, additional resources may be necessary. For example, the RAA would require agencies to conduct many more cost-benefit analyses than are currently required, and OIRA would be required to review many more rules than it is currently required to review. There would also be a cost associated with the increased litigation that the RAA would be likely to bring about. The requirement for a potentially large subset of rules (major rules, high-impact rules, and rules involving novel legal or policy issues) to publish ANPRMs 90 days before publishing an NPRM and the minimum 60-day comment period associated with that requirement could also make rulemaking proceedings longer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implications for Independent Regulatory Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Another potential implication of the enactment of the RAA may be a change in the level of independence of the independent regulatory agencies. Presidential executive orders on regulatory review have excluded independent regulatory agencies by referencing a statutory definition of an \"independent regulatory agency\" that contains a list of such agencies. The majority of these independent regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, are led by multi-member boards in which substantive regulatory authority is vested in the board itself. The heads of independent regulatory agencies typically may be removed by the President only for cause. For cause removal protection provides an element of insulation from presidential control.", "Independent regulatory agencies may also have several other structural elements that theoretically provide insulation from executive branch control, such as staggered terms of office for the members of a multi-member board, as well as an odd number of members, with no more than a simple majority from one political party, who serve terms for an odd number of years and that may \"extend beyond the four-year presidential term.\"", "Independent regulatory agencies have not been covered by the requirements for OIRA review and cost-benefit analysis since those requirements were established by President Ronald Reagan in E.O. 12291. President Clinton also chose to exclude those agencies when he issued E.O. 12866, which superseded E.O. 12291. According to President Clinton's OIRA Administrator, those agencies were excluded from the requirements for centralized regulatory review because presidential advisors concluded that the legal authority to extend the requirements existed, but the President should maintain deference to Congress and respect the independence of the agencies. ", "As discussed throughout this report, if enacted, the RAA would extend both of the major requirements of E.O. 12866 to the independent regulatory agencies. First, they would have to submit their proposed and final rules to OIRA for review. Under the executive orders that have been in place since 1981, the requirements for OIRA consultation has essentially allowed the President, through OMB and OIRA, to ensure that regulations are consistent with his policy priorities. Therefore, critics may point out that a requirement for OIRA consultation could reduce the level of independence of those agencies. On the other hand, supporters of this change have argued that OIRA review would provide an important check on rulemaking in the independent regulatory agencies. ", "Second, the independent regulatory agencies would also be subject to the same requirements for cost-benefit analysis to which other agencies currently are subject under E.O. 12866. During FY2010, the independent regulatory agencies promulgated 17 \"major\" (defined differently than in the RAA) rules, 16 of which \"were issued to regulate the financial sector,\" and while some agencies assessed costs, according to GAO, \"none of the 17 rules assessed both anticipated benefits and costs.\" OMB has indicated that it \"does not know whether the rigor of the analyses conducted by these agencies is similar to that of the analyses performed by agencies subject to OMB review.\" OMB has \"encouraged\" independent regulatory agencies to follow E.O. 13563's instruction that agencies use \"the best available techniques to quantify anticipated present and future benefits and costs as accurately as possible,\" as well as the executive order's principles and requirements.", "Again, critics of this change may point to the independence of the independent regulatory agencies when it comes to OIRA's ability to examine their cost-benefit analyses. Critics of the RAA's change also may argue that courts may hold agencies accountable to their current statutory mandates with regard to cost-benefit analyses. Supporters of that change would argue, however, that those agencies should be held to the same standard to which other agencies are held when considering costs and benefits of regulations. In addition, those who support expanding the cost-benefit analysis requirements to the independent regulatory agencies have pointed to recent major legislation\u2014particularly the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which delegated a substantial amount of rulemaking authority to independent regulatory agencies\u2014as an example of how transparency could be brought to the implementing regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirement for Choosing Least Costly Rule", "paragraphs": ["Another element that some critics of the RAA have raised is the RAA's requirement that agencies choose the least costly regulatory alternative. It appears that this could come into conflict with current laws, such as the Clean Air Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which enable agencies to issue regulations and make decisions based on factors other than economic costs or cost-benefit analysis. Other laws provide specific directives with regard to costs and benefits. Given this potential conflict with existing law, some have identified the RAA as a \"supermandate\" that would supersede other requirements not to consider costs that exist in the enabling statutes of numerous agencies.", "Under the current executive orders that govern the rulemaking process, agencies are encouraged to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits, tailor their regulations to impose the \"least burden on society\" and ensure that the benefits of a rule justify the costs. Under the RAA, it appears that the decision criteria for the selection of a regulatory alternative may change: agencies would be required to \"adopt the least costly rule considered during the rule making \u2026 that meets relevant statutory objectives.\" However, this provision may create uncertainty as to what would constitute a \"relevant statutory objective,\" and such uncertainty would likely be resolved over time through case law on particular statutes or through a specific congressional directive defining what the \"relevant statutory objectives\" for a particular law. ", "For example, in the Food and Drug Administration Food Safety Modernization Act, Congress directed the FDA to publish an NPRM \"to establish science-based minimum standards for safe production and harvesting of those types of fruits and vegetables \u2026 that are raw agricultural commodities for which the Secretary has determined that such standards minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death.\" The statutory provision contains specific requirements for the NPRM and the final rule, and provides requests for variances and exempts some farms.
