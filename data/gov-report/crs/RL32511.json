Current law allows pharmacists and wholesalers to import prescription drugs from Canada commercially, and codifies the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) current practice of allowing imports of prescription drugs by individuals under certain defined circumstances. There is, however, one proviso. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) must first certify that the drugs to be imported under the program would \"pose no additional risk to the public's health and safety; and result in a significant reduction in the cost of covered products to the American consumer\"\u2014a step no Secretary has been willing to take.", "FDA has argued that it is impossible to monitor the millions of transactions and guarantee that these drugs would be safe. Meanwhile, some states and municipalities, looking at ways to control their expenditures for prescription drugs, have created websites to direct U.S. consumers to Canadian sources, and several state Governors have proposed pilot import programs. In October 2006, Congress took limited action regarding personal-use importation. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2007, blocks Customs and Border Protection from using those funds to stop an individual's importing, for personal use, a limited supply of a drug that meets FDA standards.", "Drug importation was addressed in three pairs of comprehensive bills in the 109th Congress, none of which saw legislative action. To date, two revised versions have been introduced in the 110th (S. 242/H.R. 380 and S. 251). All would allow commercial and personal-use imports and replace the need for HHS Secretary certification with different ways to assure safety and effectiveness, among them requiring tamper-resistant and anti-counterfeit packaging; inspecting samples of imported drugs; requiring registration of importers, exporters, and Internet pharmacies; and enforcing extensive chain-of-custody monitoring and documentation. They also present different approaches for influencing industry response. Updates of this report will address bills and continuing discussions in the 110th Congress.", "Opponents of the legislation raise concerns about safety, added costs, the feasibility of imports as a long-term solution to high domestic prices, and whether, beyond the short term, U.S. consumers would pay less for their prescription drugs. Other points of contention include issues of patent law and international trade agreements.", "This report examines these issues, spells out how they are treated from bill to bill, and refers to the following alternatives to importation that might ease the burden of prescription drug costs on consumers: use of generics and disease management techniques; research and development incentives to industry; study of the drugs' comparative effectiveness and judicious application of the findings to benefit package and prescribing decisions; and assumption of some of the consumers' cost."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, U.S. consumers bought more than $1 billion in prescription drugs from Canada\u2014twice as much as the year before, by some estimates.

Many U.S. residents use the Internet or mail-order pharmacies; others simply go to a drug store when they travel outside the United States, especially to Canada or Mexico. The reason is clear. Brand-name prescription drugs often cost less abroad\u2014particularly for the uninsured and many of the elderly who pay retail prices.", "Under current law, only the manufacturer of a prescription drug may legally bring it into the United States. The law allows U.S. pharmacists and wholesalers to do so only if the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) first certifies that those drugs would be safe and that the program lowered drug costs for U.S. consumers. After issuing that certification, the Secretary must issue regulations allowing individuals to import prescription drugs. Because no HHS Secretary has ever taken that step, consumers, pharmacists, and wholesalers are prohibited from importing prescription drugs.", "Given the difference between prices in the United States and elsewhere, many Americans, including some Members of Congress, want legislation eliminating the restrictions on imports.", "This report does not address whether drug prices are too high or unfair. It does focus on the issues recent legislative proposals raise in attempting to help U.S. consumers\u2014themselves or through importing pharmacists and wholesalers\u2014gain access to safe and less expensive Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription drugs from abroad.", "The report begins with an overview of the domestic drug distribution system and how Congress has handled prescription drug importation. It then discusses the current situation following its upsurge in the volume of drug imports, state and local government initiatives, the drug industry and FDA's reactions, and the legislative proposals introduced to consider this issue. It goes on to examine three broad sets of issues surrounding importation. The first involves ensuring drug safety and effectiveness, by attending to product integrity and appropriate use. The next set explores whether a drug import program would be feasible administratively and in the context of international trade and pharmaceutical research and development. The report concludes by discussing the likelihood that a drug import program would save U.S. consumers money.

The FFDCA is the major law that set up the current U.S. system of drug regulation; subsequent legislation amends it. In the last 17 years, congressional and FDA actions have addressed the importation of prescription drugs by, in turn, limiting imports, establishing exceptions to those restrictions, and attempting to broaden access to imports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Distributing Prescription Drugs: The Current System", "paragraphs": ["FDA supervises the approval, production, and distribution of prescription drugs.

After approval, the manufacturer must continue production according to FDA-approved \"good manufacturing processes.\" The drug companies must periodically open their production facilities to rigorous FDA inspection.", "After production, the manufacturer sends the drug to FDA-registered U.S. drug wholesalers or secondary drug wholesalers for further distribution.

The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA, P.L. 100-293 ) banned the sale, trade, and purchase of drug samples; mandated storage, handling, and accounting standards for drug samples; and required that drug wholesalers be licensed by the states. To enforce the law, the FDA drafted regulations that would require drug companies to maintain a detailed \"chain of custody\" (known as a pedigree) for every pharmaceutical product sold in this country. By imposing strict recordkeeping requirements, FDA hoped, among other things, to ensure the safety and quality of all drugs that are exported and later imported back into the country. The recorded pedigree would allow manufacturers to trace back suspected counterfeit shipments.", "However, the law excluded manufacturers' authorized distributors from this recordkeeping requirement. Because most drugs are sold from authorized distributors into secondary drug wholesale distribution markets (not authorized distributors of record), the recordkeeping requirement created a dilemma. Because secondary distributors (authorized and unauthorized) receive no records or pedigree with the drugs they purchase, they do not have the information necessary to show a chain of custody. For that reason, when FDA published final regulations to implement this section of the PDMA in December 1999, the Small Business Administration petitioned the agency, arguing that enforcement of the provision would drive 4,000 or more secondary distributors out of business. Subsequently, FDA delayed the effective date of this provision's enforcement repeatedly, most recently because it believed that industry voluntary conversion to an electronic pedigree was imminent, in which case the rule would be superfluous. In 2006, seeing that industry's progress toward the technology change was slow, FDA announced and then finally implemented the rule on December 1, 2006.

On November 18, 2003, the United States and Canada signed a Memorandum of Understanding to share information on (1) pharmacies that export drugs to either nation, (2) quality defects or product recalls, (3) new regulations or policies regarding drugs, and (4) post-market surveillance results.", "Canadian pharmacies are regulated by provincial and federal authorities and are required to have licenses. These pharmacies cannot dispense a prescription drug without a prescription written by a physician licensed in Canada. Even though legitimate Internet or mail-order pharmacies require faxed or e-mailed prescriptions from a U.S.-licensed health care provider, there are some Canadian pharmacies (called \"rogue\" by FDA) that have apparently been set up only to dispense pharmaceuticals by mail. For some of these, Canadian physicians rewrite a U.S. prescription or initiate a Canadian original, not necessarily following whatever regulations Canada might require nor being available for the level of monitoring required in the United States.", "Canadian pharmacies may soon find it difficult to hire physicians to write prescriptions for U.S. patients. The Canadian Medical Protective Association, a large malpractice insurance company for physicians (about 95% of the doctors licensed to practice in Canada are members), has notified Canadian doctors that it would no longer provide coverage to \"risky activity\" meaning if the physician did not originate the prescription but instead co-signed it for Americans in search of cheaper drugs without examining the patients in person. The co-signing has been denounced by provincial and territorial licensing bodies. It also is illegal, according to Canadian law, for any Canadian entity to import drugs in finished dosage form from a foreign country for the purpose of subsequent export, according to the Canadian International Pharmacy Association.", "Cost and Price", "U.S. and Canadian pharmaceutical markets are significantly different. For example, approximately 98% of Canadian citizens over the age of 65 have some form of prescription drug coverage, mainly through their provincial government health programs. This allows the government to negotiate bulk purchasing contracts for pharmaceutical products. By federal law, Canada's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board keeps drug costs in check by regulating a drug's price based on guidelines involving the cost of alternate drugs, cost of the same drug in other developed countries, and changes in the Consumer Price Index. In addition, both public and private benefit plans actively manage costs using price and cost-effectiveness data, international price comparisons, reference pricing, substantial generic substitution, and pharmacy reimbursement policies."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
