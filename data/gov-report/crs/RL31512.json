Generally, the application requirements are more extensive for aliens who wish to permanently live in the United States than those coming for visits. The amount of paperwork required and the length of adjudication process to obtain a visa to come to the United States is analogous to that of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) tax forms and review procedures. Just as persons with uncomplicated earnings and expenses may file an IRS \"short form\" while those whose financial circumstances are more complex may file a series of IRS forms, so too an alien whose situation is straightforward and whose reason for seeking a visa is easily documented generally has fewer forms and procedural hurdles than an alien whose circumstances are more complex.

If the prospective immigrant is already residing in the United States, the USCIS handles the entire process, which is called \"adjustment of status.\" If the prospective LPR does not have legal residence in the United States, the petition is forwarded to Consular Affairs in their home country after USCIS has reviewed it. The Consular Affairs officer (when the alien is coming from abroad) and USCIS adjudicator (when the alien is adjusting status in the United States) must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to the immigrant status. Many LPRs are adjusting status from within the United States rather than receiving visas issued abroad by Consular Affairs, as Figure 1 indicates.

Most of these nonimmigrant visa categories are defined in \u00a7101(a)(15) of the INA. These visa categories are commonly referred to by the letter and numeral that denotes their subsection in \u00a7101(a)(15); for example, B-2 tourists, E-2 treaty investors, F-1 foreign students, H-1B temporary professional workers, J-1 cultural exchange participants, or S-4 terrorist informants.", "As with immigrant visas, the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for nonimmigrant status and the type of nonimmigrant visa for which the application is made. Nonimmigrants must demonstrate that they are coming for a limited period and for a specific purpose. Specifically \u00a7214(b) of the INA presumes that all aliens seeking admission to the United States are coming to live permanently; as a result, nonimmigrants must demonstrate that they are not coming to reside permanently. The Consular Affairs officer, at the time of application for a visa, as well as the Customs and Border Protection Bureau (CBP) inspectors, at the time of application for admission, must be satisfied that the alien is entitled to a nonimmigrant status. The law exempts only the H-1 workers, L intracompany transfers, and V family members from the requirement that they prove that they are not coming to live permanently. USCIS and CBP play a role determining eligibility for certain nonimmigrant visas, notably H workers and L intracompany transfers. Also, if a nonimmigrant in the United States wishes to change from one nonimmigrant category to another, such as from a tourist visa to a student visa, the alien files a change of status application with the USCIS. If the alien leaves the United States while the change of status is pending, the alien is presumed to have relinquished the application.", "Personal interviews are generally required for foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas. Interviews, however, may be waived in certain cases; prior to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, personal interviews for applicants for B visitor visas reportedly were often waived. This waiver formed the basis for the controversial and allegedly fraud-prone \"Visa Express\" in Saudi Arabia (now suspended) where travel agents pre-screened visa applicants and submitted petitions on behalf of the aliens. After September 11, 2001, the number of personal interviews rose significantly as part of broader efforts to meet national security goals. DOS issued interim regulations on July 7, 2003, that officially tightened up the requirements for personal interviews and substantially narrowed the class of nonimmigrants eligible for the waiver of a personal interview. Prior to implementation of P.L. 108-458 , personal interview waivers might have been granted only to children under age 16, persons 60 years or older, diplomats and representatives of international organizations, aliens who were renewing a visa they obtained within the prior 12 months, and individual cases for whom a waiver was warranted for national security or unusual circumstances.", "Nonimmigrant visas issued abroad dipped to 4.9 million in FY2003 after peaking at 7.6 million in FY2001.

The number of immigrant visas issued each year by consular officers abroad has held steady at about 0.4 million over the past decade.

However, the act allows the Secretary of State to waive the requirement until September 30, 2007 if he finds that the country is making progress towards instituting machine-readable passports and preventing passport fraud. Amendments to these provisions and progress in implementation are discussed elsewhere.", "Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act", "The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-173 , hereafter referred to as the Border Security and Visa Reform Act) expressly targeted the improvement of visa issuance procedures. Among its provisions, it required the development of an interoperable electronic data system to be used to share information relevant to alien admissibility and removability and the implementation of an integrated entry-exit data system. It also requires that all visas issued by October 2004 have biometric identifiers. In addition to increasing consular officers' access to electronic information needed for visa issuances, it expanded the training requirements for consular officers who issue visas.", "The Border Security and Visa Reform Act placed new requirements on the VWP, specifically mandating that the government of each VWP country certify by October 26, 2004 that it has established a program to issue tamper-resistant, machine-readable passports with a biometric identifier. The act also requires all VWP countries to certify that they report in a timely manner the theft of blank passports, allowing the Secretary of DHS to remove a country from the program if it is determined that the country is not reporting thefts of blank passports.", "Homeland Security Act", "Prior to establishment of the DHS, two departments\u2014the DOS through Consular Affairs and the DOJ through INS\u2014each played key roles in administering the law and policies on the admission of aliens. At that time, the INA gave DOS responsibility for issuing visas abroad, and specifically assigned such decisions to consular officers. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ) states that DHS through the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security issues regulations regarding visa issuances and assigns staff to consular posts abroad to advise, review, and conduct investigations, and that DOS's Consular Affairs will continue to issue visas. The memorandum of understanding that implements the working relationship between DOS and DHS's three immigration-related bureaus was signed September 29, 2003.", "Legislation in the 108 th Congress", "9/11 Commission Findings and Recommendations", "The report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the 9/11 Commission) offered its assessment of how visa and immigration inspection failures contributed to the terrorist attacks. The 9/11 Commission contended that \"(t)here were opportunities for intelligence and law enforcement to exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities.\" The report went on to state: \"Considered collectively, the 9/11 hijackers", "included known al Qaeda operatives who could have been watchlisted; presented fraudulent passports; presented passports with suspicious indicators of extremism; made detectable false statements on visa applications; made false statements to border officials to gain entry into the United States; and violated immigration laws while in the United States.\"", "The report maintained that border security was not considered to be a national security matter prior to 9/11, and as a result neither the State Department's consular officers nor the former INS's inspectors and officers were considered full partners in national counterterrorism efforts.", "The 9/11 Commission made several recommendations that underscore the urgency of implementing legislative provisions on visa policy and immigration control that Congress enacted several years ago. They also suggest areas in which Congress may wish to take further action. The specific recommendations are:", "Targeting travel is at least as powerful a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money. The United States should combine terrorist travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a strategy to intercept terrorists, find terrorist travel facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility. The U.S. border security system should be integrated into a larger network of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities, such as nuclear reactors. The Department of Homeland Security, properly supported by the Congress, should complete, as quickly as possible, a biometric entry-exit screening system, including a single system for speeding qualified travelers. The U.S. government cannot meet its own obligations to the American people to prevent the entry of terrorists without a major effort to collaborate with other governments.", "Other 9/11 Commission recommendations, notably those related to intelligence policy and structures, have been the focus thus far of congressional consideration and media attention. The 9/11 Commission prepared a subsequent report that deals expressly with immigration issues.", "Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act", "Legislation implementing the 9/11 Commission recommendations ( S. 2845 , H.R. 10 , S. 2774 / H.R. 5040 and H.R. 5024 ) had various provisions that would affect visa issuances. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), a compromise version of these bills that included some\u2014but not all\u2014of the immigration provisions under consideration, was signed on December 17, 2004.", "Most notably, House-passed S. 2845 would have expanded the terror-related grounds for inadmissibility and deportability to include additional activities, such as receiving military-type training by or on behalf of a terrorist organization. P.L. 108-458 would make deportable any alien who has received military training from or on behalf of an organization that, at the time of training, was a designated terrorist organization.", "Among the other provisions in the 9/11 Commission implementation bills were: acquire and deploy technologies (e.g., biometrics) to detect potential terrorist indicators on travel documents; establish an Office of Visa and Passport Security; and train consular officers in the detection of terrorist travel patterns. H.R. 10 (as reported by the House Judiciary Committee on September 27 and passed by the House as S. 2845 on October 8, 2004) included provisions to establish an Office of Visa and Passport Security in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security of the Department of State to target and disrupt individuals and organizations at home and in foreign countries that are involved in the fraudulent production, distribution, or use of visas, passports and other documents used to gain entry to the United States. It also would have clarified that all nonimmigrant visa applications are reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer, and would assign anti-fraud specialists to the top 100 posts that experience the greatest frequency of fraudulent documents. P.L. 108-458 establishes a Visa and Passport Security Program within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security at the Department of State.", "As passed by the Senate on October 8, 2004, S. 2845 \u2014as well as House-passed H.R. 10 \u2014would increase the number of consular officers by 150 over the preceding year, annually FY2006 through FY2009. Both bills also had provisions aimed at improving the security of the visa issuance process by providing consular officers and immigration inspectors greater training in detecting terrorist indicators, terrorist travel patterns and fraudulent documents. These provision were retained by the conferees in P.L. 108-458 .", "Personal Interviews", "On a related matter, concerns have been raised that consular officers did not personally interview many aliens to whom they issue nonimmigrant visas. By-passing the personal interview, especially for visitors coming for purportedly short periods of time, was advocated by some as an efficiency of staffing and resources. Critics assert that this cost savings comes at too high a price in terms of national security. While some argue that checking an alien's name in a database is no substitute for a face-to-face interview, others assert that the value of a brief personal interview is overrated as a security precaution and that time is better spent doing more thorough background checks. DOS's interim final regulations that increase the type and number of aliens required to have a personal interview have sparked concern that the waiting times to obtain a visa will increase dramatically. H.R. 3452 and H.R. 3522 would have, among other provisions, required all visa applicants to be interviewed.", "Senate-passed S. 2845 had provisions to narrow the authority to waive the personal interview for nonimmigrant visas to children under age 12, persons 65 years or older, diplomats and representatives of international organizations, aliens who are renewing a visa they obtained within the prior 12 months, and individual cases for whom a waiver is warranted for national interest or unusual circumstances (as determined by the Secretary of State). S. 2845 , as passed by the House, had provisions to clarify that all nonimmigrant visa applications are reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer. P.L. 108-458 requires an in-person consular interview of most applicants for nonimmigrant visas between the ages of 14 and 79; requires an alien applying for a nonimmigrant visa to completely and accurately respond to any request for information contained in the application; and clarifies that all nonimmigrant visa applications are reviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer. It also places at least one full-time anti-fraud specialist at diplomatic and consular posts deemed high-fraud unless there is a full-time employee of the DHS trained to do such tasks.", "Visa Revocation and Removal", "An ongoing issue has been the legal process for removing aliens whose visas have been revoked. Under current law the grounds for removal are similar\u2014but not identical\u2014to the grounds for inadmissibly discussed above, and include national security and related grounds as well as document fraud. Some have maintained that a foreign national should be immediately removed if the visa that enabled his or her entry has been revoked. They have recommended that grounds for removal in INA \u00a7212(a) should be amended to expressly state visa revocation as a basis for deportation. Some further argue that aliens whose visas are revoked should not be entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge to determine if the alien should be deported. Others have asserted that current law balances the broader discretion given to the consular officers abroad with the explicit standards of the grounds for inadmissibility and the legal process for removing aliens from the United States. They further have maintained that consular officers often make \"prudential revocations\" of visas that they subsequently re-issue and that anecdotal cases of mistaken identities suggest that the alien screening databases are not sufficiently precise to be the basis for removal without a hearing.", "On July 15, 2004, legislation ( S. 2661 ) was introduced to amend the INA to make the revocation of visas and of other documentation authorizing admission administratively and judicially unreviewable. It also would have added revocation of visas to those grounds of inadmissibility supporting deportation (thus making aliens subject to such revocation immediately removable). A similar provision was included in S. 2845 (\u00a73008) as passed by the House. The conferees retained the provision on visa revocation as a ground of inadmissibility, but P.L. 108-458 permits limited judicial review of removal if visa revocation is the sole basis of the removal.", "Other Security Concerns", "The Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act of 2003 ( H.R. 1440 / S. 710 ) would have, among other things, further broadened the security and terrorism grounds of inadmissibility to exclude aliens who have participated in the commission of acts of torture or extrajudicial killings abroad. In addition to denying visas to such aliens, these bills also would have made aliens already in the United States removable on the same grounds. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported S. 710 , filing a written report on November 24, 2003 ( S.Rept. 108-209 ). An amendment with similar language to S. 710 was approved when the House considered and passed S. 2845 on October 8, 2004. These provisions were included in P.L. 108-458 .", "Citing problems implementing the technology, the Bush Administration sought extensions in installing the biometric readers/scanners required by the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. The 108 th Congress enacted P.L. 108-299 ( H.R. 4417 ), which amended the law to extend by one year (to October 26, 2005) the deadline for installing at all U.S. ports of entry equipment and software capable of processing machine-readable, tamper-resistant entry and exit documents and passports that contain biometric identifiers. It also extended by one year the deadline for VWP countries to certify that they are issuing machine-readable, tamper-resistant passports that contain biometric and document authentication identifiers comporting with specified standards, and VWP participants who are issued passports on or after the new deadline to present passports that comply with such requirements.", "Legislation in the 109 th Congress", "At the time Congress passed the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 ( P.L. 108-458 ), some congressional leaders reportedly agreed to revisit certain immigration and document-security issues in the 109 th Congress that had been dropped from the final version of the legislation. Many of these dropped provisions were introduced as H.R. 418 , the REAL ID Act of 2005 and ultimately folded into the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005 ( H.R. 1268 , P.L. 109-13 ).", "The Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 ( H.R. 4437 ), as passed by the House in December 2005, had a few provisions that would have revised visa policies. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 ( S. 2611 ), as passed by the Senate in May 2006, also contained provisions aimed at revising visa policies. When the 109 th Congress closed, these major immigration reform proposals were left pending.", "REAL ID Act", "The REAL ID Act ( P.L. 109-13 , Division B) expands the terrorism-related grounds for alien inadmissibility and deportation, as well as the meaning of certain terms used in the INA to describe terrorist activities or entities, to cast a wider net over groups and persons who provide more discrete forms of assistance to terrorist organizations, particularly with respect to fund-raising and soliciting membership in those organizations. The REAL ID Act makes activities such as espousal of terrorist activity and receipt of military-type training from, or on behalf of, a terrorist organization grounds for exclusion. At the same time, the REAL ID Act provides the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security with authority to waive certain terrorism-related INA provisions that would otherwise make a particular alien inadmissible or cause a group to be designated as a terrorist organization.", "Denying Entry", "Under current law (INA \u00a7243(d)), the Secretary of State is required to deny visas to nationals of countries, when informed by the Attorney General that the country has denied or delayed accepting its citizens, nationals, or residents whom the United States ordered removed. H.R. 4437 would have rewritten this provision to authorize the Secretary of DHS, after consultation with the Secretary of State, to deny the admission of nationals of countries that deny or delay accepting their citizens, nationals, or residents whom the United States ordered removed. In other words, it would have shifted implementation from visa issuances at consulates abroad\u2014where reportedly the Attorney General has never invoked \u00a7243(d)\u2014to alien admissions at U.S. ports of entry. If enacted, foreign nationals who have visas but are from uncooperative countries would be denied admission when they arrive at ports of entry if the Secretary of DHS so deemed.", "In comparison, S. 2611 would have authorized the Secretary of DHS to instruct the Secretary of State to deny a visa to any citizen, subject, national, or resident of a country that has denied or delayed accepting its citizens whom the United States ordered removed, until the country accepts its citizens.", "Grounds of Inadmissibility", "H.R. 4437 would have expanded the criminal grounds for inadmissibility and deportation (including for alien gang members). Likewise, S. 2611 contained comparable provisions that would have revised the grounds for inadmissibility. In addition, S. 2611 would have expanded the terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility to cover any incitement or advocacy of terrorist activity (current law only expressly covers incitement in certain circumstances)."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
