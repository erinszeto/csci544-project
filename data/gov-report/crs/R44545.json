As of June 16, 2016, 60 countries and territories had reported mosquito-borne transmission of the virus, 39 of which are in Latin America and the Caribbean and are reporting cases of Zika for the first time. Brazil, which has registered the most confirmed cases of Zika in Latin America, will host the summer Olympics in August 2016. Scientists expect that travel destinations in the Caribbean will see more cases as the summer's warm, rainy season continues. More than 750 U.S. citizens, including pregnant women, have become infected through either travel or sexual transmission.", "Frequent business and tourist travel, combined with the close proximity and similar climates of Latin America and the southern United States, means that mosquito-borne Zika infections are likely in the United States. Zika is primarily spread by Aedes mosquitoes\u2014primarily Aedes aegypti but also Aedes albopictus, the latter of which is present in a majority of U.S. states. Local (or mosquito-borne) transmission has not yet occurred in the continental United States but is occurring in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "On February 8, 2016, the Obama Administration submitted an emergency request for almost $1.9 billion in supplemental funding to respond to the Zika outbreak, including $526 million for international efforts. On April 6, 2016, the Administration announced that it would reprogram $589 million in unobligated funds, including $510 million in Ebola supplemental funds, for efforts to address the Zika outbreak. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is reprogramming $215 million of that funding\u2014including a $78 million transfer to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2014for international efforts. In mid-May 2016, both the House and the Senate passed supplemental appropriations measures for Zika response. The House bill, H.R. 5243, would provide $622.1 million in Zika funding and rescind an equal amount of budget authority. The Senate measure (S.Amdt. 3900 to H.R. 2577, the combined FY2017 Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and Transportation-Housing and Urban Development appropriations bills) would provide $1.1 billion in Zika response funding without rescissions. On June 23, 2016, the House agreed to a conference agreement (see H.Rept. 114-640) that would provide $1.1 billion for Zika response, including $175.1 million for State Department and USAID activities.

Zika responses in the region have been led by Brazil and Colombia, multilateral organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO)/Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the U.S. government. Health experts have expressed concerns about the capacity of health systems\u2014particularly in Central America and the Caribbean\u2014to prevent, diagnose, and care for Zika cases and associated complications, particularly among pregnant women. Related issues of interest to Congress include how to balance support for U.S. initiatives and multilateral approaches, the proper scope and components of U.S. health assistance to the region, and funding for pandemic preparedness and research on neglected tropical illnesses in Latin America.", "This report focuses on the Latin American dimensions of the Zika virus.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has concluded that Zika causes microc ephaly (a serious birth defect involving brain damage) and is associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS, a neurological condition) and other neurological and autoimmune conditions. Latin America and the Caribbean have been most affected by this outbreak ( Figure 1 ). Since February 2016, new cases in the southern parts of the region have decreased, but an increase in new cases is expected in the Caribbean during the summer months as mosquitoes hatch and bite. The United States will likely experience an increase in travel-associated cases and possibly local transmission. Policymakers are concerned about the spread of Zika into the continental United States, as well as the potential that visitors traveling to the Olympics in Brazil in August could contract the virus and bring it back to their home countries.", "In February 2016, WHO Director-General Margaret Chan announced that the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee on Zika virus had determined that the Zika outbreak was a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Shortly thereafter, President Barack Obama requested that Congress provide almost $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations to fund domestic and international responses to the outbreak. A conference agreement on Zika funding was approved by the House but remains pending in the Senate. As Congress considers funding the Zika request and then exercises oversight over U.S. Zika responses in Latin America and the Caribbean, Members may consider issues such as the following: ", "Balance between U.S. bilateral and multilateral Zika responses . Although U.S. health assistance (bilateral and regional) to Latin America in general has declined, U.S. support for the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has increased. While considering the President's Zika request and the FY2017 budget request, Congress may discuss how much support to provide for multilateral responses in the region led by PAHO. U.S. health programs in Latin America as a part of U.S. policy toward the region . On average, roughly 10%-20% of the funds provided by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for Latin America between FY2009 and FY2016 have been aimed at health programs. The WHO has recommended that women and men in countries with local transmission of Zika be correctly informed and oriented to consider delaying pregnancy. Congress may evaluate reproductive health and family planning funding in the region given the WHO recommendation and the limited access to sexual education and contraception in the region.", "Regional a pportionment and components of global health budget . Less than 5% of all U.S. global health funds are provided to Latin America, and the majority of these funds are for HIV/AIDS programs. On average, health indicators in the region\u2014particularly those related to maternal and child health, family planning, and reproductive health\u2014are better than in other low- and middle-income countries, although inequities exist. Congress might reexamine the apportionment of global health funding and consider whether investments in the region are sufficient to meet emerging health concerns. F unding for pandemic preparedness . The United States committed to support 30 countries (including Haiti and Peru) and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in bolstering their ability to respond to disease outbreaks through the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA). Congress included almost $600 million in emergency Ebola appropriations to the CDC in support of GHSA and $50 million in FY2016 appropriations to USAID for pandemic preparedness activities. Congress might consider funding levels for those programs and where those funds are allotted. Investments in research and development of neglected diseases . In recent years, Aedes mosquitoes have caused three disease outbreaks (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika) in Latin America and the Caribbean, all of which have been imported into the United States, with the latter being only travel-associated at the time of this report. These and other diseases lack vaccines to prevent transmission, treatment regimens, and effective vector control tools. Congress might evaluate options to address threats from new and reemerging diseases, including those that are mosquito-borne.", "This report provides background information on the Zika virus, discusses challenges faced by governments and implementing partners in the Latin America and Caribbean region that are attempting to control the ongoing outbreak, and analyzes the above issues in the context of the U.S. Zika response.

In 2007, the first large Zika outbreak was recorded on the Micronesian island of Yap. Household surveys detected 185 cases. ", "Scientists are studying the virulence of the Zika virus and the extent to which human activity affects global spread. Retrospective studies of a 2013-2014 outbreak in French Polynesia linked Zika infection with GBS for the first time. The current outbreak, which began in Brazil, has been accompanied with a spike in microcephaly and GBS cases, as well as other neurological and autoimmune disorders. As of June 16, 2016, WHO has reported more than 1,600 cases of Zika-related microcephaly worldwide\u2014almost all in Brazil.

Throughout the region, millions of people live in densely populated urban slums and poor rural communities where homes and other facilities lack air conditioning or window screens. Lack of proper plumbing and poor sanitation facilitate mosquito breeding, as mosquitoes can lay their eggs in standing water. Aedes mosquitoes thrive in such conditions, biting during the day and breeding indoors and out.", "Health threats to Latin American and Caribbean populations may also be exacerbated by the 2015-2016 El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which is reflected in unusually warm water in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The present El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which has been particularly strong, has produced multiyear droughts in some areas (Colombia, Venezuela, and northern Central America) and extreme flooding in others (Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay). The warm, wet weather has facilitated the proliferation of mosquitoes, and human responses to drought conditions have provided favorable conditions for mosquito breeding because more people have been storing water. Studies have also linked climate change with greater health threats, such as increasing prevalence of malaria, chikungunya, and dengue fever. In recent years, Aedes mosquitoes have spread chikungunya, dengue, and Zika across the Americas. All three of these diseases have been imported into the United States and can become locally transmissible because the Aedes mosquito resides in large segments of the United States.

In terms of preparedness and response to epidemiological emergencies, including Zika, recent assessments of core capacities under the International Health Regulations carried out by PAHO have highlighted weaknesses in health system capacity in all Caribbean countries (including Suriname and Guyana), selected countries of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), Bolivia, and Paraguay.

Gang violence and insecurity have also reportedly prevented health workers from providing services in some parts of El Salvador and Honduras.", "Should Zika-associated cases of microcephaly become more common outside of Brazil, the health systems in the region may come under strain. Most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean lack the capacity to treat children born with severe birth defects and do not generally permit abortion. Lifetime care for a child with microcephaly can be expensive. In the United States, such care can cost up to $10 million.

As a result, Brazil's Ministry of Health has issued guidelines for providing physical and occupational therapy to children born with microcephaly and is certifying hospitals capable of providing care to those infants. Brazil's congress passed a law to provide a small monthly stipend to families caring for microcephalic children, many of whom are led by single mothers who have lost the ability to maintain employment due to the type of care microcephalic babies require. Many observers are concerned that there may be a rise in illegal abortions (and possibly maternal mortality due to unsafe abortions) in Brazil as a result of increasing diagnoses of microcephaly.", "The Brazilian government has launched a National Plan to Combat the Aedes Mosquito and Microcephaly, which includes research, prevention, and mosquito control efforts, as well as health assistance for pregnant women and children. Brazil has several world-class research institutions with vast experience in tropical diseases, and the country's national public health institutions are working with local and international partners to develop more efficient diagnostic kits, antiviral drugs, and a Zika vaccine. The government has dispatched 220,000 troops and 300,000 health agents to communities around the country to educate the population and eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. Officials have placed particular focus on mosquito-control efforts in Rio de Janeiro, which is scheduled to host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in August. ", "Some observers have expressed concerns about the adequacy of Brazil's efforts, particularly in low-income areas. Although Brazil has one of the most advanced public health systems in Latin America, significant discrepancies exist in the quality of prenatal care and child mortality rates between the poor north and northeast regions, where many Afro-descendants live (and many Zika cases have been concentrated), and the wealthier south.

Policymakers concerned about development in Latin America may consider whether health should once again become a larger component of U.S. assistance programs, as inadequate access to health services can exacerbate poverty and inequality. A recent report by the U.N. Development Program urged governments and donors in the region to focus on addressing exclusion experienced by Afro-descendant and indigenous populations, women who suffer from domestic violence, and rural populations. These issues may be of particular concern in Central America, where the Administration significantly increased development assistance in FY2016 (and in the FY2017 request) but did not include any funds for bilateral health programs in Honduras or El Salvador."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Global Health Support in Latin America", "paragraphs": ["With support from USAID and other donors, many Latin American countries have made notable progress in improving the delivery of primary health care services\u2014including access to contraception and basic prenatal care\u2014over the past few decades. Since the 1960s, these developments have led to a 41% decline in maternal mortality, a 70% decline in infant mortality, and a drop in fertility rates from six children per family to between two and three children per family.

In FY2009, for example, USAID implemented global health programs in 14 countries in the region. By FY2016, USAID global health programs were operating in five countries (Brazil, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Guyana, and Haiti). In three of those countries (Brazil, Dominican Republic, and Guyana), global health programs focus only on HIV/AIDS. In FY2009, maternal and child health (23%) and reproductive health and family planning programs (13%) together constituted almost 40% of USAID health programs in Latin America. By 2016, maternal and child health (8%) and family planning and reproductive health programs (7%) amounted to 15% of all USAID health spending in the region.", "In 2016, health ministers in several countries urged women to consider postponing pregnancy in response to Zika. Delaying or avoiding pregnancy is a problem in some communities where access to affordable and reliable contraception is limited and domestic violence (including spousal rape) is a major problem. Experts estimate that some 56% of pregnancies in Latin America are unplanned, particularly among adolescents in poor communities who often do not have access to sexual education or counseling. Health experts, including WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, have decried this constraint. The WHO/PAHO Zika Strategic Response Plan urges support for reproductive health counseling and services, and pre- and postnatal care to pregnant women who may be affected by Zika and related birth defects.", "Some groups have advocated for many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to legalize abortions for severe microcephaly cases and have urged the United States to bolster investments in family planning and reproductive health services across the region. Others oppose the legalization of abortion and argue that additional resources should be spent on finding effective treatments and vaccines. In February 2016, Pope Francis\u2014an Argentinian who is influential in largely Catholic Latin America\u2014indicated that birth control may be the \"lesser evil\" compared with allowing babies to be born with microcephaly, though he remained staunchly opposed to abortion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pandemic Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, a succession of new and reemerging infectious diseases have caused outbreaks and pandemics that have together affected millions of people worldwide: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (2003), Avian Influenza H5N1 (2005), Pandemic Influenza H1N1 (2009), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (2013), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2015). In 2014, former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan announced the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), a global effort to accelerate implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005), particularly in resource-poor countries that lack the ability to comply with the regulations. The regulations include measures to strengthen global responses to public health events with potential international impact.

As of 2012, PAHO maintained that only six countries (Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, and the United States) were prepared to handle a pandemic.

The Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) within HHS has received a number of proposals to develop new Zika vaccines using vaccine platforms that could also be used for other emerging infectious disease threats. BARDA, NIH, and DOD are collaborating to support the development of a vaccine at DOD's Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.", "Health experts argue that the Zika outbreak highlights the need to increase research not only for the treatment and prevention of human Zika infections but also for the development of effective vector control measures. At the 69 th World Health Assembly, WHO Director-General Chan asserted that \"the spread of Zika, the resurgence of dengue, and the emerging threat from chikungunya are the price being paid for a massive policy failure that dropped the ball on mosquito control in the 1970s.\" Inappropriate and inconsistent use of insecticides has led to insecticide resistance and the growth of Aedes populations across the Western Hemisphere. This phenomenon has prompted some to advocate for increased U.S. investments in vector control in the region.
