However, it says, their increasing technical competency is resulting in an emerging capability for network-based attacks. The FBI has predicted that terrorists will either develop or hire hackers for the purpose of complementing large conventional attacks with cyberattacks.

However, for a targeted attack to be successful, the attackers usually require that the network itself remain more or less intact, unless the attackers assess that the perceived gains from shutting down the network entirely would offset the accompanying loss of their own communication. A future targeted cyberattack could be effective if directed against a portion of the U.S. critical infrastructure, and if timed to amplify the effects of a simultaneous conventional physical or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) terrorist attack. The objectives of a cyberattack may include the following four areas:", "loss of integrity, such that information could be modified improperly; loss of availability, where mission-critical information systems are rendered unavailable to authorized users; loss of confidentiality, where critical information is disclosed to unauthorized users; and physical destruction, where information systems create actual physical harm through commands that cause deliberate malfunctions.", "Publicity would also potentially be one of the primary objectives for a terrorist cyberattack. Extensive media coverage has shown the vulnerability of the U.S. information infrastructure and the potential harm that could be caused by a cyberattack. This might lead terrorists to believe that even a marginally successful cyberattack directed at the United States would garner considerable publicity. Some suggest that were such a cyberattack by an international terrorist organization to occur and become known to the general public, regardless of the level of success of the attack, concern by many citizens and cascading effects might lead to widespread disruption of critical infrastructures. For example, reports of an attack on the international financial system's networks could create a fiscal panic in the public that could lead to economic damage.", "According to security experts, terrorist groups have not yet used their own computer hackers nor hired hackers to damage, disrupt, or destroy critical infrastructure systems.

Stuxnet is thought to be the first piece of malicious software (malware) that was specifically designed to target the computer-networked industrial control systems that control utilities, in this case nuclear power plants in Iran. Although many experts contend that the level of sophistication, intelligence, and access required to develop Stuxnet all point to nation states, not only is the idea now in the public sphere for others to build upon, but the code has been released as well.

Quite often the jihadist websites are the first indicators of extreme elements of the jihadist community identifying a controversial issue for purposes of inciting action harmful to U.S. interests. For example, a recent controversy in the United States about a proposed burning of copies of the Quran on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks led to increased chatter on international jihadist websites.

DOD refers to these activities as \"Defense Support to Public Diplomacy\" (DSPD).", "Although some reports warn of social media's potential misuse by terrorists, government policies are evolving to embrace the use of tools such as Facebook and Twitter as a means of strategic communications and public diplomacy. On the one hand, according to a U.S. Army report, social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook can be used by terrorist groups to expand networks and exchange real-time information, enabling operatives to organize and act quickly. These tools can not only spread propaganda, but can also host embedded malicious software in links and applications that can corrupt an unsuspecting user's electronic device. Based on these security concerns, several services and offices within DOD had banned certain social networking sites from access on their unclassified networks. However, the federal government has begun to embrace using these same tools to allow free access to information, spread democratic values and ideas, and combat the misinformation spread by terrorist groups' media campaigns. In February 2010, DOD issued a directive-type memo (DTM) outlining the department's new social media policy, citing Internet-based capabilities including social networking services as integral to operations. This policy is due to expire in March 2011; reportedly, there are no plans to develop a replacement policy, nor plans to fill the top positions that were instrumental in creating the social media policy. Some fear that the recent WikiLeaks issue may push the pendulum back toward more restricted access to Internet-based capabilities and less information sharing between organizations. Others note that, to date, much of the activity conducted under the current policy has been one-sided, focused on using social network tools to gather information about others, including potential adversaries, rather than to send messages outward in order to shape the information environment.

Also, some point to the potential futility of offensively attacking websites, as a dismantled site may be easily relocated to another server.", "The 2010 National Security Strategy mentions the importance of the Internet for commerce and for disseminating information, and the importance of cybersecurity in protecting national security assets, but does not appear to present a strategy specifically for combating violent extremism on the Internet."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Activity", "paragraphs": ["A number of hearings have been held to address the issue of violent extremism on the Internet. In a March 2, 2010, \"Dear Colleague\" letter, Members of the House of Representatives announced the formation of a new Strategic Communications and Public Diplomacy Caucus, whose stated purpose is to \"raise awareness of the challenges facing strategic communication and public diplomacy and provide multiple perspectives on proposed solutions.\" On July 13, 2010, the caucus's chairs, Representatives Mac Thornberry and Adam Smith, introduced H.R. 5729 , the Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2010. This measure would amend the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 to allow the Secretary of State to create products designed to influence audiences abroad that could also be disseminated domestically, thereby removing the \"firewall.\" ", "Another piece of legislation introduced in the 111 th Congress was S. 3480 , the Protection of Cyberspace as a National Asset Act. This bill, which may be reintroduced in some form in the current Congress, has generated much discussion over what some describe as the \"Internet Kill Switch.\" Recent events of social unrest and government Internet control in the Middle East highlight the question of whether the President has the authority to \"turn off\" the U.S. connection to the Internet in times of similar crisis and whether such authority is needed. Critics consider such a communication disruption as an attack on the freedom of speech and the free flow of information. Others point to the economic damage that could result from the loss of networked communications. Regardless, blocking the flow of traffic into and out of U.S. information infrastructure would require the assistance of many private Internet service providers (ISPs), as there is no single, government-owned national network. The bill's sponsors wrote that such authorities already exist for the President to compel private companies to suspend service, particularly in the Communications Act of 1934, and the new legislation would actually limit presidential emergency powers over the Internet. A new proposal in the 112 th Congress, S. 413 , the Cybersecurity and Internet Freedom Act of 2011, contains a provision that would amend the Communications Act of 1934 so that, \"[n]otwithstanding any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this Act, or section 706 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 606), neither the President, the Director of the National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications, or any officer or employee of the United States Government shall have the authority to shut down the Internet.\"", "The Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), codified in Title V of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, was an effort to regulate both indecency and obscenity in cyberspace. Although much of it is targeted at lewd or pornographic material, particularly when shown to children under the age of 18, the law's definition of obscenity and harassment could also be interpreted as applying to graphic, violent terrorist propaganda materials or incendiary language. YouTube's terms of use (called \"Community Guidelines\") prohibit, among other things, \"gratuitous and graphic violence\" and \"hate speech.\" To control its content, YouTube employs a user-feedback system, where users flag potentially offensive videos that are then reviewed and removed by the site's administrators. However, Section 230 of the CDA reads: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" This would absolve both ISPs and Internet administrators from liability for the words or crimes committed by third-party users of their websites or online forums, even if the provider or administrator fails to take action after receiving notice of the harmful or offensive content. In other words, although many ISPs and website administrators follow internal policies that restrict the type of material posted on their sites or trafficked through their networks, they may not have a legal responsibility to dismantle a site with offensive or violent content. ", "In September 2010, General Alexander told the House Armed Services Committee that the White House was leading an effort to review the legal framework governing operations in cyberspace and the protection of telecommunications infrastructure. The results of this review will be presented to Congress, with legislative recommendations on what new statutes may be required and which should be revised or amended to facilitate effective operations in cyberspace. The 2011 National Military Strategy also contains a point to that effect."], "subsections": []}]}}
