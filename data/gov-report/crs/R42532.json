One disadvantage is therefore the possibility that displaced brine could leak into underground sources of drinking water. Ultimately, CO 2 will likely dissolve into the brine, but that could take decades. Also, injecting large volumes of fluid into the subsurface has the potential to trigger earthquakes, especially if the CO 2 is injected into an undetected fault. Presumably, evaluating the potential storage site prior to beginning injection will limit the potential for triggering earthquakes (also referred to as \"induced seismicity\"), but there is no guarantee that fluid could not migrate to faulted or fractured rocks over the course of many years and induce an earthquake.

When this process occurs naturally, it is known as \"weathering\" and takes place over thousands or millions of years. The process can be accelerated by reacting a high concentration of CO 2 with minerals found in large quantities on the Earth's surface, such as olivine or serpentine. Mineral carbonation has the advantage of sequestering carbon in solid, stable minerals that can be stored without risk of releasing carbon to the atmosphere over geologic time scales.", "Mineral carbonation involves three major activities: (1) preparing the reactant minerals\u2014mining, crushing, and milling\u2014and transporting them to a processing plant, (2) reacting the concentrated CO 2 stream with the prepared minerals, and (3) separating the carbonate products and storing them in a suitable repository."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Advantages and Disadvantages", "paragraphs": ["Mineral carbonation is well understood and can be applied at small scales, but is at an early phase of development as a technique for sequestering large amounts of captured CO 2 . Large volumes of silicate oxide minerals are needed, from 1.6 to 3.7 metric tons of silicates per tCO 2 sequestered. Thus, a large-scale mineral carbonation process needs a large mining operation to provide the reactant minerals in sufficient quantity. Large volumes of solid material would also be produced, between 2.6 and 4.7 metric tons of materials per tCO 2 sequestered, or 50%-100% more material to be disposed of by volume than originally mined. Because mineral carbonation is in the research and experimental stage, estimating the amount of CO 2 that could be sequestered by this technique is difficult.", "One possible type of geological reservoir for CO 2 storage\u2014major flood basalts such as those on the Columbia River Plateau\u2014is being explored for its potential to react with CO 2 and form solid carbonates in situ (in place). Instead of mining, crushing, and milling the reactant minerals, as discussed above, CO 2 would be injected directly into the basalt formations and would react with the rock over time and at depth to theoretically form solid carbonate minerals. Large and thick formations of flood basalts occur globally, and many have characteristics\u2014such as high porosity and permeability\u2014that are favorable to storing CO 2 . Those characteristics, combined with the tendency of basalt to react with CO 2 , could result in a large-scale conversion of the gas into stable, solid minerals that would remain underground for geologic time. The DOE regional carbon sequestration partnerships are exploring the possibility of using Columbia River Plateau flood basalts in the Pacific Northwest for storing CO 2 ."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Current Issues and Future Challenges", "paragraphs": ["A primary goal of developing and deploying CCS is to allow large industrial facilities, such as fossil fuel power plants and cement plants, to operate while reducing their CO 2 emissions by 80%-90%. Such reductions would presumably reduce the likelihood of continued climate warming from greenhouse gases by slowing the rise in atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 . To achieve the overarching goal of reducing the likelihood of continued climate warming would depend, in part, on how fast and how widely CCS could be deployed throughout the economy. ", "The additional cost of installing CCS on CO 2 -emitting facilities is a primary challenge to the adoption and deployment of CCS in the United States, especially in an environment of low natural gas prices and increasing domestic natural gas supplies. Major increases in CO 2 capture technology efficiency will likely produce the greatest relative cost savings for CCS systems, but challenges also face the transport and storage components of CCS. Ideally, storage reservoirs for CO 2 would be located close to sources, obviating the need to build a large pipeline infrastructure to deliver captured CO 2 for underground sequestration. If CCS moves to widespread implementation, however, some areas of the country may not have adequate reservoir capacity nearby, and may need to construct pipelines from sources to reservoirs. Identifying and validating sequestration sites would need to account for CO 2 pipeline costs, for example, if the economics of the sites are to be fully understood. If this is the case, there would be questions to be resolved regarding pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO 2 itself, and pipeline safety. In addition, Congress may be called upon to address federal jurisdictional authority over CO 2 pipelines under existing law, and whether additional legislation may be necessary if a CO 2 pipeline network grows and crosses state lines.", "Although DOE has identified substantial potential storage capacity for CO 2 , particularly in deep saline formations, large-scale injection experiments are only beginning in the United States to test how different types of reservoirs perform during CO 2 injection. Data from the experiments will undoubtedly be crucial to future permitting and site approval regulations. ", "In addition, liability, ownership, and long-term stewardship for CO 2 sequestered underground are issues that would need to be resolved before CCS is deployed commercially. Some states are moving ahead with state-level geological sequestration regulations for CO 2 , so federal efforts to resolve these issues at a national level would likely involve negotiations with the states. Acceptance by the general public of large-scale deployment of CCS may be a significant challenge if the majority of CCS projects involve private land. Some of the large-scale injection tests could garner information about public acceptance, as local communities become familiar with the concept, process, and results of CO 2 injection tests. Apart from the question of how the public would accept the likely higher cost for electricity generated from plants with CCS, how a growing CCS infrastructure of pipelines, injection wells, underground reservoirs, and other facilities would be accepted by the public is as yet unknown."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other CRS Reports", "paragraphs": ["CRS reports covering different aspects of CCS are listed below.", "CRS Report R42496, Carbon Capture and Sequestration: Research, Development, and Demonstration at the U.S. Department of Energy , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report R41325, Carbon Capture: A Technology Assessment , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report R40103, Carbon Control in the U.S. Electricity Sector: Key Implementation Uncertainties , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL33971, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Pipelines for Carbon Sequestration: Emerging Policy Issues , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL34059, The Carbon Cycle: Implications for Climate Change and Congress , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL34621, Capturing CO2 from Coal-Fired Power Plants: Challenges for a Comprehensive Strategy , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL34601, Community Acceptance of Carbon Capture and Sequestration Infrastructure: Siting Challenges , by [author name scrubbed].", "CRS Report RL34316, Pipelines for Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Control: Network Needs and Cost Uncertainties , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}]}}
