The House approved the measure on June 19 and the Senate on June 26. As enacted, the bill reflects compromises with the White House on several key issues.

The amended bill also drops most Iraq-related policy provisions that had been in earlier versions.

A key issue in congressional action on the bill was whether to offset the long-term costs of expanded benefits, which CBO estimated would amount to $52 billion through FY2018. In May, under pressure from \"Blue Dog\" Democrats, the House leadership agreed to add to the bill a 0.5% surcharge on high income taxpayers as a means of offsetting the cost of the program. The Senate, however, did not agree to the tax offset, and it was not included in the May 22 Senate-passed bill.", "Subsequently, as the House leadership considered how to proceed, \"Blue Dog\" Democrats in the House continued to warn that they would vote against the final bill if it did not offset the costs.

At a May 8 press conference, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Michael Mullen complained that the measure being proposed in the House and Senate bills would undermine retention of personnel because it would make full educational benefits available for service members who have not reenlisted for a second term.

The Graham bill would provide larger benefits for military personnel who serve for at least 12 years and permit benefits to be transferred to other family members.

However, of the roughly $2.1 billion appropriated in this category of assistance, only about $230 million was for economic aid under the foreign operations portion of the bill, the bulk of enacted reconstruction assistance being in the form of DOD appropriations.

The DOD appropriations reconstruction request included $2 billion for the ISFF, $1.7 billion for the CERP in Iraq and Afghanistan, of which at least half would go to Iraq, and $50 million for the Business Task Force. Both DOD and Foreign Operations portions of the FY2009 emergency request were considered by Congress at the same time as the FY2008 supplemental.", "The accounts to be funded under both FY2008 and FY2009 supplemental requests for Iraq support a wide range of reconstruction programs. ESF is the primary source of funding for assistance disbursed by the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), which have grown in number under the surge to 25, including 13 newly established ePRTs (embedded PRTs) embedded with U.S. combat battalions and concentrated mostly in Baghdad and Anbar province. The ePRTs are intended to help stabilize areas secured by U.S. and Iraqi forces by supporting local small-scale, employment-generating, economic projects, using ESF-funded community development grants, job training and micro-loan programs, among other activities. PRTs also utilize ESF to increase the capacities of local government officials to spend Iraqi-owned capital funds allocated by the Iraqi government for infrastructure programs. At the national level, ESF supports ministerial capacity development, agriculture and private sector reform, and the strengthening of democratization efforts.", "Of the ESF request, $25 million, accompanied by proposed authorization language, would allow the Administration to establish a new Iraq enterprise fund based on the model created for east Europe and the former Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Enterprise funds are U.S. government-funded private sector-run bodies that primarily provide loans or equity investments to small and medium business. In the former communist countries, enterprise funds also encouraged growth of the private sector, including support for mortgage lending markets and establishment of private equity funds. The most successful example, the Polish Fund, made many profitable investments, helping companies grow that otherwise were unable to obtain financial support in the period just after the fall of communism. Some of the funds, however, have been much less successful, either because they took on poor investment risks, or because they were unable to locate promising businesses due to the poor business climate or competition from other private sector funding sources. Some observers question the usefulness of the funds because their ostensible development purpose seems often to conflict with pressures for economic profit.", "The INCLE account largely would support rule of law and corrections programs. The Administration request was expected to fund prison construction, something that Congress has sometimes cut from previous requests. The request was also intended to extend judicial reform and anticorruption efforts to the provinces. The MRA request would address the continuing refugee crisis in the region; an estimated 2.0 million Iraqis have fled the country and another 2.2 million have been displaced due to sectarian violence and instability.", "The CERP allows military commanders to support a wide variety of economic activities at the local level, from renovating health clinics to digging wells to painting schools, provided in the form of small grants. CERP also funds many infrastructure efforts no longer supported with other U.S. assistance, such as provision of electric generators and construction of sewer systems and roads. Commanders are able to identify needs and dispense aid with few bureaucratic encumbrances.

The second amendment, approved by a vote of 206-201, provided $31 billion in emergency defense appropriations, mostly restricted to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which encompasses operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, excluding Iraq. Funding for Army and Marine Corps operation and maintenance was made available only for OEF, except for amounts for force protection that could be allocated to any area.
