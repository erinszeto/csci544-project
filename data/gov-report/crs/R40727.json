However, it is about $9 billion less than total FY2009 funding for HUD, if the more than $13 billion in emergency economic stimulus funding provided by P.L. 111-5 is taken into account.", "This budget request included increased funding for most HUD programs, such as the Section 8 voucher program, public housing program, housing programs for persons who are elderly or disabled, and block grant programs for states and localities.

HUD's programs are primarily designed to address housing problems faced by households with very low incomes or other special housing needs. These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the Department's non-emergency funding (almost 74% in FY2009). Two flexible block grant programs, HOME and Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), help communities finance a variety of housing and community development activities designed to serve low-income families. Other, more specialized, grant programs help communities meet the needs of homeless persons, including those with AIDS. HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to lower-income home buyers, many with below-average credit records, and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers, which are used to sustain the insurance fund and offset its administrative costs. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset the cost of the HUD budget.", "In recent years, the HUD budget has also received significant amounts of emergency supplemental funding. Almost $20 billion was provided through HUD's budget for recovery assistance to communities affected by Hurricane Katrina and the other 2005 hurricanes.

As a result, the amount provided in the annual appropriations acts each year generally determines how much funding will be obligated and eventually spent for each of HUD's programs and activities.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , generally in response to disasters, through one or more of HUD's programs. These funds are generally provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular program level funding.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits in the amount of new, non-emergency, discretionary appropriations they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to provide less in regular annual appropriations. Another way is to find offsets for spending. A portion of the cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees paid by HUD partners or clients.", "The interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions, receipts, and collections, determines HUD's total budget authority. Budget authority is also the \"cost\" of the HUD budget, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office in its scorekeeping process. The total amount of budget authority provided to HUD each year, while important for federal budgeting purposes, is not necessarily the best measure of the amount of funding that is being provided for HUD's programs and activities. ", "For example, if Congress has increased appropriations for HUD's programs and activities at the same time that offsetting receipts are increasing by a greater amount, then HUD's total budget authority may appear to be declining. Conversely, if Congress has reduced appropriations for HUD's programs and activities at the same time that offsetting receipts are declining by a greater amount, then HUD's budget authority may appear to be increasing. If Congress wished to maintain level budget authority for HUD programs, Congress would increase appropriations if offsets are declining (or, provide less appropriations if offsets are increasing).", "As shown by the line in Figure 1 , net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 41% between FY2002 and FY2009, from over $29 billion to over $40 billion. However, the increase in net new non-emergency budget authority masks several important trends.", "From FY2002 to FY2009, regular annual appropriations, which is the amount available to fund HUD's programs and activities, grew by 20%. During the same period, the amount available in offsetting receipts and collections, which Congress uses to reduce the cost of providing new appropriations, declined by more than 75% (see Figure 1 ). As a result, the increase in total non-emergency budget authority for HUD from FY2002 to FY2009 is not fully attributable to increases in appropriations for HUD's programs and activities; rather, part of the increase in total budget authority is attributable to decreases in the amount available in offsetting receipts.", "For example, in FY2007, Congress provided $39 billion in regular appropriations for HUD's programs and activities. As shown by the line in Figure 1 , since $3 billion was available from offsets and rescissions, HUD's net non-emergency budget authority was only $36 billion. If less had been available in offsets, the cost to Congress of providing $39 billion in regular appropriations (net new budget authority) would have been higher.", "The increase in regular (non-emergency) appropriations shown in Figure 1 (from just over $35 billion in FY2002 to over $42 billion in FY2009) is largely attributable to the growth in appropriations for the project-based and tenant-based Section 8 programs. From FY2002 to FY2009, non-emergency appropriations for the Section 8 programs grew by 50%; non-emergency appropriations for all other programs and activities during that period grew by only about 4%. As can be seen in Figure 2 , appropriations for the Section 8 program have grown from about 46% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2002 to about 54% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2009. Congress has increased funding for these programs in part because it has funded new Section 8 vouchers, in some cases to serve new families, and in some cases to provide assistance to families whose project-based rental assistance has expired or whose public housing has been demolished or sold. In other cases, it has required new appropriations to continue to serve the same families in the project-based rental assistance program, as previous funding for long-term rental assistance contracts has run out.", "The decline in offsetting receipts over this period is largely attributable to declines in excess receipts in the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) mortgage insurance programs (discussed later in this report). As shown in Figure 3 , from the peak (in FY2004) to the lowest point (in FY2008), the amount of offsetting receipts available from the FHA mortgage insurance program declined by 92%. While the amount of FHA offsetting receipts increased in FY2009, they are expected to decline below the FY2008 level in FY2010, although, as discussed later in this report, that decline may be partially offset by an expected increase in receipts from the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FY2010 Appropriations", "paragraphs": [" Table 2 presents President Obama's FY2010 budget request for HUD and the congressional response, compared to the prior year's enacted budget authority.

The GI/SRI fund provides insurance for more risky home mortgages, for multifamily rental housing, and for an assortment of special-purpose loans such as hospitals and nursing homes. (For more information, see CRS Report RS20530, FHA-Insured Home Loans: An Overview , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].)", "Historically, the MMI fund has had a negative subsidy rate, which means that it generated negative credit subsidy that could be used to offset the credit subsidy needs of other programs.", "In recent years, FHA has experienced adverse loan performance due to a number of reasons. As a result of this loan performance, the FY2009 HUD budget submission noted that the MMI fund has a positive credit subsidy rate and would require appropriations of credit subsidy budget authority to continue operation. The Budget did not request a credit subsidy appropriation and assumed that it would use its existing authorities to increase the insurance premiums to borrowers, and thereby avoid the need for credit subsidy appropriations. The collapse of the subprime mortgage market has resulted in an increase in applications for FHA-insured loans. For the FY2010 Budget, HUD estimates that the MMI fund has returned to a negative subsidy rate of 0.57%, which would produce $1.7 billion in negative credit subsidy. ", "The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P.L. 110-289 , moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program into the MMI fund, and it is separately accounted. In prior years, the HECM program was estimated to produce a negative credit subsidy. When HUD re-estimated the subsidy rates for FY2010, the subsidy rate for the HECM program was estimated as positive, because the present housing market has resulted in lower than expected appreciation rates for homes. For FY2010, the Administration estimated that the HECM program would have a positive subsidy rate of 2.66% and would need appropriations of $798 million in credit subsidy.", "Under the assumptions in the President's budget, the net credit subsidy for the MMI fund in FY2010 would be -$902 million, meaning that the MMI fund would provide income to the government.", "The Congressional Budget Office, however, assumes in its re-estimate of the President's budget that the MMI would not produce any negative credit subsidy. Under CBO's assumptions, which are used by Congress, due to large negative credit subsidy needed for the HECM program, the MMI fund would need a net positive credit subsidy appropriation in FY2010.", "Both the House-passed and Senate-passed versions of H.R. 3288 would have required HUD to make changes to the HECM program to minimize the amount of positive credit subsidy required in the MMI fund.", "Under H.R. 3288 , as passed by the House, HUD would have been directed to adjust the factors used to calculate the principal limit for HECMs such that the program operates at a net zero subsidy rate. The House bill also expected HUD to implement the changes to the HECM program recommended by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in its recent report. The net effect of the requirements in the House bill is that the MMI fund would not have needed the $798 million in credit subsidy for HECMs assumed by the President's budget.", "Under the Senate version of H.R. 3288 , HUD would have been directed to reduce by 5% the factors used to calculate the principal limits for HECMs. As a result, the positive subsidy requirement for HECMs would be $288 million under the Senate-passed bill, compared to $0 under the House bill, and $798 million under the President's budget.", "The continuing resolution, P.L. 111-68 , adopted the House language and directed HUD to calculate these factors such that the HECM program operates at a net zero subsidy rate for the duration of the CR. Similarly, P.L. 111-117 adopted the House language directing HUD to calculate the principle limit factors such that the program operates at a net zero subsidy rate. In September 2009, HUD announced the new principle limit factors. In addition, P.L. 111-68 authorized FHA to insure loans under the Mutual Mortgage Insurance fund (MMIF) for up to $1.5 billion multiplied by the number of days covered by the resolution. P.L. 111-117 authorized the MMIF to insure up to $400 billion in loans during FY2010. ", "For FHA-insured mortgages during CY2010, the continuing resolution enacted in P.L. 111-88 provided that, except for HECMs, the FHA loan limit for an area may not be less than the limit in effect under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. The higher loan limits provided under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 were slated to expire at the end of CY2009. This permits FHA loan limits of up to $729,750 for one-family homes.

After foreclosure, HUD makes an insurance payment to the lender and takes title of the home until such time as the home can be resold. The rate of foreclosure has increased in recent years among FHA-insured homes, as it has risen throughout the housing market, and, as a result, the number of homes HUD \"owns\" has increased.

The FY2010 President's budget is requesting a $500 billion limit on mortgage backed securities by Ginnie Mae, a significant increase when compared to the $300 billion requested for FY2009. The budget assumes that Ginnie Mae will carry over uncommitted loan guarantee limitation from prior years, so only $300 billion of the new commitment limit will be used in FY2010, the same as for FY2009. The subsidy rate for FY2009 was estimated at -0.21% and produced a negative subsidy of $630 million.
