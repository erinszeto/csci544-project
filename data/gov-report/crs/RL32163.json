These materials were later defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as special nuclear materials, along with other materials that the former Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) determined were capable of releasing energy through nuclear fission. Reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel to extract special nuclear material generated highly radioactive liquid and solid byproducts. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) defined irradiated fuel as spent nuclear fuel, and the byproducts as high-level waste. Uranium ore processing technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material and left behind uranium mill tailings. The fabrication of nuclear weapons generated transuranic waste. Both commercial and naval reactors continue to generate spent fuel. High-level waste generation has ceased in the United States, as irradiated fuel is no longer reprocessed.

Most recently, DOE policy on managing the residue in high-level waste storage tanks proved controversial enough that Congress amended the definition of high-level waste.

In the 1954 amended Act, Congress authorized the AEC to license commercial reactors, and ease restrictions on private companies using special nuclear material. Section 183 (Terms of Licenses) of the Act, however, kept government title to all special nuclear material utilized or produced by the licensed facilities in the United States. In 1964, the AEC was authorized to issue commercial licenses to possess special nuclear material subject to specific licensing conditions (P.L. 88-489).", "Although the Atomic Energy Act referred to transuranic waste (material contaminated with elements in atomic number greater than uranium), radioactive waste was not defined by statute until the 1980s.

Unlike the NRC's dose-based approach to acceptable hazard level, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses a risk-based approach that relies on the \"linear, no-threshold\" model of low-level radiation effects. In the EPA model, risk is extrapolated as a straight line from the high-dose exposure for Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors down to zero radiation exposure. Thus, the EPA model attributes risk to natural background levels of radiation. For illustrative purposes, EPA considers a 1-in-10,000 risk that an individual will develop cancer to be excessive, and has set a goal of 1-in-a- million risk in cleanup of chemically contaminated sites.

Since the concentrations each exceed the values in Column 1 (0.04 and 1.0 respectively) of Chart 3 (Table 2 of Section 61.55), they must be compared to the concentration limits of Column 2. For Sr-90, the fraction 50/150 equals 0.33, for Cs-137 the fraction 22/44 equals 0.5. The resulting sum of the fractions (0.33 + 0.5) equals 0.83.
