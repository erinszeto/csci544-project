Early on, it joined in the international endeavor to eliminate the African slave trade\u2014an enterprise in which William Wilberforce was a moving force. Later, it crafted, and presented to the states for ratification, the Thirteenth Amendment which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States and which it then implemented with a ban on peonage. Shortly thereafter, it passed the Padrone statute which outlawed bringing individuals, particularly children, from overseas in order to hold them in involuntary servitude in this country. When early in the Twentieth Century Congress enacted the Mann Act outlawing transportation of unlawful sexual purposes, it included a prohibition on importing foreign \"women and girls\" for such purposes.", "Although these statutes or their successors have remained in place, Congress believed more was needed. Having found that \"[a]t least 700,000 persons annually, primarily women and children, are trafficked within or across international borders,\" and that roughly 50,000 of them were imported into the United States a year, Congress responded with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Division A of which (Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000) is its centerpiece.

Nevertheless, then as now federal law prohibits three forms of obstruction of justice generally. It is a federal crime to use physical force, threats, intimidation, or corrupt persuasion to prevent another from providing federal law enforcement officials with information relating to the commission of a federal crime. It is a federal crime to alter, destroy or conceal physical evidence to prevent its use in a federal judicial or administrative proceeding. And it is a federal crime to injure another in his person or property in retaliation for providing a law enforcement officer with information relating to a federal crime. At least facially, however, these provisions are more narrowly tailored than the all encompassing language of the peonage obstruction proscription (\"obstructs, or attempts to obstruct, or in any way interferes with or prevents ... enforcement\").", "With the passage of the Wilberforce Act, it is now a federal crime to obstruct, or attempt to obstruct, or in any way interfere with or prevent the enforcement of Section 1583 (enticement into slavery), 1584 (holding another in involuntary servitude), 1590 (trafficking with respect to peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor), 1591 (sex trafficking using force, fraud, coercion or children), or 1592 (document abuse relating to peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, or forced labor).

When the victim is between 14 and 17 years, the offender faces the same maximum sentence, but with a mandatory minimum of 10 years. The Wilberforce Act amends 18 U.S.C. 1594 so that conspirators face the same maximum penalty as they would for a completed Section 1591 offense (imprisonment for any term of years or for life), but not the mandatory minimum that would accompany the completed offense."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sex Trafficking Amendments", "paragraphs": ["Section 1591 houses two offenses, a trafficking offense and profiteering offense. The Wilberforce Act recasts Section 1591 in a number of other ways. First, it makes it clear that in its trafficking offense the section condemns not only trafficking but the sexual exploitation of the victims of trafficking. It does so by adding \"maintains\" to the list of possible conduct elements for the offense, i.e., \"Whoever knowingly\u2014(1) in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains , or maintains by any means a person ... \" with the knowledge, or in reckless disregard of the fact, that the person will be used for commercial sexual purposes and either is a child or will be induced to participate through the use of force, the threat of force, fraud, coercion, or some combination of such inducements.", "Second, the Wilberforce Act expands the mens rea or knowledge element of both Section 1591 offenses. The offenses shared two knowledge elements prior to the Wilberforce Act. The government had to prove (a) that the defendant knew that an individual had been recruited, transported, or harbored, or knew that he was benefitting from such activity, and (b) that the defendant knew either that the individual was a child to be used for commercial sexual purposes or that force, fraud or coercion was to be used to exploit the individual for such purposes.", "The Wilberforce Act enlarges the second knowledge element, the commercial sexual purposes element, to include instances where the defendant acts with \"reckless disregard\" of the fact that a child, force, fraud or coercion will be used for commercial sexual purposes. A similar reckless disregard standard has been part of the prohibition against harboring illegal aliens for some time. There, the courts have explained that \"reckless disregard\" means \"deliberate indifference to facts which, if considered and weighed in a reasonable manner, indicate the highest probability that the alleged aliens were in fact aliens and were in the United States illegally.\" In many instances, the principal effect of the amendment may be to reenforce the law's understanding that the \"knowledge\" element covers instances of \"willful blindness\":", "A willful blindness instruction is appropriate when the defendant asserts a lack of guilty knowledge, but the evidence supports an inference of deliberate ignorance. Ignorance is deliberate if the defendants were presented with facts putting them on notice criminal activity was particularly likely and yet intentionally failed to investigate.... If reasonable inference support a finding the failure to investigate is equivalent to \"burying one's head in the sand,\" the jury may consider willful blindness as a basis for knowledge.", "A third amendment addresses the age-of-the-victim issue. It absolves the government from having to prove that a trafficker actually knew the age of a child victim, as long as it shows that he had a reasonable chance to observe the victim. The explanatory statement accompanying consideration of H.R. 7311 in the House notes that other federal sexual child abuse statutes, like 18 U.S.C. 2241(c), (d)(statutory rape), require the government to prove the victim's age but not the defendant's knowledge of victim's age.", "The Wilberforce Act also increases the penalty for violations of the Mann Act (travel for illicit sexual purposes) by those previously convicted of a sex trafficking offense of Section 1591. The Mann Act already doubled the otherwise applicable terms of imprisonment for offenders who violate its proscriptions following an earlier conviction under its provisions or under those of chapters 109A (sexual abuse) or 110 (sexual exploitation of children) of Title 18 of the United States Code. The Wilberforce Act adds prior Section 1591 convictions to the list."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coercion Further Defined", "paragraphs": ["The Wilberforce Act provides expansive definitions for the terms used to describe the coercion employed to effectuate sexual trafficking under Section 1591 or forced labor under Section 1589. Concern that the scope of then existing coercive trafficking laws led to enactment of Section 1589 in the first place. The Supreme Court in Kozminski had held that the involuntary servitude statute encompassed coercive servitude but only to the extent that the coercion involved the use or threat of physical restraint or abuse of legal process\u2014psychological threats or threats of other kinds of harm were beyond the scope of the section's proscriptions. When it enacted Section 1589, Congress explained that \"Section 1589 will provide federal prosecutors with the tools to combat severe forms of worker exploitation that do not rise to the level of involuntary servitude as defined in Kozminski .\" The 2000 Trafficking legislation clearly stated that the forced labor and sexual trafficking bans in sections 1589 and 1591 condemned violations accomplished by the use of physical restraint and abuse of law, but also by the threat of serious harm, or by a scheme intended to convey the impression of such coercive threats.", "The Wilberforce Act provides yet further clarification with specific definition of the terms (a) serious harm (\"physical or nonphysical ... psychological, financial, or reputational\" harm which a similarly situated, reasonable person would consider serious) and (b) abuse of law (\"administrative, civil, or criminal\" use of the law to cause another to engage in or refrain from conduct). The new definitions re-enforce recent judicial interpretations that have construed the terms found in sections 1589 and 1591 broadly. The explanatory statement supplied the House immediately prior to passage emphasizes Congress's expansive view of the term \"serious harm\":", "The term \"serious harm\" refers to a broad array of harms, including both physical and nonphysical, and is intended to be subjectively construed in determining whether a particular type or certain degree of harm or coercion is sufficient to overcome a particular victim's will ... It is contemplated that these refinements will streamline the jury's consideration in cases involving coercion and will more fully capture the imbalance of power between trafficker and victim. A scheme, plan, or pattern intended to inculcate a belief of serious harm may refer to nonviolent and psychological coercion, including but not limited to isolation, denial of sleep and punishments, or preying on mental illness, infirmity, drug use or addictions (whether pre-existing or developed by the trafficker).", "The Wilberforce Act's definition of abuse of law is modeled after that found in the Second Restatement of Torts referenced in the earlier limited available case law (use of \"a legal process, criminal or civil, against another primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed\"). It expands upon the Restatement's definition to encompass threats of abuse and the abuse of administrative process, but confines application to coercive abuse (i.e., abuse exerted or threatened \"in order to exert pressure on another person to cause that person top take some action or refrain from taking some action\")."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trafficking Profiteers", "paragraphs": ["Although Section 1591 condemns both those who engaged in sex trafficking and those who knowingly benefitted financially from such trafficking ventures, at one time the other trafficking sections had no such financial benefit component.

This statute is intend to capture situations in which exploitative employers and recruiters have lured heavily indebted workers to the United States; but did not obtain their labor or services through coercion sufficient to reach the level of Chapter 77 Slavery/Trafficking offenses.

The courts will look to the language of the statute, the purpose for its enactment, and consistency with the principles of international law to determine whether Congress intended a particular criminal statute to apply to conduct committed overseas.", "For example, when a statute proscribes the theft of federal property, even in the absence of a statement of extraterritorial jurisdiction, it is presumed that Congress intends the prohibition to apply regardless of where the property may be stolen. The courts have generally considered overseas application of federal criminal law consistent with international law when either the offender or the victim is American. Extraterritorial jurisdiction may also be considered consistent with international law when the overseas conduct has an impact within the United States, or when the criminal prohibition is enacted to implement a treaty or similar international obligation or with respect to a crime that is contrary to the law of nations, i.e., that is abhorrent under the laws of all countries.

Thus for example, a profiteer, who benefits from a third person holding an individual in involuntary servitude in violation of Section 1584, faces no criminal liability under that section. The individual, however, may recover civil damages and attorneys' fees against the profiteer based on the harm caused the individual for the violation of Section 1584.", "As for the statute of limitations, prior law supplied no explicit statute of limitations for a cause of action under Section 1595. Where Congress has failed to provide a statute of limitations for a federal cause of action, the courts will resort to the most analogous state or federal civil statute of limitations. The statute of limitations of the civil cause of action established for various federal sex offenses under 18 U.S.C. 2255 is six years. The statute of limitations for the criminal prosecution of most of the offenses under chapter 77 is 10 years.
