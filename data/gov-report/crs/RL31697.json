With Africa's largest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), a diverse economy, and a government that has played an active role in promoting regional peace and stability, South Africa is poised to have a substantial impact on the economic and political future of Africa. The country is also playing an increasingly prominent role in the G20 and other international fora. South Africa is twice the size of Texas and has a population of almost 50 million. Its political system is regarded as stable, but South Africa faces serious long-term challenges arising from poverty, unemployment, and AIDS.", "The United States government considers South Africa to be one of its strategic partners on the continent, and the two countries commenced a new Strategic Dialogue in 2010, with the encouragement of the U.S. Congress. Bilateral relations are cordial; however, the U.S. and South African administrations have expressed differences with respect to the situations in Zimbabwe and Iran, among other foreign policy issues. South Africa begins a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in 2011; U.S. officials articulated frustration with the South African government on positions it took during its last term on the Council in 2007-2008.", "The African National Congress (ANC), which led the struggle against apartheid, has dominated the political scene since the end of apartheid and continues to enjoy widespread support among the population. The party has suffered internal divisions, though, some of which contributed to the resignation of President Thabo Mbeki in 2008 and the formation of a breakaway party, the Congress of the People (COPE). The ANC fell short of retaining its two-thirds majority in the parliament during the most recent elections, held in April 2009. Jacob Zuma, elected as head of the ANC in late 2007, weathered a series of corruption charges and was chosen by the ANC-dominated parliament after the 2009 elections to serve as the country's newest President.", "South Africa has the largest HIV/AIDS population in the world, with almost 6 million people reportedly HIV positive. The Mbeki Administration's policy on HIV/AIDS was controversial, but the Zuma Administration has made significant commitments to addressing the disease. The country has weathered a series of corruption scandals, and continues to struggle with high crime and unemployment rates. Mounting social tensions related to the competition for jobs, resources, and social services led to an eruption of xenophobic violence against immigrants in 2008; some resentment against foreign workers in the country lingers. South Africa, with its wealth of mineral resources and diverse manufacturing sector, has benefitted from steady economic growth in recent years, but the country weathered a recession in 2009 and economists predict weaker growth prospects for the near future. Job creation remains a major challenge for the government.", "In 2010, South Africa successfully hosted the largest event ever held on the African continent, the FIFA World Cup, an international football (soccer) competition. The government and the private sector undertook a wide variety of construction and infrastructure projects in preparation for the event, which was attended by over three million people and drew over 300,000 tourists. South Africa defied many expectations during the event\u2014six new stadiums were finished on time, crime was low, and South Africans introduced the world to a long (and loud) plastic horn known as the vuvuzela.

South Africa produces wine, wool, maize and other agricultural products for export, although only about 12% of the country's land is suitable for agriculture. Moreover, South Africa is the world's leading producer of gold, platinum, and chromium. Major industrial sectors include automobile assembly, chemicals, textiles, foodstuffs, and iron and steel production. South African cell phone companies and other firms are active throughout Africa, and SABMiller, formerly South African Breweries, operates on a global scale. The country's stock exchange is among the 20 largest in the world, and South Africa is one of the few countries on the continent to rank as an upper middle income country. Despite its many economic strengths, however, the country ranks as one of the most unequal societies in the world in terms of income distribution.

Its voting record on both bodies has been considered by some to be controversial. South Africa was a founding member of the African Union (AU), successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and then-President Thabo Mbeki served as the AU's first chairperson. President Mbeki also took a lead role in the creation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), an African-designed plan for improved governance within Africa and increased western aid, trade, and investment that was adopted by the AU as a blueprint for the continent's economic development. South Africa has repeatedly put itself forward as a venue for major international conferences, such as the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, the 2001 World Conference on Racism. In 2010, South Africa was the first African nation to host the soccer World Cup, and in December 2011, the country will host the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. South Africa is the only African member of the G20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation.", "Weak regimes and instability elsewhere in the region have historically had a negative impact on South Africa, and the country continues to face a large influx of illegal immigrants. By some estimates, more than three million Zimbabweans currently reside illegally in South Africa. Some South Africans blame these immigrants for the country's high crime and unemployment rates, and in May 2008 tensions erupted in the townships, sparking a wave of xenophobic attacks that displaced over 25,000 and left over 60 dead. Isolated attacks have occurred since then, and the potential for further violence cannot be ruled out.", "In order to promote greater stability, South African officials have played prominent mediator roles in African conflicts, and South African troops actively support peacekeeping missions throughout the continent. In 2002, they helped to persuade the parties to the prolonged conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to sign a peace agreement following negotiations in South Africa. President Thabo Mbeki was less successful in mediating the conflict in Cote d'Ivoire, a country which continues to face political turmoil. Former President Nelson Mandela played a leading role in brokering a peace agreement in Burundi, and South Africa contributed hundreds of troops to the peacekeeping mission there. Over 1,200 South African troops are currently participating as peacekeepers in the U.N. Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), and over 900 South African soldiers and police serve under the U.N.-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). In a move believed by many to protest the Sudanese government's policies in Darfur, the Mbeki government was instrumental in preventing Sudan from attaining the chairmanship of the African Union in 2006. It has, however, protested the imposition of tougher U.N. sanctions against Sudan and an International Criminal Court (ICC) indictment of Sudanese President Omar al Bashir as counterproductive. Former President Mbeki continues to play an active mediation role in Sudan. The country has supported democratic advances on the continent, providing millions of ballots in 2006 for elections in the DRC. In 2007, the heads of state of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) nominated then-President Mbeki as mediator between the Zimbabwean government and the opposition in an effort to resolve its political and economic crises.

His release followed years of secret contacts between the ANC and key white business and political figures. These contacts had led both sides to conclude that a settlement could be negotiated that would protect the interests of all South Africans. The negotiations themselves encountered many difficulties, including several outbreaks of violence that threatened to destroy the peace process. Finally, however, in November 1993, all-party negotiations resulted in a final agreement on a new constitution and free elections, held in 1994. South Africa's second universal suffrage elections were held in June 1999, and the ANC retained control of the National Assembly.

In contrast, the DP, though also largely white in its membership, advocated a classical liberal platform and was heir to the Progressive Party, which had strongly opposed apartheid and campaigned on human rights issues.

In October 2001, van Schalkwyk announced that the NNP would leave the DA and enter into a cooperative agreement with the ANC.

However, there has been considerable disagreement among the ANC and its allies over the government's economic reform programs. The government's first major economic strategy, known as Growth, Employment, and Redistribution (GEAR), sought to spur economic growth by attracting foreign investment, strengthening the private sector, and privatizing state-owned enterprises. COSATU and the SACP have argued that this approach has failed to benefit South Africa's poor. They favor the creation of programs that would use state resources to create jobs and a moratorium on privatization.

In June 2007, the country's trade unions launched what was reported to have been the biggest strike since the end of apartheid, costing the economy over $400 million. The unions, who were demanding a 12% pay raise for public servants, accepted the government's offer of a 7.5% raise after four weeks of protest. Strikes in mid-2008 brought the country's mining industry to a standstill as workers protested rising food, fuel, and electricity costs. These strikes were considered significant acts of defiance against the policies of the Mbeki government.

Mbeki had suggested that he would not run for a third term. His successor would be widely expected to succeed him as President of the country following the national elections in 2009. Although the ANC's party constitution allows for a competitive leadership race, no party presidential candidacy had ever been contested. Mbeki's dismissal of Jacob Zuma as the country's Deputy President in 2005 (see below) exposed divisions in the party (Zuma remained deputy president of the party). He had been widely considered to be the likely successor to Mbeki prior to these scandals. Zuma, a populist who has elicited strong support from both youth and labor groups, as well as from his Zulu ethnic base, has been linked with a number of controversies, including a 2006 rape allegation for which he was acquitted, and a high-profile corruption case (see \" The Arms Deal and Other Corruption Scandals \" below). Zuma made his intention to vie for the party leadership post clear, and he was vocally supported by leaders from COSATU and SACP, who claim he has been a victim of political conspiracy. After months of speculation, Mbeki, rather than put his support behind a chosen successor, chose to run for a third term as ANC president. Zuma won a decisive victory over Mbeki in a secret ballot vote at the party congress, suggesting that Mbeki had alienated many party members.", "Although he prevailed in the rape and initial corruption trials, Zuma continued to face legal challenges. In November 2007, the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned a lower court decision that had made documents seized from Zuma and his lawyer inadmissable in future proceedings. Zuma was expected to go on trial again in August 2008 for racketeering, money laundering, fraud, and corruption, but the date of his trial was postponed. In September, a High Court judge ruled that the case should be thrown out on procedural grounds and suggested in his findings that Mbeki and members of his administration had interfered in the case.

Among them was Finance Minister Trevor Manuel who, along with Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni, had been widely credited with guiding the country's economic progress since the end of white rule. The inflation rate rose to its highest level since the end of apartheid amid speculation of Manuel's resignation; he was later reappointed. Other resignations followed.

Prosecutors filed an appeal, and in January 2009, the Supreme Court of Appeal overturned the High Court ruling. Zuma filed an appeal with the Constitutional Court to have the charges, which he claimed were politically motivated, dropped. In March 2009, evidence of collusion between prosecutors, Mbeki, and several senior ANC officials emerged, and, after extensive internal debate, the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) dropped all charges against Zuma on April 5. Some analysts suggest that the evidence does not affect the merits of the case, and questions have been raised on how that evidence, recorded phone conversations, was obtained.

More pressing, though, have been allegations of corruption associated with the purchase. Tony Yengeni, the ANC's former chief whip in the National Assembly, was arrested in 2001 on charges of corruption, forgery, and perjury in connection with a large discount he received for the purchase of a luxury car, allegedly in return for assuring that the deal went ahead. He pled guilty to fraud in exchange for acquittal on corruption charges. President Mbeki later fired then-Deputy President Jacob Zuma, after a judge declared Zuma had a \"generally corrupt\" relationship with his former financial advisor, Schabir Shaik, who was convicted of fraud and corruption in connection with the arms deal. Zuma was indicted but acquitted in 2006, after prosecutors failed to build a case against him. Shaik lost an appeal of his conviction, with the judges ruling that evidence overwhelmingly supported the charge that payments totaling about $165,000 made by Shaik to Zuma were bribes.

Pikoli had been preparing warrants for Selebi's arrest when he was suspended. Selebi, a senior ANC member, was considered to be a Mbeki supporter within the party, and some South Africans accused Mbeki of trying to prevent Selebi's arrest.

The reasons for Mbeki's stance on AIDS have been difficult to discern. Some speculate that he feared that AIDS could undermine his vision of South Africa as a leader in an African renaissance sparked by NEPAD and the African Union and thus tended to minimize the importance of the epidemic.", "The Mbeki government gradually modified its stance on HIV/AIDS under mounting domestic and international pressure. In 2002, the government announced that it would triple the national AIDS budget, end official opposition to the provision of antiretrovirals for rape victims, and launch a program for universal access to drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. That year, a South African court ordered the government to begin providing the antiretroviral (ARV) drug Nevirapine nationwide to reduce MTCT. The South African Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) had launched the suit in 2001, maintaining that MTCT prevention trials were inadequate and that 20,000 babies could be saved yearly by a nationwide program. At its 2002 party conference the ANC announced that it was putting AIDS at the top of its agenda. The Department of Health in 2003 declared that the government would provide free antiretroviral drugs, but after what observers considered a very slow implementation of the policy, TAC threatened another lawsuit. Under pressure, the government began providing treatment at five hospitals in 2004 and has gradually expanded access to the program. Reports suggest that access to treatment for those with advanced HIV has since increased significantly, from only 4% of those in need receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2004 to 21% in 2006 and over 30% in 2008.", "Despite this commitment by the government to providing ART, many critics still did not consider the Mbeki administration to be serious about the epidemic. In August 2006, then-Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang drew international criticism for a controversial display of traditional remedies such as garlic, lemons, and beetroot, which she reportedly claimed provided an alternative defense to AIDS, at the International AIDS Conference in Toronto. Stephen Lewis, the U.N. Special Envoy to Africa on AIDS, proclaimed South Africa's AIDS policies as \"wrong, immoral, and indefensible\" and \"worthy of a lunatic fringe\" during the conference, and 81 international scientists delivered a petition to Mbeki urging the health minister's dismissal. Many observers consider the Toronto Conference to have prompted a key shift in the government's position. Weeks after the conference, Mbeki appointed his Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, as head of a new national AIDS commission charged with halving the country's infection rate by 2011. She emphasized that the government did believe that HIV causes AIDS and acknowledged \"shortcomings\" in the government's response to the epidemic. The government also reached out to the AIDS advocacy community, which responded with cautious optimism. TAC, the most vocal critic of the Mbeki Administration's efforts, was cited in late 2006 saying that there was now \"a growing enthusiasm, across the board, around the possibility of what we can do as a country in a united fashion\" to combat the disease. However, TAC again questioned Mbeki's commitment to fighting the epidemic after the August 2007 firing of Tshabalala-Msimang's deputy, who was outspoken about problems with the nation's health services and critical of the Health Minister's controversial views on AIDS.", "Although experts believe the country's prevalence rates have begun to stabilize, the South African government still faces many challenges in its response to HIV/AIDS. The emergence of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), high rates of HIV/TB co-infection, and significant HIV prevalence rates among health care workers place major strains on the health care system. AIDS activists responded positively to then-President Motlanthe's appointment of a new health minister, Barbara Hogan. She was replaced by President Zuma with Aaron Motsoaledi, who in late 2009 appeared to publicly link the doubling of South Africa's death rate in the last decade, largely due to AIDS, to the Mbeki Administration's policies on the epidemic. President Zuma, in a speech on December 1, 2009, World AIDS Day, announced a nationwide campaign to encourage all South Africans to be tested for HIV and pledged to provide treatment for all infants under one year who test positive for HIV by April 2010. He also pledged that ART would be more readily available to pregnant women and those with both TB and HIV, and that a larger number of health clinics would be prepared to provide counseling, testing, and, where possible, treatment. Activists praised the President, who has made some controversial personal choices in the past, for his speech and his proposed policies, commending the government's \"new-found commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS in an open, serious, and evidence-based manner.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Land Reform", "paragraphs": ["In order to address historic injustices, the South African government began a land reform program in the late 1990s to restore land rights to those in the black majority forcibly dispossessed of their land under racially discriminatory apartheid legislation. The government set a number of targets, including the settlement of all land claims by the end of 2008 and the more ambitious transfer of 30% of agricultural lands owned by whites in 1994 to African owners by 2014. While the government's \"willing buyer, willing seller\" land reform policies have reportedly met with little resistance from white landowners, and the Land Affairs Department reports that almost all land claims have been settled, critics charge that the transfers are going too slowly. According to media reports, the government announced in mid-2006 that negotiations with white farmers over the price of land marked for restitution would be limited to six months, after which expropriation could take place if no settlement was reached. Two months later, two white-owned farms claimed by black South Africans were marked for expropriation, a process through which the government would seize the land and pay the owners a price set by independent assessors. ", "In a 2005 speech on the perceived slow pace of land transfers, then-Deputy President Mlambo-Ngcuka said that South Africa might learn from Zimbabwe's land reform process, igniting considerable controversy. President Mbeki dismissed critics of the speech, saying that her words were misinterpreted and that Zimbabwe's policies were only one among many the government had studied. The media reported a similarly controversial discussion document circulated by the Land Affairs Department suggesting replacing the \"willing buyer, willing seller\" approach with a \"Zimbabwean model,\" or forced-sale principle (Zimbabwe's policy that preceded land invasions there). The discussion paper was said to propose the expropriation of commercial agricultural land to meet the government's target of 30% redistribution. Government officials stressed that the document was for internal discussion only and did not reflect official policy.", "The South African government has made several attempts to speed up the transfer of commercial agricultural lands. Official figures in 2009 suggest that the government had met only 6% of its 30% target for state-funded transfers. The Mbeki Administration proposed legislation in 2008 that would accelerate the process by adding a constitutional provision for expropriation of a property \"for a public purpose.\" Critics, including the Democratic Alliance, argued that the proposed law, which would restrict property owners' rights to judicial appeal and force sales at below market prices, was unconstitutional and would undermine confidence in property rights and deter investment. They also suggest that while the rate of state-funded transfers has been slow, substantial transfers have been made privately through the property market. The legislation was shelved, but the Zuma Administration is expected to resubmit it in 2011. The Zuma Administration has maintained its commitment to a controversial \"use it or lose it\" initiative introduced in 2008 that allows farms that have been transferred to black beneficiaries to be taken by the government if they are deemed unproductive.", "In late 2009, officials from the Department of Land Affairs announced that South Africa would not meet its deadline to redistribute one-third of farmland by 2014, and would extend the deadline to 2025, due to a shortage of funds needed to buy the remaining land. COSATU has referred to the redistribution issue as a \"social time-bomb.\" In a 2004 survey of South Africans of all races, 72% of black respondents agreed with the statement: \"All the land whites own, they stole from blacks.\" According to an independent South African think tank,", "The most universal and immediate land need in South Africa is for 'a place to stay' rather than 'a place to farm'.... Even among employed agricultural workers, land demand is modest.

Several surveys suggest that some potential tourists were deterred from visiting South Africa for the World Cup out of fear of becoming victim to a criminal act. The government deployed over 40,000 new police officers for the World Cup, new positions that the force has retained. South Africa also set aside more than 50 special courtrooms to handle crimes committed during the games. Reports suggest that the country's crime rate dropped during the event, which was held in June and July, and that the special courtrooms consequently did not see the number of caseloads originally anticipated. Fears of a terrorist incident, possibly one similar to that conducted in Mumbai in 2008, during the games also went unfounded.

Unemployment estimates range from 25% to 40%, far above the government's target of 15%. The vast, poverty-stricken townships surrounding South Africa's cities remain a potential source of political instability. In recent years periodic riots have erupted in several poor municipalities to protest local government corruption and inadequate service delivery. Although turnout and support for the ANC remained high nationally in the country's last nationwide municipal elections, voters boycotted the polls in a number of townships in which the ANC had formerly enjoyed strong support, and several hundred former ANC supporters stood as independent candidates.

If others had used the arguments we are using today when we asked them for their support against apartheid, we might still have been unfree.\" Former DA leader Tony Leon expressed similar sentiments on his government's alleged refusal to address the Zimbabwe situation, calling it \"extraordinary irony\" that the ANC government would use the same argument used to block debate on the abuses of the former apartheid regime in South Africa.", "In July 2008, South Africa voted with Russia, China, Vietnam, and Libya in opposition to a U.S.-sponsored resolution on Zimbabwe (S/2008/447) that called for targeted sanctions on select members of the Mugabe regime, an international arms embargo, the appointment of a U.N. Special Representative on Zimbabwe, and the creation of a Panel of Experts to monitor and evaluate the situation and the effects of the sanctions.", "South Africa and the United States also differed on Middle East issues addressed by the Security Council. In 2007, South Africa abstained from a U.S.-sponsored resolution to establish an international tribunal to investigate political killings in Lebanon, arguing that although it supported a tribunal with \"Lebanese ownership,\" it was not appropriate for the Security Council to impose a tribunal upon the country and \"politicize international criminal law.\" The country was vocal in its opposition to sanctions on both Sudan and Iran, arguing that they would ultimately harden the target governments' positions rather than reduce tensions. However, after efforts to modify resolution language, South Africa ultimately did vote for sanctions against Iran in March 2007, \"to remind Iran of its responsibility towards the IAEA and the Nonproliferation Treaty.\" South Africa began a new term on the Security Council in January 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Zimbabwe 75", "paragraphs": ["Political and economic turmoil in neighboring Zimbabwe over the last decade led to a massive exodus of Zimbabweans in search of work. A nationwide outbreak of cholera in Zimbabwe in 2008 and early 2009 exacerbated the flight. Some sources estimate that as many as four million Zimbabweans (30% of the total population) may have left the country by 2009. Zimbabwe's other neighbors, Zambia, Botswana, and Mozambique, also saw a significant rise in immigration during that period. Those who were caught by South African police entering the country illegally were sent back to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's economy has recovered slightly since the formation of the new government in early 2009, and basic goods are again available in Zimbabwe. Nevertheless, less than 10% of the population is estimated to be formally employed in Zimbabwe, and many who fled the country in the last decade currently see little economic opportunity at home.

Over one million Zimbabweans are estimated to currently reside in South Africa, and those who are unemployed or hold part-time jobs are ineligible for permits. With thousands lining up in December 2010, the government relaxed requirements that applicants show a Zimbabwean passport, a document that is reportedly expensive and difficult to acquire. Advocacy groups have expressed concern that deportations may begin in April 2011.", "As mentioned above, tensions over perceived competition for resources led in mid-2008 to xenophobic attacks on Zimbabweans and other immigrants in townships throughout South Africa. Many were rendered homeless and forced to seek shelter in temporary camps established by the South African government, while others chose to return to their country of origin. Resentment against immigrants remains a potential flashpoint for violence in South Africa.", "During his 2003 visit to Africa, President George W. Bush called then-President Mbeki his \"point man\" on Zimbabwe. The United States has been outspoken in its criticism of the policies of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe with respect to human rights, democracy, and land reform, and has imposed \"targeted sanctions\" prohibiting travel to the United States by Zimbabwe leaders. President Mbeki, by contrast, chose to deal with President Mugabe through \"quiet diplomacy,\" or diplomatic engagement. Mbeki's Zimbabwe policies drew criticism from within South Africa; former President Mandela, Archbishop Tutu, former opposition leader Tony Leon, and even the ANC's ally, COSATU, were vocal detractors.", "South African officials have called for western countries to reconsider the penalties they have imposed on Zimbabwe. Although the United States has expressed support for Zimbabwe's coalition government, U.S. officials remain critical of the presence of Mugabe and other \"hardliners\" in the government, and have been reluctant to ease sanctions. The United States and other donor governments remain concerned with the lack of progress on several outstanding issues related to political and press freedoms and government appointments. The opposition and others, including the United States, have requested that SADC, as mediator and guarantor of the political agreement between the opposition and Mugabe's party, press for reforms.", "As Zimbabwe's largest trading partner, many observers consider South Africa to be in a position to exert substantial leverage on its neighbor. At the same time, South Africa must weigh the unintended effects of such leverage\u2014increasing instability or state collapse across its northern border could produce a sharp increase in illegal migration and have a substantial impact on South Africa.

Social tensions over perceived inequalities in the distribution of wealth and inadequate service delivery, which resulted in violent attacks on African immigrants in 2008, are likely to continue in the near term as the government struggles to address the needs of its poorest citizens. South Africa's longer-term stability is linked to the success of the South African government and its partners in fighting poverty and reducing the toll of the AIDS pandemic.", "The principal worry for some analysts has been that South Africa would become a de facto one-party state under the ANC, weakening checks and balances in the political system. Should this happen, some fear that the regime could become increasingly authoritarian and unresponsive to the needs of its citizens. ANC leaders reject this view, arguing that their party is a national liberation movement committed to transforming South Africa and fulfilling the aspirations of the poor. Others have argued that the power of the ruling party is limited by the country's very active press, independent judiciary, and a bill of rights enshrined in the constitution. In any event, ANC leaders want their country to be seen as a leader in Africa, and as a spokesman for Africa and developing countries generally in world affairs. To play such roles, South Africa must continue to be recognized as a successful democracy."], "subsections": []}]}}
