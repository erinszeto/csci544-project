Congressional action on the budget for a fiscal year usually begins following the submission of the President's budget at the beginning of each annual session of Congress.

The Antideficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from obligating more funds than the budget authority that was enacted by Congress. Budget authority may be indefinite, however, when Congress enacts language providing \"such sums as may be necessary\" to complete a project or purpose. Budget authority may be available on a one-year, multi-year, or no-year basis. One-year budget authority is only available for obligation during a specific fiscal year; any unobligated funds at the end of that year are no longer available for spending. Multi-year budget authority specifies a range of time during which funds can be obligated for spending; no-year budget authority is available for obligation for an indefinite period of time.", "Obligations are incurred when federal agencies employ personnel, enter into contracts, receive services, and engage in similar transactions in a given fiscal year.

The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 defines discretionary appropriations as budget authority provided in annual appropriation acts and the outlays derived from that authority, but it excludes appropriations for entitlements. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriation acts and is typically not appropriated each year.

Some of these fees offset spending at the account level and are subtracted from the Appropriations Committee tables directly below the program they offset. An example of this is the Federal Protective Service, which is immediately offset in the appropriations tables by an intergovernmental transfer from the General Services Administration.

DHS notes that it \"will solicit and award a contract to complete the transition from the current, limited-scope technology plan to one that addresses the Department's comprehensive and integrated technological needs.\" A potential issue for Congress may involve the contracting process that DHS will pursue for this program. In FY2005, the General Services Administration's Inspector General (GSA IG) released a report which criticized the USBP for its contracting practices regarding the Remote Video Surveillance (RVS) system. The GSA IG found that the contracts were granted without competition, and that in many cases the contractor failed to deliver the services that were stipulated within the contract leading to RVS sites not being operational in a timely manner. In a 2005 report, the DHS Inspector General (DHS IG) noted that deficiencies in contract management and processes resulted in 169 incomplete RVS sites.", "Another potential issue for Congress could be the level of integration and scope of this border technology program. The RVS system mentioned above forms part of a larger program that integrates surveillance cameras with sensors. This program was originally called the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), but was folded into the broader America's Shield Initiative (ASI) by DHS in 2005. DHS IG Richard Skinner stated in congressional testimony on December 16, 2005, that \"to date, ISIS components have not been integrated to the level predicted at the onset of the program. RVS cameras and sensors are not linked whereby a sensor alert automatically activates a corresponding RVS camera to pan and tilt in the direction of the triggered sensor. However, even if ISIS was fully integrated, due to a limited number of operational RVS sites (255 nationwide), integration opportunities would be limited to the areas near these sites.\" Additionally, the DHS IG noted in its 2005 report that, due to a lack of integration, \"ISIS remote surveillance technology yielded few apprehensions as a percentage of detection.\" For these reasons, the FY2006 DHS Appropriations Conferees noted that they were not fully funding the department's FY2006 request for ASI. The conferees stated that it was their understanding that DHS was currently reviewing the entire ASI program, and that major procurement for the program might be curtailed until DHS \"has resolved fundamental questions about scope and architecture, and possibly its relation to overall, nationwide border domain security and awareness.\" The conferees noted that they expected to be kept informed of the results of this review and encouraged DHS to explore the use of off-the-shelf solutions for the program. Possible issues for Congress could thus include the relationship between SBI and ASI, whether the review process outlined above has been concluded and what its recommendations were, whether the DHS IG's recommendations concerning ISIS will be carried out, and what the overall extent of the technological integration featured in SBI will be. H.Rept. 109-476 voiced concern about DHS' request for SBI, noting that the submission and review of a strategic plan should have been the first step in creating the program. The House required that a strategic plan for SBI be submitted by November 1, 2006, and cut funding for SBI technologies by $17 million from the President's request. The Senate fully funded the President's request, but would make $100 million conditional on the submission to and approval of an expenditure plan by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.

DHS has historically constructed tactical infrastructure under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the U.S. Corps of Engineers. Under this MOU, CBP was responsible for providing the funding for planning, engineering, and purchasing materials, while the actual construction was undertaken by military personnel at no charge. However, the department notes that using this traditional approach would take until 2010 to finish the projects currently underway. For this reason, the requested increase for tactical infrastructure includes funds for a commercial contract to construct almost half of the vehicle barriers in Arizona. DHS argues that it is at a critical point in its deployment of personnel and other resources at the border, and proposes using private contractors to accelerate the construction of this infrastructure. A potential issue for Congress could involve whether using private contractors to construct border infrastructure is the most cost-effective allocation of taxpayer resources given that under the current MOU with the Corps of Engineers CBP incurs no labor costs for these projects. Additionally, if contracts are issued for tactical infrastructure projects another potential issue for Congress could involve the oversight of the contracting process, given the contracting irregularities identified by the GSA IG in the RVS contracts mentioned earlier. H.Rept. 109-476 noted that while $30 million in funding was provided for San Diego tactical infrastructure improvements as requested, funding for Arizona tactical infrastructure projects was reduced due to poor budget justifications, uncertainty surrounding SBI procurement, and the lack of a strategic plan for SBI expenditures.

CBP's cargo security strategy includes two significant programs: the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). CSI is a CBP program that stations CBP officers in foreign sea ports to target marine containers for inspection before they are loaded onto U.S.-bound vessels. C-TPAT is a public-private partnership aimed at securing the supply chain from point of origin through entry into the United States. The FY2007 request did not contain significant increases in funding for either the Container Security Initiative (CSI) or the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). Funding for C-TPAT remained flat with the FY2007 request of $76 million (which includes funding for the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) and NEXUS/SENTRIi programs), and the request for CSI increased by $2 million to $139 million for FY2007.", "P.L. 109-295 provides $139 million for CSI, $55 million for C-TPAT, and $11 million for FAST and NEXUS/SENTRI.

GAO has issued several reports noting that inadequate staffing levels for both the CSI and C-TPAT programs have hampered CBP's ability to conduct inspections overseas at foreign ports and to validate every C-TPAT member within three years of certification. Recent testimony by a CBP official has also noted that CBP itself is not satisfied with the current numbers of supply chain specialists available to conduct C-TPAT validations. GAO has raised a number of additional concerns regarding the C-TPAT program, which CBP has begun addressing, including the scope of effort and level of rigor applied to the validation process, how many and what types of validations are necessary to manage security risk, and the lack of a comprehensive set of performance measures for the program. GAO has also reported that several factors limit CBP's ability to successfully target maritime containers at foreign ports, including staffing imbalances, operational factors, lack of technical requirements for NII equipment used at foreign ports, and continued refinements to the strategic plan and performance measures needed to manage the program.", "The House Appropriations Committee in H.Rept. 109-476 expressed several concerns regarding the department's port, container, and cargo security programs, including lack of a \"port, container, and cargo strategic plan....\" The committee would have withheld $10 million from the Office of the Secretary and Management until this strategic plan was submitted.

GAO reported in March of 2006, that although DHS has made progress in deploying radiation detection equipment at US POEs, the program goals are unrealistic (deployment has fallen behind schedule), and the program's cost estimate is uncertain. Delays have been caused by a variety of factors, including DHS's review process which has delayed the provision of acquisition and deployment information to Congress, and difficult negotiations with seaport operators concerning placement of the portal monitors and the screening of railcars. According to GAO, uncertainty regarding the cost and improved effectiveness of advanced technology portals are contributing to the difficulties in obtaining an accurate cost estimate of the radiation detection deployment program.", "In addition, GAO found that although DHS has improved the use of the detection equipment, CBP officers do not have access to data that would allow them to verify Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licenses (which are generally required for radiological materials transported into the U.S., though the licenses need not accompany the shipment), and that CBP secondary inspection procedures do not require CBP officers to open containers and inspect them to resolve an alarm (though GAO found that this does occur at some POEs).

The proposal would have replaced the current fee structure of $2.50 per flight segment and a maximum fee of $5.00 per one-way trip, with a flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip. Although passengers making connections to reach their destination would not see a fee increase under this proposal, passengers on direct flights would see their aviation security fees double. The Administration argues that the flat fee proposal more closely parallels passenger utilization of the aviation security system since passengers and their baggage are typically screened only once regardless of how many connections they might make to reach their destination.", "In this regard, the Administration's proposed aviation security fee changes for FY2007 differed significantly from those previously proposed in the FY2006 budget request. That prior proposal, which was not widely supported in Congress, would have kept the per-segment fee structure in place and raised it to $5.50 per trip segment with a maximum of $8.00 per one-way flight. That proposal, however, was opposed in Congress not only because it was viewed by many as detrimental to the airline industry as a whole, but also because it was seen as disproportionately impacting certain passengers, particularly those using smaller airports, who are more dependent on connecting flights. It is notable, however, that this perceived imbalance in the aviation security fee structure stems from the original collection authority enacted under ATSA, which presently requires passengers taking connecting flights to pay twice as much in aviation security fees as passengers taking a direct flight.", "The Administration projected that if the newly proposed flat fee of $5.00 per one-way trip were enacted, the increase in fee collections from passengers on direct flights, along with a rise in the numbers of air travelers, would have boosted aviation security fee collections in FY2007 by about $1,726 million dollars, or roughly 85%, compared to expected FY2006 revenues. If this measure were enacted, the Administration expected the new fees to cover about 70% of core aviation security costs, compared to a contribution of about 38% in FY2005.", "The Administration asserts that having users pay for aviation screening and security is what Congress intended when it enacted the aviation security fee under ATSA and doing so would free up general funds for spending on other homeland security needs that are more generally applicable to all citizens. Critics of the proposal, on the other hand, argue that all citizens benefit from aviation security measures that are intended, in part, to prevent another terrorist attack like the attack of September 11, 2001, and therefore, aviation security should be funded, at least in part, through general fund contributions. Critics of the proposal also maintain that tacking the aviation security fee on to passenger tickets hurts airlines by increasing the overall ticket cost which may prompt some passengers to seek alternative transportation, particularly for shorter trips. These critics go on to argue that airlines are already burdened by other ticket taxes and higher fuel prices that can negatively impact passenger revenues. Also, industry experts believe that the proposed fee schedule would have a greater relative impact on low-cost carriers that offer more direct flights. The current fee schedule arguably has a greater relative impact on legacy carriers that route passengers on connecting flights to a much greater extent using a hub-and-spoke service model.", "The Administration also proposed to collect $644 million from security fees paid directly by the air carriers, known as the aviation security infrastructure fees (ASIF).

In addition the House committee projected aviation security infrastructure fee (ASIF) collections directly from the airlines, including retroactive payments from FY2005 and FY2006, to total $546 million in FY2007, $98 million less than the administration projection. While the House-passed bill was based on the assumption of collecting significantly less in passenger and airline fees than administration projections, the only TSA program that was specifically reduced to derive cost savings was for headquarters administration, which was reduced by $4 million. House-passed funding for the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and flight attendant (cabin crew) training was also reduced, by $5 million, compared to the President's request.

As in past years, language in the House-passed bill capped TSA screener staffing levels to 45,000 full-time equivalents. The committee noted that this cap has been kept in place, in part, to ensure that the TSA accelerates technology deployment initiatives for passenger and baggage screening. Report language also directed the TSA to report on its efforts to decentralize screener hiring, and how these efforts might be encumbered by centralized financing of the hiring process. The committee also wanted the TSA to complete a study to identify those airports where passenger wait times at screening checkpoints are continually above system-wide averages.", "The House-passed bill would have provided $45 million more than the President's request for EDS purchase.

The committee, however, emphasized that it did not believe that explosive trace detection (ETD) should be refurbished, and sought the long term reduction in the use of ETD equipment for baggage screening. House-passed language also required the TSA to develop standards and protocols for increasing the use of EDS to screen air cargo, and requires the TSA to use existing EDS equipment and screeners to screen cargo on passenger aircraft to the greatest extent practicable at each airport.

The Senate committee report ( S.Rept. 109-273 ) expressed concerns over the President's budget request that would have cut this function by more that 50%. The report specified that out of the total funding amount for EDS and ETD purchase, $20 million or more should be put toward acquiring and deploying next-generation EDS machines, noting that the newer machines are potentially more efficient than current-generation units and may yield a significant improvement in installation, integration, and life-cycle costs. The Senate-passed bill also included $172 million for EDS and ETD installation, $127 million more than the FY2006 appropriated amount and $78 million more than both the President's request and the House-passed bill. S.Rept. 109-273 indicated that this sizable increase in funding would ensure that EDS and ETD installation is carried out in an expedited manner.

The Senate committee report asserted that this amount, in conjunction with available carryover balances, should be sufficient to meet FY2007 program requirements. While the committee expressed its general support for the additional layer of aviation security that would be provided through the Secure Flight program, the committee concluded that the shape and size of the program still remains unclear because of continuing delays and another effort to re-scope the program. The committee indicated that it was therefore reluctant to provide any resources beyond the proposed $15 million.", "Also regarding Secure Flight, the Senate-passed language was identical to the House-passed bill requiring DHS certification and GAO oversight to confirm that the system is secure, protects the privacy of personal data, and has an adequate redress process for passengers that are erroneously flagged by the system. Like the House-passed bill, this language would have prohibited the use of commercial databases in the Secure Flight system for any purpose including authenticating passenger identity or assessing passenger risk. In addition, S.Amdt. 4635 directed the TSA to work more closely with the airlines to provide technical data and other assistance to better align their reservation systems with terrorist databases to minimize travel delays and inconvenience associated with mistaken identification, until the Secure Flight system or a successor system is fully deployed. Also, S.Amdt. 4619 would have required the DHS to establish revised procedures for clearing individuals whose names are mistakenly placed on a terrorist watch list or whose names are similar or identical to individuals included on a terrorist watch list. Often these \"false positive\" identifications are made when an individual attempts to board a flight and is singled out for additional screening or denied boarding based on use of the no-fly and selectee lists provided by the TSA to the airlines.", "The Senate also agreed to several amendments related to aviation security. S.Amdt. 4608 would have required the TSA to provide passenger and baggage screener and related resources at the New Castle Airport in Wilmington, DE, as long as commercial air service is provided at that airport. It is uncertain whether the wording of this amendment would have specifically restricted the use of private screeners, contracted by TSA under their Screening Partnership Program (SPP) \u2013 sometimes referred to as the opt-out program \u2013 under which airports can elect to use private screeners instead of TSA screeners. If so, this provision could be highly controversial as it could set precedent for legislators to seek similar restrictions at other airports, which could be viewed by advocates for private screening as potentially undermining the intent of the opt-out provision of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA; P.L. 107-71 ). Another agreed-to amendment ( S.Amdt. 4582 ) would have required TSA to report on the effectiveness of screening operations resulting from its modification of the list of prohibited items in December 2005. Senate-passed S.Amdt. 4592 would have required air carriers to develop plans to comply with a provision of ATSA that gave emergency service personnel, such as firefighters, police officers, and medical technicians authority to voluntarily provide emergency services on commercial air flights during emergencies. The Senate also agreed to S.Amdt. 4552 , which would have removed the TSA's exemption from federal procurement law. When TSA was established as part of the Department of Transportation under ATSA, it was given authority to operate under the FAA's acquisition management system, which was statutorily exempt from many aspects of federal procurement law in order to provide for more timely and cost-effective acquisitions of equipment and materials to meet unique challenges in responding to the needs of the aviation industry. Also, in contrast to the House and prior-year appropriations language that capped the number of TSA screeners at 45,000, the Senate-passed S.Amdt. 4558 would have prohibited any statutory limitation on the number of TSA employees, or any administrative rule or regulation limiting the recruiting or hiring of TSA personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "P.L. 109-295", "paragraphs": ["P.L 109-295 provides gross funding of $6,374 billion for the TSA.

Although the conference report encouraged the deployment of emerging airport checkpoint technologies, it funded checkpoint support at $173 million, consistent with the House-passed amount, instead of the $181 million funding level originally passed by the Senate. This was due to a large unobligated carryover balance of $56 million from previous fiscal years for this activity that can be used to support FY2007 checkpoint support initiatives. These initiatives remain a high priority, and the conference report directs the TSA to develop a strategic plan for screening all types of explosives on passengers and in carry-on baggage. The act, however, did not include the Senate-passed language that would have moved aviation security research and development activities back within the TSA. With regard to checkpoint screening, report language also directs the TSA to review airport checkpoint wait times over the past three years and provide a report, identifying airports with above average wait times, with the FY2008 budget. Conference report language also direct the TSA to provide screening at 24 commercial airports and heliports that have requested TSA screening, but continue to operate with temporary screening or none at all. The report further directs the TSA to consider contracting out screening functions at these locations if it does not believe it would be efficient to deploy TSA personnel to these sites. Conference language also directs the GAO to study the effects of changes to the permitted and prohibited items lists made in December 2005 on public safety and screening effectiveness. The act keeps in place the longstanding cap on full-time equivalent TSA screeners of 45,000.", "A provision of the act (Section 514) reiterates a prohibition on using funds for the Secure Flight passenger prescreening program in other than a test basis until the TSA demonstrates and the GAO certifies that certain conditions pertaining to data security, privacy, and redress have been adequately addressed. While the President's signing statement indicates that the executive branch considers this section to only be advisory in nature, the TSA has been cooperating with the GAO to address these unresolved issues. The cct further requires the TSA to submit a detailed plan of Secure Flight program milestones and certification within 90 days of enactment.", "The act provides $141 million for EDS purchase, as initially agreed to by the Senate and $5 million above the House-passed amount. Report language specifies that up to $6 million may be used for refurbishing existing EDS equipment so long as the manufacturers are willing to place these machines back under warranty. This is $4 million less than the direct appropriation for EDS and ETD refurbishing passed by the House. While the Senate report language expressed support for the TSA's EDS refurbishment efforts, it did not specify an appropriation level for this activity. The conference report further specifies that EDS purchase funding is not to be used to procure ETD equipment, unless necessary for secondary baggage screening, as replacements at airports primarily dependent of ETD technologies, or for use at small airports and heliports where screening operations are newly federalized. The act includes a total of $388 million for EDS installations, including $250 million from the Aviation Security Capital Fund and a separate appropriation of $138 million. This amount is $34 million less than the original Senate-passed amount, but it is $44 million more than the original House-passed amount. The act also includes $222 million for EDS and ETD maintenance, an even split between the original Senate and House amounts. Conference report language directs the TSA to combine maintenance costs for all equipment, including EDS, ETD, and checkpoint screening equipment, into one budget activity in FY2008 to provide a more complete picture of the total maintenance costs for security equipment deployed at the nation's airports. The conference report also directs the TSA to develop performance measures and targets with regard to alternative screening procedures; track the use of these alternative screening procedures at airports; assess their effectiveness; conduct covert tests at airports using these procedures; and develop a plan to stop the use of these alternative screening procedures which are sometimes used in lieu of EDS and ETD screening. A general provision of the act (Section 524) specifies that recovered or deobligated funds for TSA aviation security, administration security support from prior fiscal years shall only be available for procurement and installation of EDS equipment for use in air cargo, checkpoint, and baggage screening. However, a separate provision (Section 537) rescinds roughly $5 million of these prior-year unobligated funds.", "The act provides $714 million for the Federal Air Marshals Service (FAMS), $15 million above the original amounts passed in both the House and Senate. The increased funding is designated for travel and training. Conference language states that the pilot program using FAMS in transportation modes other than aviation \"goes beyond what has been authorized for FAMS.\" The report further states that it is imperative for FAMS to focus on protecting aviation assets, particularly flights deemed to be a high security threat, before further expanding the role of FAMS. The act also maintains the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) program and crew training initiatives at a appropriated level of $25 million, consistent with the original House-passed amount and $2 million above the original Senate-passed funding level.", "The act provides $55 million for air cargo security, consistent with original House-passed and Senate-passed and requested amounts. While this funding is the same as FY2006 appropriations levels, the conference report noted that the TSA has been slow to obligate air cargo security funding, and expected that one-tenth of the total FY2006 appropriation would be carried into FY2007. The conference report language directs the TSA to use these carryover funds to hire additional staff to enhance the TSA's air cargo security analytic capabilities. A separate provision (Section 518) of the act directs the TSA, in consultation with industry stakeholders, to develop standards and protocols for increasing the use of EDS for screening air cargo when appropriate.", "With regard to surface transportation security, the act provides $37 million, consistent with both the original House-passed and Senate-passed amounts. The act also appropriates $20 million for the TWIC program, which is expected to be recouped through credentialing fees. Conference report language notes that due to the TSA's reprogramming of TWIC, an additional direct appropriation for FY2007 was not necessary. The TWIC is regarded as a high priority issue in response to public attention directed at seaport security over the past year, and conference report language reflects support for expeditious implementation of the TWIC program.

An amendment to that resolution offered by Senator Lautenberg ( S.Amdt. 3137 ) that would prohibit the proposed changes to aviation security fee collections was agreed to by unanimous consent. However, during consideration of the Transportation Security Administration Reorganization Act of 2005 ( H.R. 4439 ) in a markup session held by the House Subcommittee on Economic Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Cybersecurity on March 9, 2006, Representative Lungren offered an alternative aviation security fee proposal that is similar to the President's proposed fee structure. This alternative fee structure\u2014agreed to by the subcommittee for inclusion in H.R. 4439 \u2014includes a $4.00 fee per one-way trip that would directly fund the TSA, plus an optional $1.00 fee that could be charged by the airport of origin for funding qualified aviation security projects. Passenger aviation security fees under this plan would be capped at $5.00 per one-way trip and $10.00 per round-trip. Under the proposal, however, security fees paid directly by the airlines\u2014the ASIF\u2014would be eliminated. Noting that going along with the President's proposed passenger fee restructuring would not be in order as part of the appropriations process because it would require modifications to existing law, the House-passed appropriations bill does not address the issue of modifying passenger security fees.", "The status of the Secure Flight program to prescreen airline passengers against the consolidated terrorist watch list may be considered during the FY2007 appropriations debate. In prior years, appropriations legislation has contained language directing the GAO to review the program and making full implementation of the system beyond the testing phase contingent on the GAO finding that information security, privacy protection, and passenger redress issues have been adequately addressed. The GAO recently reported that these issues still largely remain unresolved and the program still faces many management hurdles, while the TSA has indicated that it is \"re-baselining\" the program before entering into the operational testing phase. As previously noted, the House-passed bill would keep the restrictions on full deployment of Secure Flight in force. It also would prohibit the TSA from using methods other than Government watch lists for assessing passenger security risk, and would prohibit the use of commercial databases for vetting passengers. During the FY2007 appropriations process, Congress may also examine the related Registered Traveler program, scheduled to be launched on a nationwide basis in FY2006. The status of the Registered Traveler program may be of particular interest to Congress since the airline industry, which once championed the program concept as a means to gain efficiency in passenger screening, is no longer backing the program amid concerns over the manner in which it is being implemented.", "Another aviation security-related issue that Congress may consider is the ongoing debate over resources and schedules for integrating checked baggage explosives detection equipment with airport baggage handling systems. Although deploying these in-line baggage screening systems is projected to significantly increase baggage throughput and reduce TSA manpower requirements for baggage screening, these capital projects are costly and will take several years to complete on a systemwide basis at current appropriations levels. A somewhat related issue is the TSA's effort to mitigate workplace injuries among TSA baggage screeners, which may benefit from in-line baggage screening systems and related ergonomic design considerations to the extent that they can eliminate or minimize the lifting and handling of baggage. Also, as previously discussed, the physical screening of passengers and their carry-on items for explosives and nonmetallic threats remains a high priority, and Congress may debate whether available technologies and TSA initiatives to deploy these technologies adequately respond to this stated need in a timely manner.", "Recent interest in seaport security stemming from the proposed acquisition of terminal operations at several large U.S. seaports by Dubai Ports World (DPW) may prompt more detailed examination of TSA's efforts to assess security risks at seaports as well as progress on the Transportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC) program. According to the TSA, the TWIC program, which is currently in a prototype testing phase, will be rolled out to ports utilizing the national port criticality list that prioritizes posts based on risk, threat, and vulnerability analysis. Although initial deployment of TWIC was planned for FY2006, it has been delayed until FY2007 to accommodate program review and related rulemaking. In light of the current interest in port security, the TWIC program scope, status, and deployment schedule may be of particular interest during the appropriations process.

DHS Appropriations in Context", "Federal-Wide Homeland Security Funding", "Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been an increasing interest in the levels of funding available for homeland security efforts. The Office of Management and Budget, as originally directed by the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act, has published an annual report to Congress on combating terrorism. Beginning with the June 24, 2002 edition of this report, homeland security was included as a part of the analysis. In subsequent years, this homeland security funding analysis has become more refined, as distinctions (and account lines) between homeland and non-homeland security activities have become more precise. This means that while Table B -1 is presented in such a way as to allow year to year comparisons, they may in fact not be strictly comparable due to the increasing specificity of the analysis, as outlined above.", "With regard to DHS funding, it is important to note that DHS funding does not comprise all federal spending on homeland security efforts. In fact, while the largest component of federal spending on homeland security is contained within DHS, the DHS homeland security request for FY2007 accounts for approximately 48% of total federal funding for homeland security. The Department of Defense comprises the next highest proportion at 29% of all federal spending on homeland security. The Department of Health and Human Services at 7.8%, the Department of Justice at 5.6% and the Department of Energy at 2.9% round out the top five agencies in spending on homeland security. These five agencies collectively account for nearly 93% of all federal spending on homeland security. It is also important to note that not all DHS funding is classified as pertaining to homeland security activities. The legacy agencies that became a part of DHS also conduct activities that are not homeland security related. Therefore, while the FY2007 requests included a total homeland security budget authority of $27.7 billion for DHS, the requested total gross budget authority was $39.8 billion. The same is true of the other agencies listed in the table."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
