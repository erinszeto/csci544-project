After much deliberation, the Senate revisited the FY2006 \"hold harmless\" requirement, which ensures that every state and U.S. territory receives at least its FY2006 amount. The hold harmless requirement has divided lawmakers from states with relatively faster-growing older populations from those representing states with relatively slower growth in their older populations. High-growth states have argued that the \"hold harmless\" provision in current law protects states whose populations are not increasing as quickly as others, resulting in an inequitable distribution of funds that disadvantage high-growth states. ", "To address this issue, P.L. 114-144 changes the Title III statutory funding formula for four programs by reducing the effect of the FY2006 hold harmless provision over a three-year period. These changes affect the following programs: (1) supportive services and centers, (2) congregate nutrition services, (3) home-delivered nutrition services, and (4) disease prevention and health promotion services. This legislative change was introduced in the bipartisan Senate bill ( S. 192 ). The House amended S. 192 but did not change the hold harmless reduction as proposed in the Senate's version.

P.L. 114-144 specifies certain amounts that are authorized to be appropriated for OAA programs and activities for FY2017 through FY2019. This change to the statutory language was included in the House amendment to S. 192 and reflects House protocols established by the majority leadership that are intended to guide legislation considered on the House floor. These protocols include \"Elimination of 'Such Sums' Discretionary Authorizations\" and \"Cut-Go for Discretionary Authorizations.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expansion Versus Consolidation", "paragraphs": ["One challenge for OAA reauthorization has been balancing the interests of policymakers and stakeholders in establishing new programs and activities that would expand authorities or create new requirements under the act with competing interests to consolidate or streamline certain authorities. In addition, much of the reauthorization debate has been framed in the context of constraints on discretionary appropriations in the current budgetary climate. As a result, there has been little interest among policymakers and stakeholders in seeking new or significant program expansions under a reauthorization. ", "Certain provisions under P.L. 114-144 provide some additional flexibility to states, area agencies on aging, and social service providers in addressing modernization of senior centers, falls prevention, and behavioral health screening, for example. The law codifies existing practices, such as requiring \"evidence-based\" disease prevention and health promotion services. It also aligns related programs, such as the workforce programs under Title V and those under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA, P.L. 113-128 ) while establishing new Title V performance measures and providing states with the option to establish a combined state plan for Title V under WIOA.

The original legislation established authority for grants to states for community planning and social services, research and development projects, and personnel training in the field of aging. The law also established the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the then-Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) to administer the newly created grant programs and to serve as the federal focal point on matters concerning older persons.", "Although older persons may receive services under many other federal programs, today the act is considered to be the major vehicle for the organization and delivery of social and nutrition services to this population. It authorizes a wide array of service programs through a nationwide network of State Units on Aging (SUAs), Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), and tribal organizations, as well as thousands of aging and social service providers in local communities. The act also supports the sole federal job program targeting low-income older workers and funds training, research, and demonstration activities in the field of aging.", "Prior to the creation of the act in 1965, older persons were eligible for limited social services through some federal programs. However, with the recognition that older individuals were becoming an increasing proportion of the population and that their needs were not being formally addressed through existing programs, many groups began advocating on their behalf. Their actions led President Truman to initiate the first National Conference on Aging in 1950. Conferees called for government and voluntary agencies to accept greater responsibility for the problems and welfare of older persons. ", "Further interest in the field of aging led President Eisenhower to create the Federal Council on Aging in 1956 to coordinate the activities of the various units of the federal government related to aging. The beginning of a major thrust toward legislation along the lines of the later-enacted OAA was made at the 1961 White House Conference on Aging. The conferees called for a federal coordinating agency in the field of aging to be set up on a statutory basis, with adequate funding for coordinating federal efforts in aging, as well as a federal program of grants for community services specifically for the elderly. ", "In response to the White House Conference on Aging recommendations, legislation was introduced in 1962 to establish an independent U.S. Committee on Aging to cut across the responsibilities of many departments and agencies, and create a program of grants for social services, research, and training that would benefit older persons. Legislation introduced in 1963 modified the 1962 proposal by creating within DHEW the AOA, which was to be under the direction of a Commissioner for Aging, appointed by the President with the approval of the Senate. ", "The OAA as introduced in 1965 paralleled the 1963 proposal. Sponsors emphasized how it would provide resources necessary for public and private social service providers to meet the social service needs of the elderly. The act received bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on July 14, 1965 (P.L. 89-73). In addition to creating AOA, the act authorized grants to states for community planning and services programs, as well as for research, demonstration, and training projects in the field of aging. In his remarks upon signing the bill, the President indicated that the legislation would provide \"an orderly, intelligent, and constructive program to help us meet the new dimensions of responsibilities which lie ahead in the remaining years of this century. Under this program every state and every community can now move toward a coordinated program of services and opportunities for our older citizens.\""], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Amendments to the Older Americans Act", "paragraphs": ["Since the original legislation was enacted in 1965, the OAA has been amended numerous times.

However, with the recognition that older individuals were becoming an increasing proportion of the population and that their needs were not being formally addressed through existing programs, many groups began advocating on their behalf. Their actions led President Truman to initiate the first National Conference on Aging in 1950. Conferees called for government and voluntary agencies to accept greater responsibility for the problems and welfare of older persons.

The beginning of a major thrust toward legislation along the lines of the later-enacted OAA was made at the 1961 White House Conference on Aging. The conferees called for a federal coordinating agency in the field of aging to be set up on a statutory basis, with adequate funding for coordinating federal efforts in aging, as well as a federal program of grants for community services specifically for the elderly. ", "In response to the White House Conference on Aging recommendations, legislation was introduced in 1962 to establish an independent U.S. Committee on Aging to cut across the responsibilities of many departments and agencies, and create a program of grants for social services, research, and training that would benefit older persons. Legislation introduced in 1963 modified the 1962 proposal by creating within DHEW the AOA, which was to be under the direction of a Commissioner for Aging, appointed by the President with the approval of the Senate. ", "The OAA as introduced in 1965 paralleled the 1963 proposal.

In addition to creating AOA, the act authorized grants to states for community planning and services programs, as well as for research, demonstration, and training projects in the field of aging.
