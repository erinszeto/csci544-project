However, differences in the characteristics and composition of spending and tax expenditures may have implications for the way each is used across major sectors of the federal budget. Federal spending programs may be better able to target groups that are unlikely to file federal tax returns, like low-income and elderly households. Tax expenditures may be more likely than spending programs to utilize targeting and enforcement services already undertaken by the federal government.", "Other differences important to federal usage occur within certain types of federal spending and tax expenditures. Discretionary spending and, in some cases, expiring tax expenditures typically involve more frequent legislative action than mandatory spending and permanent tax expenditure programs. Discretionary spending programs also provide increased budget certainty to Congress through the use of budget authority, while mandatory spending and tax expenditure resources depend on the participation and benefit choices of program recipients.", "This report identifies the largest spending and tax expenditures across eight major categories of federal activity: (1) defense and international affairs; (2) general science, space and technology, natural resources and the environment, and agriculture; (3) commerce and housing, community and regional development, and transportation; (4) education, training, employment, and social services; (5) health, including Medicare; (6) income security; (7) Social Security and veterans' benefits; and (8) administration of justice and general governance."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Spending programs and tax expenditures are the two primary ways that the federal government provides benefits to the public.

Discretionary spending includes most of the expenditures devoted to the general operations of federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and Environmental Protection Agency.

The magnitude of net interest payments is determined by the size of the federal debt and the interest rate of outstanding debt instruments.

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates the revenue losses attributable to certain programs. Tax expenditures were projected to increase net deficits in FY2016 by $1.521 trillion, or 8.2% of GDP. ", "Exclusions, exemptions, and deductions lower the taxes paid through reductions in the amount of income that is eligible for taxation. The financial value of exclusions, exemptions, and deductions is a function of the amount of income subject to the rule and the tax rate that would have otherwise been paid on the income. All else equal, an exemption that reduces an individual's taxable income by $1,000 is more valuable than an exemption that reduces individual taxable income by $500. Similarly, a deduction from income that would have otherwise been subject to a 39.6% income tax rate will lead to a greater revenue reduction than a deduction from income otherwise treated with a 15% income tax. Thus, the value of exclusions, exemptions, and deductions generally increases with income. ", "Preferential tax rates represent levies on parts of personal or corporate income that are lower than their normal rates, as defined by law (but which are nonzero). As with exclusions, exemptions and deductions, the value of preferential tax rates is a function of the amount of income affected and the rate of tax that would otherwise be applicable. Preferential tax rates will only have value in cases where the rate of tax would otherwise have been higher than the preferred rate. For instance, a law placing a tax rate of 30% on income will have value (be preferential) for an individual who otherwise would have been taxed at a 35% rate, but will have no value (or be harmful, if forced to adopt) to an individual otherwise subject to a 25% tax rate on the income. ", "Tax credits directly reduce the tax liability of an individual or corporation. Unlike other types of tax expenditures, tax credits do not modify the definition of income in the federal tax code. Tax credits may be designated as non-refundable or refundable. Nonrefundable credits cap benefit claims at the amount of remaining tax liability, while refundable credit benefits are not inherently limited by the tax liability threshold (and thus can also affect federal outlay projections).

In the event that a discretionary budget has not been agreed to as a new fiscal year approaches, Congress and the President have two choices: (1) enactment of a continuing resolution, which provides temporary budget authority for discretionary programs (typically as a function of the budget authority available in the previous year until permanent authority is passed); or (2) allow discretionary budget authority to lapse. The lapsing of budget authority can produce a \"government shutdown,\" which involves the closure of some federal operations that rely on discretionary funding. ", "Unless designated otherwise, mandatory programs are permanently funded by the federal government. Therefore, the funding provided for mandatory programs is typically not affected by the annual appropriations process. Absent the enactment of modifying legislation, the eligibility and benefit rules governing mandatory spending programs remain constant across budget years.

In this case, whether the tax expenditure is permanent or expiring is the biggest determinant of the legislative role in its maintenance.", "Many tax expenditures have been permanently incorporated into the tax code. In those instances, legislative action is required to change the implementation and benefits provided by the tax expenditures. Moreover, the level of their benefits is not subject to change based on the state of the appropriations process, which is similar to the treatment of mandatory spending programs.", "Tax expenditures may also serve as temporary provisions, with a scheduled expiration after a certain date or tax year. Such cases introduce increased uncertainty, as temporary provisions may be allowed to lapse, expire, or change in legislation that extends their inclusion in the tax code. In this way, temporary provisions may be comparable to the uncertain outcomes that are part of the legislative process for discretionary spending.", "Recent legislation changed the length of effectiveness for a number of tax expenditures that recently expired.

For these programs, Congress may use legislation to control the eligibility criteria and benefits afforded.

Discretionary spending programs usually allocate benefits to federal agencies, which have the autonomy to spend those funds as needed (within the limits provided in the authorizing statute). In many cases, these programs are used to finance spending on \"public goods.\" Public goods are defined here as goods that are non-rival (their \"use\" by one person does not reduce amounts available to others) and non-excludable (benefits are available to everyone, regardless of payment contribution). ", "Providing public goods by levying fees on individuals or firms in return for service may allow for the possibility of \"free-riding,\" where some market participants benefit with no or reduced payment for services paid for in full by other actors. For example, national defense is commonly thought of as a public good. In that case, payment by one group of people for defense services is likely to have benefits for all individuals in the local area\u2014including individuals who did not contribute payments for those services. The potential for free-riding may be one reason why discretionary spending is used for most national defense programs, as benefits can be applied broadly by the government and paid for through general tax revenues.

Therefore, for policy issues targeted to individuals, tax expenditure programs may be best targeted to households with at least one employed person, and which are thus much more likely to fill out a tax return than the population at large. However, populations that have below-average employment, such as low-income and elderly households, may be less likely to participate in tax expenditure programs, as the lower filing rate of tax returns could reduce their exposure to such programs.
