As the term is currently being discussed, s urprise billing typically refers to situations where consumers are unknowingly, and potentially unavoidably, treated by providers outside of the consumers' health insurance plan networks and, as a result, unexpectedly receive larger bills than they would have received if the providers had been in the plan networks. In the 116 th Congress, federal proposals have sought to address surprise billing in the context of two types of situations: (1) where an individual receives emergency services from an out-of-network provider and (2) where an individual receives services from an out-of-network provider that is working at an in-network facility.", "Although no federal requirements directly address surprise billing, at least half of the states have implemented policies to address surprise billing in some capacity. However, the state laws are limited in application, as certain types of plans, such as self-funded plans offered by employers, are exempt from state insurance regulation. State policies to address surprise billing vary in terms of the types of consumer financial protections provided (e.g., consumer balance billing limitations) and the related requirements on insurers and providers to establish such protections. Among states that offer similar types of consumer protections, policies may vary in their application and may differ according to the types of situations addressed (e.g., emergency services, out-of-network care at an in-network facility), the types of plans addressed (e.g., HMO, PPO), and the methods used to determine insurer payments to providers for such services (e.g., benchmark, arbitration).", "Similar to many state laws, recent federal legislative proposals related to surprise billing typically seek to address the financial relationships between insurers, providers, and consumers. They do so by establishing new requirements on insurers, providers, or both to create a degree of consumer protection related to reducing patient financial responsibilities with respect to some types of out-of-network care.", "In addition to including language that limits consumer cost sharing in surprise billing situations, the federal proposals typically include language that specifies the methods by which insurers determine payment to providers for the services being addressed in the bill (since solely reducing consumer financial liability in such situations would reduce the total amount providers receive for their services). When combined with balance billing prohibitions, this type of requirement effectively results in what the insurer and provider recognize as the total payment for out-of-network care.", "To date, federal proposals are largely aligned in how they would address consumer protections in surprise billing situations. However, the proposals differ in how they would address total payment for specified services furnished by out-of-network providers.", "Federal proposals generally have focused on at least one of two methods to determine insurers' financial responsibility: (1) selecting a benchmark provider payment rate that serves as the basis for determining specific amounts that insurers must pay providers, net of consumer cost sharing or (2) establishing an alternative dispute resolution process, such as arbitration, with provider payment determined by a neutral third party.", "This report discusses selected policy issues that Congress may want to consider as it assesses surprise billing proposals.

States are not able to directly apply surprise billing requirements to self-insured plans, but certain state requirements may affect state residents enrolled in a self-insured plan. For example, at least one state (New Jersey) has allowed self-insuring entities to opt in to surprise billing requirements.", "Relatedly, state requirements on providers may affect consumers with self-insured coverage. For example, New York established an arbitration process for certain surprise billing situations, which applied to providers and fully insured plans. This arbitration process did not apply to self-insured plans. However, results from a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper suggest the policy affected consumers with both fully insured and self-insured plans. The authors hypothesized that because most providers were unaware of whether the consumer's plan was fully insured or self-insured, providers billed amounts that were \"likely chosen to reflect the possibility of arbitration.\" ", "In light of this example, to the extent that a federal proposal would establish requirements on providers for consumers enrolled in plans in a specific market segment (e.g., only self-insured plans), providers may need to develop processes to determine whether a consumer has such a plan, as this information is not necessarily available to the provider when services are furnished. Broadly applying a provider requirement so that it addresses consumers enrolled in all types of health plans would minimize the potential that consumers inadvertently receive a surprise bill. Many federal proposals would be broadly applicable to self-insured and fully insured individual, small-group, and large-group private health insurance plans, though there has been some variance with respect to certain types of plans (e.g., Federal Employees Health Benefits [FEHB] Program plans).

Another study found that the prevalence of similarly defined \"surprise\" out-of-network billing increased for emergency department visits and inpatient admissions between 2010 and 2016.", "Researchers have suggested that surprise billing tends to occur around these particular types of services due to a unique set of market forces that differentiate these services from how other services function within the provider-insurer-consumer relationship.

Insurers steer their enrollees toward in-network providers by limiting plan coverage to in-network providers only or providing more generous coverage for in-network providers as compared with other out-of-network providers (i.e., reduced cost sharing). This approach effectively disincentives consumers from seeking out-of-network care in most situations.", "However, in the aforementioned billing situations, consumers are not necessarily able to choose an in-network provider. For example, a consumer may be unconscious due to a medical emergency and unable to decide whether he or she wants to be seen by an in-network or out-of-network emergency provider. In this instance, the consumer may be taken to the nearest hospital emergency department (without consideration of network status of the hospital and/or the emergency department providers within the hospital). As another example, consumers may be able to select or seek out a particular in-network hospital or in-network surgeon for a specific procedure, but the consumers are unlikely to be able to select every provider participating in that specific procedure. This is especially true if the consumer is unaware of the need for additional assistance when he or she arranges the procedure.", "Considering this, certain emergency and ancillary providers may have fewer incentives to join the network of a health insurer, since they are more likely to receive constant demand for their services regardless of network status and consumer choice. Instead, these provider types may find it more beneficial to stay out of network in order to be able to charge more for their services than the negotiated rate they would accept had they been considered in network.", "However, surprise billing is not limited to the aforementioned situations. It can occur in other situations (e.g., ambulance services or in situations where an in-network physician sends a consumer's lab test to an out-of-network lab).

Air ambulances are similar to the previously discussed situations in that consumers often are not able to choose an in-network air ambulance due to the urgency associated with the request for services. In addition, the \"relative rarity and high prices charged [by air ambulance providers] reduces the incentives of both air ambulance providers and insurers to enter into contracts with agreed-upon payment rates.\" For context, the Government Accountability Office found, as a result of its analysis of FAIR Health claims data, that 69% of air ambulance transports for privately insured consumers were out of network.

Cost sharing does not address the plan deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. Therefore, under this requirement, insurers may apply out-of-network deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for emergency services if such cost-sharing requirements generally apply to out-of-network benefits, which could increase the amount owed by the consumer as compared with a requirement that aligned the deductible, co-payment amount, coinsurance rate, and out-of-pocket limit.

This may lead insurers to raise in-network rates for these services to incentivize providers to join networks. If this response subsequently leads to higher average in-network rates as well as out-of-network rates (along with increased out-of-network coverage), then it may result in higher premiums in the market.

UCR rates are a method that insurers use to determine payment to providers for out-of-network services if a plan provides out-of-network benefits. Insurers have discretion over how UCR rates are calculated, and such determinations vary from insurer to insurer.

This could occur because these providers would otherwise be more likely to receive results that are more favorable as an out-of-network provider participating in an arbitration process that considers the extent of the provider's expertise and the complexity of each case.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the net effects of these types of policies on insurance premiums and the related effects on the federal budget in its scoring of two surprise billing bills from the 116 th Congress ( S. 1895 and H.R. 2328 , which are compared in the Appendix ).", "As implied by the policy impacts of these types of proposals on premiums, different policies also could have varying effects on national health expenditures. For example, the surprise billing proposal that required insurers to pay out-of-network providers their median in-network rate for services likely would reduce the aggregate dollar amount of private health insurance spending on out-of-network care relative to current law. This shift likely would occur even if consumers utilized the same amount of services, because \"median rates are generally lower than the current overall average rates.\" Future health expenditures also could grow slower than what is expected under current law if such a benchmark were indexed to an inflationary rate that is generally smaller than the rate of growth for provider rates. Relative to a benchmark-type policy that is tied to median in-network rates, an arbitration model policy likely would result in greater heath expenditures because arbitration would likely affect the negotiation of in-network rates. The potential threat of arbitration may afford certain providers increased leverage during the negotiation of in-network rates. However, the total effect of such policies on national health expenditures would be contingent upon the percentage of expenditures affected by the federal policies.", "The discussion of the aforementioned policies should not be interpreted as likely effects of all benchmark or all arbitration type policies. For example, a benchmark rate set at median rates would have different effects than a benchmark rate set at billed charges.", "Although comprehensive studies of state surprise billing laws are limited, there is anecdotal evidence of the impacts of such laws. For example, the effects of implementing a payment methodology were anecdotally evident in California, where a law required insurers to pay certain out-of-network providers the greater of the average contracted rate or an amount equal to 125% of the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) rate. As a result, at least some insurers took the position that \"providers should either accept a lower contract rate or not contract and, potentially, receive only 125% of Medicare FFS rates.\"", "A related example involves insurer responses to a Colorado surprise billing law that required insurers to pay the in-network payment rates for services furnished to enrollees of managed care plans by out-of-network providers at in-network facilities. A subsequent state survey of insurers regarding the implementation of the surprise billing law highlighted that certain insurers felt that \"out-of-network providers [were] encouraged not to join networks because they will receive in-network payment regardless\" and \"hospital-based physicians had greater leverage when negotiating contracts with managed care plans.\"", "The Colorado law did not affect all insurers equally. Of the 52 insurers that issued managed care plans in the private health insurance market during the evaluation period and provided responses to the survey, 7 carriers reported that the law had a positive effect on network adequacy, 20 carriers indicated no change, 21 carriers indicated a negative effect, and 4 carriers indicated insufficient experience and time to evaluate the change.", "Relatedly, New York implemented an arbitration-type surprise billing law (independent dispute resolution, or IDR) for emergency physician services and other specified non-emergency services. From 2015 to 2018, different provider types participated in the IDR process differently. For example, plastic surgery providers submitted 40% of emergency service IDR disputes and neurosurgery providers submitted 31% of the specified non-emergency service IDR disputes.", "The Colorado and New York examples highlight the likelihood that a federal surprise billing policy will affect individual actors within a market differently, which is the result of existing dynamics between insurers and providers within each specific market (e.g., market concentration and network participation). CBO accounted for this effect in its scoring of the two bills from the 116 th Congress. This idea is further compounded by the fact that each state has its own set of regulations (potentially including surprise billing laws). Therefore, the effects of federal surprise billing proposals also will have varying impacts on insurers and providers across states."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix. Side-by-Side Comparison of Selected Federal Surprise Billing Provisions", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides a side-by-side comparison of surprise billing provisions included within two federal bills that have gone through markup procedures.

As each bill addresses more than one type of situation, this appendix refers to different situations as scenarios . For each proposal, different scenarios are identified numerically in the \"Applicable Health Services and Providers\" row. Where applicable, each subsequent cell under a given proposal refers back to the terminology used in the \"Applicable Health Services and Providers\" row to indicate how a given requirement in the proposal applies to each scenario addressed within that specific proposal. In some instances, the requirement may apply solely to one scenario, apply differently across multiple scenarios, or apply similarly to all scenarios. ", "As an example, Title I of S. 1895 (Alexander) includes provisions regarding six scenarios, including (1) emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider at an emergency department of a hospital or freestanding emergency room and (2) ancillary services performed by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility if such services would have been covered had they been provided in network. In the \"Applicable Health Services and Providers\" row for the Title I of S. 1895 (Alexander) column, these scenarios are identified as Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 , respectively (with additional scenarios listed accordingly). Subsequently throughout the Title I of S. 1895 (Alexander) column, each reference to Scenario 1 discusses how that particular requirement would apply to emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider at an emergency department of a hospital or freestanding emergency room.", "Consumer costs for the services addressed within each of the proposals are discussed in the \"Consumer Cost-Sharing\" and \"Other Consumer Costs\" rows; a distinction that incorporates (1) the aforementioned discussion (highlighted in Figure 1 ) around whether a plan does or does not cover services provided by an out-of-network provider that would have been covered if provided by an in-network provider and (2) whether a particular service is a covered benefit under the plan irrespective of the network status of the provider (i.e., whether the service is considered an excluded service).", "When reading the appendix table, if the same language is used across the bills for a given feature, it means the bills have language that is identical or substantively similar. However, there may be underlying differences between the bills. For example, both bills create limits on consumer cost-sharing requirements, but the actual requirements that would be affected (e.g., deductible, co-payment) may vary between the bills, depending on how cost sharing is defined in either that bill itself or the amending statute (for bill language that does not include a definition of the term). This appendix table focuses on, and incorporates, language as included and defined in the aforementioned bills. It does not compare or analyze differences between the bill languages as a result of underlying statutory differences.", "Each bill summary is based on a review of the provisions as drafted. If a given proposal lacks specificity or includes inconsistencies, no assumptions were made to fill in gaps or resolve any discrepancies.", "Finally, the table does not address drafting errors or other technical issues within the proposals (unless such errors required an interpretation to incorporate bill text into the table).
