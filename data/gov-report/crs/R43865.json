The Reagan Administration designated the DPRK after it was implicated in the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner, in which more than 100 people died. The George W. Bush Administration removed the designation from the DPRK in 2008, one of the measures the United States took in exchange for North Korea's agreement to take steps to disable its nuclear program. As of early 2015, only the governments of Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria remain on the lists.", "The State Department can designate a government as a state sponsor of acts of international terrorism pursuant to three laws: the Export Administration Act of 1979; the Arms Export Control Act; and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Thus, there effectively are three state sponsors of terrorism \"lists.\" The State Department can use a variety of criteria when assessing whether a government should be added to and removed from the lists. In North Korea's case, policy considerations appear to have weighed heavily in the designation of the DPRK from 1988-2007, as well as in the decision to remove the designation in 2008. In the 114th Congress, H.R. 204 expresses the sense of Congress that the State Department should redesignate the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism.", "According to the State Department, North Korea has not been conclusively linked to any terrorist acts since 1987. Some observers have questioned the Department's claim. These observers support their contention by citing seizures of cargo ships carrying North Korean missile parts and conventional weapons, apparently to Syria and Burma (Myanmar). U.S. government agencies have stated that North Korea helped Syria build a nuclear reactor, and that North Korea and Iran cooperate closely in missile development. According to press reports, North Korea has provided support to Hamas and Hezbollah, and has targeted North Korean refugees living overseas for kidnapping and assassination. The 2010 sinking of a South Korean naval vessel also triggered calls to redesignate the DPRK. To date, cyber-related incidents such as the late 2014 attack on Sony have not been used as justification for designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. The 2009 and 2013 seizures of chemical protection equipment bound for Syria appear to be the only DPRK actions since 2008 that both (1) were recognized by official U.S. or U.N. bodies, and (2) conceivably could have met the statutory criteria for designation.", "Redesignating the DPRK as a terrorism sponsor appears unlikely to inflict significant direct economic punishment on North Korea, particularly in the short term. However, a decision to redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism could have a significant impact on international diplomacy with North Korea.

Placing North Korea back on the lists could forestall future diplomatic initiatives between Washington and Pyongyang, particularly if North Korean leaders\u2014as well as Chinese leaders\u2014interpret it as a sign that the United States is not interested in dialogue. Given previous patterns of North Korean behavior, it is possible that Pyongyang would respond to a redesignation by taking additional provocative actions, such as more nuclear-weapon or long-range-missile tests. North Korea has not conducted such tests since early 2013. Returning Pyongyang to the terrorism sponsor lists also could complicate the South Korean government's initiatives to improve relations with North Korea. Assessing the merits of these implications depends heavily on whether or not one believes the United States should adopt a harsher stance toward Pyongyang."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["From 1988 until 2008, the State Department designated the government of North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as a state sponsor of terrorism. Since the Bush Administration's October 2008 removal of the DPRK from the three state sponsors of terrorism lists (see \" Listing a Country as a State Sponsor of Terrorism ,\" below), provocative actions by North Korea periodically have been followed by calls for the Obama Administration to redesignate Pyongyang as a terrorism sponsor. The state sponsors lists include governments that the Secretary of State determines have \"repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.\" As of January 2015, the governments of Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria are on the lists. ", "The calls to redesignate North Korea were particularly intense in 2010, following the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, as well as in late 2014, following a cyberattack against Sony Pictures Entertainment and a threat against theater-goers to Sony's movie, The Interview. The film depicts the fictional assassination of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. U.S. and foreign government sources have implicated North Korea in all three incidents. Interdictions of North Korean missile and conventional arms shipments to Iran and Syria, and from Cuba\u2014as well as reports of North Korean arms sales to and training of known terrorist actors such as Hezbollah and Hamas\u2014also have fueled the calls to redesignate the DPRK government as a state sponsor of terrorism. ", "Since 2008, Members of Congress have made several legislative attempts to challenge the Bush Administration's decision to remove North Korea's state sponsor of terrorism designation. In the 114 th Congress, H.R. 204 expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. H.R. 1771 , the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act from the 113 th Congress, would have imposed many of the restrictions on the DPRK that would be triggered if it were redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism. The House passed H.R. 1771 in July 2014, and many expect that a similar bill will be introduced in the 114 th Congress. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Possible Implications of Redesignating North Korea", "paragraphs": ["The Bush Administration's removal of the DPRK from the state sponsor of terrorism lists does not appear to have provided Pyongyang with significant tangible economic benefits. Two main reasons are North Korea's widely perceived lack of appeal as a trade and investment partner and the numerous U.S. legal restrictions on doing business with and in North Korea. Commercial U.S.-DPRK trade has remained virtually at zero, as in the years before the delisting. The U.S. Department of Commerce continues to treat North Korea as a supporter of terrorism when it considers export license applications for dual-use and restricted goods and services; Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security keeps North Korea in its most restricted trade categories. Annual foreign assistance appropriations laws continue to prohibit direct bilateral aid to North Korea; the United States withholds contributions to United Nations programs proportionate to U.N. spending in the DPRK. Although some U.S. companies, including DHL and the Associated Press, have opened offices in North Korea since 2008, the number and scope of these operations appear to be small in scale, and likely would require a special license from the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control if the North Korean government is redesignated. Thus, redesignating the DPRK as a terrorism sponsor appears unlikely to inflict significant direct economic punishment on North Korea, particularly in the short term. However, even if redesignation directly causes only a small practical effect, North Korea-watchers who want to increase pressure on North Korea may favor such a move because the Kim regime likely would perceive it as a sign of a tougher U.S. approach. ", "For a number of reasons, a decision to redesignate the DPRK as a state sponsor of terrorism could have a significant impact on diplomacy with North Korea. The Kim regime has been promoting a two-track policy (the so-called byungjin line) of nuclear development and economic development, with the latter goal partially dependent upon influxes of foreign investment. Some analysts of North Korea have pointed to signs that the Kim regime is pursuing economic reforms more earnestly than commonly is thought and is poised to accelerate the reforms in 2015. The DPRK could be particularly sensitive to a redesignation, which could be perceived as a threat to the potential economic gains the North Korean government expects from its byungjin policy. Therefore, those who wish to encourage North Korea's economic reforms, in the belief that they eventually would lead to changes in the government and/or the government's behavior, may oppose redesignating the DPRK. In contrast, those who wish to increase economic pressure on North Korea by undercutting the byungjin line may favor redesignating the DPRK.

", "Placing North Korea back on the lists could forestall any future diplomatic initiatives between the United States and North Korea. One of North Korea's long-standing foreign policy goals is improving relations with the United States, particularly if this can be accomplished on Pyongyang's terms and can be paired with economic benefits. Many analysts interpreted Pyongyang's decision in the fall of 2014 to release three U.S. detainees as a sign that North Korea is seeking a new diplomatic breakthrough with Washington, part of a broad outreach that also included overtures to South Korea, Japan, and Russia. Redesignation could be interpreted by North Korean leaders, as well as officials in other countries, as a sign that the Obama Administration is not interested in dialogue. Additionally, given previous patterns of North Korean behavior, it is possible that Pyongyang would respond to a redesignation by taking additional provocative actions, such as more nuclear-weapon or long-range-missile tests. North Korea has not conducted such tests since early 2013.", "Additionally, North Korean leaders might try to use a redesignation to convince other countries, particularly China, that the United States is to blame if tensions between Pyongyang and Washington increase. Even without encouragement from North Korea, China may be inclined to use redesignation as a pretext for opposing U.S. and South Korean efforts to increase pressure on North Korea through other means. Although the South Korean government of Park Geun-hye has maintained a relatively hard line towards North Korea, she has made improved relations with Pyongyang a signature goal for her term and has pressed North Korea to improve relations and open negotiations over various issues. Returning Pyongyang to the terrorism sponsor list could complicate these initiatives, particularly her desire to encourage multinational companies to invest in the inter-Korean Kaesong Industrial Complex, which operates in North Korea. Nonetheless, many people in South Korea\u2014as well as in Japan\u2014who favor adopting a tougher approach to North Korea likely would welcome the DPRK's redesignation as a terrorism sponsor.", "One proponent of redesignating the DPRK argues that if the U.S. government explicitly links the North Korean government to terrorism, it would give encouragement to North Korean refugees, helping them to resist intimidation. North Korean refugees have become an important source of information about and insights into North Korean politics, economics and society. Additionally, some see these defectors as a means to spread news about the outside world into North Korea, such as through operating radio stations in Seoul, some of which have received U.S. democracy assistance funds. There have been reports that North Korean agents have targeted some refugees for harassment, kidnapping, and assassination. ", "If redesignated, North Korea might make removal from the list a precondition for cooperation in any future talks over its nuclear, missile, chemical, biological, or cyber weapons programs. Redesignation could create both an obstacle to future talks and a possible bargaining lever for the United States if negotiations restart.

Thus, there effectively are three state sponsors of terrorism \"lists.\" None of the three Acts defines the overarching term \"international terrorism.\" However, Section 140 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989, in its requirement that the Secretary of State report annually to Congress on foreign governments supporting international terrorism, defines \"terrorism\" as \"premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.... \" Criteria considered by the Secretary of State when assessing whether a foreign government should be added to the lists include, but are not limited to: supplying a terrorist organization with planning, training, logistics, and lethal material support; providing direct or indirect financial assistance; abetting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; or providing other types of assistance that could provide material support for the terrorist organization's activities. Supplying weapons or weapons technology to governments designated as state sponsors of terrorism generally has not been considered justification for designating the supplier government as a state sponsor of terrorism. Laws that seek to deter weapons proliferation, however, might come into play.", "The enumerated criteria do not specify the type of incidents or the level or duration of terrorism related activities that might be considered by the Secretary of State when deciding whether or not the United States should designate a foreign government as a state sponsor of terrorism. Some analysts suggest that the ambiguity of the criteria may be purposeful insomuch as it would give the Secretary of State and the President a great deal of discretion when weighing competing policy and political implications associated with placing a government on the list. ", "In North Korea's case, diplomatic and policy considerations appear to have weighed heavily in the designation of the DPRK from 2000 to 2007, as well as in the decision to remove the designation in 2008. Originally, the government of North Korea was added to the lists because it was implicated in the in-flight bombing of Korean Air flight 858 on November 29, 1987, which killed all 115 passengers and crew on board. For years before 2008 the State Department's annual reports on global terrorist activities stated that North Korea was not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the Korean Air attack. However, the Department's reports listed a number of other factors that merited North Korea's continuation on the state sponsors lists, including: ", "the abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s; the harboring of several Japanese Red Army terrorists who participated in a jet hijacking in 1970; the failure to take \"substantial steps\" to cooperate in efforts to combat international terrorism; the maintenance of ties to terrorist groups; and developing a capability to manufacture weapons of mass destruction that could be acquired by other terrorist states or non-state entities.", "In 2008, the Secretary of State removed North Korea from the lists despite little change in most of the above conditions. Instead, the decision appears to have been made primarily for diplomatic reasons: removing the government of North Korea from the terrorism lists was part of the 2007 deal that the Bush Administration made with Pyongyang as part of the Six-Party Talks seeking to disable North Korea's nuclear program. Under the 2007 deal, North Korea agreed to disable its nuclear installations at the Yongbyon site and provide the other five countries with a \"complete and correct\" declaration of its nuclear programs. Some analysts have argued that the subsequent collapse of the Six-Party process, along with North Korea's advances in its nuclear programs, have erased the original diplomatic justification for removing North Korea from the state sponsor of terrorism lists.", "During a January 13, 2015, House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on North Korea, the State Department's Special Representative for North Korea Policy, Sung Kim, said that the Department has an \"ongoing process\" to assess whether North Korea meets the criteria for being designated as a state sponsor of terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restrictions as a Result of Terrorism Designation17", "paragraphs": ["A foreign government on the state sponsors of terrorism lists is subject to restrictions on trade, investment, and assistance.

The Clinton Administration reportedly presented to North Korea in February 2000 four steps that North Korea would have to take to be removed from the terrorism lists: (1) issue a written guarantee that it no longer is engaged in terrorism; (2) provide evidence that it has not engaged in any terrorist act in the past six months; (3) join international anti-terrorism agreements; and (4) address issues of past support of terrorism.

The Bush Administration resisted these demands, giving significant emphasis to the Japanese abduction issue.", "The final phase of negotiations over North Korea's inclusion on the terrorism lists occurred in the 2006-2008 period, following North Korea's first nuclear test in October 2006. In February 2007, the six parties reached an agreement under which North Korea agreed to freeze and then disable its nuclear programs, and the United States agreed to take steps that included removing North Korea from the terrorism sponsor list. On January 22, 2008, Dell Dailey, the State Department's coordinator for counterterrorism, reportedly stated that it appeared that North Korea had complied with the criteria for removal from the terrorism support lists because North Korea had not committed an act of terrorism for the past six months. He added that despite the unresolved Japanese kidnapping issue, \"we think that even with that on the table that they still comply with the ... delisting criteria.\" Later that year, after considerable back-and-forth in the nuclear negotiations, the Bush Administration removed North Korea from the terrorism sponsorship lists, as well as from the TWEA strictures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Actions Since 2008 Not Deemed Sufficient for Redesignating North Korea", "paragraphs": ["Since the United States removed North Korea from the terrorist list, Pyongyang has taken or been linked to a number of actions that have led to calls to place the North Korean government back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Furthermore, Crowley said that the Department had determined that while the Cheonan 's sinking was a violation of the 1953 armistice agreement that brought an end to the major fighting of the Korean War, it was not an act of international terrorism because it was \"taken by the military or the state against the military of another state.\" Therefore, Crowley said, the sinking \"by itself would not trigger placing North Korea on the state sponsor of terrorism list.\" "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Does a Cyberattack Equate to an Act of \"Terrorism?\" The 2014 Hacking of Sony Pictures", "paragraphs": ["Events in late 2014 again led to calls to redesignate the government of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.

North Korea's Foreign Ministry said that \"a movie of a plot to hurt our top-level leadership is the most blatant act of terrorism and war\" and threatened a \"merciless countermeasure\" if The Interview was released. On November 24, Sony Pictures Entertainment experienced a cyberattack that disabled its IT systems, destroyed data, and released to the public internal emails. North Korea denied involvement in the attack, but praised the hackers, who called themselves the \"Guardians of Peace,\" as having done a \"righteous deed.\" Weeks later, anonymous emails threatened \"9/11-style\" terrorist attacks on theaters showing the film, leading some theaters to cancel screenings and subsequently to Sony's cancelling the film's scheduled widespread Christmas Day release. In responding to the possibility of such attacks, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson noted that the United States has \"no specific, credible intelligence of a plot to launch attacks on movie theaters.\" Sony later announced the film would be shown in a small number of theaters and available on some online streaming services.

In an interview with CNN, Obama called the incident \"cyber-vandalism,\" implying that it was not an act of war. On December 20, cyber analysts and news media reported that the North Korean network providing access to the Internet faltered and then eventually went offline for approximately 10 hours. Many cyber analysts said the disruption pointed to an attack on North Korea's network, although they could not rule out either an overload or a preventive shutdown by North Korea. Two groups linked to the hacker collective Anonymous claimed responsibility for shutting down North Korea's Internet connection using denial-of-service attacks. U.S. officials would not comment on whether this constituted the \"proportional response\" promised by Obama. On January 2, 2015, the White House issued an Executive Order authorizing additional sanctions on North Korean individuals and entities, calling it a \"first aspect\" of its proportional response.

The FBI claimed that the Sony attack used the same malware as previous attacks attributed to North Koreans, but some cyber experts say that evidence is circumstantial and speculative. Administration officials have claimed that other intelligence used to make the determination is classified and unavailable for public consumption. On January 7, 2015, at a cybersecurity conference in New York City, FBI Director James Comey, in discussing whether North Korea was behind the cyberattack, stated \"There is not much in this life that I have high confidence about\u2014I have very high confidence about this attribution, as does the entire intelligence community.\" At this same event DNI James Clapper noted that this cyberattack was \"the most serious ever against U.S. interests.\" ", "As of January 2015, a cyber-related incident directed at the United States has never been used as justification for inclusion on the state sponsors of terrorism lists. It could be argued that current laws relating to the state sponsor of terrorism lists may be viewed as sufficiently broad and ambiguous to allow for the inclusion of cyber-based incidents as a designation criterion.
