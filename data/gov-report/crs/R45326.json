The agency's civil works activities consist largely of the planning, construction, and operation of water resource projects to maintain navigable channels, reduce flood and storm damage, and restore aquatic ecosystems. Congress directs USACE's civil works activities through authorization legislation, annual and supplemental appropriations, and oversight. For Congress, the issue is not only the level of USACE appropriations but also how efficiently the agency is delivering flood control, navigation, and ecosystem restoration projects. These projects can have significant local as well as national economic and environmental benefits.", "Annual and Supplemental Appropriations", "USACE discretionary appropriations, which typically are provided through annual Energy and Water Development appropriations acts, have ranged from $4.7 billion to $7.0 billion during the decade from FY2009 to FY2019 and have been increasing since FY2013. In recent years, Congress has directed that more than 50% of the enacted appropriations be used for operation and maintenance of USACE's aging infrastructure.", "USACE also has a prominent role in responding to natural disasters, especially floods, in U.S. states and territories. Congress increasingly is using supplemental appropriations not only to perform emergency response and repair for damaged flood control works and USACE projects but also to study and construct new projects that reduce flood risks in areas recently affected by hurricanes and floods. From FY2005 through FY2018, Congress enacted 13 supplemental bills related to flooding and natural disasters, providing a total of almost $45 billion to USACE; for the same period, annual discretionary appropriations for USACE's flood-related projects and activities totaled $23 billion. Supplemental appropriations bills often alter or waive various requirements for USACE activities, such as cost shares and project cost limitations, and establish project selection and reporting requirements that differ from requirements for USACE activities funded through annual discretionary appropriations.", "Issues for Congress", "Issues for Congress include the significant role of supplemental appropriations in advancing studies and construction of flood control projects since FY2005 and the agency's backlog of authorized but unconstructed projects. The agency has reported a $96 billion backlog of authorized construction projects; for context, annual appropriations for the USACE Construction account (which funds most USACE construction projects) in FY2018 and FY2019 are $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. Congress also has limited the number of new studies and construction projects initiated with annual discretionary appropriations (e.g., a limit of five new construction starts using FY2019 appropriations). Given that only a few construction projects typically are started each fiscal year, numerous projects authorized for construction by previous Congresses remain unfunded.", "USACE may fund some of the authorized flood control projects in its backlog with the more than $17 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations provided to USACE accounts in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA; P.L. 115-123). Although no numerical limits on starting new studies or construction projects are associated with these funds, the study and construction funds have some geographic limitations that tie their use to areas affected by flooding by the hurricanes in 2017 or by more than one flood in calendar years 2014 through 2017. As a result of this limitation, seventeen states (including North Carolina, which was affected by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018) did not qualify for USACE supplemental construction appropriations provided through the BBA 2018.", "Related policy questions for Congress and other decisionmakers include the following:", "How have the roles of Congress and the Administration shifted vis-\u00e0-vis USACE and its appropriations, and does that shift affect the type of information and engagement that Congress may pursue in the future regarding USACE's use of appropriations?

USACE operates more than 700 dams; has built 14,500 miles of levees; and improves and maintains more than 900 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors, as well as 13,000 miles of deep-draft channels and 12,000 miles of inland waterways. ", "For most activities, Congress requires a nonfederal sponsor to share some portion of project costs. For some project types (e.g., levees), nonfederal sponsors own the completed works after construction and are responsible for operation and maintenance. As nonfederal entities have become more involved in USACE projects and their funding, these entities have expressed frustration with the time it takes USACE to complete studies and construction. Only a subset of authorized USACE construction activities are included in the President's budget request and funded annually by federal appropriations. Consequently, numerous authorized USACE projects or project elements have yet to receive federal construction funding. An estimated $96 billion in authorized USACE construction projects and dam safety work is eligible for USACE construction appropriations; discretionary appropriations for the USACE Construction account in annual Energy and Water Development appropriations bills have averaged $2 billion in recent years. ", "Congress enacted an omnibus USACE authorization bill in 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014; P.L. 113-121 ). Congress followed WRRDA 2014 with enactment in December 2016 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2016, which was Title I of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ( P.L. 114-322 ). Among other things, these laws expanded authorities providing alternative ways to advance and deliver USACE studies and projects. To expand delivery options, Congress increased the flexibility in nonfederal funding of USACE-led activities and nonfederal leadership of USACE studies and projects. Competition for USACE discretionary appropriations also has increased interest in alternative project delivery and innovative financing , including private financing and public-private partnerships. In addition, Congress in WRRDA 2014 authorized new financing mechanisms for water resource projects. These statutes also provided that the costs of these nonfederally led activities generally are shared by the federal government largely as if USACE had performed them. That is, subject to the availability of federal appropriations, nonfederal entities advancing water resource projects may be eligible to receive credit or reimbursement (without interest) for their investments that exceed the required nonfederal share of project costs. These authorities typically require that the nonfederal entity leading the project comply with the same laws and regulations that would apply if the work were being performed by USACE.

This situation results in competition for funds among authorized activities during the budget development and appropriations processes. ", "Since the 112 th Congress, site-specific project line items added by Congress (i.e., congressionally directed spending , also referred to as earmarks ) have been subject to House and Senate earmark moratoriums. Consequently, appropriators generally have refrained from inserting in appropriations bills and accompanying reports funds for specific projects that were not requested in the President's budget. This practice has resulted in post-enactment agency work plans that identify how funds provided by Congress that were not requested by the President are being distributed across authorized USACE studies and projects. In the congressional reports and explanatory statements that accompany the annual appropriations bills for USACE, Congress has provided guidance to the Administration on activities to prioritize during the development of the work plan.

To fund these activities and repairs to USACE-operated projects (e.g., dredging to clear a navigation channel following a storm), Congress often has provided supplemental funds to certain USACE accounts. At times, including in BBA 2018, Congress also has funded construction of new flood control projects in areas affected by recent flood disasters. As discussed in detail later in this report (see below section, \" USACE Annual Appropriations \"), Congress has provided USACE accounts with almost $45 billion in supplemental appropriations in response to flood disasters since FY2005, of which almost $24 billion was for construction of flood control projects.

This shift is consistent with efforts by recent Administrations and Congresses to limit funding for new construction activities (referred to as new starts or new construction starts ) and to focus instead on completing existing projects and on actions to address aging infrastruct ure. Enacted appropriations bills since FY2014 have allowed the agency to initiate a specified number of USACE new start studies and construction projects.

The press book shows the requested funding for USACE projects for each state, and it shows how the President's requests for various accounts are distributed across the agency's business line s (i.e., types of activities, such as navigation, restoration, and recreation). In recent years, the executive branch has justified decisions about which projects to fund and at what level through a number of metrics, including benefit-cost ratios and other metrics outlined in USACE budget development guidance each year.", "For decades through the annual discretionary appropriations process, Congress identified numerous USACE projects to receive funding that were not in the President's request and provided more funding than requested for others that were in the President's request. Since the 112 th Congress, congressional funding for site-specific projects has been subject to House and Senate earmark moratoriums. Since the 112 th Congress, in lieu of increasing funding for specific projects, Congress has provided additional funding for specific categories of work within some USACE budget accounts. That is, in recent appropriations cycles, Congress has included additional funding categories for various types of USACE projects (e.g., additional funding for ongoing maintenance of small, remote, or subsistence harbors), along with directions and limitations on the use of these funds on authorized studies and projects. USACE typically has been directed to report back to Congress in annual work plans on how these funds will be allocated at the project level. Recent levels of additional funding are shown below in Figure 3 .", "The work plan is developed by the Administration after enactment of the appropriations bill. For example, Congress in P.L. 115-244 provides $2.21 billion more than the President's request for FY2019; of this $2.21 billion, $2.07 billion is identified as additional funding for a total of 25 categories of USACE activities in four budget accounts. The accompanying conference report, H.Rept. 115-929 , calls for USACE, within 60 days of enactment, to issue a work plan that included the specific amount of additional funding to be used for each project. These work plans typically consist of a few pages of tables that list the projects, the amount of the additional funding that each project will receive, and in some cases a brief description of what is to be accomplished with the funds.

Use of HMTF monies is restricted largely to maintenance, and use of IWTF monies is limited largely to construction. Federal funding for harbor-related maintenance activities is funded in large part from the HMTF. This trust fund receives revenues from taxes on waterborne commercial cargo imports, domestic cargo, and cruise ship passengers at federally maintained ports. Similarly, the IWTF is authorized to fund roughly half of inland waterways construction; the IWTF receives the proceeds of a fuel tax on barge fuel for vessels engaged in commercial transport on designated waterways. ", "In recent fiscal years, the HMTF has developed a surplus balance (nearly $10 billion at the start of FY2019), as appropriations from the fund have been less than receipts accruing to it. Conversely, the limited IWTF balance in recent years prevented the fund from supporting earlier levels of expenditures on waterway construction. Both trust funds were addressed in 2014 authorizing legislation, and spending from both funds has subsequently increased. ", "Whether these trust funds will continue to provide for increased spending on inland and coastal navigation will depend in part on future appropriations legislation and actions on other legislative proposals. For example, H.R. 1908 , Investing In America: Unlocking the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Act, if enacted would make an amount equivalent to the harbor maintenance tax collections during the previous fiscal year available for authorized harbor maintenance. In January 2017, USACE estimated the cost to achieve and maintain constructed widths and depths of coastal navigation channels at $7.6 billion over the subsequent five-year period (i.e., $1.5 billion annually) and an additional $7.0 billion for the five years that follow. In FY2017, USACE used $1.2 billion (most of which was derived from the HMTF) on coastal navigation maintenance. The economic benefit of maintaining channels to these dimensions would vary from channel to channel depending on the cost of the dredging and the reduced transportation cost to shippers (and the benefits to the broader economy) resulting from improved navigation conditions.", "Most inland waterway construction and major rehabilitation costs are shared by the federal government (50%) and commercial users through the IWTF (50%). IWTF monies derive primarily from a fuel tax on commercial vessels on 27 designated federal waterways. At times, the level of collections from the fuel tax have been a limiting factor in the construction of inland waterways projects. In P.L. 113-295 , Congress authorized a $0.09 per gallon increase in the fuel tax, resulting in a barge fuel tax of $0.29 per gallon beginning in April 2015. As part of its FY2019 budget request, the Administration submitted a proposal that would establish a new user fee on vessels transporting commercial cargo on the inland waterways, allow the IWTF to cover 10% of O&M expenses, and designate additional federal waterways. P.L. 115-244 did not address the Administration's proposal; instead, Congress chose to alter the use of the IWTF by decreasing the IWTF contribution to the Chickamauga Lock construction on the Tennessee River from 50% to 15% during FY2019, thereby expanding the funding available for other inland navigation construction projects. This 85% General Treasury and 15% IWTF cost sharing is similar to what Congress enacted in WRRDA 2014 for the completion of the Olmsted Locks and Dam. The Olmsted project, which facilitates navigation on the Ohio River, had an extended construction period starting in the early 1990s. The project, which is anticipated to have a total construction cost of $2.78 billion (of which $1.00 billion derived from the IWTF), is anticipated to be completed in FY2019."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USACE Supplemental Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["USACE also undertakes flood fighting activities and other natural disaster response and recovery activities.

Of the monies in the Construction account, Congress has provided that $15.000 billion was to be used for the following:", "$10.425 billion is designated for expedited construction of flood and storm damage reduction projects in states and territories affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. $4.575 billion is to be used for USACE flood and storm damage reduction construction activities in any state or territory with more than one flood-related major disaster declaration in calendar year (CY) 2014, CY2015, CY2016, or CY2017. Of this amount, $50 million is set aside for smaller projects that reduce the risk of flooding and storm damage being performed under the agency's programmatic authorities (known as continuing authorities programs).", "BBA 2018 establishes requirements for states and insular areas to be eligible for BBA 2018 study and construction funds. The geographic constraints on BBA 2018 funds mean that some states and territories are eligible for all the funding, some states and territories are eligible for some of the study and construction monies, and some states and territories do not meet the requirements for the BBA 2018 study and construction funds. USACE projects in five states (Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas) and two territories (U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico) meet the eligibility requirements for funding from both the $10.425 billion and the $4.575 billion, as shown in Figure A-1 . A total of 33 states and 3 territories meet the criterion of one flood-related major disaster declaration in CY2014, CY2015, CY2016, or CY2017, as shown in Figure A-1 ; that is, $4.575 billion in BBA 2018 funds are available for use on USACE construction projects in these 33 states and 3 territories. Seventeen states (e.g., North Carolina, which was affected by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018) do not qualify for USACE supplemental construction appropriations provided by the BBA 2018.", "When using BBA 2018 construction funds (but not when using annual appropriations), projects in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and ongoing construction projects are 100% federally funded; all other construction activities using these funds follow normal cost-sharing arrangements (e.g., typically 65% federal and 35% nonfederal for construction of flood control projects, but these percentages vary by project due to project-specific conditions). ", "On July 5, 2018, USACE assigned most of the BBA 2018 funds provided for construction and studies to specific USACE projects; that is, of the $15.000 billion, $1.131 billion in construction funds remains unassigned. On August 9, 2018, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) issued Policy Guidance on Implementation of Supplemental Appropriations in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ; it provides a definition for key terms, including ongoing construction project, and whether the projects on the July 5, 2018, list qualify as ongoing construction. Table A-1 combines the project-level information for construction projects in the July 5, 2018, list and the August 9, 2018, guidance. The August 9, 2018, guidance identifies ongoing construction projects as: (1) authorized projects that had received funding from the USACE Construction account in FY2015, FY2016, or FY2017, and (2) authorized projects that a nonfederal sponsor was constructing during those three fiscal years pursuant to a potential reimbursement agreement with USACE.", "Of the $135 million for the Investigation account, BBA 2018 requires that $75 million be available for states and territories affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria; the statute also states that the remainder (i.e., $60 million) is to be available for \"high-priority studies of projects\" in any state or territory with more than one flood-related major disaster declaration in CY2014, CY2015, CY2016, or CY2017. When using these funds (but not when using annual appropriations), study costs are 100% federal. ", "Construction Authorization and Role of Congress", "BBA 2018 amends the role of Congress for some construction projects that receive supplemental USACE construction funds provided in the legislation. The standard process for USACE projects is that after the completion of a multistep project development process (which includes, among other measures, a completed feasibility study and environmental documentation and a report by the agency's Chief of Engineers known as a Chief's Report ), Congress authorizes the project's construction. The authorization is typically in an omnibus water project authorization bill. Division B, Title IV of BBA 2018 includes the following language, which allows for some projects to proceed to construction without project-specific congressional authorization:", "$15,000,000,000 is available to construct flood and storm damage reduction, including shore protection, projects which are currently authorized or which are authorized after the date of enactment of this subdivision, and flood and storm damage reduction, including shore protection, projects which have signed Chief's Reports as of the date of enactment of this subdivision or which are studied using funds provided under the heading \"Investigations\" if the Secretary determines such projects to be technically feasible, economically justified, and environmentally acceptable.", "A deviation from the standard authorization process also is provided for use of USACE funds from the Hurricane Sandy supplemental appropriation while maintaining a role for the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. Division B, Title X, Chapter 4 of P.L. 113-2 states that", "upon approval of the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate these funds may be used to construct any project under study by the Corps for reducing flooding and storm damage risks in areas along the Atlantic Coast within the North Atlantic Division of the Corps that were affected by Hurricane Sandy that the Secretary determines is technically feasible, economically justified, and environmentally acceptable.", "Hurricane Sandy Projects in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018", "In Section 20402, BBA 2018 transfers unobligated balances from the monies provided by P.L. 113-2 to the USACE Flood Control and Coastal Emergencies account ($518.9 million) and the USACE Operations and Maintenance account ($210.0 million) to the Construction account for Hurricane Sandy-related construction projects. The August 9, 2018, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works implementation guidance for BBA 2018 does not provide explicit guidance on how these transferred funds are to be implemented."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
