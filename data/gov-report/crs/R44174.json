Historically, the federal role in apprenticeship has primarily involved regulation and oversight.

Federal student aid provides financial assistance to individual students to assist in covering costs related to postsecondary education. Apprentices who are eligible for need-based Pell grants can use those funds for tuition, books, and other costs associated with the related instruction portion of a Registered Apprenticeship program if the apprentice is enrolled in an eligible certificate or degree program.
