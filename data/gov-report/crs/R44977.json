Although not explicitly mentioned in the Stafford Act, PDAs play a crucial role in the declaration process. State and tribal governments use PDA information as part of the basis for their major disaster request, and FEMA relies on the PDA findings to provide a recommendation to the President concerning whether a major disaster declaration is warranted and what types of federal supplemental assistance should be made available.", "More specifically, the PDA provides information about various \"factors\" which FEMA evaluates to determine whether Public Assistance (PA) is warranted after an incident. For PA, these factors include estimated costs of assistance, localized impacts, insurance coverage, hazard mitigation, recent multiple disasters, and the availability of other federal resources. Similarly, FEMA uses information from the PDA to assess factors that determine whether an incident warrants Individual Assistance (IA) and, if so, which types of IA.", "Despite their importance in the declaration process, PDA information has only recently been publicly available.

It also compares that constructed dataset to a previously constructed dataset of disaster declarations and other data from FEMA regarding obligations from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), the account from which FEMA provides PA and IA.", "In recent years, congressional interest in emergency management has focused on funding, program administration, and program coordination\u2014both among federal agencies and state emergency management agencies. The data from PDA reports informs debates about these policy issues. For example, PDA reports provide insight as to whether FEMA recommendations are applied uniformly to all major disaster requests. Similarly, PDA reports can be analyzed to address congressional concerns over whether PA and IA determinations are systematic and appropriate. More broadly, PDA information can inform the debate over whether federal disaster assistance is being provided for incidents that could be handled at the state, local, or tribal level.", "Some of the key findings in this report include", "major disaster declarations that authorize PA generally conform with the PA thresholds outlined in regulation; higher percentages of low-income households in a disaster-impacted area seem to influence the decision to authorize IA; of requests that were neither expedited nor appealed, 18.5% were decided within one week, 63.7% were decided within two weeks, and 89.8% were decided within one month; the time between a major disaster request and decision varies based on the amount of PA and IA damage as well as the type of event; and the magnitude of PDA estimates for both PA and IA that under-estimate ultimate obligations is greater than the magnitude of estimates that over-estimate ultimate obligations.", "This report concludes with policy observations and considerations for Congress. These considerations include", "replacing the per capita threshold used by FEMA to make major disaster recommendations with another form of measurement; requiring PDA reports to include additional information about the incident; taking measures to increase PDA accuracy; and amending Section 320 of the Stafford Act.", "This report will be updated as events warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Robert T.

When a major disaster overwhelms a state or tribal nation's response capacity, the state's governor or the tribal nation's chief executive may submit a request for a major disaster declaration. Under Section 401 of the Stafford Act", "All requests for a declaration by the President that a major disaster exists shall be made by the governor of the affected state. Such a request shall be based on a finding that the disaster is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments and that federal assistance is necessary.

State and tribal governments use information from a PDA to determine whether to request a major disaster declaration and, if so, the basis for that major disaster request.

", "Despite the importance of PDAs in the declaration process, PDA information has only recently been made available to the public. In 2008, FEMA, at the direction of Congress via general provisions in appropriations legislation, began to post PDA reports on its website. The same provision was included in appropriations legislation through 2015, but it was not included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. PDA reports summarize \"damage assessment information used to determine whether to declare a major disaster.\" However, PDA reports do not necessarily provide the entirety of information that could be included in PDAs.", "In spite of their limitations, PDA reports contain a great deal of information concerning (1) damage estimates; (2) demographic information of the affected area, including percentages of elderly populations and low-income households; and (3) insurance coverage in the area. PDA reports can also be used to track the timeline of a declaration request because they include request and declaration (or denial) dates.

In general, the PDA process begins with a pre-assessment at the state, local, or tribal level. If state, local, or tribal authorities decide a joint FEMA-State (or FEMA-Tribal Nation) PDA is warranted, a damage assessment team is assembled to assess and document the damage caused by an incident. The team that oversees the PDA process typically consists of representatives from the state government, representatives from the appropriate FEMA regional office, local officials familiar with the area, and, in some instances, representatives from the American Red Cross and/or the Small Business Administration (SBA). After the relevant information is gathered, it is consolidated, reconciled, and submitted with the governor's or chief executive's request to the President for a major disaster declaration.

If it is unclear whether response capacity has been (or will be) exceeded, the PDA process begins with a pre-assessment by the state or tribal government to determine if the situation warrants federal participation. Pre-assessment allows the governor or chief executive to review the situation before initiating an official request for a major disaster declaration.", "Pre-assessment information can help the governor or chief executive anticipate a potential denial for federal assistance and withhold a request. While there are obvious incentives to submit a request for federal assistance, there are at least two reasons why a request may be withheld. First, a denied request for a major disaster declaration can only be appealed once. If early indications point to a possible denial, the governor or chief executive may have state, local, or tribal officials verify the extent of damage to ensure nothing has been overlooked. Given the limit on the number of appeals, it might be better to determine whether that information is available prior to submitting an initial request. Second, leaders may be concerned that a denied request will reflect adversely on a governor's or chief executive's decision-making skills and judgment under pressure. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Damage Assessment Teams", "paragraphs": ["If a state or tribal nation decides to move forward with the major disaster request after the pre-assessment, a damage assessment team is assembled.

As mentioned previously, in some cases it may also include representatives from other federal agencies or voluntary relief organizations. ", "While state and tribal nations are responsible for coordinating local participation in the PDA process, FEMA representatives are responsible for briefing the team concerning which factors should be considered, what information will be helpful in the assessment, and how information should be reported. With that guidance, the damage assessment team collects relevant information about the incident and completes FEMA's PDA template (see Appendix ).", "Damage assessment teams often face challenges when collecting data. For example, while some information may be directly observable, such as damage to buildings and structures, less tangible information, such as the percentage of elderly residents affected in an area or the amount of insurance coverage for all homeowners and renters, may be more difficult to obtain in a timely manner. For another example, the geographic span of damage can create complications as the damage assessment team struggles to cover and access all of the affected area in a limited time. ", "At times, a state or tribal government will suspend the information gathering process when officials believe the damage assessment team has documented the necessary amount of damage to warrant a declaration.

However, even when the PDA process is waived or expedited, initial federal assistance is typically limited, and subsequent PDA processes are required to determine what additional assistance is necessary.

The request is submitted to the appropriate FEMA Regional Administrator who, in turn, acknowledges the request, summarizes the findings, analyzes the data, and submits a recommendation to FEMA Headquarters.

Several reports by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as well as the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General have suggested taking steps to update the PA factors, particularly with the view of better assessing a state's capacity. In response to the conversation on this issue, FEMA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on January 20, 2016. ", "Following public comment, FEMA published a second Advance Notice that sought to address earlier public comments requesting greater detail and clarity.

The proposal addressed several factors in explaining how the Deductible is developed. Perhaps the most direct response to previous criticisms are suggestions for calculating the fixed capacity of states which contains some of the previous recommendations from GAO and the IG.

The first threshold is $1 million in public infrastructure damages. This threshold is set \"in the belief that even the lowest population states can cover this level of public assistance damages.\" ", "The second threshold used by FEMA is determined by multiplying the state's population (according to the most recent census) by a specified statewide per capita impact indicator\u2014currently $1.43. The statewide per capita impact indicator has been periodically adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers since 1999. In general, FEMA will recommend a major disaster declaration that includes PA if public infrastructure damages exceed $1 million and meet or exceed $1.43 per capita. The underlying rationale for using a per capita threshold is that tax revenues that support a state's disaster response capacity should be sufficient if damages and costs fall under the per capita amount.", "Depending on a state's population, the per capita threshold may be difficult to reach. For example, the 2010 Census estimated California's population at 37.25 million people. Multiplied by the current per capita impact indicator of $1.43, an incident in California would need to require PA-eligible damages and costs of more than $53.27 million before federal supplemental assistance would be recommended through a major disaster declaration. California is a large state with a budget and tax base commensurate with its size. Therefore, expecting California to be able to respond to an incident that causes more than $53 million worth of damage could be considered by some to be within \"the capabilities of the state.\" On that basis, some would argue that using per capita thresholds as a consideration when determining whether an incident warrants PA is consistent with the Stafford Act. ", "Others disagree. In some cases, a rural area in a highly populated state is affected by an incident and denied federal assistance presumably because damages and costs do not exceed the per capita threshold. Some argue that these incidents warrant federal assistance because they overwhelm local response and recovery capacity in spite of not exceeding the statewide threshold. In other cases, some argue that the application of the per capita threshold is inequitable because the same incident may affect multiple states but only result in a major disaster declaration for some states by virtue of differences in state population. Further, GAO noted in a recent report that there may be more effective ways to account for the capabilities of the state.", "CRS constructed and analyzed a dataset using FEMA's publicly available PDA reports to determine how often declaration decisions align with meeting the two PA thresholds. Of the 410 requests that resulted in a declaration that authorized PA, two\u2014both for the state of Vermont\u2014met the per capita threshold but not the $1 million threshold, and two did not meet the per capita threshold. ", "One of the two declarations for which PA was authorized, even though the statewide per capita threshold was not met, was requested by the governor of Arizona in 2010 for severe storm and flooding damages affecting the Sovereign Tribal Nation of Havaspupai. Within the tribal nation, the PA cost estimate was $1.63 million, which equates to more than $3,000 per capita according to the tribal per capita impact reported in the PDA report. Since the Sandy Recovery and Improvement Act ( P.L. 113-2 ), which is discussed in the next section, similar requests can now be made directly by tribal nations.", "The second declaration that authorized PA for an event that did not meet the statewide per capita threshold was for severe storm and flooding damages in Kansas during the summer of 2009. For this request, the statewide per capita impact estimate was one cent ($0.01) below the threshold. Another request in the dataset reported a statewide per capita impact estimate that was one cent ($0.01) less than the threshold, but that request was denied. There were also 17 PDA reports in which the state per capita threshold was exceeded but a major disaster was not declared. Two of those 17\u2014both for tribal nations\u2014did not meet the $1 million threshold. The next section will discuss thresholds for declarations in tribal nations in greater depth.", "In spite of the general adherence to the $1 million and statewide per capita PA thresholds, Section 320 of the Stafford Act states that \"no geographic area shall be precluded from receiving assistance under this Act solely by virtue of an arithmetic formula or sliding scale based on income or population.\" Consequently, some Members of Congress may argue that FEMA's use of these thresholds is justified only so long as it is one of several factors it takes into consideration when evaluating an incident's impact.

A considerable number of state and local governments \"self-insure\" their investments against some types of disasters and thus, arguably, could be found to have no remaining liability during the PDA process. In addition, the state insurance commissioner must certify that hazard insurance is both available and affordable for certain disaster types (such as earthquakes).

Under that assumption, FEMA uses census data to determine homeowner insurance penetration. Further, if the home is located in a flood prone area then purchasing insurance for those disasters is often a legal requirement if the owner has a federally-backed mortgage.

More specifically, regulations published in 1999 include a table of the average amount of IA per disaster, by state population, from July 1994 to July 1999 (reproduced as Table 5 ). FEMA stresses that these averages are not to be used as thresholds but rather as a guide that \"may prove useful to states and voluntary agencies as they develop plans and programs to meet the needs of disaster victims.\" Indeed, as an average, some of the values of total IA per disaster necessarily fall below the values listed in the table. Regardless, it has generally been inferred that the amount of damage listed in the table is generally how FEMA determines which incidents warrant IA. ", "Given the congressional mandate in Section 320 of the Stafford Act, the information in Table 5 cannot be the basis of an arithmetic formula that solely determines whether IA is recommended. Furthermore, some question the table's relevance because the amounts have not been updated in over 15 years and are based on 1990 census data. In the proposed rule, FEMA \"determined that the table should be removed because it causes confusion among States.\" ", "Using the CRS dataset constructed from PDA reports of major disaster requests dated October 2007 through December 2015, Table 6 compares the average amount of assistance per disaster from July 1994 to July 1999, as reported in regulation, to the estimated amount of assistance reported in PDA reports for small, medium, and large states by declaration decision. The columns of the table indicate the number of requests in which estimates either do or do not exceed two damage indicators: the average number of residences with major damage or destroyed and the average total IA cost.", "As evidenced in Table 6 , damage estimates exceeding either the average number of residences with major damage or destroyed or the average total IA cost is a strong predictor of whether a request receives a major disaster declaration that authorizes IA. That said, over 75% of the requests included damage estimates that did not exceed either of the indicators. Of those requests that included damage estimates that did not exceed either indicator, almost 40% received IA. These findings were consistent across state sizes."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Damage Assessment Timeline", "paragraphs": ["PDA reports also provide information about the length of time between a major disaster request and its ultimate declaration or denial by the President. This information is often useful for setting expectations of when federal supplemental help may be authorized.

As would be expected, the declared/expedited requests are skewed toward the beginning of the timeline and the denied/appealed requests are skewed toward the end of the timeline. Of the requests that were neither expedited nor appealed, 89.8% were decided within a month after requested, 63.7% were decided within two weeks after requested, and 18.5% were decided within the week they were requested. ", "Beyond expedited and appealed requests, there are other reasons to expect the timeline to be different. For example, when an incident results in a great amount of damage, it is reasonable to assume the decision will be made more quickly than when an incident causes relatively less, albeit still as devastating, amount of damage. This assumption is supported by the data. When considering the estimated costs of PA, requests in which the per capita impact indicator was exceeded by the per capita impact estimate were decided, on average, 6.4 days sooner than requests in which the indicator was not exceeded. Furthermore, IA requests that estimated more than $7.5 million in costs were decided on average in 6.2 days versus 13.4 days for those requests that estimate less than $7.5 million in costs. This may indicate that those factors may make it far easier, or more obvious, to FEMA that IA should be recommend as part of a disaster declaration.", "The type of disaster event may also impact the PDA timeline. When excluding those requests that were either expedited or appealed, the average number of days for key stages of the PDA process for fires, floods, hurricanes, severe storms, severe winter storms, tornadoes, and tropical storms are reported in Table 8 . Across the 485 events included in the table, the average amount of time between when the incident begins and when the governor or tribal leader submits the request is 27.6 days. However, for flooding events, the average time is 48.5 days, likely reflecting the unique access issues that prevent damage assessment teams from evaluating damage until the flood waters have receded. Conversely, the average time is shorter for hurricanes, likely reflecting the lead time and ability to anticipate the severity of those events given forecasting.", "Similar to the time between when the incident begins and the request is submitted, the time between when the request is submitted and when the decision is announced varies by event. For example, the average time between when the request is submitted and when the decision is announced for all events is 13.4 days. However, decisions on major disaster requests for fire-related events occur, on average, 20.5 days after they are submitted. This likely reflects the availability of Fire Management Assistance Grants under Stafford Act authorities, which facilitate response to fires without the need for a presidentially declared disaster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Damage Assessment Accuracy", "paragraphs": ["Beyond the declaration decision, PDAs may be useful predictors of the ultimate obligations for PA and IA. By combining the information from PDA reports with information from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), it is possible to assess how accurate the PDA process is for estimating the amount of public and individual assistance ultimately obligated. This information may be useful for assessing the adequacy of the PDA process for evaluating whether federal supplemental assistance is necessary following an event.", "Before examining the differences between DRF obligations and PDA estimates, a few words of caution are warranted. First, the estimates included in the PDA report are just that\u2014estimates. Therefore, some might argue that some degree of inaccuracy should both be expected and tolerated. Second, given the process by which information from a PDA results in a major disaster declaration, there may be an incentive for damage assessment teams to gather enough data to demonstrate that damages and costs exceed the state's capacity while not necessarily gathering data that captures the totality of those damages and costs. Consequently, to the extent there are differences between DRF obligations and PDA estimates, it might be expected that the PDA estimates under-estimate ultimate obligations. Table 9 and Table 10 include summary statistics on the differences in obligations and estimates for PA and IA, respectively.", "For PA, a typical PDA estimate differs from its corresponding DRF obligation, as measured by the median absolute value difference, by just over $3.1 million (see Table 9 ). Overall, PDAs over-estimated PA obligations in 56.3% of the cases. However, the largest amount by which a PDA over-estimated PA obligations was $64.6 million whereas the largest amount by which a PDA under-estimated PA obligations was $453.9 million. The magnitude of difference between the greatest over-estimation and greatest under-estimation may be due to the incentive to gather enough data to demonstrate that damages and costs exceed the state's capacity while not necessarily gathering data that captures the totality of those damages and costs, as mentioned in the previous paragraph.", "For IA, a typical PDA estimate differs from its corresponding DRF obligation, as measured by the median absolute value difference, by just under $3.6 million (see Table 10 ). Overall, PDAs were just as likely to overestimate IA obligations as to underestimate them. However, the largest amount by which a PDA over-estimated IA obligations was $19.4 million whereas the largest amount by which a PDA under-estimated PA obligations was $361.5 million. Again, the magnitude of difference between the greatest over-estimation and greatest under-estimation may be due to the incentive structure mentioned earlier. These differences for IA are similar to the differences for PA, but as a percentage of total obligations, the IA estimates are further from the projected obligations than their PA counterparts.

The statewide per capita impact indicator has been periodically adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers since 1999. As noted earlier in this report, FEMA did not adjust the indicator between 1986 and 1999. ", "The underlying rationale for using a per capita threshold is that tax revenues that support a state's disaster response capacity should be sufficient if damages and costs fall under the per capita amount. Some may argue that using per capita thresholds as a consideration when determining whether an incident warrants PA is consistent with the Stafford Act. ", "Others may disagree that the per capita indicator is a useful tool for measuring state capacity. As mentioned previously, using the per capita indictor as a determinant for major disaster assistance may preclude some incidents from receiving federal assistance\u2014particularly rural incidents occurring in populous states.", "If Congress is concerned that the per capita threshold is a poor measurement of state capacity, it could require FEMA to replace or supplement the per capita threshold with another form of measurement. For example, in 2001, GAO issued a report on disaster declaration criteria. This report was a comprehensive review of FEMA's declaration criteria factors. GAO recommended that FEMA \"develop more objective and specific criteria to assess the capabilities of state and local governments to respond to a disaster\" and \"consider replacing the per capita measure of state capacity with a more sensitive measure, such as a state's total taxable resources.\"", "The state's Total Taxable Resources (TTR) was developed by the Department of the Treasury. GAO reported that TTR:", "is a better measure of state funding capacity in that it provides a more comprehensive measure of the resources that are potentially subject to state taxation. For example, TTR includes much of the business income that does not become part of the income flow to state residents, undistributed corporate profits, and rents and interest payments made by businesses to out-of-state stock owners. This more comprehensive indicator of state funding capacity is currently used to target federal aid to low-capacity states under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration's block grant programs. In the case of FEMA's Public Assistance program, adjustments for TTR in setting the threshold for a disaster declaration would result in a more realistic estimate of a state's ability to respond to a disaster.", "It could be argued that the use of TTR would conflict with the prohibition against arithmetic formulas established by Congress in Section 320 of the Stafford Act. However, just as FEMA's per capita measurement is one of several factors considered and not the \"sole\" determinant of a declaration, GAO stated that TTR would not violate Section 320 because TTR could also be used with other criteria such as those identified in regulations. Thus, some could contend that TTR could fill a similar role with perhaps more accuracy.

Some may argue that loss of life should also be given greater weight when evaluating an incident. In addition to listing the number of fatalities caused by an incident, loss of life can be measured by using a method known as the value of statistical life (VSL) which assigns a monetary value to each fatality caused by the given incident. For example, the U.S. Department of Transportation uses $9.1 million as the VSL when evaluating risk reduction.

Although the amount of damages and costs can vary widely by incident, just as incidents can present various challenges to the estimating processes, FEMA appears generally to adhere to consistent indicators in declarations decisions, such as per capita amounts to support a request for PA. While estimates do not always comport with eventual DRF spending, they do serve as a guide to the scope of the disasters and the likely categories of spending.", "The PDA reports also offer some insights into the swiftness of disaster response efforts. CRS analysis of PDA reports indicates that in most cases states or tribal nations will receive a decision within two weeks of submitting a request. This finding likely indicates that once the necessary information has been submitted, the decision-making process can generally proceed with little delay. That analysis also reveals that different types of disaster events take different amounts of time, on average, for assessment. For example, damage caused by a tornado is quickly assessed whereas damage from flooding may take longer because damage assessment teams need to wait for the waters to recede.", "The PDA process is likely to be improved in the future as FEMA and the states develop better survey tools that capture more information without encumbering the goal of providing emergency assistance.
