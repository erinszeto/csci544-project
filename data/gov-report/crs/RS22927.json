Negotiators have attempted to maintain a balance across the three pillars by simultaneously achieving concessions from exporters and importers alike in the form of tighter spending limits on trade-distorting domestic support; elimination of export subsidies and new disciplines on other forms of export competition; and expansion of market access by lowering tariffs, increasing quota commitments, and limiting the use of import safeguards and other trade barriers. However, as a concession to poorer WTO member countries, the degree of new conditions is to be less stringent for developing than for developed nations.", "Substantial progress had been made by 2008 in narrowing differences in Doha Round negotiating positions. As a result, a \"modalities framework\" (i.e., specific formulas and timetables for reducing trade-distorting farm support, tariffs, and export subsidies, and for opening import markets) was released in December 2008, in an attempt to lock in the status of negotiated concessions, while adding detail to outstanding issues as a basis for further, more specific talks. By 2009, outstanding differences had been reduced to a short list of contentious issues, including designating additional products as sensitive coupled with establishing new tariff quotas, designating developing country products as special and thus exempt from tariff reductions, and allowing developing countries to raise tariffs temporarily to deal with import surges or price declines. However, these differences proved sufficient to deadlock the negotiations.", "From the U.S. perspective, a successful Doha agreement (under the current negotiating text) would significantly lower allowable spending limits for certain types of U.S. domestic support and eliminate export subsidies, while allowing U.S. agricultural products wider access to foreign markets. Any assessment of the potential effect of the new domestic support programs authorized by the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) is very preliminary at this time. Many of the new programs have yet to be fully implemented; thus producer participation is uncertain and program outlays hinge on future market conditions. For example, under a relatively high price environment, as existed during the 2010-2013 period, U.S. program outlays could easily fall within proposed Doha Round limits with no or only modest changes. However, if market prices were to decline substantially below support levels for an extended period, then outlays could escalate rapidly and threaten to exceed the proposed spending limits.", "A concern of U.S. trade negotiators, Congress, and commodity groups is whether the draft modalities include too many exceptions for foreign importers (in terms of their ability to restrict imports) to ensure that an adequate balance will be achieved between U.S. domestic policy concessions and potential U.S. export gains.

Thus, while U.S. program outlays under any one of these latter categories may achieve their specific box limit, the cumulative total (i.e., the OTDS) must be well below the sum of their separate totals.

However, in 2012 the United States changed the notification status of federal crop insurance support. Prior to 2012, all federal crop insurance premiums were notified as non-commodity-specific and were thus excluded from the AMS under the large non-commodity-specific de minimis exemption. In 2012, federal crop insurance premium subsidies of $7 billion were notified as commodity-specific outlays. As a result, only a portion of the premium subsidies were excluded under the commodity-specific de minimis exclusion, and U.S. product-specific outlays rose sharply to $5 billion in 2012 after averaging $0.4 billion during 2006-2011.

The income support programs were replaced with an insurance program, called the stacked income protection program (STAX), that uses a county-level, within-year, market-based revenue guarantee. Although determined at the county level, indemnities are coupled to planted acres (as they are for other crop insurance products). STAX premiums are subsidized at an 80% rate. This premium subsidy could be notified as product-specific amber box, thus making them vulnerable to any significant reduction in cotton-specific AMS limits. Premium subsidies for upland cotton under traditional crop insurance policies were $554 million in 2012, $447 million in 2013, and $472 million in 2014.", "Because cotton is singled out for separate treatment, it would also have an accelerated reduction to the cap for its product-specific blue box.
