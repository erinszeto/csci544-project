Targeted Case Management (TCM) refers to case management for specific Medicaid beneficiary groups or for individuals who reside in state-designated geographic areas. Over the past seven years of available data (1999-2005), total expenditures on Medicaid TCM increased from $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion, an increase of 107%. In comparison, over the same period, total Medicaid spending increased by 87%, from $147.4 billion to $275.6 billion.", "TCM has been an active concern for both the executive and legislative branches. For instance, the Bush Administration proposed legislative changes to reduce Medicaid TCM expenditures in recent annual budget submissions. In the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171), Congress added new statutory language to clarify the definition of case management and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations to guide states' claims for federal Medicaid matching funds for TCM. As a result of DRA requirements, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an interim final rule on December 4, 2007 for case management, which took effect March 3, 2008. In the interim final rule, CMS estimated that the new case management rules would reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by approximately $1.3 billion between FY2008 and FY2012.", "In April, the Economic Recovery in Health Care Act of 2008 (S. 2819), was introduced in the Senate, which would impose a moratorium on implementation of the TCM regulation until April 1, 2009. On May 22, 2008, the Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2642). H.R. 2642 included a moratorium until April 1, 2009, on implementation of the TCM and other Medicaid regulations. H.R. 2642 was amended by the House and passed on June 19, 2008. The House amendments to H.R. 2642 included moratoria on implementation of six Medicaid regulations, including case management and TCM, until April 1, 2009. On June 26, 2008, the Senate passed H.R. 2642 without changes to the House legislation, so that implementation of six Medicaid regulations, including case management and TCM, would be delayed until April 1, 2009.

Case management is not the direct provision of medical and related services, but rather is assistance to help beneficiaries receive care by identifying needed services, finding providers, and monitoring and evaluating the services delivered. Targeted case management (TCM) refers to case management that is restricted to specific beneficiary groups. Targeted beneficiary groups can be defined by disease or medical condition, or by geographic regions, such as a county or a city within a state. Targeted populations, for example, may include individuals with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, chronic physical or mental illness, developmental disabilities, children receiving foster care, or other groups identified by a state and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS). TCM and case management are optional services that states may elect to cover, but which must be approved by CMS through state plan amendment (SPAs).", "The Medicaid statute covering case management has been amended a number of times, most recently by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ). Section 6052 of DRA added new language that further defined case management services (including TCM) and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop rules for states to follow in claiming reimbursement for case management expenditures under Medicaid. To this end, CMS issued an interim final rule governing the use and claiming of Medicaid case management services.

Nationally, during the same period, the number of beneficiaries receiving TCM increased 62.6%, from approximately 1.7 million in FY1999 to approximately 2.7 million in FY2005. Average TCM expenditures per beneficiary also increased from FY1999 to FY2005, rising by 26.9%. In comparison, overall Medicaid expenditures also increased rapidly over the same period, rising from approximately $147 billion in FY1999 to $276 billion in FY2005, an approximate 87% increase. The number of Medicaid beneficiaries also increased during this period, rising by 43.1%, from FY1999 (40.3 million) to FY2005 (57.7 million). During the same time period, average spending per Medicaid beneficiary increased by approximately 30.7%, from $3,657 in FY1999 to $4,781 in FY2005.", "Based on CMS reported data, total federal and state expenditures for TCM services in FY2005 ranged from approximately $535 million in California to approximately $872,000 in Hawaii (see Table 2 ). During the same period, the number of beneficiaries receiving TCM services ranged from 820,000 individuals in Illinois to 1,463 in Hawaii.

The majority of states that reported TCM expenditures in FY2005 spent between $500 to $1,500 per beneficiary on TCM. Although most states cover TCM, some do not show TCM expenditures in the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) database compiled by CMS from state-reported information.

The SMDL reiterated statutory language that broadly defined TCM and left states substantial flexibility on whether to cover and how to structure TCM services. In addition, the 2001 SMDL described examples that would be considered appropriate claiming of TCM expenditures.", "Subsequently, in the early years of the Bush Administration, states received indirect guidance on TCM expenditure claiming from GAO and Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS/OIG) reports that were critical of state and CMS practices on TCM, as well congressional testimony presented by CMS officials. Moreover, in 2004, Maryland's state plan amendment to provide TCM services to children in the state's foster care program was denied, and an administrative appeal upheld that decision. The denial of Maryland's SPA for foster care TCM provided states additional unofficial information but, as found by GAO, contributed to ambiguity on TCM because other states were allowed to continue similar practices. For example, GAO reviewed a sample of Massachusetts and Georgia TCM claims and found a number of claims where TCM services billed to Medicaid were integral parts of other programs, such as foster care. Nevertheless, TCM expenditures continued to increase, raising questions about whether some states were delivering direct medical and social services to beneficiaries through other social services programs (e.g., child welfare, foster care, juvenile justice, special education) and classifying those expenditures as Medicaid TCM. Subsequent HHS/OIG audits found state practices for TCM claiming inconsistent with current CMS policy, federal, or state laws, and/or Medicaid rules. Moreover, Bush administration officials testified that state practices for claiming TCM and other Medicaid services were abusive and violated the federal-state Medicaid partnership by inappropriately shifting costs for other federal programs to Medicaid and claiming services directly delivered by other federal programs as TCM.", "In 2005, Congress passed DRA, which contained Section 6052, \"Reforms of the Case Management and Targeted Case Management.\" Sec. 6052 refined the case management definition by adding new language that narrowed what services could be considered case management. The DRA case management provision identified case management services, such as assessment, development of care plans, referral and related activities, and monitoring and follow up of beneficiaries, and elaborated on the overall content of these services. The DRA also reiterated that case management, including TCM, excluded the direct delivery of underlying medical, educational, social, and other services. The DRA also specifically explained that federal matching payments would not be permitted to assist non-eligible individuals, including those individuals ineligible for a TCM target group. The DRA also reiterated that Medicaid third-party rules applied to case management, so payments for TCM would be permitted only if no other third parties are available to pay. DRA Section 6052 also specifically noted that states should cost-allocate when costs for case management services were shared between another federally funded program in accordance with OMB circular A-87.

The interim final rule permits states to receive FFP to assist individuals who are able to transition from an institution to a community setting. This provision would enable states to claim FFP to assist individuals in transitioning to community settings during either the last 14 days (for beneficiaries institutionalized for short-term stays) or the last 60 days (for beneficiaries who were institutionalized for long-term stays). However, for states to receive FFP for beneficiaries transitioning to the community, the beneficiary must receive the TCM services for terms that span their inpatient and community placement.

To ensure beneficiaries have a unified planning process, as well as to reduce fragmentation and maintain quality of care, states would need to assign each beneficiary only one case manager. However, case managers may not serve as gatekeepers or make medical necessity determinations. Further, beneficiaries must have free choice of all qualified case managers, and beneficiaries' access to case management can not be contingent upon use of certain providers. If beneficiaries might fit in several target groups, states must decide which target group to assign beneficiaries.

The interim rule indicates that case management is an implicit part of managed care and capitation, and additional FFP for such case management of medical services under managed care would be considered duplicate payment.

Specific guidance and definitions, CMS contends, were needed to avoid further \"excessive\" federal outlays. CMS points out that the proposed rule clarifies when Medicaid will, and will not, pay for case management services. CMS further claims the proposed rule will reduce past confusion about the overlap between Medicaid TCM and non-Medicaid programs. Moreover, CMS cites GAO studies, OIG audits, and review of SPAs that document past abuses of Medicaid TCM claiming.", "Advocates for children and adult Medicaid beneficiaries who receive TCM services contend that the rule is more restrictive than what Congress intended in DRA. Advocates also fear that reduced federal Medicaid funding for TCM will need to come from other programs or services that do not have funding, resulting in cuts to TCM services. States cite administrative complexities of the rule that will increase state costs while decreasing provider participation and beneficiaries' quality of care. Further, states and advocates also believe that the complexity of the rule will make it difficult for states to implement within the specified time frame.", "Child welfare advocates and organizations representing mentally retarded and developmentally disabled individuals, many of whom need Medicaid TCM, believe that the interim final rule will cut TCM services for these beneficiaries. Child welfare advocates argue that by requiring Medicaid to reimburse providers based on 15-minute billing segments, costs of care would increase and provider participation would decrease. They also argue that new requirements for record keeping and claims processing will discourage provider participation and reduce actual beneficiary services. Advocates claim that states already cannot afford to fund enough TCM services and that with more restrictions, states will be forced to cut services further. According to advocates, with less TCM available, children receiving foster care and protective services will get fewer health care services, causing their existing medical and related conditions to deteriorate. Moreover, they argue, without TCM, these beneficiaries will ultimately require more costly health care treatment in the future.", "Some Medicaid and other state officials believe that the CMS case management rule will increase costs by creating additional administrative activities. For example, Medicaid agencies have raised objections to the additional reporting requirements and other administrative complexities contained in the interim final rule because they believe these rules will make it harder for them to provide TCM to beneficiaries. Medicaid agencies claim that new delayed billing requirements for providers who assist TCM beneficiaries in transitioning from institutions are burdensome and may reduce patient access to TCM services.", "As noted earlier, the interim final rule proposes to permit states up to two years to comply with the one-provider provision for case management. The additional time for states to comply suggests that CMS recognizes the complexity for states to adapt their systems and administratively comply with the proposed rules. In the same vein, state Medicaid agencies believe that the effective date of the interim final rule is inadequate to permit states sufficient time to comply with the regulations, so that states' FFP for case management will be withdrawn suddenly or recovered later under auditors' disallowances. Observers maintain that an extension of time for states to comply might help to moderate stakeholder concerns, while giving states the opportunity to provide an orderly transition and realistically comply with the regulations that have been under development for some time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative and Other Proposals", "paragraphs": ["In January 2008, legislation was introduced ( H.R. 5173 and S. 2578 ) that would impose a moratorium on changes to Medicaid case management services until April 1, 2009.
