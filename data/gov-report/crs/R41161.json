Some analysts argued for keeping NSF's MSI programs as separate programs, noting that MSIs serve different populations with different needs. However, keeping the programs separate might result in less availability of funds for HSIs because NSF has not established, and Congress has not specifically appropriated funds for, a separate HSI program at the Foundation.
