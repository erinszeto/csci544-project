Part D participants may choose to have their premiums deducted from their Social Security checks.", "Medicare premiums are absorbing a growing share of Social Security benefits. To see the effect of growing premiums, consider a Social Security beneficiary who earned the average wage throughout his or her career.

For a new retiree in 2010, the Part B premium absorbs about 9% of the Social Security benefit, and combined premiums for both Part B and Part D absorb about 12% of the average initial Social Security benefit check. Medicare's trustees project that premiums for Parts B and D will grow at a faster rate than average Social Security benefits in the future, thus consuming a greater proportion of benefits over time. In 2078, a retired worker receiving the average initial Social Security benefit amount is projected to need 22% of benefits to pay the Part B premium and 31% of initial benefits to pay combined Parts B and D premiums.", "The deduction of Medicare premiums affects beneficiaries differently, depending on their Social Security benefit amounts and total incomes. Medicare premiums absorb a greater fraction of lower earners' Social Security benefits than of higher earners' benefits, because although benefit amounts are progressive, low earners tend to have lower dollar amounts of benefits.
