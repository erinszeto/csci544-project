The agency submits a budget as a part of the President's formal budget request each year, and then Congress, through the appropriations process, decides how much funding to provide to the agency. Funding for HUD is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies subcommittees of the House and the Senate appropriations committees.", "Regular appropriations for HUD (not including emergency supplemental funding) have increased by 57% in the nine years prior to FY2011. This increase in the HUD budget has been partly attributable to increased funding for HUD programs, particularly the Section 8 programs, which have had a 70% increase in funding over this period and have grown to account for well over half of HUD's total budget. The increase in funding has also resulted from a decrease in the amount of rescissions, collections, and receipts available to offset the cost of the HUD budget.", "For FY2011, the President's budget requested about $45.57 billion in net new budget authority for HUD, a decrease of about 1% from the FY2010 enacted level. However, the requested decrease in net new budget authority would actually include a 3% increase in appropriations for HUD programs in aggregate. The overall increase in appropriations requested would be more than offset by a substantial increase in offsetting collections and receipts, which are estimated to come from proposed changes to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance programs. The two Section 8 rental assistance programs were requested to receive the largest increases, followed by increases for programs for the homeless and for HUD's research and technology needs. The President's budget proposed decreased funding for other programs, such as programs providing housing for persons who are elderly or disabled and capital repairs in public housing, and the brownfields redevelopment program would no longer be funded.", "The House Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2011 HUD funding bill on July 26, 2010 (H.R. 5850, 111th Congress), and it passed the full House on July 29, 2010. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved its version (S. 3644, 111th Congress) on July 23, 2010. The House-passed version would have provided $46.55 billion for HUD in FY2011 and the Senate committee-reported version would have provided $46.59 billion, about $1 billion more than the President's request.", "When no appropriations legislation was enacted before the beginning of FY2011, the 111th Congress enacted a series of continuing resolutions (CR) to continue funding at the FY2010 level for most accounts in the federal budget, including all of the accounts in HUD's budget. The last CR of the 111th Congress extended funding into the 112th Congress. On February 18, 2011, the House approved H.R. 1, a year-long CR which would have resulted in an overall reduction in funding for HUD. H.R. 1 was rejected by the Senate on March 9, 2011. The 112th Congress approved three short-term CRs before enacting a final year-long CR that was signed into law (P.L. 112-10) on April 15, 2011. The final FY2011 appropriations law cut funding for HUD, relative to FY2010, but not as deeply as proposed in H.R. 1.

These include several programs of rental assistance for persons who are poor, elderly, and/or have disabilities. Three rental assistance programs\u2014Public Housing, Section 8 Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance\u2014account for the majority of the department's non-emergency funding (almost 73% in FY2010).

HUD's Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages made by lenders to lower-income home buyers, many of whom have below-average credit records, and to developers of multifamily rental buildings containing relatively affordable units. FHA collects fees from insured borrowers, which are used to sustain the insurance fund and offset its administrative costs. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset the cost of the HUD budget.", "In recent years, the HUD budget has also received significant amounts of emergency supplemental funding. Almost $20 billion was provided through HUD's budget for recovery assistance to communities affected by Hurricane Katrina and the other hurricanes of 2005.

And, as demonstrated by the line in Figure 1 , the rate of growth has increased in recent years. In FY2004 and FY2005, year-over-year growth was relatively flat (under 2%), but since then, HUD's budget has had year-over-year increases of 5% or more each year, with growth of nearly 10% in FY2009 and nearly 12% in FY2010.", "Adjusting for inflation, the growth in \"real\" funding (shown by the gray bars in Figure 1 ) has been less robust. Over the nine-year period, adjusting for inflation, HUD's budget grew by about 17%. Through FY2008, the year-over-year growth never exceeded about 3.5%, and in two years there were declines. Most of the growth over the previous nine years has come in the last two years.", "As shown in Figure 2 , HUD's funding is made up of several components. The components of HUD's annual funding, or budget authority, include regular annual appropriations, emergency appropriations, rescissions, and offsets.", "HUD's programs and activities are funded almost entirely through regular annual appropriations , also referred to as discretionary appropriations. The amount provided in the annual appropriations acts each year generally determines how much funding will be obligated and eventually spent for each of HUD's programs and activities.", "In some years, Congress will also provide emergency appropriations , usually in response to disasters, through one or more of HUD's programs. These funds are generally provided outside of the regular appropriations acts\u2014often in emergency supplemental spending bills\u2014and are generally provided in addition to regular annual appropriations.", "Congressional appropriators are generally subject to limits on the amount of new non-emergency discretionary funding they can provide in a year. One way to stay within these limits is to provide less in regular annual appropriations. Another way is to find offsets. A portion of the cost of HUD's regular annual appropriations acts is generally offset in two ways. The first is through rescissions , or cancellations of unobligated or recaptured balances from previous years' funding. The second is through offsetting receipts and collections , generally derived from fees paid by HUD partners or clients.", "The interaction between new appropriations and offsets provided through rescissions, receipts, and collections determines HUD's total net budget authority. Net budget authority is also the \"cost\" of the HUD budget, as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office in its scorekeeping process. The total amount of net budget authority provided to HUD each year, while important for federal budgeting purposes, is not necessarily the best measure of the amount of funding that is being provided for HUD's programs and activities. Because of the role of offsets, declining or increasing net budget authority did not necessarily mean declining or increasing regular appropriations.", "As shown by the line in Figure 2 , which repeats the data shown by the line in Figure 1 , net non-emergency budget authority for HUD increased 57% between FY2002 and FY2010, from over $29 billion to over $46 billion. However, the overall increase in net new non-emergency budget authority masks several important trends.", "The 57% increase in net non-emergency budget authority is not fully attributable to increased appropriations for HUD programs. From FY2002 to FY2010, regular annual appropriations, which is the amount provided by Congress to fund HUD's programs and activities, grew by only 37% (shown by the dark green bars in Figure 2 ). During the same period, the amount available in offsetting receipts and collections and the amount rescinded, which Congress uses to reduce the cost of providing new appropriations, declined by more than 70% and 96%, respectively (shown by the dark and light red bars in Figure 2 ). As a result, part of the increase in net non-emergency budget authority from FY2002-FY2010 is attributable to decreases in the amount available in offsetting receipts and collections and the amount of rescissions taken.", "The 37% growth in regular appropriations during this period (shown by the dark green bars in Figure 2 ) is largely attributable to growth in HUD's Section 8 voucher and project-based rental assistance programs, which, combined, are the largest component of the HUD budget. As can be seen in Figure 3 , from FY2002 to FY2010, appropriations for the combined Section 8 programs grew by over 70%, while aggregate funding for all other HUD programs and activities grew by only 8%. During this period, the Section 8 programs went from accounting for about 46% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2002 to accounting for about 57% of HUD's regular appropriations in FY2010. As can be seen in the chart, for a number of years, Section 8 funding grew while aggregate funding for all other HUD programs declined. However, in FY2009 and FY2010, funding for other HUD programs began to grow as well.", "The more than 70% decline in offsetting receipts shown in Figure 2 is largely attributable to declines in offsetting receipts available from the FHA mortgage insurance programs.

Those eligible borrowers then pay both upfront and monthly fees for the cost of the insurance. The provision of FHA insurance helps to make mortgage credit more widely available, and at a lower cost, than it might be in the absence of the insurance. The FHA home loan insurance programs are administered primarily through two program accounts in the HUD budget: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance/Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund account (MMI/CMHI) and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund account (GI/SRI).", "The Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Fund is the largest of the FHA insurance funds, and when there is public discussion of \"FHA insurance\" or \"FHA loans,\" the discussion is usually related to the MMI fund and the single-family home loans insured under that fund. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ) also moved the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, FHA's reverse mortgage program, into the MMI Fund. This movement has resulted in the establishment of two risk categories in the MMI Fund: the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category and the MMI HECM risk category. The GI/SRI Fund provides insurance for more-risky home mortgages, for multifamily rental housing, and for an assortment of special-purpose loans such as hospitals and nursing homes.", "The issues discussed in this section apply to the single-family loans insured under the MMI Fund.

For the MMI fund, the cash inflows are mainly the insurance premiums paid by borrowers, and the cash outflows are mainly the payments to lenders for the cost of loan defaults.", "The net value of these cash flows is expressed as a percentage of the volume of insured loans and is referred to as the subsidy rate. If the cash inflows exceed the cash outflows, the subsidy rate is expressed as a negative number because net income from business type activities is shown in the budget as negative outlays. If the cash outflows exceed the cash inflows, the subsidy rate is expressed as a positive number. When the subsidy rate is applied to the expected loan volume in a given year, the result is the amount of credit subsidy that a federal credit program needs over the life of the loans. The budget rules require an appropriation of this credit subsidy in the budget year that the loans are originated. However, actual cash flows over the life of the loans are likely to differ from those projected in the first year. Therefore, agencies are required to periodically revise the initial subsidy estimates to include actual experience on the loans.", "Historically, the MMI Fund has had a negative subsidy rate, which means that it generated negative credit subsidy that could be used to offset the funding needs of other programs in the HUD budget. (A negative credit subsidy means that the MMI Fund makes money for the government.) In other words, the MMI Fund has generally made more money in fees than it has paid out in claims, and therefore it has not historically needed an appropriation from Congress in order to operate, although it does traditionally receive a congressional appropriation for administrative expenses.", "As described earlier, the MMI Fund is now divided into the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category and the MMI HECM risk category. The Administration estimated that the Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund would have a negative subsidy rate of -2.59% for FY2011, which is above the negative subsidy rate of -0.62% that was estimated for FY2010. The Administration further estimated that this means the Purchase and Refinance risk category of the MMI Fund would generate about $5.8 billion in negative credit subsidy in FY2011. Negative credit subsidy results in the availability of offsetting receipts. The estimated increase in negative credit subsidy would result partly from a series of FHA reforms that have been proposed by HUD (see \" Proposed FHA Reforms \" later in this report). ", "The Congressional Budget Office, in its re-estimate of the President's budget, estimated that the MMI Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate a smaller negative credit subsidy than the Administration projected. CBO projected that FHA's Purchase and Refinance risk category would generate around $1.9 billion in negative credit subsidy. This included $960 million without FHA's proposed changes, and an additional $902 million with HUD-proposed program reforms. Although these projections were lower than the Administration's, CBO still projected that this category of the MMI Fund would make more money than it loses in the upcoming year, and therefore would not require a positive credit subsidy in FY2011. The differences between the offsetting receipts in the President's FY2011 budget request and CBO's re-estimate are shown in Table 3 .", "Given that the full-year FY2011 appropriations law ( P.L. 112-10 ) was not enacted until April 2011, FHA's estimates of FY2011 negative credit subsidy had been revised upward by the time the appropriations law was enacted. This was largely due to an increase in the annual premium that FHA charges that went into effect in April 2011, described later in this section. In the President's FY2012 budget request, FHA indicated that this change in the annual premium would result in a -3.92% subsidy rate for the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund's Purchase and Refinance risk category for the remainder of FY2011, or a weighted average of -3.25% for FY2011 as a whole. Consequently, FHA's estimates of offsetting receipts for the Purchase and Refinance risk category in FY2011 increased to nearly $10 billion by the time the FY2012 budget was released, from an estimate of $5.8 billion when the FY2011 budget was released.

For FY2011, HUD proposed to increase the HECM borrowers' annual insurance premiums from the current 0.5% of the loan balance to 1.25% of the loan balance. HUD also planned to adjust the formula that determines the size of the initial loan that a HECM borrower may obtain.

Given that the average credit score on FHA-insured loans has been in the 690s in recent months, compared to the 650s in late 2007, FHA believes that the newer mortgages it is insuring are of a better credit quality than past mortgages. However, the default rate on past FHA-insured loans is still rising, and this puts some strain on the MMI Fund.", "In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-508 ), Congress mandated that within 10 years after enactment, the MMI Fund must have a capital reserve ratio of at least 2%, and that it must maintain that ratio at all times going forward. The capital reserve ratio is a measure of the resources that FHA has on hand to cover unexpected losses, after accounting for expected losses based on its current book of business. During FY2009, the capital reserve ratio was estimated to be 0.53%. This was the first time since the requirement was put into effect that the capital reserve ratio had fallen below 2%.", "In response to concerns over the financial stability of the MMI Fund, FHA has announced a number of proposed changes to its single-family mortgage insurance programs. FHA can implement some of these changes administratively, while others will require congressional action. FHA has proposed or implemented the following changes:", "Increasing the annual mortgage insurance premium. Congress sets a statutory cap on the annual mortgage insurance premium that FHA can charge. P.L. 111-229 , signed by the President on August 11, 2010, sets the maximum annual insurance premium amounts at 1.5% for borrowers with downpayments greater than 5%, and 1.55% for borrowers with downpayments of 5% or less. At the time this law was enacted, FHA had been charging the maximum annual insurance premium allowed by law. After P.L. 111-229 was enacted, FHA increased the annual mortgage insurance premiums it charged to 0.9% of the loan balance if the loan-to-value ratio was 95% or higher, and 0.85% of the loan balance if the loan-to-value ratio was below 95%, beginning on October 4, 2010. Beginning on April 18, 2011, FHA raised the annual insurance premiums again, to 1.15% of the loan balance if the downpayment is 5% or less, and to 1.10% of the loan balance if the downpayment is greater than 5%. Increasing the upfront mortgage insurance premium. Congress also sets a statutory cap on the upfront premium that FHA can charge. The statutory cap is currently 3%. FHA raised the upfront premium it charged to 2.25% for loans endorsed on or after April 5, 2010, because it had the flexibility to do so without reaching the statutory cap but could not raise the annual insurance premium at that time (because it was already charging the maximum annual insurance premium allowed by law). However, after P.L. 111-229 was enacted, raising the maximum annual premium that FHA could charge, FHA raised the annual mortgage insurance premium (as described above) and lowered the upfront mortgage insurance premium to 1% for loans endorsed on or after October 1, 2010. Changing downpayment and minimum credit score requirements . FHA proposes to require borrowers with credit scores between 500 and 579 to provide a downpayment of at least 10%.

The President's budget requested that the funding be allocated using a formula similar to that in use in FY2010 (based on prior year costs and utilization, plus inflation), but also that the Secretary be given the authority to reduce allocations to those PHAs with unspent reserve funding and to reallocate funding to PHAs with lower reserves. This would allow PHAs with little or no reserves to receive an increase in funding over those agencies with high reserves, potentially allowing them to increase their utilization and serve additional families. To facilitate additional increases in leasing, the President's budget also requested that Congress lift the ban on \"over-leasing,\" which has been in place since FY2004. A PHA over-leases when it uses excess funding to fund additional vouchers above the number of vouchers it has been allocated by HUD.
