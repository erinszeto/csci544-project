Applicants develop and submit proposals to the Global Fund Secretariat that include output, outcome and impact indicators, and targets defined by the countries themselves. If the proposal is approved, these form the basis for measuring the performance of a grant. 2. Grant negotiation. Upon approval, the Global Fund negotiates the terms of grant agreements, legally binding contracts that clearly indicate time-bound targets to measure the performance of the grants. At this stage, monitoring and evaluation systems are also assessed. The Global Fund recommends that 5%-10% of grant budgets are used for monitoring and evaluation. 3. Performance-based disbursements. Over the course of a grant's life cycle, the Principal Recipient reports regularly to the Global Fund on results, expenditures, and any deviations from or corrective actions to program activities. The Local Fund Agent, an independent contractor based in the country, verifies the Principal Recipient's programmatic and financial reports and makes recommendations to the Global Fund on the amount to be disbursed for the next period of implementation. The Secretariat evaluates the overall performance of the grant, assigns a rating, and decides on the next disbursement amount. Lack of progress triggers a request by the Secretariat for corrective action and may also result in reduced disbursements. 4. Grant renewal. Toward the end of Phase 1 (first two years of implementation), the Global Fund evaluates each grant to ensure that funding is managed and spent efficiently and programs are achieving expected results. At this point, the Fund decides whether to continue funding grants, reduce funding, direct investments in systems strengthening, or stop funding altogether.

In FY2012, a slightly larger share of global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria resources went toward the Global Fund. Should Congress meet the President's request, the Fund will become an even greater share of U.S. global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria spending in FY2013.", "Debate about supporting the Global Fund has often focused on HIV/AIDS. Nonetheless, some global health experts urge Congress to consider the impact of the Global Fund on the other two diseases. The Global Fund estimates that by the end of 2010, it had committed some $12 billion to HIV/AIDS programs, less than half of U.S. spending levels on related bilateral projects during the same time period. The Fund outspent the United States during this time, however, on global TB and malaria projects. The Global Fund committed over three times as much funding to TB and malaria activities than the United States.", "The Global Fund estimates that the $3.6 billion that it committed to TB programs accounted for 65% of all donor spending in 2009, far exceeding the $1.1 billion in U.S. bilateral spending. Advocates assert that U.S. support for the Global Fund enables the United States to invest in TB programs, an area in which the United States has a relatively limited presence. Proponents of greater spending on TB point to the dire impact of HIV/TB co-infection, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which has complicated efforts to control the spread of tuberculosis and accelerated the rate at which people die from either disease. ", "Supporters for a diversified U.S. global health portfolio also point to the role that the Global Fund plays in eliminating malaria. According to the Fund, it has committed roughly $6.1 billion to malaria programs since its inauguration, accounting for some 65% of total donor spending through the end of 2009. Since the launch of the President's Malaria Initiative, U.S. investments in global malaria programs has increased substantially, though U.S. spending on malaria from FY2001 through FY2010 amounted to about one-third as much as Global Fund commitments. ", "Congress may also consider potential advantages of the Global Fund over U.S. bilateral health programs. Some experts argue that the Fund's grant process allows for greater country ownership of programs, more flexibility in tailoring programs to specific country priorities, and supports interventions that are better integrated with existing national and civil society activities. These experts argue that these attributes may make these programs more sustainable in the future and less dependent on U.S. assistance.

In its Five-Year Strategy report, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) emphasized its partnership with the Global Fund and outlined several steps to ensure the Fund's long-term sustainability, including transferring some PEPFAR programs to the Global Fund and coordinating and aligning activities related to the funding, monitoring, and evaluation of PEPFAR, Global Fund, and UNAIDS programs.

Though the United States is not party to the platform, OGAC has expressed limited support for the undertaking. Despite OGAC's support for increased coordination among donors of health system strengthening efforts, it also contended that each donor has a unique mandate and role to play in strengthening health systems.

Specifically, the Fund has uploaded onto its website an abundance of information on grant proposals and budgets, grant spending trends, and results of board meetings, which include decisions regarding the suspension of grants. Fund advocates also argue that the Fund's decisions to suspend temporarily and, in some cases, discontinue poor performing grants demonstrate the effectiveness of the Fund's oversight and funding mechanisms.", "Some in Congress have long advocated for stronger oversight of Global Fund spending. Supporters of this idea have welcomed language included in FY2006 and FY2008 foreign operations appropriations measures, which required the Secretary of State to withhold up to 20% of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund until she determined the Fund had adhered to U.S. reporting and monitoring standards. In FY2009, the withholding was reduced to 10%. Beginning in the FY2010 foreign operations appropriations, the Lantos-Hyde Act ( P.L. 110-293 ), which authorized the extension of PEPFAR programs and funding for U.S. bilateral TB and malaria programs, required the Secretary of State to withhold 20% of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund until she certified that the Fund had met requirements pertaining to the Local Fund Agent (LFA) performance, a policy of transparency, an independent Office of the Inspector General, and several other policy and procedural provisions.

To date, the U.S. government has not withheld funds on the basis of any of the above provisions.

The Department of State would be required to certify to Congress that the reforms were in place before funds could be released. 2. Withhold all funding to UNDP until it certifies that its internal rules and procedures have been sufficiently modified to allow the Inspector General of the Global Fund, the Inspector General of the World Bank, and any investigative arm of any multilateral organization to which the United States contributes funds full access to their audits, investigations, records, and personnel. 3. Withhold U.S. contributions from the Global Fund to the UNDP until the United States receives confirmation of such certification. 4. Instruct the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study regarding the coordination of the Office of Inspectors General (or equivalent offices) of all U.S. government entities and multilateral organizations receiving U.S. taxpayer funds that oversee the integrity of global health programs. 5. Have the U.S. Representative to the Global Fund reiterate in the strongest terms to the board of the Global Fund that the United States has no tolerance for fraud and abuse and that the Office of the Inspector General needs to acquire adequate resources and personnel to audit and investigate programs on the ground. 6. Have the Global Fund take any steps necessary to ensure that Local Fund Agents and CCMs are capable of managing grants and are properly trained on how to spot and mitigate suspected fraudulent activities. 7. Have the U.S. government conduct a top-to-bottom analysis of U.S. investment and contributions to international organizations and funds, similar to that conducted by Britain. On March 1, 2011, the United Kingdom Department for International Development issued a Multilateral Review, which evaluated the 43 international funds and organizations that the United Kingdom contributes with respect to value for the money and each fund's and organization's effectiveness in combating poverty, taking in account transparency and accountability. 8. Have the U.S. government work more closely with host governments on establishing or increasing the country's commitment to making its own investments in health programs. When possible, the countries must demonstrate some commitment in moving toward sustainability and cease complete reliance on the donor community for the indefinite future.", "Since the release of this report, the Global Fund has announced several plans to increase transparency, monitoring, and evaluation of its programs, particularly through the Consolidated Transformation Plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["To date, the Global Fund has approved funding for over 1,000 projects in 150 countries. Through its treatment, prevention, and care efforts, the Fund estimates that it has saved approximately 7.7 million lives. Despite these achievements, observers raise several issues that could influence U.S. support for the Fund:", "The appropriate balance between U.S. support for the Global Fund and bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs \u2014Since the Global Fund was created, some have weighed U.S. contributions to the Global Fund against U.S. spending on bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator rejects this notion and presents the Global Fund as a complement to U.S. bilateral programs. Nonetheless, the 112 th Congress will likely debate the distribution of U.S. support between the Global Fund and related bilateral programs, especially PEPFAR. The President's FY2013 budget request may contribute to this debate, as it proposes decreased funding for bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs while proposing increased funding for the Global Fund. Some experts argue that this reflects the relative efficient and flexible nature of multilateral programs. Others argue that increasing funding for the Fund while decreasing funding for bilateral programs undercuts the success of more predictable and sustainable U.S. programs. How to coordinate Global Fund and bilateral HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs \u2014When President Obama announced GHI, he expressed his intent to reshape U.S. global health policy so that global health efforts were better integrated and coordinated. Despite references throughout the GHI Implementation Plan to stronger collaboration with the Global Fund, the extent to which such an effort will occur is not yet clear. While several official U.S. documents support calls from the Global Fund to enhance donor coordination, the United States has expressed limited support for a joint funding platform for health systems strengthening. U.S. officials maintain each donor has a unique mandate and role to play. Growing emphasis on improving health systems \u2014Despite calls by the Global Fund for more financial support, the team of experts who conducted a five-year evaluation of the Fund warned that recipient countries might not be able to continue receiving assistance at current scale without significant investments in health systems. The Global Fund and other donors have increased spending on improving global health systems, nonetheless challenges in this area persist. One of the goals of the Global Health Initiative is to improve health systems through several strategies, such as addressing health system bottlenecks, strengthening data collection systems, improving human resources for health, and donor coordination. Several global health experts recommend that the Global Fund and other donors support national health plans and address the major gaps in basic health service availability and readiness as part of HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria efforts. Whether Global Fund resources should be used in middle - income countries \u2014Several observers question the use of Global Fund resources in middle-income countries. In 2010, 11 countries were considered both donors and recipients: China, India, Malaysia, Namibia, Nigeria, Romania, Rwanda, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and Tunisia. China has received the most attention from all of these countries, due to both the substantial amount of grants it has received from the Fund and the rapid growth of its economy. The Global Fund awards grants to lower middle-income countries, but expects them to contribute up to program costs. For example, as a middle-income country with a per capita income of $3,650 China is eligible for Global Fund grants and pays roughly 80% of total program costs. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's minority report recommends that as China becomes an upper middle-income country, it should no longer receive Global Fund resources. In May 2011, the Global Fund approved a new Eligibility, Counterpart Financing and Prioritization Policy that limits how much funding middle-income countries could receive through the Fund and requires all countries to contribute to national disease and health strategies and demonstrate increased funding for these activities annually. At the November 2011 board meeting, the Global Fund also implemented a policy whereby G-20 upper middle-income countries will no longer be eligible for grant renewals unless they have an extreme disease burden, as defined by the Fund. The Fund's responses to allegations of corruption \u2014The Global Fund's announcement that funds from some its grants were misspent has opened a rigorous debate in the foreign aid community. Some observers applauded the Global Fund for its transparency and encouraged others to release similar information, arguing that the Global Fund is not alone in facing these problems. Advocates also note efforts by the Fund to reform its fiduciary practices and reduce corruption. On the other hand, some have called for governments to withhold support for the Global Fund until adequate safeguards are established. The Global Fund's release of information on misused funds by its grant recipients raises several questions. If the Global Fund is penalized for being honest in its shortcomings, will others hesitate to do so? When allegations of corruption and malfeasance are discovered, what is the appropriate response? What impact might reduced funding have on those relying on aid programs for life-saving treatments? "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
