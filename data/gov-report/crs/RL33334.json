Producers are interested in the application of biotechnology to improve productivity, consistency, and quality; to introduce new food, fiber, and medical products; and to protect the environment. Potential human health applications of transgenic animals include producing biopharmaceuticals and generating organs, tissues, and cells for xenotransplantation. Criticisms of such applications involve issues ranging from food safety and social resistance to potential negative impacts on animal welfare and on ecosystems. Questions also have arisen about the adequacy of the current regulatory structure to assess and manage any risks created by these technologies.", "On January 15, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released final guidance on how it is to regulate GE animals and products. Consistent with the Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology, FDA will do so under its existing statutory authority and regulations. Generally, GE-derived foods, for example, will be regulated like non-GE foods; if their composition does not differ from their conventional counterparts, they will not have to be labeled. Nonetheless, developers of GE animals and of GE-derived products must gain FDA pre-market approval.", "On February 6, 2009, FDA announced the first approval of a drug from a GE animal. The drug is a human anti-clotting agent produced in the milk of transgenic goats. FDA is also currently considering approval of the first genetically modified animal for human consumption, having declared in August 2010 that a GE salmon\u2014AquaAdvantage Salmon\u2014is safe to eat and poses no threat to the environment. FDA is considering environmental and labeling issues, and has not issued a final decision on the commercialization of the GE salmon. In letters from both houses, 40 Members have asked the FDA Commissioner to halt the approval process for the GE salmon, citing serious concerns with FDA's review and approval process. The congressional letters have been endorsed by over 50 consumer and environmental groups.", "Although animal biotechnology involves many techniques other than cloning, this latter technology has attracted widespread attention. A final risk assessment and industry guidance on the safety of meat and milk from cloned cattle, pigs, and goats and their offspring were released January 15, 2008, by FDA. The documents generally echoed FDA's December 28, 2006, draft risk assessment, which found that such products are as safe to eat as those of conventionally bred animals. FDA also concluded that cloning poses the same risks to animal health as those found in animals created through other assisted reproductive technologies\u2014although the frequency of such problems is higher in cloning. (Scientists stress that cloning is an assisted reproduction technique that does not involve any transfer or alteration of genes through GE.) The agency said it was no longer asking industry to refrain voluntarily from marketing the products of cloned animals and their offspring, although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) did ask that it be continued for products from clones (but not from the offspring of clones).", "Bills on animal cloning introduced in the 110th and 111th Congresses would have required all food from cloned animals or their offspring to be labeled, and prohibited food from cloned animals from being labeled as organic. The bills have not been reintroduced in the 112th Congress. A bill that would amend the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prevent the approval of genetically engineered fish (H.R. 521/S. 230) was introduced in the 112th Congress."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released two recent documents that renewed public and congressional interest in animal biotechnology in general and animal cloning in particular. On January 15, 2009, the agency released final guidance representing its current thinking on the regulation of genetically engineered (GE) animals for food or drugs. FDA did so under its existing statutory authority and regulations. A year earlier, on January 15, 2008, FDA had unveiled its final risk assessment and industry guidance on the safety of milk and meat from cloned animals and their offspring. FDA found that, generally, meat and milk products from cattle, pigs, and goats are as safe as products from their non-cloned counterparts.", "Still, some in the United States remain concerned about the safety and other impacts of GE animals and of animal cloning, and they continue to advocate a cautious approach to commercialization of such products. Outside of the United States, animal biotechnology, including both GE and cloning, is the focus of ongoing regulatory, policy and scientific discussions within the European Union (EU) as well as within the international organization for animal health, known by its French acronym, the OIE. (Cloning by itself is not considered to be genetic engineering; see discussion later in this report.)", "Biotechnology is a broadly defined term of relatively recent origin describing the range of modern knowledge, applications, and techniques underlying advances in many fields, notably health care and agriculture. Animal biotechnology has been defined as \"that set of techniques by which living creatures are modified for the benefit of humans and other animals.\" By its very nature, agricultural development is the history of humans modifying plants and animals to maximize desirable traits. For example, domestication and selective breeding of animals date back many thousands of years. Artificial insemination of livestock, notably dairy cattle, is a more recent technology, first finding wide commercial acceptance in the 1950s.", "Discovery of the genetic code in the 1950s gave birth to modern techniques of biotechnology. One of the first commercial products of this new biotechnology in animal agriculture was bovine somatotropin (bST), a naturally occurring metabolic modifier that is now being manufactured in larger quantities through the use of recombinant DNA technology. Manufactured bST came onto the market in 1994 and is now administered to as many as half of all U.S. dairy cattle to increase per-cow milk output. Although bST is being used commercially in approximately 20 countries, it is banned in the European Union (EU).", "The first U.S. approval of a commercial product from a GE animal is for the drug ATryn, an anticoagulant agent being produced in the milk of transgenic goats. FDA announced its approval on February 6, 2009. The goats were genetically engineered by introducing a segment of DNA into their genes that coded for the goat to produce human antithrombin in its milk. Antithrombin is a naturally occurring protein in healthy humans that helps keep blood from clotting in blood vessels.", "Other developments include pigs that have been engineered for increased sow milk output to produce faster-growing piglets. Chinese researchers announced in April 2011 that they had produced a herd of dairy cattle whose milk contains human breast milk proteins (lysozyme, lactoferrin, and alpha-lactalbumin). The researchers used cloning technology to introduce human genes into the DNA of Holstein dairy cows before the genetically modified embryos were implanted into surrogate cows. Cloned cattle also have been developed to resist mastitis, an infectious disease of the udder.", "A genetically engineered salmon\u2014AquAdvantage salmon\u2014with enhanced growth characteristics is currently under review by FDA for commercialization. If approved, it would be the first GE animal approved for human consumption. The company that developed the salmon, AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., has artificially combined growth hormone genes from an unrelated Pacific salmon with DNA from the anti-freeze genes of an eelpout. This modification causes production of growth hormone year-round, creating a fish the company claims grows at twice the normal rate.", "Output traits such as drugs recovered from animal milk (\"pharming\"), milk that lacks allergenic proteins, and animal organs for human transplant (xenotransplantation) that resist rejection are other contemporary objectives of animal biotechnology research. In March 2006, researchers at the University of Missouri announced the creation of transgenic pigs whose tissue contains omega-3 fatty acids. The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, found primarily in fish, has been linked to lowered incidence of heart disease in humans. Similar research is also under way to produce omega-3 fatty acids in cow's milk and in chicken eggs.", "This report describes several scientifically emerging animal biotechnologies that are raising a variety of questions concerning risks to humans, animals, and the environment, as well as ethical concerns. The report examines applications of the technologies and discusses major issues that may arise. Consumers, agricultural producers, the biotechnology industry, and federal regulatory bodies are debating the relative costs and benefits of these technologies. As technologies move toward commercialization, Congress is being asked to examine these issues and possibly to refine the current federal regulatory structure governing the technologies and their agricultural products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Animal Biotechnologies", "paragraphs": ["Given the breadth of the term \"animal biotechnology,\" one might reasonably define it to include thousands of years of humans selectively breeding animals: observing desirable animal traits and attempting to breed those traits into successive lines of animals. One of the first modern forms of assisted reproductive technology (ART) was artificial insemination (AI). AI has been long established as a technological advance in traditional selective breeding and an important adjunct to the development of modern industrial animal production, especially in dairy and poultry. AI was adopted by producers and accepted by the public with virtually no controversy. For example, more than 70% of all U.S.-bred Holstein cows, by far the most widely used milk producers, are artificially inseminated. Estrus synchronization, which improves the efficiency of AI by more accurately controlling when a female is in heat, is also an important animal biotechnology.", "With the development in the 1970s and patenting in the 1980s of recombinant DNA techniques, and the subsequent analysis of genes, their resulting proteins, and the role played by the proteins in animal biochemical processes (functional genomics), modern biotechnology is increasingly equipped with a set of sophisticated tools holding the promise of transforming the selective breeding of animals. The range of new techniques and technologies could transform animal biotechnology in ways that plant biotechnology was transformed in the 1980s and 1990s.", "Modern animal biotechnology is developing against the background of public experience with plant biotechnology, and controversy over the technologies may be a continuing feature of animal biotechnology development, not least because of the closer connection between humans and some animals and the belief that techniques developed for animals are only a step away from application to humans. Some of the better known animal biotechnologies follow. A number of them are types of assisted reproductive technology (ART)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Embryo Transfer", "paragraphs": ["After AI and estrus synchronization, embryo transfer (ET) is the third-most commonly used animal biotechnology technique. In ET, a donor cow of superior breeding is chemically induced to superovulate. The eggs are then fertilized within the donor, the embryo develops and is then removed and implanted in a recipient cow. Between removal and implantation, embryos may be frozen for safekeeping. Because of the relatively high costs, ET is used mostly within registered cowherds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transgenics", "paragraphs": ["A prominent area of contemporary animal biotechnology research is the development of transgenic animals through genetic engineering (GE) technology. Transgenic animals are produced by introducing an isolated DNA fragment into an embryo so that the resulting animal will express a desired trait. Transgenic animals may be generated by the introduction of foreign DNA obtained through animals of the same species, animals of different species, microbes, humans, cells, and in vitro nucleic acid synthesis. The only currently routine use of transgenic animals, primarily mice, is in the area of human disease research. The anti-clotting agent in goat milk is the first such application to be approved by FDA (March 2009). As noted above, a herd of GE dairy cattle has been created that produces human breast milk proteins in the cow's milk. That innovation could be 10 years or more away from any commercialization efforts. Potential agricultural applications from genetically engineering animals could include improved feed use and faster growth; more resistance to disease; meat that is leaner or that has more of some other desirable quality; and possibly even animal waste that is more environmentally benign.

It also refers to a form of reproduction found naturally in many single-celled organisms, as well as plants and animals.

FDA has stated that most\u2014although probably not all\u2014gene-based modifications of animals for production or therapeutic claims fall within the purview of the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), which regulates them under the FFDCA as new animal drugs. A new animal drug (NAD) must be approved by the agency after it is demonstrated to be safe to man and animals, as well as being effective. Regulation of transgenic animals as NADs, however, suggests to some observers (e.g., the Center for Food Safety, Union of Concerned Scientists) the inherent weakness of existing regulatory structures to respond adequately to the complexities that arise with animal biotechnology innovations. The NAD review process is at the center of concern over FDA's potential approval of GE salmon for commercialization.", "Primarily under the FFDCA, FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) is responsible for assuring that domestic and imported foods are safe and properly labeled. Generally, FDA does not review new foods themselves for safety before they enter commerce but does have enforcement authority to act if it finds foods that are adulterated under the act. All food additives , whether or not introduced through biotechnology, must receive FDA safety approval before they can be sold; the exception to pre-market approval are those on a list FDA has determined to be \"generally recognized as safe\" (GRAS).

This final document hews closely (with a few modifications) to the draft version that FDA published on September 18, 2008. The final document asserts that FDA's authority to regulate GE animals comes under the new animal drug provisions of the FFDCA. A drug is defined by the act, in part, as \"intended to affect the structure or any function in the body of man or other animals.\" Also, part of the FFDCA definition of \"new animal drug\" is one intended for use in animals that is not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed or recommended, and that has not been used to a material extent or for a material time.", "\"The rDNA construct in a GE animal that is intended to affect the structure or function of the body of the GE animal, regardless of the intended use of products that may be produced by the GE animal, meets the FFDCA drug definition,\" the guidance states (on page 5). A new animal drug is considered \"unsafe\" unless FDA has approved an application for that particular use, or it is for investigational use and subject to an exemption from the drug approval requirement (among a few other specified exemptions). Therefore, most developers will have to submit to the \"Investigational New Animal Drug\" (INAD) process at FDA prior to shipping any GE animals or to marketing any food or feed derived from GE animals. In other words, it is illegal to introduce food from a GE animal into the food supply that has not been approved by FDA. The guidance lays out the pre-market approval process including the information to be required of developers.", "Under the guidance, FDA will examine both the direct toxicity (including allergenicity) potential of food from a GE animal as well as any indirect toxicity. Generally, food and feed will be considered safe if the composition of edible materials from the GE animal can be shown to be as safe as from a non-GE animal. The labeling requirements for GE-derived foods would be the same as for other foods: FDA has oversight over the labeling of seafood, dairy products, and whole shell eggs, and USDA over the labeling of most meat, poultry, and egg products (see below).

The GE salmon also contains a growth hormone from the Chinook salmon. FDA also announced at the same time that it would hold a public comment period and a hearing on labeling for the transgenic salmon. While the agency has stated that the salmon poses no threats to human health, FDA officials are undecided as to whether they would require any product labeling. Environmental issues associated with potential escape of the GE salmon into the wild are also being considered.", "The GE salmon would be the first genetically engineered animal approved for human consumption and commercial-level farming. FDA scientists stated in a briefing document that the GE salmon is safe for human consumption and poses no risk to the environment. On September 19 and 20, 2010, FDA held a Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee (VMAC) meeting on science-based issues surrounding the application for approval of the GE salmon. The meetings were open to the public. Committee members heard from FDA about GE animals generally and the agency's evaluation and approval process.

FDA is also moving through the environmental review process as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. While there is no timeline for making a decision, the VMAC will advise officials whether to approve the salmon and make recommendations regarding the need to label the fish, although FDA has indicated that it would not require labeling. FDA's position is that labeling should not suggest that GE foods are different from other foods.

This means that much of the supporting data AquaBounty supplies to FDA is confidential. A coalition of 31 organizations and restaurant chefs is demanding that FDA deny approval. Various environmental organizations are concerned that the GE salmon could escape from fish farms and threaten the wild salmon population. AquaBounty, however, says it would encourage producers to grow the GE Atlantic salmon only at in-land fish farms.", "Congressional Members have raised concerns about FDA's approval process. In a September 29, 2010, letter, 39 Members of both the House and the Senate requested that FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg halt the approval process. The letter stated that the Members had \"serious concerns\" regarding the process for review and approval of the GE salmon. In particular, the letter stated that the FDA process was \"inadequate\" and \"sets a dangerous precedent: the environmental review is flawed and the consumer's right to know ignored.\" In addition to concerns about the adequacy of the data supporting the safety for human consumption of the GE salmon, Members also expressed their concerns that the GE fish could pose serious risks to the wild population of fish, such as Atlantic, Coho, and Chinook salmon. Although the company intends to raise the fish at an egg hatchery facility on Prince Edward Island, Canada, and the GE salmon would be sterile, Members expressed their concern that the GE fish could pose threats to the remaining wild Atlantic salmon. AquaBounty acknowledged that 5% of the fish could remain fertile and could potentially mate with wild populations.

This moratorium was announced in July 2001 and remained in effect until the final guidance was released in January 2008. Although the FDA moratorium is no longer in effect, USDA has since been encouraging technology providers to maintain the voluntary moratorium, but for products from cloned animals only. Food products from cloned animals' offspring would not be similarly constrained. During a continuation of this moratorium, USDA said it would \"work closely with stakeholders to ensure a smooth and seamless transition into the marketplace for these products.\"", "Officials emphasized that, at least initially, almost all cloning-related foods will come not from the clones themselves but rather from their sexually reproduced offspring. Cloned animals\u2014like other \"elite\" breeding animals such as a prized bull\u2014are too valuable to use for food production, except possibly when they reach the end of their productive lives. FDA observed that it can cost $20,000 or more to produce one such animal.", "One ongoing question has been whether, in fact, milk and meat from the offspring of clones are entering the food supply. Several press accounts have quoted farmers and others who say they have sold such offspring to be slaughtered for food, and that the total number nationwide may be in the hundreds or even thousands. On the other hand, those numbers would amount to a small fraction of the total number of U.S. livestock slaughtered (e.g., 34 million cattle and 109 million hogs in 2007).", "FDA's January 2008 risk assessment did conclude that some animals involved in cloning (notably cattle and sheep surrogate dams) and some clones are at greater health risk than conventional animals. While the types of animal health problems observed in cloned animals are no different than those found with other assisted reproductive technologies, these problems appear more frequently in cloning than in the other technologies. Such problems include late gestational complications in the surrogate mothers, and increased risk of mortality and morbidity in calf and lamb clones that are apparently caused mainly by large offspring syndrome (LOS). Swine and goat clones and their mothers do not appear to experience any additional cloning-related problems, FDA reported.", "FDA found that livestock clones as a group tend to have more health problems and death rates at or right after birth.

According to EFSA, \"Based on current knowledge, and considering the fact that the primary DNA sequence is unchanged in clones, there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety between food products from healthy cattle and pig clones and their progeny, compared with those from healthy conventionally-bred animals.\" As with FDA, the EFSA conclusion is based on an examination of compositional and nutritional data, the probability for the presence of novel constituents, the health status of the animal, and available data on toxicity, allergenicity, and microbiology.", "EFSA agreed that SCNT can be a successful reproductive technique, although death and disease rates of clones are significantly higher than those of conventionally reproduced animals.

However, at an initial discussion of the issue in early January 2009, EC commissioners indicated that there was time to consider a science-based risk assessment before deciding whether or not to ban cloning.", "In April 2009, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) called for the EU to introduce a ban on the marketing of meat and milk from cloned animals. The EC wanted meat and milk from cloned animals to be included under \"novel foods.\" A ban could be difficult to impose because an EFSA Opinion does not find a food safety risk in the meat or milk of cloned animals.

These consumer and animal welfare groups contend that FDA has ignored or minimized a number of food safety and animal welfare problems. These include the treatment of surrogate mothers with high doses of hormones and their clone offspring, who often have severely compromised immune systems, with large doses of antibiotics, which could enter the human food supply; imbalances in clones' hormone, protein, or fat levels that could compromise meat and milk safety and quality; the possibility of increased foodborne illnesses; and a wide variety of health problems and abnormalities in the animals themselves.

Forty-three percent of Americans believed that foods from clones are unsafe, the survey found. Cloning opponents cite these types of findings to argue that products from cloned animals should be labeled so that consumers could avoid them if they wanted to. Some critics have urged the President to halt all FDA actions on cloning until a national panel that includes ethicists and religious leaders can consider the ethical and other social issues that they believe the technology has raised.

FDA guidance permits such labeling so long as it is not misleading, is presented in the proper context, and is adequately substantiated. For example, a firm cannot state that its product is \"BST-free\" because the substance occurs naturally in milk, or even simply that it is \"rBST-free\" because that could imply a compositional difference between naturally occurring and rBST, which there is not, FDA has ruled.
