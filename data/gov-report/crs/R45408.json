Federal assistance takes the form of federally purchased commodities\u2014including fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains\u2014and funding for administrative costs. Food aid and funds are distributed to states using a statutory formula that takes into account poverty and unemployment rates. TEFAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS).", "TEFAP was established as the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program by the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983. The Emergency Food Assistance Act continues to govern program operations, while the Food and Nutrition Act provides mandatory funding authority for TEFAP commodities. Based on levels set in statute, appropriations provided $289.5 million in mandatory funding for TEFAP's \"entitlement\" commodities in FY2018. TEFAP also incorporates \"bonus\" commodities, which are distributed at USDA's discretion throughout the year to support different crops using separate budget authority. USDA purchased $268.6 million worth of bonus commodities for TEFAP in FY2017. A smaller amount of cash assistance ($64.4 million in FY2018) is appropriated to cover administrative and distribution costs under Emergency Food Assistance Act authority. These administrative funds are discretionary.", "USDA-FNS coordinates the purchasing of commodities and the allocation of commodities and administrative funds to states, and provides general program oversight. State agencies\u2014often state departments of health and human services, agriculture, or education\u2014determine program eligibility rules and allocations of aid to feeding organizations (called \"recipient agencies\"). States often task food banks, which operate regional warehouses, with distributing foods to other recipient agencies. TEFAP aid makes up a modest proportion of the food and funds available to emergency feeding organizations, which are reliant on private donations as well.", "TEFAP is the largest source of federal support for emergency feeding organizations. Other related food distribution programs focus on specific subpopulations; for example, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Emergency Food and Shelter Program distributes food to homeless individuals and USDA's Commodity Supplemental Food Program distributes food to low-income elderly individuals.", "TEFAP is typically amended and reauthorized through farm bills. Most recently, the 2014 farm bill (P.L. 113-79) extended and provided additional funding for TEFAP's entitlement commodities. Current 2018 farm bill proposals (two versions of H.R. 2) would reauthorize and continue additional funding for entitlement commodities (as of the date of this report). They also include different approaches to incorporating non-federally donated foods and reducing food waste. Recent program developments include TEFAP's use in disaster response and receipt of commodities from the 2018 trade aid package."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP; previously the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program) provides federally purchased commodities and a smaller amount of cash support to food banks, food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and other types of emergency feeding organizations serving low-income households and individuals. Commodities include fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains, among other foods. In addition to serving needy individuals, TEFAP's domestic commodity purchases support the agricultural economy by reducing supply on the market, thereby increasing food prices. TEFAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service (USDA-FNS).", "TEFAP was established under the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 in an effort to dispose of government-held agricultural surpluses and alleviate hunger in the wake of a recession and declining food stamp benefits. Since then, TEFAP has evolved into a permanent program with mandatory, annually appropriated funding that operates in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. territories. The program was most recently reauthorized by the 2014 farm bill ( P.L. 113-79 ) and has been included in farm bill reauthorization efforts in the 115 th Congress. ", "At the federal level, TEFAP is administered by USDA-FNS in collaboration with USDA's purchasing agencies, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC). At the state level, TEFAP is administered by a \"state distributing agency\" designated by the governor or state legislature: generally the state department of health and human services, agriculture, or education. Federal commodities and funds may flow through the state or directly to feeding organizations (called \"recipient agencies\") based on how the state agency structures the program. States will often task food banks with processing and distributing food to local feeding organizations. Food banks typically operate regional warehouses and distribute food to other organizations rather than to households directly. Figure 1 depicts the flow of commodities and funds through TEFAP. ", "TEFAP is part of a larger web of food assistance programs. Some of these programs provide cash assistance while others primarily distribute food. TEFAP foods may reach individuals who do not qualify for other food assistance programs or supplement the assistance that individuals receive through other programs. With nearly $354 million in appropriated funding in FY2018, TEFAP is the largest source of federal support for emergency feeding organizations. Other related federal programs include the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) Emergency Food and Shelter Program, funded at $120 million in FY2018, which, among its other services for homeless individuals, provides food through shelters, food banks, and food pantries. In addition, USDA's Commodity Supplemental Food Program, funded at $238 million in FY2018, distributes monthly food packages to low-income elderly individuals through local organizations, which can include food banks and pantries.", "This report begins by describing the population using emergency food assistance. It goes on to discuss the TEFAP program, including its administration at the federal, state, and local levels, eligibility rules, and funding structure. The report concludes by summarizing TEFAP's role in disaster response and recent reauthorization efforts. Appendix A lists TEFAP expenditures from the program's inception in 1983 to present; Appendix B provides a brief legislative history of TEFAP; and Appendix C lists TEFAP funding by state.

However, this is likely an underestimate of the population using emergency food assistance because the sample did not include certain households over 185% of poverty and the CPS does not fully capture households who are homeless or in tenuous housing arrangements. For comparison, a survey by Feeding America, a nonprofit membership and advocacy organization, estimated that approximately 15.5 million households accessed its network of feeding organizations in 2013 (the same year, ERS estimated that 6.9 million households used food pantries and soup kitchens). The Feeding America network represents a large segment of emergency feeding organizations nationwide.

Roughly half of these households experienced very low food security, meaning that the food intake of some household members was reduced and normal eating patterns were disrupted due to limited resources. Nationally, the percentage of households experiencing food insecurity was 11.8% in 2017, down from a recent high of 14.9% in 2011.", "According to the ERS analysis, households using food pantries were more likely to have incomes below 185% of poverty compared to the general population (70% vs. 21%) and to include children (39% vs. 30%). Meanwhile, according to the 2014 Feeding America survey, individuals using meal programs (e.g., soup kitchens and shelters) were generally single-person households and were more likely to be homeless. In 2013, just over 70% of households using the Feeding America network of meal programs had a single member and nearly 34% were homeless or living in temporary housing. ", "In addition, emergency feeding organizations may act as a safety net for food insecure households who are ineligible for or do not participate in other federal food assistance programs. For example, in the case of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), households may have an income too high to qualify for assistance but still experience difficulty purchasing food, or they may fail to meet other program eligibility rules. Among households using feeding organizations affiliated with Feeding America's network, a little more than half (55%) reported receiving SNAP benefits in 2013.

Establishment of TEFAP occurred in the aftermath of noticeable reductions in the coverage of and benefits provided by federal food assistance programs (e.g., food stamps, school meal programs) legislated in 1981 and 1982, and in the midst of an economic recession and concern over hunger and homelessness.", "The Reagan Administration began distribution of excess federally held food commodities in 1981-1982. These commodities, often termed \"bonus\" commodities, were in excess of those needed to fulfill other domestic and international federal commitments to provide food commodities (e.g., to schools operating school meal programs). In 1983, Congress followed up with legislative authority that created what was known for more than a decade as the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), as well as funding for grants to help with distribution costs. Establishment of TEFAP helped reduce federal commodity stocks (and storage costs associated with holding them), provided an alternative source of food assistance for low-income individuals, and supported an expanding network of emergency food aid providers that also drew food and other resources from many nongovernmental sources.", "In TEFAP's early years, the only significant federal expenditures involved were appropriations for the grants supporting providers' distribution costs; the bonus commodities that were provided were acquired under separate USDA programs to support the agricultural economy. However, when commodity holdings began to drop substantially in the late 1980s because of changes in agricultural policies and the economy, Congress established the practice of providing federal funds to buy food commodities specifically for donation through TEFAP (in addition to continuing support for cash grants for distribution costs).", "1988-1990. In 1988, after the Administration indicated plans to phase out TEFAP because of the lack of commodity inventories, Congress mandated funding (starting at $120 million for FY1989) in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 to buy commodities for distribution through TEFAP, thereby \"entitling\" the program to a minimum level of support regardless of the level of federal commodity holdings. The law also created a separate mandatory program to buy commodities for soup kitchens and other organizations not receiving TEFAP commodities (mandating funding starting at $40 million for FY1989). While some soup kitchens and other entities could receive federal food donations through a small separate initiative to help charitable organizations and others could participate as local TEFAP providers, the separate program was established out of a concern that most commodities for emergency feeding were going to local agencies that distributed food packages directly to individuals and families (e.g., food pantries), rather than to shelters, soup kitchens, and other providers serving meals in congregate settings. ", "Two years later, the 1990 omnibus farm bill made commodity and cash-grant funding authority for TEFAP and the soup kitchen program \"discretionary\"\u2014that is, expenditures on commodities and distribution-cost grants were made dependent on annual appropriations decisions, not \"mandated\" by the authorizing law entitling the program to a specific minimum funding level.", "1990s. Although the authorizing law for TEFAP, the Emergency Food Assistance Act (EFA) of 1983, has been amended a number of times and the word \"Temporary\" has been dropped from the program's official title, perhaps the most significant changes since 1988 were made in 1996. The 1996 farm bill ( P.L. 104-127 ) extended the discretionary authority to appropriate money for commodities and distribution-cost grants for TEFAP and soup kitchen programs through FY2002. But, more significantly, the subsequent 1996 welfare reform law (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act; P.L. 104-193 ) changed how these federal efforts are structured and funded. ", "The welfare reform law (1) consolidated TEFAP and the soup kitchen program in one statute (the EFA) so that states could get a single TEFAP grant of commodities and distribution-cost funds for all types of emergency feeding organizations and (2) mandated funding of $100 million a year (through FY2002) to purchase food commodities for the program. This was in addition to any commodities that might be bought with money appropriated under discretionary authority in the EFA and any bonus commodities that might be made available at USDA's discretion. This second change was intended to entitle the program to a minimum level of commodity support when regularly appropriated money is not made available to buy commodities or excess federal commodity holdings for TEFAP distribution are minimal or nonexistent. It was accomplished through an amendment to the Food Stamp Act (now, the Food and Nutrition Act) effectively setting aside $100 million a year in \"entitlement\" appropriations under the act to purchase TEFAP commodities. ", "As a result, the majority of funding for TEFAP (i.e., for commodity purchases) typically is now made available under the aegis of the Food and Nutrition Act appropriation unless Congress chooses to appropriate additional money for commodities under authority provided in the EFA. The minority of funding\u2014funds for administrative and distribution costs\u2014is appropriated under the authority of the EFA.", "Appendix C. TEFAP Funding by State"], "subsections": []}]}}
