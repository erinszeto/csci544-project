For example, Congress provided roughly $120 billion for the 2005 and 2008 Gulf Coast hurricane seasons and $50 billion for Hurricane Sandy recovery. Congressional interest in disaster assistance has always been high given the associated costs.", "Additional issues associated with disaster assistance have been contentious. These issues include", "increasing disagreements over the appropriate role of the federal government in providing assistance including whether some of the federal burden for disaster assistance should be shifted to states and localities, the appropriate use of supplemental appropriations to pay for disaster relief, reducing federal costs by eliminating unrelated spending in disaster funding bills, creating alternative funding methods such as a rainy-day fund or a contingency fund, the use of offsets for disaster assistance, altering policies that would limit the number of declarations issued each year, and converting some or all disaster assistance to disaster loans.", "This report provides summary information on supplemental appropriations legislation enacted since FY2000 after significant large-scale disasters. It includes funds appropriated to various departments and agencies. The funds cited in this report were provided by Congress in response to major disasters declared under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and include appropriations and loan authority for disaster relief, repair of federal facilities, and hazard mitigation activities directed at reducing the impact of future disasters. Disaster assistance provided for agricultural disasters, counterterrorism, law enforcement, and national security appropriations are generally authorized by an authority separate from the Stafford Act and are not included in this report. Unless otherwise noted, this report does not take into account rescissions or transfers after Congress appropriated the funds for disaster assistance. As demonstrated in Table 2, since FY2000, Congress has appropriated roughly $265 billion to various federal agencies to help states and localities recover from various large-scale disasters, repair federal facilities, and pay for hazard mitigation projects.", "In addition to the summary information on supplemental appropriations, this report also examines the influence the Budget Control Act has on disaster assistance. Additionally, this report frames the debate policymakers have had over the years concerning supplemental disaster assistance. Some argue that the current method of relying primarily on supplemental appropriations to fund disaster response and recovery to large scale events is functioning well and should not be changed. Others argue that the federal government should increase the amount of funding provided to states, tribal governments, and localities for major disasters. Still others argue that policy options that reduce federal costs for major disasters or reduce the number of supplemental appropriations needed (or both) should be pursued.", "This report concludes with policy questions that may help frame future discussions concerning supplemental funding for disaster assistance.

Federal assistance is contingent on whether the President issues an emergency or major disaster declaration. Once the declaration has been issued, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides disaster relief through its Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Funds from the DRF are used to pay for ongoing recovery projects from disasters occurring in previous fiscal years, meet current emergency requirements, and as a reserve to pay for future incidents. In addition, FEMA often uses what are known as \"Mission Assignments\" to task and reimburse other federal entities that provide direct assistance during emergencies and major disasters.", "The DRF is funded annually and is a \"no-year\" account, meaning that unused funds from the previous fiscal year (if available) are carried over to the next fiscal year. In general, when the balance of the DRF becomes low, Congress has provided additional funding through both annual and supplemental appropriations to replenish the account.", "When a catastrophic incident threatens to deplete the DRF, the President typically submits a request to Congress for a supplemental appropriation (see Table 1 ). Historically, FEMA is the second-largest recipient of supplemental appropriations. In addition to the funds provided to the DRF to reimburse Mission Assignments, Congress often provides direct funding to various agencies such as the Small Business Administration (SBA), or the Department of Agriculture (USDA) for disaster assistance. This is particularly true for supplemental appropriations for large-scale incidents such as Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. It is useful to note that a low DRF balance is not necessarily needed to spur congressional efforts to provide additional assistance.", "As previously mentioned, most supplemental appropriations originate with a request from the Administration for additional funds. However, Congress has initiated supplemental appropriations without a formal request from the Administration. For example, in 2007, Congress provided additional assistance for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ( P.L. 110-28 ). In 2008, Congress added DRF supplemental funding ( P.L. 110-329 ) to the FY2009 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill on its own initiative, in response to the Midwest Flooding and Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. While there were no formal requests from the Administration for additional funds, the amount of funding for the supplemental appropriation was based on estimates provided to Congress by FEMA and other federal entities that were involved in response and recovery efforts.", "Supplemental appropriations often have an \"emergency designation.\" Congress uses emergency designations to exempt a provision in legislation from the budgetary effects of certain enforcement procedures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Disaster Spending Under the Budget Control Act", "paragraphs": ["As a result of the concern over the size of the federal deficit and debt, Congress has implemented measures to limit federal spending. For example, the Budget Control Act ( P.L. 112-25 , hereinafter the BCA), includes measures to limit spending. The BCA placed caps on discretionary spending for the next ten years, beginning with FY2012. If these caps are exceeded, an automatic rescission\u2014known as sequestration\u2014takes place across most discretionary budget accounts to reduce the effective level of spending to the level of the cap. ", "The BCA, however, includes special accommodations to address the unpredictable nature of disaster assistance. First, it redefined \"disaster relief\" as being federal government assistance provided pursuant to a major disaster declared under the Stafford Act, rather than assistance provided through the DRF. Second, funding designated as disaster relief would now be \"paid for\" by adjusting upward the discretionary spending caps (also referred to as an allowable adjustment). ", "The allowable adjustment for disaster relief is limited, however, to an amount based on the 10-year rolling average (excluding the highest and lowest years) of what has been spent by the federal government on relief for major disasters. The BCA requires OMB to annually calculate the adjusted 10-year rolling average of disaster relief spending that sets the allowable cap adjustment for disaster relief. These calculations are included in the final sequestration report and sequestration update report issued under Section 254 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 as amended (BBEDCA).", "In recent years, Congress has provided more funding for the DRF through annual appropriations than in the past. Many policy experts believe that the BCA's cap adjustments have led Congress to rely more on annual appropriations to fund disaster assistance than in the past. The influence of the BCA on disaster assistance is discussed further in-depth in \" The Debate over the Use of Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Assistance \" section of this report.", "It is worth noting that the cap is calculated in nominal dollars and does not adjust for inflation.

Unless otherwise noted, this report does not take into account rescissions approved by Congress after funds have been appropriated for disaster assistance.", "As reflected in Table 1 , supplemental appropriations have generally been enacted as stand-alone legislation. In some instances, however, disaster assistance funding has been enacted as part of regular appropriations measures, continuing appropriations acts (continuing resolutions), or as a part of omnibus appropriations legislation. Also, while the need for additional funds has historically been tied to a single, large-scale major disaster such as Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy, in recent years the need for assistance has increasingly been caused by a string of incidents. For example, legislation passed in FY2010 and FY2012 provided disaster relief for several incidents rather than a single, large scale disaster.", "Supplemental appropriations for disaster relief provide funding to a wide array of federal agencies depending on the unique needs of each disaster. In general, agencies, such as FEMA or the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), are consistently included in supplemental appropriations for disaster relief.

One of the largest funding components in P.L. 110-329 was designated for the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Community Development Fund, which received $6.5 billion specifically for disaster relief, long-term recovery, and economic revitalization for areas affected by the 2008 disasters.

In six of those years, Congress passed more than one supplemental appropriation (in addition to regular appropriations) to meet disaster needs. ", "The allowable adjustment provision in the BCA may have reduced the need for supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance by encouraging larger annual appropriations for the DRF. In the past, the Administration's budget request for the DRF was based, in part, on a five-year rolling average of disaster spending. It appears that t he 10-year rolling average used to calculate the allowable adjustment is now being used to formulate the Administration's budget request for the DRF. ", "The 10-year calculation may help generate a more accurate (and higher) estimate for disaster costs than the previous budgeting model. As shown in Table 3 , there were no supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance in FY2011; one was provided in FY2012 and one in FY2013. This may be an indication that fewer supplemental appropriations are needed. However, because the BCA was passed fairly recently, it may be too early to determine whether and to what extent the BCA has influenced the need for supplemental appropriations. ", "Arguments against relying on supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance include", "supplemental appropriations for disasters often are designated as an emergency expenditure, which under congressional budgetary procedures can exceed discretionary spending limits\u2014creating an opportunity for lawmakers to circumvent budgetary enforcement mechanisms by purposefully underfunding disaster assistance through annual appropriations to make room for other spending; supplemental appropriations for disasters often move through Congress on an expedited basis, limiting the amount of time available to assess actual disaster needs and scrutinize spending to ensure that the spending is appropriately targeted and that adequate safeguards are in place to address the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse. In addition, supplemental appropriations for disasters may result in unnecessarily high funding levels, as early damage estimates may overstate actual needs; and supplemental appropriations for disasters provide a vehicle for spending or other provisions in the legislation unrelated to the incident that may not pass on their own if they were not attached to disaster legislation. Conversely, the unrelated provision may make the appropriation legislation contentious, thus slowing down the delivery of federal disaster assistance.", "Arguments in favor of the use of supplemental disaster assistance include", "the timing and severity of disasters cannot be anticipated and appropriating a relatively large sum of funds through annual appropriations may require Congress to reduce funding for other programs to pay for an unknown, and possibly non-existent, future event; the President is authorized to unilaterally determine when federal assistance is made available after a major disaster incident. Congress retains authority to control federal spending by voting on supplemental appropriations. In essence, the use of supplemental appropriations for disasters enables Congress to express its own preferences in disaster assistance; large DRF balances may be subject to a transfer or rescission to meet other needs, which may have negative consequences if a large disaster were to take place after the funds have been withdrawn. For example, if a large scale disaster were to happen after the transfer, another transfer or supplemental appropriation might be needed to address disaster needs; and supplemental appropriations for disasters can be sized according to the needs of the actual incident."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals to Restructure Disaster Assistance Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Those who oppose relying on supplemental appropriations to fund disaster assistance often suggest the following policy alternatives to reduce the need for supplemental appropriations for disaster assistance.

In recent years, the debate over the use of offsets for disaster relief or assistance has intensified due to the growing size of the federal budget deficit and national debt. ", "There have been legislative attempts to offset the costs of disaster assistance. For example, Title VI of the House-reported version of H.R. 2017 , the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2012, would have provided $1 billion of additional funding to the DRF by transferring resources from the Department of Energy.

The offset would have been achieved by an across-the-board rescission of 1.63% to all discretionary appropriations for FY2013. The amendment was not adopted.", "Proponents of offsets argue that they provide a mechanism to control spending and offset the costs of disaster assistance. Opponents argue that offsets politicize disaster assistance because the program selected for the offset may have been selected because it is politically unpopular rather than being based on a sound policy basis. They also argue that the debate over the use of offsets may unnecessarily slow the delivery of needed assistance. ", "One potential argument against the sole reliance on offsets to limit federal spending on disaster assistance is that it fails to address the significant amount of funding that would be needed to fully offset a very large-scale disaster. The Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 and 2008 and Hurricane Sandy cost the federal government $120 billion and $50.3 billion respectively.

The term \"marginal incidents\" refers to incidents that could arguably be handled by the state without federal aid. They argue that the amount of funding the federal government provides for disaster assistance could be reduced by reforming the declaration process to limit the number of declarations; adjusting the federal share for assistance; converting some, or all federal disaster assistance into a loan program; or shifting some of the responsibility for paying for recovery to the state and/or the private sector.", "Others argue that providing relief to disaster victims is an essential role of the federal government. In their view, while the concern over costs is understandable given the potential impact of disaster assistance on the national budget, the number of declarations being issued each year and their associated costs are justified given the immediate and long-term needs created by incidents. They argue that providing assistance to disaster-stricken areas is needed to help a state and region's economy recover from an incident that it otherwise may not be able to recover from on its own.

Also, the current system uses a per capita amount in estimated eligible disaster costs to determine that level when federal disaster assistance can be provided.
