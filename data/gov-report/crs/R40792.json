This followed House and Senate agreement to the conference report.

Excluding the new tobacco program, to provide a comparison of similar program responsibilities, FY2010 appropriations are 14.1% higher than FY2009 appropriations. Congress intends the increase to go toward enhanced food safety and medical product safety activities as well as cost-of-living personnel expenses.", "Neither the signed legislation nor any of the House- and Senate-considered bills include $141 million in proposed user fees that the Administration included in its request. The proposed fees were intended for generic drug review, food export certification, reinspection, and food inspection and facility registration.", "The versions of H.R. 2997 passed by the House and the Senate agreed on the appropriations to FDA.
