The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA; P.L. 116-127 ), as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L. 116-136 ), requires most private health insurance plans to cover COVID-19 testing, administration of the test, and related items and services, as defined by the acts. This coverage must be provided without consumer cost sharing. COVID-19 Treatment . There are no federal requirements that specifically require coverage of COVID-19 treatment. However, the existing federal requirement that certain plans cover a set of 10 categories of essential health benefits (EHB) is potentially relevant to coverage of COVID-19 treatment items and services, depending on state and plan variation with regard to implementation of this requirement. Even where treatment items and services are required to be covered as EHB, cost sharing could apply. COVID-19 Vaccine . As of the date of this report, there is no vaccine against COVID-19 approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States, although several candidates are in development. The CARES Act requires most plans to cover a COVID-19 vaccine, when available, without cost sharing, if it is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

Employers and other group health plan sponsors may purchase coverage from an insurer in the small- and large-group markets (i.e., they may fully insure ).

In general, private health insurance cost sharing includes deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Are plans allowed to impose prior authorization or other medical management requirements? For example, some insurers require that they (the insurer) provide prior authorization for routine hospital inpatient care, and/or require that primary care physicians provide approval or referrals for specialty care, as a condition for covering the care. Does the coverage requirement depend on how or where the service or item is furnished (e.g., by an in-network versus out-of-network provider)? Under private insurance, benefit coverage and consumer cost sharing is often contingent upon whether the service or item is furnished by a provider that the insurer has contracted with (i.e., whether that provider is in network for a given plan). In instances where a contract between an insurer and provider does not exist, the provider is considered out of network . When does the coverage requirement go into effect?
