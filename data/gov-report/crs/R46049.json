Hazardous space weather events are rare, but may affect broad areas of the globe.

The program was directed by the NSWP Council that included representatives from interested federal agencies. The NWSP Council coordinated federal space weather strategy development between 1995 and 2015 in partnership with federal agencies, industry, and the academic community.

For example, E.O. 13865 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to \"incorporate events that include EMPs as a factor in preparedness scenarios and exercises,\" without specifying whether a space weather event or nuclear attack scenario should be exercised, or which should be prioritized. The fact that E.O. 13865 does not formally supersede E.O. 13744 (which refers solely to space weather) may create further ambiguity in cases where policies of the previous and current Administrations are not in direct alignment, or else reflect differing priorities.
