The statute, which served as a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws, greatly expanded civil rights protections in a wide variety of settings. Among other provisions:", "Title VII of the CRA prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. In addition, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which was enacted in 1978 as an amendment to the sex discrimination provisions of Title VII, made it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Title VII applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including the federal government and state and local governments. Individuals who believe they are the victims of employment discrimination must file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which is responsible for enforcing individual Title VII claims against private employers. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces Title VII against state and local governments, but may do so only after the EEOC has conducted an initial investigation. Title VI of the CRA prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs or activities on the basis of race, color, or national origin. Individuals who believe they are victims of discrimination may file a complaint with the federal agency that provides funds to a recipient, or they may file a lawsuit in federal court. Each federal agency is responsible for enforcing Title VI compliance with respect to its funding recipients, but DOJ plays a role in coordinating federal Title VI activities. Title II of the CRA prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin in public accommodations. Public accommodations, which are defined as establishments that serve the public and that have a connection to interstate commerce, include hotels and motels, restaurants and bars, and entertainment venues such as movie theaters or sports arenas.

Designed to provide private remedies to individuals deprived of their civil rights, these statutes were written in general terms that have been interpreted broadly to protect individuals from a wide range of discriminatory conduct. The relevant provisions, as codified, include 42 U.S.C. Sections 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985.", "42 U.S.C. Section 1981 provides, in part, that all persons shall have the same right to \"make and enforce contracts\" as is enjoyed by white citizens. As a result, Section 1981's coverage extends to prohibit discrimination in a wide range of public and private contractual relationships, including the provision of services and the sale of goods. Indeed, since employment relationships are based on contracts, Section 1981 has been interpreted to prohibit intentional discrimination on the basis of race, color, or citizenship by private employers. Because Section 1981 refers to \"white citizens,\" however, the provision does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, or national origin, unless a claim based on national origin or religion has a racial component. Under 42 U.S.C. Section 1982, \"[a]ll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\" Like Section 1981, Section 1982 prohibits intentional discrimination in both the public and private sectors, but unlike Section 1981, the coverage of Section 1982 is limited to discrimination on the basis of race and applies only to transactions involving real or personal property. 42 U.S.C. Section 1983, which provides a remedy for deprivation of rights under color of state law, creates no new substantive rights but rather provides relief where state law is inadequate. Thus, individuals who sue under Section 1983 must find a source of rights elsewhere. As a result, Section 1983 is most typically used to enforce constitutional rights, such as the right to equal protection. In general, Section 1983 suits alleging unlawful discrimination are limited to intentional claims of discrimination involving public, not private, actors and may apply to a discrimination based on a wide variety of factors, such as race, sex, religion, or citizenship. Like Section 1983, 42 U.S.C. Section 1985, which provides a remedy in cases involving conspiracy to interfere with civil rights, creates no new independent rights. Instead, Section 1985 is designed to give the injured party an opportunity to recover damages against the conspirators. Although Section 1985 may apply to private acts of discrimination, it is not clear whether it covers discrimination based on factors other than race."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
