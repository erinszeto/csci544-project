The legal framework for such assistance emerged soon after World War II, when Congress charged the Secretary of State with responsibility for overseeing and providing general direction for military and other security assistance programs and the Secretary of Defense with responsibility for administering such programs. Over the years, congressional directives and executive actions have modified, shaped, and refined State Department and DOD roles and responsibilities. Changes in the legal framework through which security assistance to foreign forces\u2014weapons, training, lethal and nonlethal military assistance, and military education and training\u2014is provided have responded to a wide array of factors.", "Legal Authorization and Funding", "For most of the past half-century, Congress has authorized U.S. security assistance programs through Title 22 of the U.S. Code (Foreign Relations) and appropriated the bulk of security assistance funds through State Department accounts. DOD administers programs funded through several of these accounts under the Secretary of State's direction and oversight. Beginning in the 1980s, however, and increasingly after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 (9/11), some policymakers have come to view the State Department authorities, or the funding allocated to them, as insufficient and too inflexible to respond to evolving and emerging security threats.", "As a result, Congress has increasingly provided DOD with the means to offer security assistance under authorities in either Title 10 of the U.S. Code (Armed Services) or the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), both funded as part of the DOD budget. (These are collectively known as \"Title 10\" authorities and referred to by DOD as \"security cooperation.\")", "DOD security assistance and other security cooperation programs conducted under Title 10 authority and established prior to 9/11 include counternarcotics, counter-proliferation, humanitarian assistance, and assistance for training and equipping NATO forces. Title 10 statutes also provide authority for DOD to pay the expenses of foreign forces to enable them to participate in exercises, exchanges, and other military-to-military contacts. Post-9/11 DOD security cooperation authorities focus on counterterrorism assistance, and assistance to foreign forces in areas of conflict. Much of this assistance is for \"building partner capacity\" (BPC) to enable foreign forces to take greater responsibility for their own defense and for achieving mutual security goals in order to reduce U.S. costs. As part of the BPC effort, recent legislation provides DOD with authority to help strengthen foreign Ministries of Defense and related defense institutions. (Some of these DOD authorities require the concurrence [i.e., approval] of the Secretary of State.) Post-9/11 innovations include Congress's establishment through NDAA authority of two joint State Department-DOD authorities with a lead role for the Secretary of State: (1) an Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund established in FY2011 and (2) the Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), a pilot project established in FY2012 to address emerging threats. In FY2006, Congress created a DOD \"joint formulation\" BPC authority to address emerging counterterrorism threats, with DOD in the lead.", "To some analysts, the increase of Title 10 authorities and funding to DOD for BPC support to foreign military and other security forces contributes to the perceived \"militarization\" of U.S. foreign policy. For others, the increase of Title 10 authorities emerged from perceived gaps in existing authorities but has resulted in a confusing, inefficient \"patchwork\" of authorities and coordination arrangements that are not sufficient to meet all needs.", "Issues Covered in This Report", "Since the late 1940s, Congress has played an active role in shaping the legal and institutional construct for security assistance activities.

Obama Administration officials have argued that such efforts are cost-effective in the long run, potentially generating considerable savings in U.S. defense costs. Some policymakers, however, look at the mixed record of success and question whether the expenditure of billions of dollars on such programs is justified. Some wonder whether reforming such programs may improve results. ", "This report provides an overview of U.S. assistance to and engagement with foreign military and other security forces.

U.S. assistance to and engagement with foreign forces serves multiple purposes.", "Several terms are often related to such assistance and engagement, but no standard government-wide terminology exists.

Although the State Department and DOD are the major players, other U.S. agencies also contribute to U.S. security assistance efforts, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Departments of Energy (DOE), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice, and Treasury, along with members of the intelligence community. ", "Conducting foreign relations is the State Department's responsibility, and the Secretary of State, as the President's primary foreign policy advisor, contributes to the development of the President's foreign policy and ensures its coherent implementation. Defending the country against foreign threats is the DOD's core mission. The State Department-DOD shared responsibility is a result of the overlap in these functions when assisting foreign militaries and other security forces for the mutual benefit of a foreign government and the United States. ", "The United States has long recognized that it may at times be required to act alone to deter or combat threats. Nevertheless, since the end of World War II, policymakers have asserted that U.S. long-term security also requires cultivating foreign governments as allies to counter potential mutual enemies (or the enemies that threaten U.S. allies). The State Department-DOD shared responsibility arises from the many decisions that must be made in providing allies' and partners' militaries and other security forces with the equipment and training necessary to combat those enemies. Determining what equipment and training a foreign government needs and can effectively utilize requires military expertise. Determining how the provision of that equipment will affect relations with a foreign government and its people (as well as the governments of neighboring countries) and regional/international balances of power requires diplomatic skills and international affairs expertise. Determining whether a country's economy can absorb the cost of maintaining adequate military forces, and acquiring and maintaining military equipment, is a judgment for economists and development specialists. ", "In recent years, some policymakers and analysts have expressed concern over what they identify as a growing imbalance between the departments with the growing DOD role, leading to the \"militarization\" of U.S. foreign policy. Some contend that this trend stems from the substantial advantages of DOD personnel resources and Congress's provision of a growing number of new authorities to conduct security assistance missions. On the other hand, others perceive that weaknesses in the State Department's planning and implementation culture, limited personnel, and insufficient resources have compelled DOD to seek its own authorities and greater resources. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Purposes4", "paragraphs": ["Foreign military and other security assistance serves multiple purposes, both for the U.S. government and for recipient governments. As expressed in many documents since the immediate post-World War II period, foreign military assistance has been viewed as a means to foster international stability. U.S. security can be enhanced by spreading the burden for mutual defense, and by helping other governments deter or combat external aggression or internal subversion by countries or forces that may pose long-term risks to the United States.", "For the U.S. government, foreign military aid may also be a diplomatic asset. Such assistance may be used to cultivate goodwill and, in some cases, to persuade foreign governments to take positions or measures that the United States believes beneficial to its own and allied interests, or to express support for such actions. In addition, DOD uses foreign military and other security assistance as a tool to develop institutional ties with foreign militaries, cultivating relations that may be useful in dealing with future crises and fighting together in future conflicts. \"Building partner capacity\" through security assistance has been highlighted in recent defense strategy and guidance as a key component of defense planning and a significant means of decreasing DOD budgets in the long run.", "On the receiving end, the governments, military and security forces, and populations of recipient countries may incur both benefits and costs from such assistance. Foreign governments and militaries may use such aid to help them deter or actively counter aggression from other states. At times, foreign governments may use such aid to help battle or suppress domestic foes. In some cases, however, this aid may, from a U.S. perspective, upset the political balance within a country, enabling powerful militaries to unduly influence, pressure, or oust fledgling democratic governments or to suppress democratic opposition or movements in ways that may include, on some occasions, the violation of human rights. Moreover, maintaining or sustaining military and security forces may harm a country's economic prospects by diverting scarce funds from economic development to military purposes.

Nevertheless, the legal and institutional basis for State Department influence and oversight has evolved over time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Development of the Shared Partnership Legal Framework9", "paragraphs": ["The principle of civilian leadership, influence, and oversight of security assistance was a central feature of the first large-scale U.S. foreign assistance (including military assistance) programs during the post-World War II and early Cold War years. These early military and security force assistance programs were first instituted to help foreign governments build the capacity to defend against state-based foreign threats, principally the Soviet Union. This assistance started with the Greek-Turkish Aid Act, 1947, and the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, and continued through the Mutual Security Acts of the 1950s. For most of that period, program direction and oversight of funds authorized under these acts were vested in the Secretary of State by executive orders, although for four years White House officials were in charge, and for some of this early period, U.S. ambassadors played a major role. ", "The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (1961 FAA), Section 622(c), fixed the Secretary of State's leadership role in statute for funds authorized by the act, charging the Secretary with responsibility, under the direction of the President, for the \"continuous supervision and general direction\" of foreign assistance, including military assistance, education, and training under the act. In 1968, Congress broadened the scope of this responsibility to include all military assistance, regardless of the source of authority. Under Section 623, Congress charged the Secretary of Defense with responsibility for administering the FAA-authorized military assistance programs (a function originally assigned to the Secretary of Defense under Mutual Security Acts of the 1950s). Through executive orders, the President delegated to the Secretary of State most of the foreign assistance authority assigned to him by the 1961 FAA, but retained the legislative mandate for State Department oversight and DOD administration regarding military assistance. ", "Beginning in the 1980s, Congress began providing DOD with authority in Title 10 of the U.S. Code and annual National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs) (often referred to collectively as \"Title 10 authorities\") to conduct a wide range of programs and activities funded by DOD appropriations. Congress began providing such authorities in the 1980s for counternarcotics and humanitarian assistance; authority for nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs was subsequently added in the 1980s and 1990s. ", "With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. government assistance to and engagement with foreign militaries and security forces has been employed to counter new threats, including those from non-state actors. Many of the new authorities were provided to DOD, especially after the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001 (9/11).", "As the United States undertook military action in Afghanistan in 2001 and then in Iraq in 2005, Congress provided a number of DOD crisis and wartime authorities, some providing new global authority and some specific to those conflicts. Most recently, DOD statutes have been added regarding U.S. assistance to conflicts in Africa. The Defense Institute for Security Assistance Management (DISAM) catalogues approximately 80 Title 10 security cooperation programs and authorities; RAND, using different criteria, identifies 106 \"core\" Title 10 security cooperation statutes. Although not subject to 1961 FAA and AECA conditions, Title 10 security cooperation authorities may be subject to NDAA and DOD appropriations conditions, including conditions on human rights observance. ", "After U.S. military action began in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress provided several authorities for DOD to support partners in those efforts. One was a broad authority for coalition assistance not limited to those two conflicts. Others enabled assistance to (1) those countries providing military forces to participate in those conflicts and (2) bordering countries that providing assistance and other support for those operations. Congress also provided new authorities to support bilateral security assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan. ", "The growth of the Title 10 authorities has raised questions about the historical division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense. About 50 of the 80 security cooperation statutes identified by DISAM specifically require the concurrence of the Secretary of State before the Secretary of Defense may exercise his authority. Some analysts state that this proliferation of Title 10 authorities has muddled the coherence of U.S. programs and policy and undermined the earlier clarity of 1961 FAA Section 622(c) Secretary of State oversight responsibility. Other analysts question the extent to which the provision extends State Department oversight to noncombat aid and activities authorized by Title 10 and NDAAs.

As of March 1972, the interdepartmental coordination process, intended to integrate economic and military aid, consisted of five levels, which led from country-level program recommendation development to final recommendations to be submitted to the Secretary of State and then to the President. Today, the mechanisms for State Department-DOD collaboration may be considered in some respects simpler, when dealing with State Department security assistance, and in other respects more complex, when dealing with DOD authorities. ", "DOD, through U.S. military personnel as well as DOD civilian employees and contractors, engages in a wide range of noncombat activities and contacts abroad. DOD sometimes implements or otherwise supports State Department programs or the programs of other civilian agencies. The State Department oversees DOD implementation of the military aid, education, and training programs funded through the State Department budget. At other times, DOD conducts programs under DOD authorities, sometimes in cooperation with civilian agencies. The White House, the State Department, and other agencies with a security sector assistance responsibility, such as the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), work together at many levels to plan and implement military aid programs and activities. ", "Under State Department oversight and guidance, DOD plays a key role in the \"traditional\" Title 22 military assistance programs authorized by the 1961 FAA and the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). These are the Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs, which provide military equipment and related assistance, along with military education and training. Oversight for these programs is provided by the State Department Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM). FMS, FMF, and IMET are administered by the DSCA, an agency under the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Policy. In the field, primary responsibility for these programs rests with the Security Cooperation Organization (SCO) in each U.S. embassy, staffed with military personnel and directed by military officers reporting to both the U.S. ambassador and the geographic Combatant Commander (GCC), but nonetheless part of the embassy diplomatic mission. ", "DOD also cooperates with civilian agencies, playing what DOD terms a \"supporting\" role by providing assistance in conjunction with programs under the aegis of or implemented by the State Department or other agencies. For instance, DOD conducts counterproliferation programs under its own authority, but at the same time supports and cooperates on nonproliferation initiatives with the Departments of State and Energy under the Nonproliferation, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR) and Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund (NDF). DOD also supports some State Department programs funded under the State Department peacekeeping operations (PKO) account. ", "In addition, DOD has long supported USAID by providing disaster and humanitarian relief to foreign populations for natural and manmade disasters. In crises, DOD responds under the direction of the USAID Administrator to provide food, shelter, supplies, logistical support, medical evacuations, refugee assistance, and search and rescue services. In other situations, DOD conducts activities often characterized as humanitarian or development assistance, but that may be undertaken primarily for other purposes, such as strengthening relations with other military forces, establishing relations with foreign local leaders and peoples in areas where U.S. military personnel are operating to legitimize their presence (e.g., by providing benefits such as clinics, wells, and schoolhouses), or providing training for U.S. forces. USAID representatives are detailed to the geographic combatant commands (COCOMs) to review and provide advice on humanitarian and civil action projects to ensure they conform to sound development practices. In 2005, USAID established an office at headquarters in Washington to coordinate with DOD, now named the Office of Civil-Military Cooperation.", "Under its own Title 10 and NDAA authorities, DOD provides assistance to equip, train, and educate foreign military and other security forces, as well as to provide humanitarian relief and health assistance. Some of these authorities contain a specific provision requiring the \"concurrence\" (i.e., approval) of the Secretary of State.

", "On occasion, geographic COCOM security cooperation personnel draw on multiple authorities and funding pots to develop bilateral or multilateral programs for foreign forces. In some cases, they draw on both Title 10 and Title 22 resources to assemble a coherent program. The types and modes of DOD-State collaboration will depend on the combination of authorities. ", "Title 10 activities are planned and implemented by the COCOMs and are in support of their Theater Security Cooperation Strategic Plans. Such activities (as well as activities and programs conducted under Title 22) must be justified as contributing to the U.S. Integrated Country Strategy for each country in which they are conducted. COCOMs also are expected to coordinate Title 10 activities with U.S. Embassy SCOs and secure Chief of Mission (COM) approval.

The issues have risen in a new context in the post-Cold War era, as transnational terrorist groups have presented the United States with new challenges in a dramatically different threat environment.

In addition, some analysts note that security assistance/cooperation activities may be used for a variety of purposes and may have collateral benefits other than building partner capacity. For example, engaging with foreign militaries and police forces may build goodwill, help cultivate relations, and improve access, even if measurable results in foreign force capacity are not achieved.", "Examining the effectiveness of 20 security cooperation programs intended to build partner capacity in weak or failing states, a recent CRS report found results varied depending on the program's primary strategic purpose. The programs examined were undertaken from 1947 to the present. Programs with the most success were those intended to build alliances, as well as interpersonal and institutional linkages. Programs to build international participation in military coalitions were effective in achieving that aim, but also placed significant operational burdens on U.S. military forces. Least effective were programs for which the primary purpose was to enable U.S. forces to withdraw by transferring the primary responsibility for ending a war to domestic security forces. Programs addressing three strategic purposes met with mixed success, i.e., programs undertaken to manage regional security challenges, indirectly strengthen a party to a regional conflict, and mitigate conflict.", "Similarly, a 2013 RAND report found that effectiveness may vary depending on certain political, economic, and military factors. Attempting to identify ways to improve security assistance/cooperation efforts in general, whether under Title 22 or Title 10 authority, this report stated that effectiveness correlates with characteristics of the recipient country and with the level of U.S. and recipient commitment. It concluded that building partner capacity efforts have worked best in well-governed and economically sound countries that can efficiently use U.S. provided funds, invest their own funds to support or sustain capacity, and share U.S. interests. ", "However, according to the report, this is not an ironclad rule: \"BPC done well, done consistently, and matched to partner absorptive capacities and interests can be effective even when the partner is not particularly robust in any dimension at the outset.\" In cases of both \"ideal\" and \"suboptimal\" partners, prospects for success improved (1) when specific BPC objectives align with specific partner interests (regardless of the alignment of broader interests), and (2) when efforts are well matched to partner baseline capabilities and absorptive capacity. The report also stated that ministerial capacity (within the recipient ministries of defense and other relevant government institutions) is the foundation for other forms of capacity, and that \"ministerial capacity building can, itself, improve a partner's absorptive capacity even when baseline absorptive capacity is low.\" Thus, it found that that increases in defense institution building \"could enable future capacity building in other areas,\" and viewed these DIB as \"central to the future BPC toolkit.\" ", "RAND found it neither \"surprising nor problematic\" that the primary objective of some BPC programs is to build a relationship or secure access, and pointed to a possible synergy between relationship building and BPC assistance, \"with better relations making capacity building more effective and demonstrations of effectiveness in capacity building improving relations.\" ", "An academic study published in 2012 of U.S. security assistance to Greece, Vietnam, and Lebanon during crucial historical periods found that training and equipping foreign forces is not enough. Programs \"were more likely to succeed,\" it stated, \"when the United States became deeply involved in the partner state military's sensitive affairs\u2014influencing personnel and organization, but refraining from becoming a co-combatant\u2014and when unhelpful external actors played a diminishing role.\" ", "An Open Society Foundations' overview of selected academic studies examining counterterrorism efforts stated that \"no large-scale quantitative studies find a positive correlation between U.S. security assistance and a reduction in terrorism; however there are successes\" (one of which it identified as the Philippines) as well as instances in which such assistance can be counterproductive. This overview pointed to a number of nonmilitary factors influencing terrorism levels, including the extent to which governments discriminate against their minority groups, the existence of an independent judiciary, and spending on social welfare, including targeted aid for education, health, and civil society.", "DOD and the State Department have evaluation and assessment mechanisms for some individual programs, but as yet there is no government-wide, standardized assessment processes or systems. Two prominent examples of individual program assessment mechanisms are the DOD Section 1206 assessment methodology and the State Department's metrics and evaluation system for the Global Peace Operations Initiative. Under the April 5, 2013, Presidential Decision Directive 23 (PPD-23) on U.S. Security Sector Assistance Policy, the State Department Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources (\"F\") is leading an effort to develop evaluation and assessment tools. Some analysts suggest that the Administration also take steps to develop a standard, strategic-level mechanism to measure results.", "Congress may wish to take one or more approaches to examining the issue of security assistance effectiveness. ", "One approach would be to examine the status and adequacy of existing U.S. government evaluation tools and mechanisms and efforts to further develop them. Given the difficulties of assessing individual activities, some Members may wish to examine the feasibility of conducting broader assessments of overlapping interagency efforts. Others may wish to ascertain the extent to which tools and plans meet industry \"best practices,\" and, if not, whether Congress might provide additional assistance to enable the Administration to meet private sector standards. Another approach would be to consider the appropriate criteria for determining the \"success\" or \"failure\" of a security assistance program. Some analysts state that while programs tend to be judged on whether they achieve the desired end-state of strategic goals. Others argue that an assessment should also take into account the effect on intermediate goals, such as enhancing the U.S. security position, or the contribution that security assistance and cooperation programs can make as one of several tools jointly used to achieve objectives. A third approach would be to study whether the United States is appropriately prioritizing its security assistance budget. The RAND study cited above indicates that the more successful programs are conducted in developed countries, but since 2006 the United States has increasingly prioritized security cooperation programs in less-developed countries and fragile states, especially where governments are combating terrorism. Given some analysts' perspective that certain types of nonmilitary aid may be more productive than security assistance in countering terrorism, related lines of inquiry would be whether and to what extent U.S. economic or development aid should supplement or in some cases supplant security assistance, and how to best integrate economic/development and security assistance programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reconciling Foreign Policy and Security Concerns Through Statutory Reform35", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about the current State Department-DOD relationship governing security assistance center on two perspectives of that relationship and the guiding statutory framework.

Since 9/11, some analysts have perceived DOD as acting with growing autonomy, increasingly independent of State Department direction and supervision. The proliferation of DOD security cooperation authorities is viewed by some analysts as an element of the militarization of foreign policy, with GCCs disproportionately influencing the tenor of relations with countries in their theaters of operations. This viewpoint reflects a broader perception that DOD's overwhelming advantage in personnel and funds allows it to evade State Department direction and oversight and to conduct activities better carried out by civilians, which may be to the detriment of long-term U.S. interests.

Another would be to expand State Department oversight resources, including new posts in State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, which oversees security assistance, and at U.S. embassies.

The State Department does not possess the institutional inclination and capacity to lead or oversee the broad range of security cooperation activities that some analysts and practitioners view as necessary to meet national security demands.

Policymakers who prefer the use of State Department authority view FMF, IMET, and PKO as providing ample authority to conduct many programs currently carried out under Title 10, and use of these authorities as the most expeditious means to ensure that security cooperation programs conform to U.S. foreign policy.

They view the primary purpose of State Department assistance, particularly FMF and IMET, as promoting U.S. relations and interests in foreign countries by helping foreign governments and militaries to meet their security needs as they perceive them. DOD assistance, on the other hand, is viewed as responding to needs identified by the U.S. government and primarily benefitting U.S. national security. Proponents of using Title 22 authority for most DOD security cooperation authorities recognize that an expanded use of these authorities might require modifications to provide the utility, flexibility and speed that DOD seeks through Title 10 authority, as well as changes in traditional practices.

As noted above, FMF funds have been generally used as a diplomatic or \"political\" tool for weapons and equipment desired by the recipient country (but not necessarily for weapons and equipment that DOD might think most appropriate). In some cases, this means that FMF funds continue even when this assistance is not being used to best advantage. In addition, FMF traditionally has been used for bilateral rather than multilateral programs, and some view it as not suited to the regional programs DOD contemplates for areas such as maritime security. State Department officials state that bilateral use has been a matter of practice, not of law, and that FMF programs may be dedicated to regional programs as necessary.

One statute is DOD's premier building partner capacity authority, Section 1206/10 U.S.C. 2282, with DOD in the lead. This is implemented through a \"bottom-up\" process that starts at the field level with the COCOMs and the U.S. embassies. The other statute is the GSCF, with the State Department in the lead. GSCF program development has largely been a \"top down\" process, with proposals originating at the State Department and DOD offices in Washington, DC. Both of these authorities are limited to contingency operations addressing emerging or urgent threats.

Such an extension could provide greater State Department oversight where coordination mechanisms are weak or nonexistent. In 2008, DOD described the Section 1206 joint formulation process as the \"gold standard\" for interagency planning and cooperation. Similarly, when first enacted in 2011, GSCF authority was widely considered the vanguard of a new mode of State-DOD collaboration because of its unique blend of a State lead with close DOD collaboration.

This could include expanding existing authorities or adding new authorities to provide DOD with the flexibility and funding to more readily assist partners in responding to a wider range of threats.

It also recommends expanding existing DOD authorities or legislating new ones.

Other analysts propose more sweeping reform, consolidating and expanding existing DOD security cooperation authorities into one broad, comprehensive Title 10 authority. Some analysts assert Congress deliberately created the framework of narrow DOD authorities in order to exercise effective oversight and caution that consolidation may have inadvertent consequences, among them rendering DOD programs so broad that they will outstrip available State Department and Congressional resources to monitor them.

In between are a number of less ambitious, but nonetheless significant reform proposals: revamping current practices for State Department authorities to make them more suitable for DOD programs; expanding the purposes of the hybrid, dual-key State Department-DOD authorities to encompass a wider variety of programs in non-urgent environments; or consolidating, revising, and possibly expanding existing Title 10 authorities.

On the DOD side, Congress may wish to ascertain the extent to which GPF are used to train, advise, and mentor foreign military and other security forces, compared with SOF, the advantages and disadvantages of using GPF versus SOF for these missions, and the effect of the use of GPF on military readiness.

At the time the 1961 FAA was written, it seems likely that military assistance meant the U.S. provision of defense articles and services to foreign militaries, as well as military education and training, which the 1961 FAA specifically identifies, along with civil (also known as civic) action, as military assistance. (See the text box below for the definitions of these terms.) Whether the term \"military assistance\" was originally meant to encompass assistance to other foreign security forces, including police, is not clear. It appears that, for clarity's sake, the term \"security assistance\" replaced \"military assistance\" in State Department documents. ", "Security Assistance and Security Cooperation", "Today, \"security assistance\" is a term frequently used for assistance provided to foreign military and security forces, regardless of the agency providing that assistance. DOD, however, defines the term differently from its common usage. ", "There is no State Department-issued definition of security assistance. The annual State Department congressional budget justification (CBJ), however, lists six budget accounts under the heading \"International Security Assistance,\" and these accounts, with their underlying Title 22 authorities, are commonly regarded as the State Department's security assistance portfolio. These accounts are Foreign Military Financing (FMF), International Counternarcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), International Military Education and Training (IMET), Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, and Related Programs (NADR), Peacekeeping Operations (PKO), and the Special Defense Acquisition Fund.

These programs are FMF and IMET, as well as three others that do not require appropriations: (1) Foreign Military Sales (FMS), through which foreign governments purchase defense articles and services with their own funds, (2) the leases of equipment, and (3) the provision of excess U.S. defense articles. ", "DOD uses an overarching term, \"Security Cooperation,\" to denote the State Department security assistance administered by DSCA as well as all other DOD \"interactions with foreign defense establishments to build defense relationships.\" This term addresses the lack of common terminology for DOD's many noncombat activities and contacts, including not only the provision of defense articles and services, but also humanitarian assistance, exercises, and military-to-military contacts that benefit both U.S. and foreign forces. These \"interactions\" include programs to provide defense articles and services to foreign governments for which Congress provides DOD with specific authority, as well as programs and military exercises conducted under DOD's organic Title 10 authority. ", "Despite the formal DOD definition, personnel and entities within DOD use the term \"security assistance\" to include Title 10 assistance and activities. For instance, the name of the unit responsible for implementing Navy assistance and activities across the security cooperation spectrum is Naval Education and Training Security Assistance Field Activity (NETSAFA).

There may be different opinions, however, on whether the term includes all DOD humanitarian assistance authorities. This term is closely linked to \"Security Sector Reform\" (SSR), an internationally used term that refers to the broad span of programs and activities to improve the way a country provides safety, security, and justice through its police and other law enforcement and rule of law personnel, as well as its defense forces. ", "DOD uses the term \"Security Force Assistance\" in a similar manner, although it is a narrower term. DOD Instruction 5000.68 identifies SFA as a subset of Security Cooperation through which DOD contributes U.S. government efforts to strengthen and reform foreign security forces and their supporting institutions. The instruction states that such activities should be conducted \"primarily to assist host countries to defend against internal and transnational threats to stability.\" In addition, SFA may be used to help host counties defend against external threats, contribute to coalition operations, or organize, train, equip, and advise another country's security forces or supporting institutions. SFA does not include DOD activities with other sectors of a foreign government or population.", "Is Title 10 Security Cooperation a Subset of Foreign Assistance?", "The question of whether DOD Title 10 security cooperation programs and activities constitute foreign assistance is fraught with legal, policy, and practical implications. In the 1961 FAA, military assistance, including military education and training, is referred to as a subset of foreign assistance. The U.S. Army Operational Law Handbook, in its discussion of fiscal law limitations on the use of DOD funds for assisting foreign forces, describes military and related supplies and training to foreign forces as foreign assistance, with the exception of training for familiarization, interoperability, or safety purposes. (It notes that whether the exception applies to training is also determined by the size, length, and purpose of training events.) In general, however, DOD has avoided referring to programs and activities to train, equip, or otherwise support or engage with foreign security forces under Title 10 authorities as foreign assistance, using instead the term \"foreign assistance or security assistance related.\" ", "Appendix B. Historical Evolution of Roles and Responsibilities", "The current legislative framework for security assistance and cooperation has its origins in the post-World War II military assistance statutes and programs, but it has evolved overtime.

This act provided economic and military assistance to those two countries. In a statement to a joint session of Congress requesting the aid, President Truman tied U.S. national security to that of other free peoples living in a world of peace. The President delegated his power and authority under the act to the Secretary of State through Executive Order (E.O.) 9857. That E.O. also charged the U.S. ambassadors to those countries with the responsibility to direct assistance activities within Greece and Turkey \"under the guidance and instructions of the Secretary of State....\" It instructed the Secretary of State to make \"appropriate arrangements\" with other departments, including the Department of the Navy and the Department of War, to enable ambassadors to fulfill their responsibilities under the act.

Through this legislation, Congress established that foreign military assistance would be separate from the DOD budget and provided the first guidelines for the current division of responsibility between the State Department and DOD for military assistance. In a joint Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the legislation, then Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson clarified that the Administration wanted to \"keep foreign military assistance costs separate and distinct as an item so that you [Congress] can evaluate and the people of America can understand what we are doing, and not as a buried item in the budget bill of the Defense Department.\" ", "Later, in a joint report, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee stated their judgment that primary authority and responsibility for directing the foreign assistance program authorized by the act be \"lodged in the President, and under him the Secretary of State,\" and that DOD's close participation in making program policies was necessary \"because this is a military program aimed at increasing the national security.\" In January 1950, through E.O. 10099, President Truman charged the Secretary of State with \"responsibility and authority for the direction\" of the MDAA program and authority to approve programs after consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator for Economic Cooperation.", "Mutual Security Act, 1951", "With the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (1951 MSA, P.L. 82-165, October 10, 1951), Congress shifted primary responsibility for the direction and oversight of foreign assistance, including military assistance, to the White House. The 1951 MSA provided military, economic, and technical assistance to friendly countries, primarily in Western Europe, but also in the Near East, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, \"to maintain the security and to promote the foreign policy of the United States.\" Section 501 authorized the President \"to appoint in the Executive Office of the President a Director for Mutual Security\" who under the direction of the President \"shall have primary responsibility for ... continuous supervision and general direction of the assistance program under this Act to the end that such programs shall be (A) effectively integrated both at home and abroad, and (B) administered so as to assure that the defensive strength of free nations of the world shall be built as quickly as possible on the basis of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid.\" ", "Section 503 spelled out the Director's primary role with regard to military assistance. Section 506(a) enumerated a list of the Secretary of Defense's responsibilities for administering military assistance and related technical assistance and advice that has endured, with minor changes, to this day (now as 1961 FAA Section 623, see below), to be exercised subject to the Director of Mutual Security's \"coordination, direction, and supervision.\" ", "In E.O. 10300 implementing the 1951 MSA, President Truman specified what on the surface appeared to be an accessory role for the Secretary of State: \"The Secretary of State and the Director for Mutual Security shall establish and maintain arrangements which will insure that the programs included in the Mutual Security Act of 1951 shall be carried out in conformity with the established foreign policy of the United States.\" Nevertheless, that same year, an executive branch memorandum noted the ", "fundamental premise that the State Department should exercise leadership, guidance, and in the final instance, control\u2014subject only to Presidential determination if other interested Cabinet officers object\u2014over all elements of the foreign policy of the United States and over the policies and principles to govern the operations of other agencies involved in overseas activities insofar as they affect Foreign Policy considerations. ", "Mutual Security Act, 1954", "By enacting the Mutual Security Act of 1954 (1954 MSA, P.L. 83-665, August 26, 1954), Congress set the scene for the return of the Secretary of State as a principal figure in military assistance, although with a somewhat reduced military assistance oversight role. The 1954 MSA bestowed authority for all foreign assistance on the President. At first, through E.O. 10575 (November 6, 1954), President Eisenhower delegated that authority to the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) Director, except for military assistance. President Eisenhower delegated that responsibility, including responsibility for determining recipients, to the Secretary of Defense, subject to \"coordination\" by the FOA Director. Then, in mid-1955, the period of White House direct oversight of foreign assistance, which lasted almost four years, came to an end.", "In an April 1955 letter to Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, President Eisenhower signaled his intent to shift responsibility for foreign assistance from the White House to the Secretary of State. \"The Secretary of State, under the President,\" he wrote, \"must be the official responsible for the development and control of foreign policy and all relations with foreign governments, to include policies affecting mutual security.\" Through E.O. 10610 of May 1955, President Eisenhower reestablished the Secretary of State's authority over foreign assistance, with the exception of most authority for military assistance. The President vested authority provided by the 1954 MSA for military assistance in the Secretary of Defense, subject to coordination by the Secretary of State. However, seemingly in line with the President's letter, E.O. 10610 (Section 202) charged the Secretary of State with determining the value of the military assistance program in each recipient country. ", "Draper Committee Recommendations, 1959", "Throughout the 1950s, military assistance became increasingly controversial. In November 1958, President Eisenhower appointed a committee to study and recommend changes to U.S. foreign assistance programs, including the Military Assistance Program (MAP). Known as the \"Draper Committee\" after its president, William H. Draper, Jr., the committee recommended in August 1959 both that military assistance be appropriated in the DOD budget and that the ability of the Department of State \"to provide foreign policy direction for, and to coordinate, the military and economic assistance programs should be strengthened.\" The committee's stated reason for funding military assistance programs in the DOD budget was to ensure they would \"come into competition for financial support with other activities and programs of the Department of Defense.\" ", "The recommendation to place MAP under the defense budget did not imply a recommendation to reduce the State Department role, however. To the contrary, in its conclusions, the Draper Committee highlighted an interim report's description of the \"key to success\" of the MAP as ensuring \"an effective working relationship\" between the Departments of State and Defense. The interim report discussed two elements to improve the working relationship: (1) \"strengthening of the position of the State Department on the policy level of military assistance planning and an increased assurance of the conformity of the Military Assistance Program to foreign policy and to related assistance programs\" and (2) \"the focusing of responsibility on the Department of Defense for the planning, programming and execution of military assistance within the framework of policy guidance laid down in the National Security Council and by the Department of State.\" ", "The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (1961 FAA)", "With the passage of the 1961 FAA, Congress provided the Secretary of State with authority over military assistance that drew on the authority provided the White House in the 1951 MSA. The 1961 FAA echoed provisions of the 1951 MSA in three ways: (1) in the wording of the oversight responsibility originally vested in the Director of Mutual Security, (2) in the stated purpose of Secretary of State oversight, and (3) in the listed responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense in administering the program. ", "As with previous foreign assistance, the 1961 FAA bestowed on the President the authority to carry out its provisions, which the President then delegated to department secretaries and key officials. Over time, the division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense has been modified. For instance, through the first executive order governing the 1961 FAA, E.O. 10973, President Kennedy delegated most presidential authority for furnishing military assistance to the Secretary of Defense, including Section 503(a) authority to identify countries or international organizations that \"the President finds will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.\" When President Carter issued a revised executive order to govern the 1961 FAA (E.O. 12163 revoking E.O. 10973), he reserved Section 503(a) authority to the President, with a note that the Secretary of State was authorized to make that finding in certain situations. This arrangement continues to this day. ", "From the beginning, Congress explicitly provided the Secretary of State through the 1961 FAA with a strong oversight responsibility regarding military assistance. Under Section 622(c), Congress vested in the Secretary of State, under the direction of the President, responsibility for the \"continuous supervision and general direction\" of foreign assistance, with specific reference to \"military assistance, including military education and training,\" provided under the 1961 FAA. Also under Section 622(c), Congress made the Secretary of State responsible \"for determining whether there shall be a military assistance (including civic action) or a military education and training program for a country and the value thereof.\" Congress's intention for Secretary of State oversight, under that section, was \"to the end that such programs are effectively integrated both at home and abroad and the foreign policy of the United States is best served thereby.\" Under Section 623, Congress charged the Secretary of Defense with responsibility for administering the military assistance program, enumerating tasks similar to those first assigned under the 1951 MSA. ", "During the 1960s and 1970s, the 1961 FAA and related State Department accounts became the primary vehicle for U.S. military assistance, although significant assistance was provided under other accounts and authorities, especially for the Vietnam War effort. A notable exception was military services support funding for the conflict in Southeast Asia, which was authorized and funded under DOD legislation. In the mid-1970s, after the Vietnam War had concluded, Congress amended the 1961 FAA to expand Secretary of State oversight responsibility. By deleting the words \"in this Act\" from the mandate to exercise \"continuous supervision and general direction,\" Congress gave the Secretary of State (again under the direction of the President) oversight responsibility for all military assistance, regardless of the authority or budget under which it is provided. (This responsibility underpins Congress's current practice of making many Title 10 assistance authorities subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State.)", "Although the 1961 FAA gave the Secretary of State primary responsibility for security assistance, other responsibilities and the organization for implementing security assistance programs changed over time. At first, the Secretary of State delegated his responsibility for oversight to the U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator, and then divided that responsibility between two State Department officials. The oversight responsibility\u2014exercising continuous supervision and general direction of military assistance programs\u2014was subsequently re-delegated to State's Director for Political-Military Affairs. ", "In 1963, the Secretary of Defense divided his implementation responsibilities and delegated those responsibilities among several DOD positions. In 1971, he made a number of subsequent organizational changes, including the creation of the Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA, now the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, DSCA), with responsibilities for program administration. (Before the DSAA was established, the distribution of defense articles and services appeared to be the responsibility of the geographic combatant commands (COCOMs.) ", "Continuing Evolution of the Legislative Framework", "In keeping with changing needs and conditions since 1961, Congress has amended the 1961 FAA several times to incorporate additional security assistance authority. Congress has also enacted laws to provide new sources of Title 22 and Title 10 (as well as Title 50) security assistance authority. ", "Expansion of Title 22 Authority", "The original 1961 FAA military assistance provisions were supplemented by numerous amendments, including five key security assistance authorities:", "International Narcotics Control authority (Part I, Chapter 8, Section 481), added in 1972 and subsequently amended; International Military Education and Training authority (Part II, Chapter 5, Sections 541-549), added in 1976 and subsequently amended; Peacekeeping Operations authority (Part II, Chapter 6, Section 551), added in 1978 and subsequently amended; Antiterrorism Assistance authority (Part II, Chapter 8, Section 572), added in 1983 and subsequently amended; and Nonproliferation and Export Control Assistance authority (Part II, Chapter 9, Sections 581-585), added in 2000 and subsequently amended. ", "Congress provided additional security assistance authority through other laws as well. The AECA, a major new Title 22 authority, was added in 1968. The AECA provided new authority for cash arms sales (with associated training and equipment) through a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program and for assistance in purchasing arms and associated training and equipment through a Foreign Military Financing (FMF) credit and grant authority. AECA authority overlaps with 1961 FAA security assistance provisions, which the AECA amended to provide congruent authority. Like the 1961 FAA, the AECA vests responsibility in the Secretary of State, under the direction of the President, for providing \"continuous supervision and general direction\" oversight, in this case for provisions of the act. Nonproliferation and similar assistance is another area where Congress legislated separate but related authorities under Titles 22, 10, and 50. ", "Over the years, as Congress added new security assistance authority through amendments to the 1961 FAA and other legislation, the division of responsibility between the Secretaries of State and Defense for security assistance became more complex. As with the 1961 FAA, Title 22 legislation in general bestowed security assistance authority on the President. As a result, through executive orders, the President delegates most authority to the Secretaries of State, Defense, or, as appropriate, other agencies. He may reserve certain authorities for himself. As noted above, the current primary executive order governing the delegation of foreign assistance authority is E.O. 12163, issued by President Carter in 1979. Amended many times, E.O. 12163 delegates presidential authority contained in the 1961 FAA as well as numerous appropriations and other acts. For security assistance, the division of responsibility between the Secretaries of State and Defense under E.O. 12163 is supplemented by other orders. For instance, AECA authority bestowed on the President is delegated by E.O. 13637, and presidential authority for nonproliferation assistance provided by the Freedom Support Act is delegated by E.O. 12884. ", "Under the regime established by these and related executive orders, the President's 1961 FAA and AECA responsibilities for foreign military sales and financing is divided between the Secretaries of State and Defense, with some responsibilities reserved to the President. As indicated above, AECA security assistance responsibilities are divided between the Secretaries of State and Defense. Four key 1961 FAA security assistance authorities added post-1961\u2014counternarcotics (1972), peacekeeping operations (1978), antiterrorism (1983), and nonproliferation (2000)\u2014are delegated to the Secretary of State. ", "Nevertheless, sometimes multiple provisions affect the division of responsibility. For example, in the area of counternarcotics, E.O. 12163 delegates to the Secretary of Defense the President's authority to provide military assistance and law enforcement assistance to Andean countries in the International Narcotics Control Act of 1990 ( P.L. 101-623 , Section 3 through the foreign military financing program). E.O. 12163, however, also provides that the Secretary of Defense shall exercise this function \"in consultation with the Secretary of State.\" Moreover, the 1961 FAA counternarcotics provisions directly bestow oversight responsibility for all counternarcotics efforts on the Secretary of State. Section 481(b) of the 1961 FAA charges the Secretary of State with responsibility \"for coordinating all assistance provided by the United States government to support international efforts to combat illicit narcotics production or trafficking.\" ", "Addition of Title 10 Security Cooperation Authority", "Beginning in the 1980s, Congress expanded the scope and character of the statutory framework by authorizing DOD to directly train, equip, and otherwise assist foreign military and other security forces through new provisions in annual National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA), some codified to Title 10 of the U.S. Code (Armed Services). Unlike Title 22 provisions, which generally bestow assistance authority on the President, most NDAA and Title 10 security cooperation authorities are specifically assigned to the Secretary of Defense. Counternarotics authorities were among the earliest DOD statutes, enabling the use of substantial military assets to curb narcotics production abroad and block exports to the United States. ", "Post 9/11, Congress has approved additional Title 10 statutes in response to perceptions that DOD would need new, flexible tools to meet the demands of a changing international security environment. In the new environment, challenges would be posed not only by peer competitors, but also, and perhaps more immediately, by the lawlessness and ungoverned spaces found in weak and failing states. Many new statutes provide authority for DOD authorities build the capacity of foreign forces to work unilaterally or as partners with the United States to deter and counter threats. These included authorities responding to the increased demand for military resources as a result of U.S. interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, and to military requests for greater flexibility to meet the challenges\u2014actual and potential\u2014posed by terrorists and other violent groups. ", "Appendix C. Title 22 Department of State Authorities", "This appendix provides information on Title 22, Department of State statutes. These include the State Department's three \"traditional\" security assistance programs: Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF), and the International Military Education and Training (IMET), including the \"expanded-IMET defense civilian-oriented program component) programs. They also include the State Department's excess defense articles program and two Arms Export Control Act programs related to FMS/FMF: the equipment leasing program and the Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF). These are all administered by the Department of Defense's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). Other Department of State authorities and programs discussed here are the drawdown authorities, International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, Non-Proliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs, Peacekeeping Operations, and Special Authorities. DOD participates in or otherwise may support the later programs. For these programs, administered and implemented by the State Department, DOD support may include personnel, equipment, and services such as transportation.", "DSCA-Administered Title 22 State Department Programs", "Excess Defense Articles", "22 U.S.C. 2321j (1961 FAA Section 516) gives the President authority to transfer excess defense equipment (EDA) as part of military assistance programs, narcotics control programs, or activities that have been separately justified to Congress. Supplies must be drawn from DOD existing stocks. DOD cannot spend funds available for procuring defense equipment for the transfer, and the transfer cannot have an adverse impact on U.S. military readiness or on the national technology and industrial base and potential such sales. Transfers on a grant basis are to be preferred to those on a sales basis \"after taking into account the potential proceeds from, and likelihood of, such sales, and the comparative foreign policy benefits that may accrue to the United States as the result of a transfer on either a grant or sales basis.\" A 30-day advance notification is provided to Congress before any transfers of excess defense articles valued at more than $7 million (in terms of original acquisition costs). The aggregate value of excess defense articles transferred under this provision may not exceed $425 million in a fiscal year.", "Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and Related AECA Provisions", "FMS (AECA, Sections 21-22, 22 U.S.C. 2761-2762) is the U.S. government's main vehicle for selling weapons, equipment, and associated training to friendly foreign countries. Military weapons and equipment ranges from major weapons systems, such as sophisticated aircraft, to smaller items, such as patrol boats, night vision goggles, and military boots. Foreign governments may purchase such items directly from the private companies offering them, but many prefer to purchase through FMS because the U.S. government negotiates with those suppliers for packages of materiel and services on behalf of that government and monitors the procurement process through delivery. FMF grants and loans (AECA, Section 23, 22 U.S.C. 2763) are provided to selected foreign governments to purchase items through FMS. The State Department is primarily responsible for determining which nations are to receive military assistance from each program. The actual FMF expenditure for FY2015 was $5.9 billion in the enduring and OCO budgets, of which $4.4 billion was provided in the enduring budget to Israel ($3.1 billion) and Egypt ($1.3 billion). (For FY2016, total estimated FMF in the enduring and OCO budgets was $6.0 billion, but the State Department has not provided a by-country breakdown by country.) For FY2017, the State Department requested some $5.7 billion in the enduring and OCO budgets, with same dollar amounts as in FY2015 in the enduring budget for Israel and Egypt. ", "Under one related AECA provision, DOD defense articles may be leased rather than sold to eligible countries or international organizations (Leases of Equipment 22 U.S.C. 2796, AECA Sections 61-65). The President must first determine that there are compelling U.S. foreign policy and national security reasons to do so. Leases may not exceed five years, but they may be renewed. ", "In another related AECA provision, the Special Defense Acquisition Fund (SDAF, 22 U.S.C. 2795, AECA Section 51) supports an inventory of defense articles that may be used to meet the urgent needs of partner nations. First established in 1982 as a revolving fund and then discontinued in 1995 due to post-Cold War spending cuts, the SDAF was resurrected in FY2012. During its first 13 years of operation, it funded the stockpiling of \"various defense articles ranging from arms and ammunition, to radars and radios and Night Vision Goggles, to major end items such as helicopters, small boats, tanks, vehicles, and missiles\" for future sales to partner nations. The SDAF was recapitalized in FY2012 (as recommended the previous year by a Security Cooperation Reform Task Force working on FMS/FMF reform) from FMF funds authorized for transfer to the account ( P.L. 112-74 , Section 7080), as well as from receipts from selected FMS sales. Most stockpiled defense articles are sold to partner nations or provided to them through U.S. building partner capacity programs. The SDAF may also be used to purchase defense services. ", "International Military Education and Training (IMET) Program", "IMET (1961 FAA Section 541-543, 22 U.S.C. 2347) provides grants to foreign military and foreign civilian defense personnel from all levels to attend U.S. professional military education institutions and operational training courses. Incorporated in 1976 in the 1961 FAA, IMET sends foreign personnel to the military service senior-level war colleges and the National Defense University, as well to military service Command and Staff Colleges, where they take basic and advanced officer training. In 1990, the program was expanded (E-IMET) to provide opportunities for foreign civilian defense and related personnel to attend educational programs fostering responsible defense resource management, among other purposes. IMET emphasizes longer training experiences in the United States to maximize student exposure to the American way of life. In FY2016, estimated IMET funding totaled $108.1 million.

The FY2016 expenditures for this account were an estimated $885.5 million; the FY2017 request was $668.5 million (both figures include enduring and OCO budget amounts). ", "When deemed necessary, DSCA provides support for some NADR programs by providing defense articles and services through its delivery process. In addition, DOD may provide other support, including running DOD-funded programs in conjunction with NADR-funded programs. One example is the long-standing interagency Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) through which the State Department, DOD, and USAID work to thwart potential terrorist activity in 11 countries on the African continent. (The TSCTP is primarily funded through the PKO account; see below.) In addition, DOD contributes to the State Department's eight regional interagency strategy groups to assess and counter the threats posed by terrorists. DOD contributions to the work of these groups are made though 10 U.S.C. 2282 (formerly known as \"Section 1206\") counterterrorism programs and the Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP), described below.

PKO programs include efforts to diminish and resolve conflicts, address counterterrorism threats, and reform military establishments. In addition, PKO funds U.S. military participation in the Multilateral Force and Observers (MFO) in Sinai. PKO-funded programs are authorized under 1961 FAA Sections 551-553 (22 U.S.C. 2348). The FY2016 PKO estimated expenditure was $600.6 million, and the FY2017 request was $475.4 million (both figures include enduring and OCO budgets). ", "DOD sometimes provides its own funds to complement or otherwise assist with PKO-funded programs. As mentioned in the description of the NADR account, above, PKO funds are the primary vehicle for TSCTP's military assistance programs, most of which are implemented by DOD. DOD plays a similar role in TSCTP's East African counterpart, the Partnership for East Africa Counterterrorism (PREACT), which also provides counterterrorism training and equipment. In addition, DOD provides trainers, advisors, mentors, and transportation for the long-standing PKO-funded Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) to train and equip and support deployment of foreign military troops and police for United Nations and regional peacekeeping missions, a major component of which is the Africa Contingency Operations Training Assistance (ACOTA) program. (A representative from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Policy, co-chairs the GPOI Coordinating Committee.)

The FY2015 NDAA codified Section 1206 as the Build Partner Capacity authority at 10 U.S.C. 2282. Section (a)(1)(A) of this authority enables DOD to train and equip foreign military and security forces to conduct counterterrorism operations; Section (a)(1)(B) enables DOD to train and equip foreign military forces to participate in or support ongoing allied or coalition military and stability operations that benefit the U.S. national security interest.
