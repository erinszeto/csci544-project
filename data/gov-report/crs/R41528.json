E.O. 13526 continues the tradition of congressional deference to the executive branch in setting classified information policy. Since 1995, three Presidents (Clinton, Bush, Obama) have issued three executive orders (E.O. 12958, E.O. 13292, and E.O. 13526) requiring agencies to make significant revisions to their security classification policies and practices. Congress may opt to reevaluate the benefits and costs of the decision to permit significant changes in classified information policy via executive order. ", "2. As with previous executive orders, E.O. 13526 bases the classification levels on the criterion of damage. The differing levels of classification markings represent varying levels of possible \"damage to national security.\" Thus, the classification marking of \"'Confidential' shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\" Meanwhile, a document may be given the highest security protection if its release \"could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage.\" No other values or criterion are to be taken into account.", "The terms damage and national security are inherently broad concepts. Neither damage nor the state of relations among nations are easily quantified or determinable with precision. E.O. 13526 carries these two terms under a unified definition that defines national security to include the United States' international relations. ", "\"Damage to the national security\" means harm to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States from the unauthorized disclosure of information, taking into consideration such aspects of the information as the sensitivity, value, utility, and provenance of that information.", "Congress might examine the utility of the continued use of the singular criterion of harm and the concept of damage to national security . It also could assess the utility of the parameters of the term damage to the national secu rity to determine whether they are overly or insufficiently broad.", "3. As described above, E.O. 13526 assigns significant classified information policy responsibilities to the ISOO, NDC, and NARA. An executive order cannot be used to appropriate funds from the U.S. Treasury; hence, Congress may assess whether these agencies have sufficient resources to carry out their work.", "4. E.O. 13526, Section 1.9 requires classifying agencies to review their classification guides to ensure they comport with current classified information policy. This must be done within two years. One objective of this practice is to reduce the incidences of information being classified needlessly. Over-classification, or the act of classifying material that need not be classified, not only is a violation of government policy, it also creates unnecessary costs related to safe-keeping, handling, and declassification. Congress may ask agencies to report on their progress toward completing this task.", "5. In the memorandum accompanying E.O. 13526, the President ordered the National Declassification Center to clear the more than 400 million pages of classified records more than 25 years old by December 31, 2013. The NDC's role is to facilitate agencies' review of these documents and their determinations to release records (in whole or in part), or to keep them classified.", "To date, agencies' declassification of information has lagged behind their production of it. According to an NDC estimate, each year 15 million new pages of classified material are accessioned to the NARA, and only 11 million pages complete the declassification process and are made available to the public. The President's memorandum would require more than 400 million pages of information to move through this process in four years, a rate of approximately 100 million pages per year. ", "Congress may choose to monitor the NDC's progress toward achieving the reduction of the backlog. ", "6. Congress enacted the Reducing Over-Classification Act in October 2010, four months after the ISOO released its regulations (32 C.F.R. 2001) for implementing E.O. 13526. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs wrote:", "The Committee wishes to emphasize that none of the provisions in this Act is intended to supplant the Executive Branch's longstanding authority to determine what information should be appropriately classified within the framework established in Executive Order 13526 and its predecessors. Indeed, the Committee believes that the provisions of the Act complement and do not conflict with Executive Order 13526, and that both the Order and the Act will promote the goals of increased transparency, information sharing, and security.", "Section 4 of this new statute requires the Secretary of DHS to appoint a classified information advisory officer, who has the authority to \"develop and disseminate educational materials and to develop and administer training programs\" to assist sub-federal actors (i.e., state, local, and tribal governments and private-sector firms) that utilize classified information. It is unclear whether this new official must have these materials and programs approved by the ISOO, which is authorized to set the standards for agencies' security education and training programs (E.O. 13526, Part 5). Congress may consider examining whether agencies have faced any challenges in implementing the new law and the executive order consonantly.", "7. The Reducing Over-Classification Act aims to increase information-sharing among agencies. The illicit release of over 250,000 State Department cables, possibly by a Department of Defense employee, may indicate the inherent difficulty of balancing information sharing and information protection. Already, some agencies have announced new security controls. Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget has ordered agencies that handle classified information to \"establish a security assessment team consisting of counterintelligence, security, and information assurance experts to review the agency's implementation of procedures for safeguarding classified information against improper disclosures.\" Congress may move to hold a hearing where it can aggregate agency reports on their improvements to classified information safeguarding.", "8. The incidents of unauthorized leaks cited at the beginning of this report appear to share a common feature\u2014they involve persons authorized to have access to classified information. Congress may wish to survey these and other cases to determine whether there were further commonalities in these instances. Were, for example, the individuals' motivations similar? Were these individuals little supervised in their handling of classified information? Would increasing the negative consequences for the unauthorized release of classified information be likely to discourage further incidents? Was most of the information in electronic format?"], "subsections": []}]}}
