This milestone, which has been compared to the discoveries of Galileo, and other advances in genetics have created novel legal issues relating to genetic information. The Human Genome Project produced detailed maps of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes and sequenced 99% of the three billion nucleotide bases that make up the human genome. The sequence information should aid in the identification of genes underlying disease, raising hope for genetic therapies to cure disease, but this scientific accomplishment is not without potential problems. For instance, the presence of a specific genetic variation may indicate a predisposition to disease but does not guarantee that the person will manifest the disease: How should an employer or insurer respond? The ethical, social and legal implications of these technological advances have been the subject of significant scrutiny and concern.", "The legal implications of such information have been addressed in various ways largely by states, but also by Congress. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, P.L. 104-191, is the first federal law to specifically address discrimination and insurance issues relating to genetic discrimination. Congress is currently considering genetic discrimination legislation. H.R. 493, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2007 (GINA), was introduced in the 110th Congress by Representative Slaughter and 143 cosponsors on January 16, 2007. It passed the House on April 25, 2007. A companion bill, S. 358, 110th Congress, was introduced by Senator Snowe and 22 cosponsors on January 22, 2007, and has been reported out of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. On March 5, 2008, the text of H.R. 493 as passed by the House was added to the end of the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007 (H.R. 1424) in the engrossment of H.R. 1424. On April 24, 2008, the Senate took up H.R. 493, replaced the existing language with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, and passed the measure, as amended, by a vote of 95-0. The House is expected to pass H.R. 493 (as amended) during the week of April 28, 2008.", "In the 109th Congress, S. 306, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2005, was passed on February 17, 2005, by a vote of 98-0. A companion bill, H.R. 1227, was introduced on March 10, 2005, and another bill, H.R. 6125 was introduced on September 20, 2006. In the 108th Congress, the Senate passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2003, S. 1053. H.R. 1910 was introduced in the House and hearings were held, but the bill was not passed in the 108th Congress. This report discusses current federal law, state statutes, and legislation. It will be updated as needed."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In April 2003, the sequence of the human genome was deposited into public databases. Scientists involved in the Human Genome Project (HGP) reported that the finished sequence consists of overlapping fragments covering 99% of the coding regions of the human genome, with an accuracy of 99.999%. These rapid advances provide powerful tools for determining the causes, and potentially the cures, for many common, complex diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, bipolar illness, and asthma.", "In congressional testimony Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, described the potential the information generated by the HGP holds for medicine and public health. He stated that \"The human genome sequence provides foundational information that now will allow development of a comprehensive catalog of all of the genome's components, determination of the function of all human genes, and deciphering of how genes and proteins work together in pathways and networks. Completion of the human genome sequence offers a unique opportunity to understand the role of genetic factors in health and disease, and to apply that understanding rapidly to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. This opportunity will be realized through such genomics-based approaches as identification of genes and pathways and determining how they interact with environmental factors in health and disease, more precise prediction of disease susceptibility and drug response, early detection of illness, and development of entirely new therapeutic approaches.\"", "As Collins stated, with completion of the human genome sequence, scientists will now focus on understanding the clinical and public health implications of the sequence information. All disease has a genetic component and therefore genomic research has the potential to substantially reduce the collective burden of disease in the general population. Clinical genetic tests are becoming available at a rapid rate, with 1,013 clinical genetic tests currently available. In addition, private insurers are beginning to include some clinical genetic tests in their health insurance benefits packages as evidence of the tests' clinical validity accumulates. For example, some health plans have coverage policies for specific conditions, such as hereditary cancer testing, Cystic Fibrosis, Tay Sachs disease, and hereditary hemochromatosis.", "These scientific advances in genetics, while promising, are not without potential problems. The ethical, social and legal implications of genetic research have been the subject of significant scrutiny and a portion of the funds for the Human Genome Project are set aside to support the analysis and research of these issues. As scientific knowledge about genetics becomes increasingly widespread, numerous researchers and commentators, including Dr. Francis Collins, have expressed concerns about how this information will used. In congressional testimony, Dr. Collins stated: \"while genetic information and genetic technology hold great promise for improving human heath, they can also be used in ways that are fundamentally unjust. Genetic information can be used as the basis for insidious discrimination....The misuse of genetic information has the potential to be a very serious problem, both in terms of people's access to employment and health insurance and the continued ability to undertake important genetic research.\"", "This concern has encompassed fear of discrimination in many aspects of life, including employment and health and life insurance. A study on discrimination found that a number of institutions, including health and life insurance companies, health care providers, blood banks, adoption agencies, the military and schools, were reported to have engaged in genetic discrimination against asymptomatic individuals. The discriminatory practices included allegedly treating a genetic diagnosis as a preexisting condition for insurance purposes, refusal by an adoption agency to allow a woman at risk for Huntington's disease to adopt based on the woman's genetic risk, and termination from employment after disclosure of a risk of Huntington's disease. Similarly, another study reported that twenty-two percent of the respondents indicated that they or a family member were refused health insurance as a result of a genetic condition.", "Both the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) have countered that there is no convincing evidence that employers or insurers engage in genetic discrimination and that federal legislation to prohibit discrimination based on genetic information is unnecessary. Larry Lorber, representing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, stated in congressional testimony that \"There is little to no evidence of employer collection or misuse of genetic information in today's workplace. This is despite continued predictions that, in the absence of a bill, the fear of increased insurance costs, absenteeism, and low productivity would inevitably drive vast numbers of employers to genetic testing of the workforce and employment discrimination based on genetic makeup. Whether it is due to the threat of liability under existing protections, fear of public backlash, moral concerns or simply a lack of interest, employer collection and misuse of genetic information remains largely confined to the pages of science fiction.\" He goes on to state that, \"the current body of Federal law, including the ADA, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, HIPAA and other Federal laws are more than ample to deal with any misuse of genetic information.\" In discussions with the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society (SACGHS), the Chamber stated that while it does not believe that employers are engaging in genetic discrimination, it does recognize that the fear of potential discrimination may warrant a legislative solution. In addition, America's Health Insurance Plans states that, \"As a matter of practice, health insurance plans do not use or disclose such private health information [genetic information] for purposes outside of normal insurance coverage activities. Moreover, federal and state laws currently prohibit the inappropriate use of genetic information.\"", "Legal cases of genetic discrimination have been few. However, studies have shown that public fear of discrimination is substantial and negatively influences the uptake of genetic testing and the use of genetic information by consumers and health professionals. SACGHS learned that 68% of Americans are concerned about who would have access to their personal genetic information; 31% state this concern would prevent them from having a genetic test; and 68% agree that insurers would do everything possible to use genetic information to deny health coverage. A 2004 survey conducted by the Genetics and Public Policy Center found that 92% of Americans oppose employer access to personal genetic information and 80% oppose access to this information by health insurers. In addition, SACGHS as well as its predecessor Committee, the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing (SACGT), sponsored two public forums to gather perspectives on genetic discrimination. Many comments were received from patients, consumers, health professionals, scientists, genetic test developers, educators, industry representatives, policymakers, lawyers, students and others representing a wide range of diverse ethnic and racial groups. The comments and testimony revealed several anecdotal cases of discrimination. SACGT sent two letters to the Secretary of HHS urging support for nondiscrimination protections:", "During consultations with the public SACGT heard from many Americans who are concerned about the misuse of genetic information by third parties, such as health insurers and employers, and the potential for discrimination based on that information. Many stated that fear of genetic discrimination would dissuade them from undergoing a genetic test or participating in genetic research studies. Others stated that they would pay out of pocket for a genetic test to prevent the results from being placed in their medical record. Such concerns are a deterrent to advances in the field of genetic testing and may limit the realization of the benefits of genetic testing.", "The SACGHS held a half day session where it heard testimony from members of the public, health care providers, insurers, employers and other stakeholders. This testimony revealed actual cases of genetic discrimination as well as considerable fear of genetic discrimination and altered behavior due to this fear. The Committee compiled the comments it received both orally and in writing, produced a DVD highlighting the oral testimony it received, and provided an extensive legal analysis concluding that current law does not provide adequate protection against genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. This information was shared with the Secretary of HHS, with a recommendation that it also be shared with key Members of Congress. The Committee was interested in independently investigating the claims made by opponents that genetic discrimination was not occurring and that current law provides adequate protection against discrimination.", "A joint report by the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Department of Justice summarized the various studies on discrimination based on genetic information and argued for the enactment of federal legislation. The report stated that \"genetic predisposition or conditions can lead to workplace discrimination, even in cases where workers are healthy and unlikely to develop disease or where the genetic condition has no effect on the ability to perform work\" and that \"because an individual's genetic information has implications for his or her family members and future generations, misuse of genetic information could have intergenerational effects that are far broader than any individual incident of misuse.\" Concluding that existing protections are minimal, the report went on to call for the enactment of legislation which states that (1) employers should not require or request that employees or potential employees take a genetic test or provide genetic information as a condition of employment or benefits, (2) employers should not use genetic information to discriminate against, limit, segregate, or classify employees, and (3) employers should not obtain or disclose genetic information about employees or potential employees under most circumstances. According to the Labor Department report, employers should be able to (1) use genetic information for monitoring for the effects of a particular substance in the workplace under certain circumstances, and (2) disclose genetic information for research and other purposes with the written, informed consent of the individuals. In addition, the report states that the statutory authority of federal agencies or contractors to promulgate regulations, enforce workplace safety and health laws, or conduct occupational or other health research should not be limited.", "The National Council on Disability (NCD), an independent federal agency that advises the President and Congress on issues affecting individuals with disabilities, published a position paper arguing for the enactment of federal legislation prohibiting genetic discrimination on March 4, 2002. The NCD argues that recent advances in genetic research have brought an increasing potential for genetic discrimination, that genetic discrimination is a historical and current reality, that genetic discrimination undermines the purposes of genetic research and testing, that genetic test information has little value for purposes of making employment decisions and insurance decisions, and that existing laws are insufficient to protect individuals from genetic discrimination.", "President Bush has also made the prohibition of genetic discrimination one of the key components of his health care reform agenda. In his June 2001 radio address to the nation, the President stated that, \"Genetic discrimination is unfair to workers and their families. It is unjustified - among other reasons, because it involves little more than medical speculation. A genetic predisposition toward cancer or heart disease does not mean the condition will develop. To deny employment or insurance to a healthy person based only on a predisposition violates our country's belief in equal treatment and individual merit.\" The Administration has indicated that it favors enactment of legislation to prohibit the improper use of genetic information in health insurance and employment.", "It should be emphasized that legal issues relating to genetics may vary depending on whether insurance, employment or other types of discrimination, or medical research are involved. Approaches to addressing the issues raised in these contexts vary from taking no legislative action, addressing certain specific concerns (as was done in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), or more far reaching approaches such as comprehensive legislation on genetics or legislation focused on all medical records, including genetic information.", "Generally legal issues raised regarding genetics have been based on two main concepts: privacy and discrimination. The privacy interests of an individual in his or her genetic information have been seen as significant and protecting these interests is seen as making discriminatory actions based on this information less likely. However, another approach would be to prohibit this potential misuse of the information by prohibiting discrimination. Some statutes, like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 et seq., take a two-pronged approach to similar issues regarding medical information about disabilities by both protecting the confidentiality of the information and by prohibiting discriminatory acts.", "Currently there are no federal laws that directly and comprehensively address the issues raised by the use of genetic information. There are, however, a few laws that address parts of these issues but the only federal law that directly addresses the issue of discrimination based on genetic information is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). On February 8, 2000, President Clinton issued an executive order prohibiting discrimination against federal employees based on protected genetic information. On December 20, 2000, the Department of Health and Human Services issued final regulations on medical privacy which are not specific to genetics but cover all personal health information, including genetic information. This rule went into effect on April 14, 2001 but was amended in 2002. In addition, many states have enacted laws which vary widely in their approaches to the protection of genetic information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Discrimination", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)", "paragraphs": ["P.L. 104 - 191 , the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), has been hailed as taking \"important steps toward banning genetic discrimination in health insurance\" but has also been criticized as not going far enough. The act prohibits a group health plan or issuer of a group health plan from using genetic information to establish rules for eligibility or continued eligibility and provides that genetic information shall not be treated as a preexisting condition in the absence of the diagnosis of the condition related to such information. It also prohibits a group health plan or issuer of a group health plan from using genetic information in setting a premium contribution. These protections apply to individuals within the group plans; they do not apply to the acceptance of the whole group or to the premiums set for the group. Thus, HIPAA prohibits group health plans or issuers of group health plans from charging an individual a higher premium than a similarly situated individual; however, the law does not prevent an entire group from being charged more.", "The act would not prohibit group health plans or issuers of plans (i.e., insurers) from requiring or requesting genetic testing, does not require them to obtain authorization before disclosing genetic information, and does not prevent them from excluding all coverage for a particular condition or imposing lifetime caps on all benefits or on specific benefits.

The threshold issue in any ADA case is whether the individual alleging discrimination is an individual with a disability. The act defines the term disability with respect to an individual as having \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual, (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such an impairment.\" Although the statutory language of the ADA does not reference genetic traits, there was a discussion of the issue during congressional debate. So far there have been no judicial decisions but one case was brought by the EEOC and settled. In addition, Terri Seargent filed with the EEOC alleging genetic discrimination and received a determination on November 21, 2000 that the EEOC's investigation supported her allegation of discrimination under the ADA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EEOC Interpretation of the ADA Regarding Genetic Discrimination", "paragraphs": ["The ADA has been interpreted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as including genetic information relating to illness, disease, or other disorders. The legislative history was cited by the EEOC in its guidance to the definition of disability for its compliance manual. In this guidance, the EEOC examined the definition of disability under the ADA, noting that the definition was composed of three prongs: disability means (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual, (2) a record of such an impairment, or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment. It was under the third prong that the EEOC determined that discrimination based on genetic information relating to illness, disease, or other disorders was prohibited.", "Although this EEOC interpretation was widely heralded as a significant step for the protection of rights for individuals whose genes indicate an increased susceptibility to illness, disease or other disorders, it is limited in its application and may be even more limited after the recent Supreme Court decisions on the definition of disability. However, the EEOC has not withdrawn this guidance and at Senate hearings, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller stated that the ADA \"can be interpreted to prohibit employment discrimination based on genetic information. However, the ADA does not explicitly address the issue and its protections are limited and uncertain.\" In addition, Commissioner Miller observed that even if the ADA were found to cover genetic discrimination, the requirements of the ADA may not protect workers from all types of genetic discrimination. He stated, \"for example, the ADA does not protect workers from requirements or requests to provide genetic information to their employers....In addition, once the applicant is hired, the employer may request that the employee take a medical exam, such as a genetic test, if the employer can demonstrate that the information from that test is job related and consistent with business necessity.\"", "The first ADA case alleging genetic discrimination was filed with the EEOC by Terri Seargent. Ms. Seargent, whose situation was extensively discussed during Senate debate on genetic discrimination in the 106 th Congress, had a promising career as a manager for a small insurance broker in North Carolina. She had positive performance evaluations but after medical tests determined that she had Alpha 1 Antitrypson Deficiency, a condition that affects the lungs and liver, and she began taking expensive medication, she was terminated from her employment. Ms. Seargent filed with the EEOC alleging genetic discrimination and received a determination on November 21, 2000 that the EEOC's investigation supported her allegation of discrimination under the ADA.", "The EEOC settled its first court action challenging the use of workplace genetic testing under the ADA against Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway (BNSF). The settlement, announced on April 18, 2001, ended genetic testing of employees who filed claims for work-related injuries based on carpal tunnel syndrome. EEOC Commissioner Paul Steven Miller stated \"The Commission will continue to respond aggressively to any evidence that employers are asking for or using genetic tests in a manner that violates the ADA. Employers must understand that basing employment decisions on genetic testing is barred under the ADA's 'regarded as' prong, as stated in EEOC's 1995 policy guidance on the definition of the term 'disability.' Moreover, genetic testing, as conducted in this case, also violates the ADA as an unlawful medical exam.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supreme Court ADA Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Although the combination of the ADA's legislative history and the EEOC's guidance has led commentators to argue that the ADA would cover genetic discrimination, the merit of these arguments has been uncertain since there have been no reported cases holding that the ADA prohibits genetic discrimination. This uncertainty has increased in light of Supreme Court decisions on the definition of disability under the ADA.", "The first Supreme Court ADA case to address the definition of disability was Bragdon v. Abbott , a 1998 case involving a dentist who refused to treat an HIV infected individual outside of a hospital. In Bragdon, the Court found that the plaintiff's asymptomatic HIV infection was a physical impairment impacting on the major life activity of reproduction thus rending HIV infection a disability under the ADA. In two 1999 cases the Court examined the definitional issue whether the effects of medication or assistive devices should be taken into consideration in determining whether or not an individual has a disability. The Court in the landmark decisions of Sutton v. United Airlines and Murphy v. United Parcel Service, Inc., held, contrary to the interpretation given by the EEOC, that the determination of whether an individual has a disability should be made with reference to mitigating measures. In reaching this holding, the Court looked to the first prong of the definition of disability (having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual) and emphasized that the phrase \"substantially limits\" appears in the present indicative verb form \"requiring that a person be presently\u2014not potentially or hypothetically\u2014substantially limited in order to demonstrate a disability....A person whose physical or mental impairment is corrected by medication or other measures does not have an impairment that presently 'substantially limits' a major life activity.\" In Albertsons Inc. v. Kirkingburg the Court held unanimously that the ADA requires proof that the limitation on a major life activity by the impairment is substantial. The Court in Sutton also looked at the findings enacted as part of the ADA which stated that \"some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities\" and found that this figure was inconsistent with the argument that the statute covered individuals without looking at the mitigating effects of medications or devices. The individualized nature of the inquiry into whether an individual was an individual with a disability was emphasized.", "More recently the Court held in Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams, that to be an individual with a disability under the act, an individual must have substantial limitations that are central to daily life, not just limited to a particular job. The Court held that \"to be substantially limited in performing manual tasks, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives.\" Significantly, the Court also stated that \"[t]he impairment's impact must also be permanent or long-term.\"", "Although the Court's decision in Sutton did not turn on the third prong of the definition of disability (being \"regarded as having such an impairment\") the Court did address the interpretation of this part of the definition. There are two ways, the Court stated, that an individual can fall within the \"regarded as\" prong: (1) a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, or (2) a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities. The Court found that, on its own, the allegation that an entity has a vision requirement in place does not establish a claim that the entity regards an individual as substantially impaired in the major life activity of working. The term \"substantially limits\" was regarded as significant. It requires \"at a minimum, that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad class of jobs.\" The Court emphasized that it was \"assuming without deciding\" that working is a major life activity and that the EEOC regulations interpreting \"substantially limits\" are reasonable and found that even using the EEOC interpretation, the plaintiffs in Sutton failed to allege adequately that their vision is regarded as an impairment that substantially limits them in a major life activity. Being precluded from being a global airline pilot was not sufficient since they could obtain other, although less lucrative jobs, as regional pilots or pilot instructors.", "The \"regarded as\" prong was directly at issue in Murphy . In Murphy the Court held that the fact that an individual with high blood pressure was unable to meet the Department of Transportation (DOT) safety standards was not sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding whether an individual is regarded as unable to utilize a class of jobs. Like Sutton , the holding in Murphy emphasized the numerous other jobs available to the plaintiff.", "The Supreme Court's decisions on the ADA did not directly address genetic discrimination and it is possible that the ADA could be interpreted to cover a particular genetic defect. However, the reasoning used in the Court's recent decisions appears to make it unlikely that an ADA claim based on genetic discrimination would be successful. There are several factors that lead to this conclusion.", "First, the Supreme Court in Sutton specifically struck down an interpretation by the EEOC regarding the use of mitigating factors and raised questions concerning the validity of the EEOC's interpretation. The Court also found no statutory authority for agency interpretation of the definition of disability. The EEOC had taken the position that whether or not an individual has a disability should be determined by what his or her condition would be without medication or an assistive device. Rejecting this EEOC interpretation, in Sutton the Supreme Court noted that no agency was given the authority to interpret the term \"disability\" but that because both parties accepted the regulations as valid \"we have no occasion to consider what deference they are due, if any.\" Similarly, in Murphy the Court clearly stated that its use of the EEOC regulations did not indicate that the regulations were valid. However, in its earlier decision in Bragdon v. Abbott , the Court had found its conclusion that HIV infection was covered by the ADA to be \"reinforced by administrative guidance issued by the Justice Department....\" The cases subsequent to Bragdon did not examine this seeming contradiction so exactly how a future decision would view EEOC regulations and guidance is uncertain. This issue is especially important regarding potential cases of genetic discrimination since the EEOC has published guidance indicating that the ADA covers genetic discrimination, and there are no reported cases.", "Similarly, the Supreme Court showed little indication to examine the legislative history of the ADA. The Court in Sutton held that it was not necessary to consider the legislative history of the ADA regarding the issue of whether individuals should be examined in their uncorrected state or with the use of mitigating medications or devices. It found that the statutory language was sufficient to support its holding on this issue. Although the issue regarding genetic discrimination is distinct from that of the use of mitigating medications and devices, the Court's general reluctance to examine legislative history in Sutton may indicate that the language on genetic discrimination quoted above from the congressional debates also would not be examined.", "The Court's reliance in Sutton upon the findings in the ADA that 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical disabilities also indicates that the Court may not find genetic defects to be covered. The number of individuals cited in the findings as having a disability was seen by the Court as inconsistent with the argument that the statute covered individuals whose disabilities were mitigated by medications or devices. Since the prevalence of genetic defects is believed to be widespread, coverage of genetic defects could arguably include almost every individual. Thus, it is possible that the Court could use the same rationale as in Sutton to find genetic defects not included.", "In Bragdon v. Abbott, where the Court found that HIV infection was covered under the ADA, the majority opinion spent considerable time discussing the immediate physiological effects of the infection. This would appear to be consistent with the holding in Sutton that the \"substantially limits\" definitional language requires that the substantial limitation not be potential or hypothetical. In addition, in Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams substantial limitations were seen by the Court as those that are central to daily life, not just limited to a particular job. This reasoning could be contrasted to the situation presented by genetic defects which in many cases do not ever manifest. Interestingly, in his dissenting opinion in Bragdon v. Abbott, then Chief Justice Rehnquist, who was in the majority in Sutton , stated that the argument regarding coverage of HIV infection \"taken to its logical extreme, would render every individual with a genetic marker for some debilitating disease 'disabled' here and now because of some possible future effects.\" Whether the Court would now share this view that such coverage of genetic discrimination is an invalid interpretation of the definition is uncertain, especially since the Court in Bragdon was discussing the first prong of the definition, not the \"regarded as\" prong which is the most likely basis for coverage of genetic defects.", "In other cases the Court provided considerable guidance concerning the \"regarded as\" prong of the definition of disability, the most likely aspect of the definition to be used to find coverage of genetic defects. Including the requirement that the individual be regarded as \"substantially limited\" in a major life activity, the Court found that this language meant that being precluded from a particular job was not sufficient to be substantially limited in the major life activity of working if other jobs in the same class could be obtained. And when this specific issue was raised in Murphy , the plaintiff was not found to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working. The main point of this rather complicated discussion is that making the case that one is regarded as substantially limited in a major life activity, particularly the major life activity of working, is likely to be difficult.", "The Supreme Court's decisions do not directly address ADA coverage of genetic discrimination. They emphasize an individualized approach to the determination of whether an individual has a disability under the ADA. Although an argument could be made that the ADA would cover individuals with genetic defects in certain cases, the Court's decisions, particularly Sutton and Murphy , use reasoning that would make it unlikely that most ADA claims based on genetic discrimination would be successful.", "In addition, even assuming the ADA was found to apply, it may not protect employees from having their employers have access to their genetic information. Although the ADA prohibits an employer from making medical inquiries prior to a job offer, the employer may obtain medical information in certain cases after the offer of employment has been made. Assuming that the prohibitions against discrimination in the ADA would apply, it is difficult to prove that genetic information was the reason for discrimination. This raises issues relating to the privacy of genetic information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ADA and Health Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Title III of the ADA provides that no individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation. A place of public accommodation is defined in part as an insurance office. It could be argued that discrimination in insurance on the basis of genetic information would be a violation of Title III of the ADA. However, such an argument would be limited since, in addition to the limitations of the definition of disability discussed previously, the ADA specifically states that Titles I through IV \"shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict an insurer....from underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such risks that are based on or not inconsistent with State law.\" The ADA also provides that this provision \"shall not be used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of titles I and III.\" The issue of insurance was discussed by the Department of Justice in its technical assistance manual which observed that \"[t]he ADA, therefore, does not prohibit use of legitimate actuarial considerations to justify differential treatment of individuals with disabilities in insurance.\" Thus, if an insurer uses legitimate actuarial considerations regarding providing insurance to an individual with a genetic condition, it is unlikely that there would be a violation of the ADA."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Executive Order", "paragraphs": ["On February 9, 2000, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13145 prohibiting genetic discrimination against employees in federal executive departments and agencies.
