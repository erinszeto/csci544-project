Numbers of U.S. forces involved in these operations range from 19,000to just a few hundred. Some have argued that U.S. military operations in these countries areachieving a degree of success and suggest that they may offer some lessons that might be applied inIraq as well as for future GWOT operations. Potential issues for the second session of the 109thCongress include NATO assumption of responsibility for operations in Afghanistan, counterdrugoperations in Afghanistan, a long-term strategy for Africa, and developments in Colombia and thePhilippines.

Troopscurrently in Afghanistan represent the sixth major troop rotation in Operation Enduring Freedom(OEF) since the United States became involved in the fall of 2001. At present, the majority of U.S.ground forces come from the Army's Italy-based 173rd Airborne Brigade and the 1st Brigade of theFort Bragg, North Carolina-based 82nd Airborne Division and Marine elements from the Second (II)MEF from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. U.S. Special Forces are also operating in Afghanistanand are primarily concerned with capturing or killing Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders. In addition,Army units from the Florida National Guard's 53rd Infantry Brigade have been deployed to train theAfghan National Army (ANA). (5) ", "Drawdown of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. InDecember 2004, the Department of Defense (DOD) designated the 3rd and 4th Brigades of the 10thMountain Division from Ft. Drum New York and Ft. Polk, Louisiana and elements of the division'sheadquarters as the primary ground forces and command headquarters for OEF 7. (6) On December 20, 2005, DODannounced that one battalion-sized infantry task force from the 4th Brigade stationed at Ft. Polkwould deploy to Afghanistan to assist in the transition of coalition operations in southernAfghanistan in mid-2006 to NATO. (7) DOD attributes this reduction to NATO's growing presence inAfghanistan as well as continued growth and progress of the Afghan National Army (ANA) andAfghan National Police. (8) DOD's decision to deploy only a portion of the 4th Brigade is expected to bring U.S. troop levels --currently at approximately 19,000 -- to approximately 16,500; a reduction of 2,500 troops. (9) ", "Security for Parliamentary Elections. U.S. andCoalition forces, in conjunction with the Afghan National Army (ANA) and National Police,provided security for Afghanistan's September 18, 2005 nationwide National Assembly andProvincial Council elections. Reports suggest that security efforts were relatively effective, despitea number of insurgent harassing attacks prior to the election, and about 16 of 6,270 elections stationswere not opened because of security-related problems. (10) Shortly after the elections, Afghan President Hamid Karzaireportedly questioned the need for further international military operations within Afghanistan,suggesting that instead a \"stronger political approach focusing on shutting down guerilla trainingcamps and outside financial support\" would be more effective. (11) President Karzai alsosuggested that airstrikes were no longer needed -- a view shared by many as airstrikes have beenresponsible for the deaths and injury of numerous Afghan civilians and has been a past point ofcontention between the United States and the Afghan government.", "Although insurgents failed to follow through on their vows to disrupt September's elections,U.S. military officials contend that the insurgents have recently reasserted themselves -- killinghundreds of civilians, government workers, soldiers and police in bombings and ambushes insouthern and eastern Afghanistan. (12) ", "The commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Army Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry, reportedlysuggested that this pattern would continue and that U.S. and coalition forces would continue to stayon the offensive against insurgents. ", "Operational Issues.", "Changing Insurgent Tactics? A number of reportsnote that in the past months, insurgent tactics have shown an increase in the use of suicide androadside bombings, not unlike the tactics being used by insurgents in Iraq. (13) There have been over 20suicide attacks in Afghanistan since September 2005 including car bomb attacks against U.S. andNATO convoys -- resulting in four NATO deaths -- as well as individuals with explosives strappedto their bodies throwing themselves at vehicles or detonating their explosives in crowds. Most ofthese bombings failed to hit their intended targets but instead killed or wounded Afghan civilians.In one of the more successful attacks, on September 28, 2005, an insurgent dressed in an ANAuniform, blew up a motorcycle near Afghan troops boarding transportation outside their base inKabul, killing 9 soldiers and injuring 28. A top Taliban commander reportedly stated that he hadmore than 200 insurgents willing to become suicide attackers against U.S. and allied forces but theAfghan government dismissed this claim as \"propaganda\"suggesting instead that this was anindication of the insurgent's weakening military power. ", "While U.S. military officials postulate that insurgents no longer have a pool of resources tomount a serious offensive they also acknowledge that insurgent forces are \"far from being on theropes.\" (14) The U.S.military asserts that the insurgents are recruiting younger fighters and staging smaller-scale attacks, often times using a hit-and-run approach as opposed to the major combat operations of the past.According to an unnamed Afghan source with supposed ties to Taliban insurgents, the Taliban havedivided up into groups of 18 to 20 fighters and in each unit there is an Al Qaeda member fromPakistan or an \"Arab\" who teaches the group tactics developed in Iraq. According to this source,\"rogue\" elements from Pakistan's Intelligence Service help to further refine these tactics as wellprovide these groups sanctuary and training in Pakistan, provided these groups return to Afghanistanto fight U.S. and allied forces. ", "In instances where U.S. forces have engaged insurgents, they noted that insurgents were\"extremely resolute and fought to the last man.\" Insurgents were also characterized as well-organizedand reacted well to battlefield situations. Despite this perceived proficiency, the U.S. Army claimsto have killed more than 1,200 insurgents in 2005 -- including a number of senior commanders. U.S.forces have reportedly used small U.S. formations such as platoons (16 to 50 soldiers)to draw outinsurgent forces, who will often \"swarm\" into larger formations to overwhelm the smaller U.S. unit.The smaller U.S. unit then engages the insurgent forces to \"fix\" it, while other infantry units andU.S. airpower engage and destroy it. ", "Combat Operations Against Insurgents. U.S. andcoalition forces continue combat operations, primarily in the border provinces where the Talibancontinue to exert a degree of control. On August 31, 2005, U.S. and ANA forces, backed by attackhelicopters, raided a Taliban camp in the mountains of southern Afghanistan, killing nine suspectedinsurgents. (15) Thiscamp was believed to have sheltered 80 insurgents using it as a base camp to launch attacks inUruzgan province. (16) On September 4 and 5, U.S. and Afghan forces conducted raids in Zabol and Kandahar provinces,killing 25 suspected Taliban and capturing dozens more. (17) ", " Pakistani Involvement. Prior to Afghanistan's September 18 parliamentaryelections, Pakistan reportedly deployed thousands of reinforcements to its borders to help preventinsurgent attacks. (18) According to Pakistani defense officials, about 5,000 additional troops were sent to the NorthwestFrontier Province and approximately 4,500 additional troops were sent to Baluchistan. (19) On September 13,Pakistan conducted an operation with thousands of troops and helicopter gunship support in NorthWaziristan, reportedly destroying a \"major Al Qaeda hideout\" and arresting 21 suspectedmilitants. (20) OnSeptember 29, Pakistan began a series of attacks in North Waziristan region and reportedlyencountered considerable resistance from insurgents, resulting in the deaths of at least five Pakistanisoldiers and an unknown number of insurgents. (21) Despite the significant presence of the Pakistani Army inPakistan's Tribal Zone bordering Afghanistan, the Taliban and Al Qaeda are said to be rallying inthe Waziristan region. (22) According to reports, there appears to be evidence that Arab, Uzbek, and Chechen fighters linkedto Al Qaeda are operating in that area and openly recruiting local tribesman to fight in their \"jihad\"against the Pakistani Army and U.S. forces in Afghanistan. (23) This has supposedlyresulted in fighting between local tribesman that have aligned themselves with the Pakistani Armyand those siding with the insurgent. (24) ", "Renewed Fighting. U.S. and Afghan forces continuedoffensive operations against insurgents after Afghan parliamentary elections and on September 23coalition ground forces, backed by helicopter gunships, killed 14 suspected Taliban fighters inUruzgan province. (25) On September 24, a U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down by insurgents in southernZabul province, killing all five crew members. (26) On October 8, a U.S. soldier patrolling in Helmand provincestepped on a land mine and became the 200th U.S. service member killed in Afghanistan since theU.S. invaded in 2001. (27) On October 11 in Helmand province, insurgents ambushed a convoy of 150 Afghan police officers,killing 19 officers. (28) ", " U.S. Desecration of Taliban Dead. In mid-October, allegations thatU.S. soldiers had burned the bodies of two dead Taliban fighters and then used their corpses forpropaganda purposes against the insurgents emerged after the event was broadcasted on Australiantelevision. (29) According to reports, U.S. soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade burned the two bodies --supposedly for hygiene reasons as none of the local inhabitants would claim the bodies and affordthem a Muslim burial -- and then U.S. Psychological Operations soldiers used the bodies to tauntinsurgent fighters believed to be in the area. Cremation is prohibited by the Muslim faith and respectfor the body of the dead is also a central tenet of the religion. This act was strongly condemned byAfghan President Karzai and raised fears that such an act would further damage the United State'simage to Muslims, given the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal as well as other allegations ofprisoner abuse in both Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. CENTCOM, which commands operations in Iraqand Afghanistan, quickly condemned the actions of the U.S. troops involved, reportedly stating that\"desecration, abuse or inappropriate treatment of enemy combatants were never condoned and thatthese actions violated U.S. policy and the Geneva Convention.\" U.S. Army Major General JasonKamiya, the commander of Joint Task Force 76, the U.S.-led force that operates in eastern andsouthern Afghanistan, reportedly halted all tactical psychological operations the day after he wasinformed of the incident and ordered an immediate investigation. It is not known if those soldiersinvolved were punished for the incident, but extensive training was ordered to deal with what U.S.military officials described as an \"emerging gap\" between Afghanistan's Islamic culture and whatis permissible under the Geneva Convention. ", "Continued Offensive Operations Against Insurgents. On October 16, U.S. forces - mainly U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd MarineDivision, from Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii - conducted a seven day battalion-level (800 Marines)offensive operation with about 300 ANA soldiers and U.S. Army forces and U.S. air support. (30) Dubbed Operation Pil (theDari word for \"elephant\") this operation was aimed at disrupting enemy activities and sanctuariesin Afghanistan's Kunar province. No U.S. troops were killed during the operation and there were noestimates of the number of enemy killed. On October 29, a U.S. and British soldier were killed - theAmerican during a patrol in Khost province and the British soldier while on patrol in the city ofMazar-e Sharif. (31) OnOctober 30, two U.S. soldiers with the Alabama National Guard's 926th Engineers were reportedlycharged with assaulting two Afghan prisoners and both soldiers -- still serving in Afghanistan --could face court-martial. (32) On December 5, two U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopters were hitby enemy fire - one in Kandahar province and one in Uruzgan province - and made emergencylandings, resulting in minor injuries to their occupants. (33) On December 6, U.S. and Afghan forces reportedly killed nineTaliban insurgents in Uruzgan province and 13 insurgents were killed in joint operations inKandahar province on December 7. (34) On December 15, one U.S. soldier was killed during a firefightin Kandahar province and another was killed on December 28 by a roadside bomb while anotherwas killed in a vehicle accident. (35) According to reports, 2005 was the deadliest year for the U.S.military in Afghanistan with 91 service members killed as of December 29, 2005 by fighting andaccidents. (36) ", "Predator Strike in Pakistan. On January 13, 2006, anarmed CIA Predator unmanned aircraft reportedly launched an airstrike on the Pakistani village ofDamadola near the Afghan border, possibly killing four top Al Qaeda leaders but also killing 13 Pakistani villagers -- sparking angry, nation-wide protests in Pakistan. (37) The target of the raid, AlQaeda's alleged second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, apparently escaped or was not present atthe insurgent's meeting. Those four Al Qaeda leaders believed to have been killed in the raidincluded a supposed chemical weapons expert, a public relations and recruitment chief, and AlQaeda's operations chief responsible for planning attacks on U.S. and coalition forces on the Afghanborder. If these reports are true, some experts believe that this could be a significant blow to AlQaeda as these men were considered very experienced leaders who will be difficult to replace.", "Permanent Presence and Bases inAfghanistan? (38) There are indications that the United States may seek permanentmilitary bases in Afghanistan. The United States is upgrading military facilities in Afghanistan --primarily at the airbases of Bagram and Kandahar, which are currently being equipped with newrunways. At Bagram airbase, the United States hopes to have a new 11,800-foot runway built byMarch 2006, along with a hospital, and facilities to accommodate 1,000 service members. (39) At Kandahar airbase, U.S.forces are expanding and widening the damaged 7,900-foot runway for both military and civilian airtraffic. (40) Afghan leadersare said to be seeking a \"long-term strategic partnership\" with the United States and other friendlycountries to avoid a strategic disengagement by the international community like the West's 1990sdisengagement that helped to bring the Taliban to power. Senior U.S. military and governmentofficials have acknowledged that bases, and perhaps pre-positioned U.S. military equipment, are apossibility, but note that there are numerous regional sensitivities to such a plan. Some believe thatthe importance of these bases in Afghanistan was emphasized when Uzbekistan evicted the U.S.military from a key airbase in July 2005 -- a base that had been used to ship troops, equipment, andsupplies to forces to Afghanistan.

ISAF operates under a series of U.N. mandates and conducts security patrols in Kabul andsurrounding districts and runs several Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) located throughoutAfghanistan. In addition, ISAF coordinates Civil Military Cooperation projects throughout the areaof operations.

The Italian Rapid DeploymentCorps will command ISAF until May 2006 and then relinquish command to the British-ledmulti-national Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), which will command ISAFfor nine months. (45) InFebruary 2005, NATO agreed to expand ISAF coverage into southern Afghanistan, providingsecurity assistance to an estimated 50 percent of Afghanistan. (46) On September 28, theGerman Parliament voted in favor of extending Germany's mandate in Afghanistan until October2006 and will expand its forces assigned to ISAF from 2,250 to 3,000 troops. (47) France reportedlyannounced on December 18 that it would send an additional 450 troops by mid-2006 to support the600 French troops that are currently part of ISAF. (48) France also has about 200 special forces troops deployed insouthern Afghanistan. (49) Despite these commitments of additional troops, there continues to be a great deal of concernamongst certain U.S. allies about ISAF working more closely with the U.S. counterterrorism effortin Afghanistan. France, Germany, and Spain do not want ISAF leadership to also take overleadership of counterterror operations - a position supported by the United States and GreatBritain. (50) Reportedly,discussions were underway to find a way whereby France and Germany would permit NATO tocommand both ISAF and counterterror operations but not participate directly in theseoperations. (51) ", "On November 14, Taliban insurgents killed a German ISAF member and wounded two othersin a suicide car attack in Kabul. (52) This attack, along with other recent incidents, have raisedsecurity concerns amongst NATO nations. The Netherlands, one of a reported thirteen nations thatwill lead NATO's expansion in 2006, has raised questions publically about the sufficiency of plannedNATO forces to handle serious trouble. (53) The Dutch plan to deploy about 1,000 to 1,400 troops tosouthern Afghanistan, and Britain and Canada are also expected to send additional forces to theregion; non-NATO members New Zealand and Australia might also provide forces for theexpansion. (54) OnJanuary 10, 2006, the Australian Defense Minister reportedly announced that Australia would sendan additional 110 special forces soldiers and two helicopters in support of 190 Australian troopsalready in Afghanistan. (55) By adding an additional 6,000 troops to the 9,000 already a partof ISAF, the United States may be able to decrease the number of forces it has in Afghanistan.

(56) This merger is expectedto occur in mid to late 2006 and essentially involves NATO expansion into southern Afghanistanand other volatile regions of the country such as the Pakistani border region. Command arrangementsfor this merger and peacekeeping versus counterterror roles quickly became points of contention formany NATO countries who felt that placing both missions under a single NATO commander wouldbe counterproductive and that having NATO troops keeping the peace and at the same timeconducting combat operations against insurgents would result in widespread Afghan resentment andoverall mission failure. On November 14, NATO agreed to a plan where there would be a singlechain of command for all operations under an ISAF commander, but a deputy commander would bemade responsible for counterinsurgency operations. (57) Under this plan, NATO agreed that British, Dutch, andCanadian troops would spearhead NATO's move into southern Afghanistan while Germany wouldtake over the north, and Italy and Spain would retain responsibility for western Afghanistan. (58) ", "Dutch Concerns Over Deploying to SouthernAfghanistan. The Netherlands currently has approximately 625 troops currentlyserving in Afghanistan and under NATO's expansion plan, are due to provide an additional 1,000to 1,400 troops to serve in Urzuzgan province in the south. (59) The Dutch government,based on a Dutch intelligence service report, are concerned that their forces may be operating in aparticularly dangerous area and have sought assurances that additional military support would beavailable in the event of significant levels of violence in the region. (60) The Dutch government hasgiven Parliament - who are reportedly deeply divided over the issue -- the authority to approve orreject the deployment and a vote on the issue is scheduled for February 2. (61) This situation is causingdifficulty amongst other NATO members, the majority of whom suggest that they would be\"hard-pressed\" to make up for the Dutch shortfall should the Dutch Parliament vote \"No\" to sendingforces to the southern region. (62) In this event, the United States, already operating in the region,might be required to make up for the shortfall of forces, possibly affecting recently announced plansto decrease force levels by 2,500 troops. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, a formerDutch defense minister, is reportedly putting pressure on the Dutch government to honor its troopcommitment and former U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, Paul Bremer, reportedly suggestedthat the U.S. Congress might act against Dutch economic interests if Dutch troops are not deployedas planned.

Some question how effective NATO will be in its new role, particularly when many of its members are unwilling to place their troops in potentially hostilesituations and only a few member nations are willing to commit their forces to counterterror andcounterinsurgency operations. If only a few NATO's 26 members are willing to engage incounterterror and counterinsurgency operations, then NATO's ability to sustain these operations overan extended period -- against an insurgency that has shown a great deal of resiliency and has shownno signs relenting their attacks against coalition forces -- could be called into question.

(68) In order for PRTs toachieve their full potential the Defense official suggests the following improvements: ", "Either create more PRTs or extend the operational reach of the current 22 PRTswith mini-PRTs into key districts throughout Afghanistan;", "Each PRT should be equipped the best communications possible, additionaltransportation assets, and receive substantially more funding for a diverse array ofprojects;", "PRTs need a broad range of development and civilian governance expertiseand civilians with the PRTs must have both the authority and resources to play a leadershiprole;", "The civil-military coordination on PRTs must improvesignificantly;", "PRTs need to improve their ability to measure the effectiveness of theiractivities.
