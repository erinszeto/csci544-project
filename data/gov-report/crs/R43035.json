While the overall objectives of U.S. policy towards the country remain in place\u2014the establishment of civilian democratic government based on the rule of law and the protection of basic human rights\u2014the Obama Administration has moved from a more reactive, \"action-for-action\" strategy and a skeptical and cautious attitude towards the newly created Union Government and Union Parliament to a more proactive mode. The new approach is designed to foster further reforms based on some form of partnership with the Union Government, headed by President Thein Sein.", "During the last two years, the Obama Administration has conducted much of its policy towards Burma using existing constitutional and legal authority, while regularly consulting with Congress about the actions taken. The 112th Congress passed five laws containing provisions related to U.S. policy in Burma. Three laws\u2014P.L. 112-33, P.L. 112-36, and P.L. 112-163\u2014extended the general import ban contained in Section 3 of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 (2003 BFDA, P.L. 108-61) which is subject to annual renewal. P.L. 112-74 placed restrictions on the use in Burma of appropriated funds for certain Defense and State Department programs. P.L. 112-192 granted the Secretary of the Treasury the option of instructing the U.S. Executive Director at any international financial institution to \"vote in favor of the provision of assistance for Burma by the institution, notwithstanding any other provision of law\" if the President has determined that to do so is in the national interest of the United States. The 113th Congress will have the opportunity to decide what role it will play in the future course of U.S. policy in Burma.", "The Administration's Burma policy in 2011 and 2012 may be characterized as the combination of increasing engagement with Burma's Union Government, Union Parliament, and selected opposition groups, and the waiving or easing of many of the existing economic sanctions imposed on Burma by various laws, including the 2003 BFDA and the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-286). However, the Administration may decide that it is approaching the limit of actions it can take with regard to easing of sanctions without Congress passing new legislation.", "Some critics of the Obama Administration say that it has moved too fast and too far in easing the existing sanctions, given the continued reports of serious human rights violations and significant restrictions on civil liberties. Other critics think the Administration has moved too slowly and cautiously in waiving sanctions, hindering the reform process in Burma and blocking greater U.S. participation in Burma's economic development.", "Certain key issues with regard to Burma's political situation may be important to the future course of U.S. policy in Burma. First, President Thein Sein's vision for Burma's \"disciplined democracy\" has not been clearly elaborated, and his commitment to further reforms remains untested. Second, the view of Burma's military leadership on political reforms is uncertain. Third, the path for possible reconciliation between the country's Burman majority and various ethnic minorities is unclear."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview", "paragraphs": ["During the preceding two decades, Congress played an active and at times leading role in setting U.S. policy towards Burma. Since Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), transferred power to a quasi-civilian government in March 2011, Congress has been largely deferential to the decisions of the White House, the Department of State, and the Department of the Treasury on the conduct of U.S. policy towards Burma. With a few important exceptions, adjustments in U.S. policy towards Burma over the last two years have been done using executive authority granted by the U.S. Constitution or existing legislation. The Obama Administration has consulted regularly with the congressional committees with jurisdiction, as well as with key Members of Congress, as it made changes in bilateral relations. However, the Obama Administration has used much of its discretionary authority and may require direct congressional action to implement additional changes in U.S. policy towards Burma. In addition, Congress may determine it is time to reassess the situation in Burma and to resume its more active role in the determination of U.S. policy towards this politically dynamic country.", "The Obama Administration has ushered in a new approach to U.S. relations with Burma (Myanmar). On September 28, 2009, the State Department announced a change in U.S. policy towards Burma after seven months of review, discussion, and consultation. The existing sanctions regime would remain in place, but new elements of U.S. policy were added. First, the Administration announced its willingness to engage in direct dialogue with Burma's ruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), on how to promote democracy and human rights in Burma. Second, it sought to cooperate to a greater extent with the SPDC on international security issues, such as nuclear nonproliferation and counternarcotics efforts. ", "The Obama policy would also continue to pursue the same goals of the two preceding administrations\u2014namely, to support \"a unified, peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Burma that respects the human rights of its citizens.\" In order to achieve these goals, the Obama Administration would press Burma's military leaders to release all its political prisoners, end all its conflicts with ethnic minorities, cease its human rights violations, and initiate \"a credible internal political dialogue with the democratic opposition and ethnic minority leaders on elements of reconciliation and reform.\" It would also call for Burma to sever its political and military ties to North Korea and abandon its alleged nuclear weapons program. In addition, the Obama Administration would continue to communicate with other nations and coordinate their respective policies towards Burma.", "The months following the announcement of a new U.S. policy towards Burma would see the nation undergo a dramatic political transformation. The SPDC called for and held parliamentary elections in November 2010, the first such elections in 20 years. A few days after the election, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. While the conduct of the elections was far from free and fair by international standards, the SPDC abided by the results of those elections. On March 30, 2011, the SPDC transferred power to a quasi-civilian government (most of the leaders are ex-generals and one-quarter of the members of the parliament are military officers) under the provisions of a new constitution largely written by the SPDC and purportedly approved by a public plebiscite in 2008.", "Since assuming power, Burma's quasi-civilian government, led by President Thein Sein\u2014ex-general in the Burmese military and the SPDC's last prime minister\u2014has undertaken a number of political and economic reforms that many see as encouraging signs. Hundreds of political prisoners have been released from detention and a few of Burma's more oppressive laws have been repealed or amended by Burma's Union Parliament. In April 2012, Burma held parliamentary by-elections in which Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi and her political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won 43 of the 46 seats. While the conduct of the by-elections was still flawed, the acceptance of the results by the Thein Sein administration and the Burmese military was generally seen as a positive political development.", "Over the last two years, the Obama Administration has responded to such promising developments in Burma by enhancing and increasing high-level meetings with the Thein Sein government and selectively easing many of the existing sanctions on Burma. Since adopting the new Burma policy, the first U.S. ambassador to Burma in 20 years has been appointed, Hillary Clinton became the first Secretary of State in over 50 years to visit Burma, and President Obama subsequently became the first U.S. President to visit Burma while in office. Many of the specific sanctions on Burma\u2014including the general ban on importing Burmese goods, the ban on new investments in Burma, and the restrictions on the provision of financial services to Burma\u2014have been waived using presidential authority provided by the laws imposing sanctions on Burma. Plans are underway to increase U.S. assistance to Burma, including the reopening of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) mission in Burma after a 23-year hiatus.", "Even with the various changes that have taken place in Burma since the quasi-civilian government took power, the political and economic situation in the country remains serious, and the reforms are generally viewed as fragile and reversible. Despite ongoing negotiations and the signing of 12 preliminary ceasefire agreements, fighting between the Burmese military, or Tatmadaw, and various ethnic-based militias continues across the country. Fighting is particularly serious in the Kachin State, with regular reports of the Tatmadaw committing serious human rights violations against civilians in conflict areas. Rioting in Rakhine State in western Burma has uncovered festering ethnic tensions in the country. While the Union Parliament has passed some laws providing better protection of civil liberties, many of the country's more oppressive laws (including a few dating back to British colonial rule) remain on the books. The NLD was able to register and compete in the April 2012 by-elections, but several other political parties have not been allowed to register or refuse to register because some of their members remain in detention for political reasons. In spite of multiple prisoner releases since May 2011, over 200 political prisoners are being held in Burma's prisons.", "The 113 th Congress may choose to consider a number of different issues raised by the Obama Administration's Burma policy, as well as Burma's political and economic development, including:", "Is President Thein Sein's government committed to democracy and the protection of human rights in Burma, and does it have the ability to continue to implement reforms? Will it be able to work with the Union Parliament and the Burmese military to promote political and economic reform? Is U.S. policy too closely tied to President Thein Sein's government, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and the NLD to the neglect of developing relations with Burma's ethnic minorities and their representative organizations? What can the United States do to encourage progress in the ongoing negotiations between the Burmese government and the various ethnic-based organizations? Has the Obama Administration moved too quickly or too slowly in its easing of sanctions? What would have to occur in Burma in order for the sanctions to be removed or the waivers reversed? Are the current sanctions on Burma being fully and properly enforced in accordance with the law? What types of aid or assistance should the United States provide to support Burma? How does U.S. policy towards Burma fit with the Obama Administration's rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region and its objectives in Southeast Asia? What role does Burma play in the geopolitical dynamic between China and India and relations within Southeast Asia?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Evolution of Obama's Burma Policy", "paragraphs": ["Many observers trace the origins of the Obama Administration's Burma policy to a 2007 article in Foreign Affairs , co-authored by Michael Green and Derek Mitchell. In their article, Green and Mitchell stated that U.S. policy towards Burma at the time was \"stuck,\" and wrote that a change in approach was necessary to press Burma's ruling military junta to undertake political and economic reforms. The changes recommended by Green and Mitchell in their article are very similar to those announced by the State Department in September 2009\u2014direct engagement with the country's military regime and the continuation of sanctions.", "While the conceptual basis of Obama's Burma policy may have been set, the Obama Administration's attitude and approach towards Burma has seemingly evolved over time. Initially, the White House and the key figures in handling U.S. relations with Burma expressed some skepticism and reservations about the quasi-civilian Union Government, its leadership, and the prospects for significant political and economic reform. The Obama Administration also appeared to keep President Thein Sein's administration at arm's length, and made efforts to balance relations with the new government with contact with Aung San Suu Kyi, other opposition parties, and representatives of ethnic groups. ", "Over time, and in response to various actions by the Burmese government, the Obama Administration's assessment of President Thein Sein and his government became more optimistic, and ties between the two governments became closer\u2014possibly, in the view of some experts, at the expense of relations with Burma's opposition parties and ethnic groups. After the NLD agreed to participate in parliamentary by-elections in April 2012, U.S. policy shifted to a focus on promoting perceived progressive forces within the Thein Sein government and isolating individuals and organizations considered anti-reform. U.S. officials now speak of a partnership with President Thein Sein's government. For example, following his meeting with President Thein Sein in Rangoon, President Obama said, \"we will continue to work with [you] as the partner with the United States.\" As a consequence, U.S. relations with the traditional opposition parties and ethnic organizations may have suffered.", "In addition to the apparent closer realignment of the United States towards President Thein Sein and the Union Government, the Obama Administration also switched from an approach of responding to positive developments in Burma with graduated relaxation of sanctions\u2014often referred to as an \"action for action\" approach\u2014to one that attempts to foster or promote further reforms. Whereas in the past senior U.S. officials spoke of the need for Burma to demonstrate that conditions have improved enough to warrant the waving of sanctions, more recent statements from the Obama Administration have focused on creating an environment in Burma where more reforms can occur. ", "These two shifts in the Obama Administration's Burma policy\u2014reliance on the Thein Sein government and trying to get out in front of Burma's reforms\u2014have become a matter of some debate among Burma experts and various interest groups. Some observers are concerned that the Obama Administration has moved too fast and too far in rewarding comparatively modest progress towards the attainment of U.S. goals in Burma. Other observers think that the White House has been too slow and too cautious in its actions, and worry that the sanctions that remain in effect are hindering reforms in Burma, placing the United States at a disadvantage in influencing political and economic developments there. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Policy Towards the SPDC", "paragraphs": ["Following its announcement of a new Burma policy, the Obama Administration held several direct discussions with SPDC officials. On November 15, 2009, both President Obama and then Prime Minister General Thein Sein attended the first ASEAN-U.S. leaders meeting in Singapore. ", "Although it held a series of high-level meetings with the SPDC, the Obama Administration made it clear that the existing U.S. sanctions on Burma would remain in place \"until we see concrete progress towards reform.\" The Obama Administration also reserved the right to implement or recommend additional, targeted sanctions if warranted by circumstances inside Burma. Alternatively, the Obama Administration stated it might relax sanctions or call for the removal of sanctions if the political situation in Burma meets the specified criteria set in existing U.S. law. ", "The comments by the Obama Administration may have been partially based on the tense political situation in Burma in 2010. The NLD and several other pro-democracy parties had decided not to participate in the November elections because of what they considered unfair and restrictive election laws; several ethnic parties either were prohibited from participating in the election or chose not to participate because some of their members were detained in prison. The SPDC, meanwhile, transformed the Union Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), a civil organization created by the SPDC in 1993 to support the policies and activities of the Burmese military, into a political party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), with SPDC Prime Minister Thein Sein as its leader.", "In addition, the SPDC announced that in accord with the new constitution, all the ethnic militias would be transformed into Border Guard Forces (BGF) under the command of the Burmese military or face the possible abrogation of the existing ceasefire agreements and the resumption of hostilities. In August 2009, the refusal of the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army operating in the Kokang region of northern Shan State to join the BGF resulted in a military offensive which led to more than 30,000 refugees fleeing over the border to China. On November 11, 2010, fighting broke out between the Burmese military and the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N), which had also rejected its transformation into a BGF. Over the next few months, conflicts between the Burmese military and several other ethnic militias erupted across much of eastern Burma.", "Another potential source of the Obama Administration's cautious response to Burma's political transition may have been reports about Burma's alleged nuclear weapons program and arms trade with North Korea. In 2009, U.S. naval vessels monitored a cargo ship allegedly carrying arms and weapons materials from North Korea to Burma in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) released a report in January 2010 warning that sufficient evidence existed that Burma was exploring the development of nuclear weapons. In June 2010, Al Jazeera aired a special report, \"Burma's Nuclear Ambitions,\" that claimed that the SPDC had an active program to develop nuclear weapons, and was receiving technical support from North Korea. Although many experts doubt Burma's technical ability to develop a nuclear weapons program, the apparent continuation of arms trade prohibited by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 was a major concern for the Obama Administration.", "The Obama Administration responded to the SPDC's transition to the installation of the quasi-civilian government with cautious encouragement and carefully worded criticism. For example, following the parliamentary elections in November 2010, President Obama issued the following statement: ", "The November 7 elections in Burma were neither free nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections. The elections were based on a fundamentally flawed process and demonstrated the regime's continued preference for repression and restriction over inclusion and transparency.", "One of the starkest flaws of this exercise was the regime's continued detention of more than 2,100 political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, thereby denying them any opportunity to participate in the process. The unfair electoral laws and overtly partisan Election Commission ensured that Burma's leading pro-democracy party, the National League for Democracy, was silenced and sidelined. The regime denied the registration of certain ethnic parties, cancelled elections in numerous ethnic areas, and stage-managed the campaign process to ensure that pro-democracy and opposition candidates who did compete faced insurmountable obstacles. ", "The United States will continue to implement a strategy of pressure and engagement in accordance with conditions on the ground in Burma and the actions of the Burmese authorities. We renew our calls for the authorities to: free Aung San Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners immediately and unconditionally, cease systematic violations of human rights, begin to hold human rights violators accountable, and welcome pro-democracy and ethnic minority groups into a long-overdue dialogue.", "Following the transfer of power on March 30, 2011, Acting Deputy Department Spokesman Mark C. Toner expressed similar reservations about the situation in Burma at the daily press briefing:", "[I]t was a fundamentally flawed electoral process that's now ensured the key military regime figures have continued to dominate the government and all decision making. The fact that they've taken off their uniforms and donned civilian clothes is immaterial.\u2026 We urge Burmese authorities to release all political prisoners, to recognize the legitimacy of the National League for Democracy and all democratic and ethnic opposition political parties, and to enter into a genuine and inclusive dialogue with these groups as a first step towards reconciliation to take place.", "The cautious approach to Burma continued for the first few months after the establishment of the Thein Sein administration and the convening of Burma's Union Parliament."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Flickers of Progress\" and Clinton's Trip to Burma", "paragraphs": ["As Burma underwent its political transition, steps were being taken in Washington to respond to any significant developments in Burma.

Mitchell was nominated for the position on April 15, 2011. The position, which holds an ambassadorial ranking, was created by the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts) Act of 2008 (JADE Act) ( P.L. 110-286 ) and had remained unfilled for over three years.

President Thein Sein also made overtures to Aung San Suu Kyi, the NLD, and representatives of some of ethnic organizations about possible paths towards political reconciliation. However, 10 days later, USS McCampbell , a Navy destroyer, intercepted a Belize-flagged cargo ship reportedly in transit between North Korea and Burma under suspicion that its cargo contained banned weapons technology. The ship's North Korean crew reportedly refused to be boarded and the ship sailed back to North Korea. On June 9, 2011, the Burmese Army broke a 17-year-old ceasefire with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), attacking a KIA position along the Taping River. As a result, fighting between the Tatmadaw and Burma's ethnic militias spread from eastern to northern Burma. ", "In a speech given on May 31, 2011, at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, former Assistant Secretary Campbell succinctly summarized the Obama Administration's impressions of the new Burmese government at that time, saying, \"I think it would be fair to say, to date we have been generally disappointed and underwhelmed by the progress that we have seen.\" In his testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on June 2, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary Yun provided a similar assessment of the new Burmese government:", "The convening of [Burma's] Parliament and the formation of a so-called \"civilian\" government marked the completion of what the [SPDC] regime refers to as its seven-step roadmap to a \"disciplined and flourishing democracy.\" We strongly disagree with this assessment and believe many questions remain.\u2026 With former [SPDC] officials occupying most key positions in all branches of government, the United States is not optimistic that we will see any immediate change in policies or progress on our core concerns.", "On September 7, 2011, Ambassador Mitchell made his first trip to Burma as Special Representative, and held meetings with President Thein Sein, Aung San Suu Kyi, and NLD leaders, and representatives of Burma's ethnic groups. Just prior to Ambassador Mitchell's arrival, President Thein Sein announced his willingness to negotiate ceasefire agreements with Burma's various ethic militias. In a press conference following his trip, Ambassador Mitchell described his conversations in Burma as candid, and indicated that he had reiterated U.S. concerns about ongoing human rights abuses (including the continued detention of political prisoners), the continuing conflicts between the Burmese military and some of the ethnic militias, and Burma's relations with North Korea. The announcement by President Thein Sein and Ambassador Mitchell's visit were viewed by some observers as setting the stage for future developments in bilateral relations. They also facilitated the U.S. visit of Foreign Minister Wunna Maung Lwin in late September 2011.", "On October 11, 2011, President Thein Sein announced the second large-scale prisoner pardon, this time involving the release of 6,359 people, including 241 political prisoners. Ambassador Mitchell and Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Michael Posner travelled to Burma on November 1-2, 2011, to discuss prospects for political reform, the ongoing fighting with the ethnic militias and the status of the ceasefire talks, and the human rights situation in general.

During her visit to Burma, she announced that the United States would consider the exchange of ambassadors and would introduce several new U.S. development programs including an English language program, aid to victims of Burma's internal conflict (especially land mine victims), and academic exchange programs. In a separate announcement, USAID said that it intended to expand an existing $24 million anti-malaria program into Burma. All of the initiatives announced by former Secretary Clinton during her visit were permissible under the U.S. sanction regime in force at that time.", "During the summer and autumn of 2011, the Burmese government made some headway in implementing political reforms and negotiating ceasefire agreements. The Union Parliament passed a few laws that improved the legal protection of civil liberties, most notably the Labour Organization Law (allowing the formation of labor unions and legalizing worker strikes) and the Law Relating to Peaceful Assembly and Peaceful Procession (allowing for public protests under certain conditions).

The NLD had refused to run in the November 2010 elections because it considered the election laws overly restrictive.

U.S. investors in Burma would be allowed to invest in all sectors and export financial services to any Burmese entity, so long as the investment partner or entity in Burma is not on OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. To ensure that \"bad actors\" will not receive benefits from the U.S. easing of sanctions, the SDN is to be regularly updated.

In the view of some of Burma's ethnic minorities, the Burmese government failed to abide by the terms of the Panglong Agreement that granted the ethnic states a degree of autonomy. According to the Tatmadaw, the inability of the democratic civilian government to suppress the ethnic militias and protect the national integrity of Burma led to the 1962 military coup. To this day, senior Burmese military officers maintain that the Tatmadaw is responsible for preserving Burma in its current form during the last 60 years. Article 20 of the 2008 Constitution explicitly designates the Burmese military as the main entity for \"safeguarding the nondisintegration of the Union, the non-disintegration of National solidarity and the perpetuation of sovereignty.\"", "The Union Government has proposed a three-step peace process to negotiate an end to the civil war and achieve a reconciliation between the Burman majority and the various ethnic organizations opposed to the current configuration of the Burmese government. The first step is the negotiation of a preliminary ceasefire agreement with all the ethnic organizations that maintain a militia. The second step is to negotiate broader agreements with the ethnic organizations regarding the political and economic development of the States in which the ethnic organizations and their militias operate. The third step calls for the negotiation of a national agreement on how to amend or alter the 2008 Constitution in a manner consistent with the agreements achieved in the second stage. The Union Government's proposal assumes the preservation of the 2008 Constitution, with amendments, and the disbanding of the ethnic militias or their merger into the Tatmadaw. The Union Government has established a \"peace committee\" consisting of a 12-member central committee headed by President Thein Sein and a 52-member working committee headed by Vice-President Sai Mauk Kham. Former Railway Minister Aung Min, however, is widely seen as the Union Government's lead negotiator in talks with the ethnic organizations.", "The Union Government's three-step peace process has been rejected by several of the more prominent ethnic organizations. An alliance of 12 ethnic organizations, the United Nationalities Federal Council (UNFC), has proposed an alternative path to national reconciliation involving direct negotiations between the Union Government and the UNFC, followed by a national conference of ethnic organizations, and the convening of a national convention to negotiate the terms of a \"national accord\" for the establishment of a federal union of Burma. The UNFC proposal does not presume the preservation of the 2008 Constitution, or the disbanding or merger of the militias into the Tatmadaw. The UNFC has also appointed a negotiating team consisting of representatives of its member organizations. ", "Talks between the Union Government and the various ethnic organizations, including the UNFC, have yielded mixed results. Preliminary ceasefire agreements have been reached with 13 of 21 different groups, with the critical exception of the KIO/KIA. Informal talks between the UNFC and the Union Government were held in Ruili, China, in February 2013, resulting in an agreement to hold future talks. None of the negotiations have resulted in the completion of the second step of the Union Government's three-step peace process.", "Several unresolved issues underlie the efforts to achieve national reconciliation in Burma. First, a consensus needs to be reached regarding the relative powers of the central government and the ethnic States, particularly with respect to the political and economic development of the States. Many ethnic organizations seek a comparative high degree of autonomy for their States, but the Union Government and the Burmese military seemingly prefer a stronger central government. Second, any agreement on national reconciliation will require the support and approval of the Tatmadaw. However, the Burmese military has generally not participated in the current negotiations. Also, widespread reports of Burmese Army attacks on ethnic militias with whom a preliminary ceasefire agreement has been reached raise doubts about the Tatmadaw's support of the peace process or the ability of the Union Government's peace committee to speak on behalf of the Burmese military. Third, the parties need to agree on the process for negotiating terms of national reconciliation. The Union Government is pressing for an approach the operates within the structure of the 2008 Constitution and would eventually incorporate the ethnic organizations into the current governance system as political parties contesting in parliamentary elections. The major ethnic groups prefer to hold talks with the Union Government as equals, and do not accept the implicit assumption of the legitimacy of the 2008 Constitution and the Union Government implied by the approach proposed by the Union Government. As a result, the future of the 2008 Constitution appears to be a critical element of any proposal for national reconciliation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Future of the 2008 Constitution", "paragraphs": ["The entire process by which the 2008 Constitution was drafted and adopted is politically problematic for Burma. Many of the opposition parties and the ethnic organizations did not participate in the drafting of the Constitution, which is generally viewed as having been written by the SPDC to protect and preserve the preferential status and power of the Burmese military. Public access to the written text of the Constitution was limited before the national referendum was held in 2008, and the official results of the plebiscite are widely seen as fraudulent. The parliamentary elections held in November 2010 under the provisions of the 2008 Constitution are similarly considered neither free nor fair, raising questions about the legitimacy of the Union Government and the Union Parliament. ", "The Union Government and the Burmese military view the 2008 Constitution as a legitimate document governing the nation. President Thein Sein has indicated a willingness to consider limited amendments to the constitution. For example, it appears that President Thein Sein is open to modifications of the privileged status of the Tatmadaw under the constitution, including the size of its membership in the Union Parliament, but to an unspecified extent. The Tatmadaw reportedly is also open to limited changes to the constitution, but not ones that would fundamentally alter their special status. ", "The opposition parties within the Union Parliament\u2014led by Aung San Suu Kyi and her fellow NLD members\u2014would also like to see amendments to the 2008 Constitution. For example, the NLD would like to change certain provisions that bar Aung San Suu Kyi from serving as President following the 2015 parliamentary elections. The NLD and other opposition party members of the Union Parliament seem willing to follow the amendment process in the constitution. ", "However, many of the ethnic organizations do not accept the 2008 Constitution, and are unlikely to comply with its provisions for amending the constitution. The opposition groups prefer to negotiate directly with the Union Government and the Tatmadaw about changes in the national government and the adoption of a new constitution. They may, however, accept that the Union Government will want to follow the constitution's process to adopt amendments as part of a negotiated agreement.", "The requirements to amend the constitution may be too arduous to implement such a negotiated agreement. Chapter XII of the 2008 Constitution specifies how it can be amended. A bill to amend the Constitution must be submitted to the Union Parliament as a whole and obtain the support of at least 20% of members before it can be considered by the Union Parliament. To be adopted, the bill must receive the support of no less than 75% of the members, and for certain specified sections of the Constitution also receive \"in a nation-wide referendum only with the votes of more than half of those who are eligible to vote.\" This latter provision would appear to require the approval of no less than 50% of the eligible voters regardless of the level of turnout for the national referendum. The specified sections include those setting the general structure of the government, providing for the special status of the military in the government (including the appointment of military personnel to the Union Parliament and that they constitute one quarter of the members of each chamber), establishing the conditions for the declaration of a state of emergency and the transfer of sovereign power to the Commander-in-Chief of the Burmese military, setting the requirements for eligibility to serve as President, and specifying the requirements to amend the Constitution. ", "These requirements imply that any amendment to the Constitution must obtain the support of a portion of the military appointees to the Union Parliament, and thereby indirectly, the support of the Tatmadaw. It is uncertain if any amendment acceptable to the Burmese military will sufficiently alter the current government structure to satisfy the ethnic organizations. If such a compromise can be achieved, the amendment must still be approved by more than 50% of the eligible voters, which could be a challenge. Voter turnout for the April 2012 parliamentary by-elections in some districts was not much above 50%.
