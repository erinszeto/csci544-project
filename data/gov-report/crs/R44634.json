", "Health disparities, including those in behavioral health that may result from social determinants, are not exclusive to the AI/AN population; rather they may occur in all disadvantaged populations.

Moreover, behavioral health conditions may exist in individuals without these risk factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "High Prevalence of Behavioral Health Problems Among AI/AN", "paragraphs": ["The AI/AN population has a higher prevalence of some behavioral health problems than many other racial or ethnic groups. For example, in 2014 the AI/AN population had the highest suicide rates among other racial ethnic groups for both the male population (27.4 per 100,000) and the female population (8.7 per 100,000), as shown in Figure 1 . Similarly, in 2014 the rate of past-year substance use disorders was higher among the AI/AN population (16%) than among other racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white (8%), non-Hispanic black (8.6%), Hispanic (8.5%), Asian (4.5%), and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders (10%). ", "Researchers have found that the AI/AN population has particularly high rates of certain behavioral health problems, including alcohol and marijuana use disorders. According to IHS, substance use disorders result in \"devastating intergenerational social, economic, physical, mental, and spiritual health disparities\" in AI/AN communities, including a rate of alcohol-related deaths (49.6 per 100,000) that is six times greater than the rate for all races (8.0 per 100,000). Posttraumatic stress disorder, childhood conduct disorder, and suicidal behaviors are also present at higher rates than in other races. However, these higher rates are not consistent across all behavioral health problems; for example, researchers found that major depressive disorder is less common among the AI/AN population than among the overall adult U.S. population. ", "Despite a greater prevalence of some behavioral health disorders among the AI/AN population, collecting and analyzing data poses several challenges. First, when researchers present prevalence rates (or other data) by race or ethnicity, they often do not report data for groups of comparatively small size (such as the AI/AN population) because the samples of such groups are too small to support statistical analysis. Second, studies conducted specifically among the AI/AN population can report data for that population but lack comparisons to other groups. Third, the designation of individuals as AI/AN may not be consistent: some datasets may categorize individuals as AI/AN based on self-identification, whereas others may do so based on tribal membership. Also, an AI/AN designation does not capture variation within that population (e.g., differences between tribes). "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Access to Care Among AI/AN", "paragraphs": ["Preventing and treating behavioral health conditions generally requires regular access to health care providers who can screen and, if necessary, treat behavioral health conditions. AI/ANs often have difficulty accessing care because they are more likely to live in rural and remote areas than the U.S. population as a whole. A number of rural areas are designated as mental health shortage areas by the federal government thereby making these areas eligible for programs that seek to reduce provider shortages; this designation includes areas with federally recognized Indian Tribes, which are automatically designated as shortage areas.", "The IHS system provides access to care but has difficulty recruiting and retaining providers generally and behavioral health providers specifically. For example, IHS noted that it has approximat ely 1,500 vacant health care provider positions and that it has difficultly recruiting providers because of the remote locations of many of its facilities.", "Even when health care facilities are geographically close and health care providers are available, other factors may impede access to care that is acceptable to and appropriate for the AI/AN population. Whereas IHS-funded facilities specialize in the AI/AN population, non-IHS-funded facilities do not and may be less likely to provide culturally competent care. AI/AN patients may be reluctant to visit non-IHS-funded mainstream health care facilities due to cultural differences between the patients and the providers available to treat them. For example, non-IHS health care providers typically speak in terms of \"treatment,\" whereas the AI/AN population might relate to the concept of \"healing.\" If health care providers are not able to provide culturally competent care, AI/AN patients may feel alienated or disrespected, and they may be less compliant with treatment. Another access barrier may be financial. AI/ANs receive free care at IHS-funded facilities when services are provided directly by these facilities. However, non-IHS facilities generally require AI/ANs to pay for services, and some people may not be able to afford such costs because they have low incomes or they lack insurance coverage."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Program Summaries", "paragraphs": ["IHS and SAMHSA have programs aimed at improving AI/AN behavioral health.

The report is not intended to address policy options for modifying, eliminating, or adding such programs (and future CRS reports may explore these policies in greater detail); however, the information in this report may help policymakers address a range of potential policy issues related to AI/AN behavioral health care. ", "For example, one challenge that IHS and SAMHSA-supported programs face is the shortage of behavioral health providers, particularly in rural areas, where much of the IHS beneficiary population resides. IHS, SAMHSA, and the Health Resources and Services Administration (which administers the majority of federal health workforce programs) are seeking to address these workforce issues. Policymakers may consider coordinating or modifying existing workforce programs to reduce the effects of workforce shortages on programs that support AI/AN behavioral health prevention and treatment. However, policymakers may face fiscal constraints in doing so, as a number of these programs have more applicants than can be supported with the funding available. ", "As another example, some research has found that improving access to culturally competent care (e.g., through integration of traditional AI/AN healing practices with mainstream health care) may lead to better health outcomes and better patient satisfaction. Although some existing federal programs aim to increase the number of AI/AN behavioral health care providers (e.g., the American Indians into Psychology Program), such training may take years to complete and may train only a limited number of providers. Policymakers may consider additional approaches to increase the culturally competent workforce, such as programs teaching qualified health care providers from other racial and ethnic groups about elements of AI/AN culture. ", "Policymakers may consider whether current data are sufficient to determine the need for programs and to evaluate their effectiveness. As noted above, data collection is complicated by several factors: efforts to identify the AI/AN population in research may be confounded by differences between self-identification and tribal membership (or program eligibility);getting a sufficient sample size for analysis of specific behavioral health conditions and comparison with other populations is difficult because the AI/AN population is comparatively small; and mapping the rates of conditions to the AI/AN population served is an ongoing challenge. Policymakers may consider requiring additional data collection or may find that the need for services is so apparent that additional data collection is not necessary. ", "Finally, many of the behavioral issues that AI/ANs experience may be related to the AI/AN socioeconomic conditions. As such, policymakers may consider the balance among programs that address behavioral health directly, programs that address the socioeconomic conditions of AI/AN (which may affect behavioral health indirectly), and programs that address some combination of the two. Similarly, policymakers may consider whether they would like to see evaluations of the association (if any) between implementation of programs aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions and subsequent changes in the rates of behavioral health conditions.
