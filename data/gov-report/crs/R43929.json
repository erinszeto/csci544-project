Title I-A has also become a vehicle to which a number of requirements affecting broad aspects of public K-12 education for all students have been attached as a condition for receiving Title I-A grants. It is the largest program authorized under the ESEA, and is funded at $14.4 billion for FY2015."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "LEA Grant Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Annual Title I-A funds are allocated under four different formulas\u2014Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG.). For each formula, a maximum grant is calculated by multiplying a \"population factor,\" consisting primarily of estimated numbers of school-age children in poor families, by an \"expenditure factor\" based on state average per pupil expenditures (APPE) for public K-12 education. In some of the formulas, additional factors are multiplied by the population and expenditure factors. These maximum grants are subsequently reduced to equal the level of available appropriations for each formula, taking into account a variety of state and LEA minimum grant or \"hold harmless\" provisions. Only LEAs meeting minimum numbers and/or percentages of children counted in the population factor may receive grants. ", "Although the allocation formulas have several distinctive elements, the primary factors used in all four formulas are the population factor (i.e., an eligible child count) and expenditure factor. The population factor, commonly referred to as the number of \"formula children,\" includes children ages 5-17 (1) in poor families, (2) in institutions for neglected or delinquent children or in foster homes, and (3) in families above the poverty level receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families payments. Each element of the population factor is updated annually. Children in poor families account for about 97% of the total formula child count. The estimated number of children ages 5-17 living in families with an income below the poverty level (i.e., children in poor families) is determined using data from the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) data set maintained and updated annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. ", "To receive funding under Basic Grants, an LEA must have at least 10 formula children, and these children must account for more than 2% of those ages 5-17 in the LEA. For Concentration Grants, an LEA must be eligible for a Basic Grant and must have more than 6,500 formula children or formula children must account for more than 15% of those ages 5-17 in the LEA. For both Targeted Grants and EFIG, an LEA must have at least 10 formula children, and these children must account for at least 5% of those ages 5-17 in the LEA. The percentage of formula children in a given LEA is determined by dividing the number of formula children by the total number of children ages 5 to 17 living in the LEA based on SAIPE program estimates.", "The expenditure factor for the Basic, Concentration, and Targeted formulas is the state APPE for public K-12 education (subject to a minimum of 80% and maximum of 120% of the national APPE for public K-12 education, further multiplied by 0.40), and is the same for all LEAs in that state. For the EFIG formula, the state APPE is subject to more narrow bounds (a minimum of 85% and maximum of 115%). The expenditure factor is included in the Title I-A formulas, in part, to compensate for the cost of education in different parts of the nation and to incentivize states to spend more on public K-12 education, as states that have higher expenditure factors get more Title I-A funding. ", "Both the Targeted and EFIG formulas include weighting schemes to increase aid to LEAs with the highest numbers or concentrations of eligible children. Under both formulas, the poor and other children counted in the formula are assigned weights on the basis of each LEA's school-age child poverty rate and number of school-age children in poor families. As a result, the LEAs with the highest poverty rates and/or number of children in poor families receive the highest grants per child counted in the formula. The EFIG formula also includes an effort factor, based on average per pupil expenditure for public K-12 education compared to personal income per capita for each state compared to the nation as a whole, and an equity factor, based on variations in average per pupil expenditures among the LEAs in each state. ", "Each formula has a hold-harmless provision\u2014no LEA may receive less than 85%-95% of its previous-year grant, depending on the LEA's poverty level and whether the LEA continues to meet the formula's eligibility threshold. All four formulas have state minimum grant provisions.", "After ED calculates LEA grants, it provides each state education agency (SEA) with information on the calculated grant amount for each LEA. SEAs then make a number of adjustments before determining the final amount that each LEA will actually receive. These adjustments are made to the total amount of Title I-A grants to LEAs under all four formulas combined. The adjustments include (1) reservation of 4% of state total allocations to be used for school improvement grants; (2) reservation of 1% of state total allocations under all formulas for ESEA Title I, Part A, plus Title I, Parts C and D (discussed below), or $400,000, whichever is greater, for state administration; (3) optional reservation of up to 5% of any statewide increase in total Part A grants over the previous year for academic achievement awards to participating schools that significantly reduce achievement gaps between disadvantaged and other pupil groups and/or exceed adequate yearly progress standards for two consecutive years or more; (4) adjustment of LEA grants to provide funds to eligible charter schools or to account for recent LEA boundary changes; and (5) optional use by states of alternative methods to reallocate all of the grants as calculated by ED among the state's small LEAs (defined as those serving an area with a total population of 20,000 or fewer)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "School Grant Determinations", "paragraphs": ["Unlike other federal elementary and secondary education program funds, most Title I-A funds are allocated to individual schools, although LEAs retain substantial discretion to control the use of a significant share of Title I-A grants at a central district level. While there are several rules related to school selection, LEAs must generally rank public schools by their percentage of students from low-income families, and serve them in rank order. All participating schools must generally have a percentage or number of children from low-income families that is higher than the LEA's average, or a minimum of 35%, whichever of these two figures is lower, although LEAs have the option of setting school eligibility thresholds higher than the minimum in order to concentrate available funds on a smaller number of schools.", "Once schools are selected, Title I-A funds are allocated among them (and reserved for services to private school students) in proportion to their number of students from low-income families. In a large majority of cases, the data used to determine which students are from low-income families for the distribution of funds to schools are not the same as those used to identify school-age children in poor families for purposes of calculating allocations to states and LEAs. As previously discussed, this is because data are not typically available on the number of school-age children enrolled in a school, or living in a residential school attendance zone, with income below the standard federal poverty threshold. Such \"population in poverty\" estimates, as used in the standard formulas for allocation of funds to states and LEAs (discussed above), are usually available only for LEAs, counties, and states.", "Thus, LEAs must use available proxies for low-income status. The Title I-A statute allows LEAs to use the following low-income measures: (1) eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches; (2) eligibility for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); or (3) eligibility for Medicaid. At the level of individual schools, the most commonly used criterion for determining whether students are from low-income families is eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches. LEAs receiving Title I-A funds use free/reduced-price school lunch data\u2014sometimes alone, sometimes in combination with other authorized criteria\u2014to select Title I-A schools and allocate funds among them. The income eligibility thresholds for free and reduced-price lunches are higher than the poverty levels used in the allocation formulas to states and LEAs: 130% of poverty for free lunches, 185% for reduced-price lunches.", "After data have been compiled on the percentage or number of students from low-income families who are either enrolled in an LEA's public schools or residing in the attendance areas served by such schools, available Title I-A funds are allocated among these schools in rank order, beginning with the highest-poverty schools, until no further funds are available. LEAs may choose to consider only schools of selected grade levels (e.g., only elementary schools) in determining eligibility for grants, as long as all schools with 75% or more of students from low-income families receive grants.", "Funds are allocated among schools in proportion to their number of students from low-income families, although grants to eligible schools per student from a low-income family need not be equal for all schools. LEAs may choose to provide higher grants per child from a low-income family to schools with higher percentages of such students (e.g., higher grants per child to a school where 70% of students are from low-income families than to a school where 40% of students are from low-income families). If an LEA provides Title I-A funds to schools with low-income student percentages below 35%, then it must provide a minimum amount of funds per child from a low-income family\u2014equal to at least 125% of the LEA's Title I-A grant per child from a low-income family\u2014to each participating school.", "At the school level, there are two basic types of Title I-A programs. Schoolwide programs are authorized if the percentage of low-income students served by a school is 40% or higher. In schoolwide programs, Title I-A funds may be used to improve the performance of all students in a school. For example, funds might be used to provide professional development services to all of a school's teachers, upgrade instructional technology, or implement new curricula. The other major type of Title I-A school service model is the targeted assistance program (TAP). This was the original type of Title I-A program, under which Title I-A-funded services are generally limited to the lowest-achieving students in the school. For example, students may receive such instruction in an after-school program or funds may be used to hire a teacher's aide who provides additional assistance to low-achieving students in their regular classroom."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Option: Overview and Possible Issues", "paragraphs": ["Under the state option, Title I-A LEA grants would be calculated by ED using the four formulas prescribed by current statute.

While Title I-A funds would be provided to schools based on a measure of poverty, similar to current law, schools would not be required to use the funds specifically to serve the students who \"earned\" them.

This student may not have the greatest academic need, however, so the funds may be used to serve other students. Also, if a student from a low-income family who currently receives Title I-A services changes schools, the student may or may not continue to receive Title I-A services at his or her new school, even though Title I-A funds would now follow the child to any school. It would depend on how the new school chooses to use the funds and the academic need within the school.

It should be noted that under the state option, a given state would not receive fewer overall Title I-A dollars, as the hold harmless provisions would only be eliminated for the final distribution of funds to LEAs.
