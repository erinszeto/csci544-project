U.S. agencies and departments also supplement funds that Congress appropriates for these purposes with funds from their discretionary budgets.", "Through FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations (P.L. 111-32), Congress appropriated $100 million to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for an additional contribution to the Multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and $50 million for international pandemic preparedness and response efforts.

", "Estimates of U.S. global health assistance vary, due in part to fragmented funding streams and a lack of consensus on what should be considered U.S. global health assistance. Congress provides funds for U.S. global health assistance through a number of appropriations vehicles: Foreign Operations; Labor, Education, and Health; and Defense. The greatest proportion of these funds is provided for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which supports global HIV/AIDS programs implemented by a number of agencies and departments, including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its implementing agencies, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Peace Corps. PEPFAR funds are also used for U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund), a multilateral organization that supports global HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria programs.

Agencies and departments might also transfer funds among each other. At times, for instance, USAID transfers some funds to CDC for research and evaluation activities.

Some advocates believe that Congress should invest the bulk of global health funds in disease-specific initiatives because they are able to garner greater political support by both U.S. and global leaders (due to their measurable outcomes) and their ability to be more easily expanded (since they are focused on one affliction). Disease-specific interventions can also be used, some argue, to bolster health systems, by building capacity and expertise in key areas. Other observers assert that investments in activities that target key diseases are better spent, because donors can divest gradually from the projects as countries learn to treat, prevent, and arrest the spread of the disease.", "While many health experts applaud the advancements made by disease-focused efforts, such as PMI and PEPFAR, others would like to see a greater emphasis on strengthening health systems. In the past, critics of single disease initiatives focused on the failures of these efforts to sometimes take into account the interconnected nature of health care challenges and how, in resource-poor countries, such activities may create competition for limited human capacity (i.e., doctors, public health specialists, and skilled managers for health programs). While progress to better coordinate health efforts has been made, some experts assert that disease-specific initiatives would be less necessary if donors and recipient governments increased investments for building or improving healthcare infrastructure and expanded training opportunities. An emphasis on health systems, they suggest, would increase local capacity for addressing a range of ailments. Furthermore, should Congress not invest sufficiently in health systems, some health experts warn, progress made in disease-focused projects will not be sustainable, as the governments will not have the capacity to maintain the efforts. ", "Many health professionals contend that global health efforts should combine both approaches so that efforts aimed at specific diseases could occur simultaneously with efforts to build health capacity and infrastructure. Supporters suggest that the initial focus of global health aid could be on building capacity to respond to disease outbreaks, and over time, investments could increasingly be targeted at improving and developing the healthcare infrastructure. President Obama indicated his support for a better integrated approach to U.S. health assistance, though he did not indicate how this might be accomplished. He stated that, \"I recognize that we will not be successful in our efforts to end deaths from AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis unless we do more to improve health systems around the world, focus our efforts on child and maternal health, and ensure that best practices drive the funding for these programs.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Balance Between Bilateral and Multilateral Health Assistance", "paragraphs": ["A single global health strategy, some experts assert, might also help Congress determine the appropriate balance of support for bilateral and multilateral global health efforts. The United States has provided substantial funding for bilateral health activities while also contributing to many international organizations that address global health, such as the Global Fund, WHO, UNICEF, and international medical research consortiums like the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the GAVI Alliance, and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV). As overall provision for global health has increased, Congress has debated the appropriate apportionment of bilateral and multilateral funding for global health efforts. ", "Proponents of increased U.S. support for multilateral global health efforts argue that combining donor funding for health allows greater economies of scale, thereby leveraging funding for greater impact, and reduces the reporting burdens on countries that receive funding from multiple sources. Supporting multilateral funding mechanisms also allows donors like the United States to share the long-term responsibility of financing higher cost activities, such as providing treatment for HIV/AIDS-infected people. ", "Opponents of increasing funding for multilateral activities over bilateral activities assert that directing funding through bilateral programs promotes accountability, increases oversight, and ensures that programs reflect U.S. priorities and values. Further, skeptics of greater investments in multilateral programs note that bilateral resources are often used to bridge support for slow-moving multilateral ones.

However, few of the reform proposals that are being debated and presented to Congress discuss comprehensively how their recommendations relate to U.S. global health programs. While a number of problems that critics cite in regard to current global health assistance programs, such as the disjointed policies, implementation, weak or uneven performance by some programs, and the absence of a comprehensive strategy are sometimes seen as common to most foreign aid sectors, various reform proposals could have unique implications for global health programs. ", "For example, rewriting the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 in such a way that the resulting legislation is more concise and comprehensive would be particularly challenging in regard to health programs. Some observers believe that any rewrite of the Act should address the range of U.S. global health assistance efforts which operate under authorities outside of the Foreign Assistance Act. CDC's global health programs, for example, are authorized through eight different Acts, including the Public Health Assistance Act. There are also a number of freestanding Acts that amend the Foreign Assistance Act and waive the requirement to authorize funds before making them available in appropriations. The United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 ( P.L. 108-25 ), for example, authorizes a number of U.S. global health assistance activities related to HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria; and amends the Foreign Assistance, Public Health Assistance, and International Financial Institutions Acts. As such, any attempt to reform foreign assistance, should it include U.S. international health assistance, requires a comprehensive review of numerous authorizing Acts. The Millennium Challenge Corporation, for example, is funded through annual foreign operations appropriations bills, but is not authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act. ", "Not only might Congress need to consider the variety of authorities under which U.S. global health assistance operates, but also consider the related oversight challenges. A number of committees have oversight authority over various U.S. global health assistance, including committees on agriculture, appropriations, foreign affairs (House) and foreign relations (Senate), and education and labor (House) and health, education, labor and pensions (Senate). Any effort to reform U.S. global health assistance might require a cooperative effort of all committees that hold oversight authority.", "Another popular reform proposal would create a cabinet-level international development agency with authority over all global health and development programs. While some observers have cited the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator to exemplify the benefits of establishing an independent high-level international development entity, others have concerns about the political implications of such a structure. Supporters maintain that a cabinet-level development agency might broaden the avenues of support through which the United States improves global health. Leadership outside of health bureaus might also raise the status of health interventions. Supporters of this idea assert that PEPFAR was so successful, in part, because the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator was appointed as an Ambassador. Proponents contend that this elevated status helped to engender partnerships and commitments from foreign governments that other global health programs have yet to secure. On the other hand, should this new agency not carry the same political currency as the Department of State, programs implemented through a new development agency might not gain as much support domestically or globally. ", "While there is little question that PEPFAR has been one of the United States' most successful public diplomacy initiatives, some health experts have concerns about the political implications of a cabinet-level development agency. Some argue that further integrating global health programs into such an entity might lead to a level of politicization that health programs, in particular, have been largely protected from under the current structure. For example, CDC was able to respond immediately to the 2009 cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe, despite strained U.S. diplomatic relations with that country. Skeptics of foreign aid reform fear that a restructuring might result in diplomatic concerns outweighing global health concerns or the use of health assistance as a political tool. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Is U.S. Global Health Assistance Sufficiently Integrated and Coordinated?", "paragraphs": ["A number of global health experts have asserted that improvements in coordination and integration of U.S. health assistance can be undertaken without launching into the comprehensive process of foreign assistance reform. Supporters of this idea maintain that Congress can create coordinating mechanisms\u2014such as OGAC\u2014that clarify oversight, funding, and implementation structures. Proponents maintain that since OGAC was launched, implementing agencies and departments have developed a clear sense of their roles and have improved their coordination, particularly at the planning phase. Other observers point out that the creation of OGAC has led to parallel structures (such as PMI) that are used to enhance coordination of U.S. global health efforts. Some health experts warn, however, that Congress might need to mandate such cooperation to ensure that the process is formalized and fully implemented. For example, in a joint memorandum, the leadership of PMI and PEPFAR directed headquarters and country staff to coordinate activities where possible, but they did not institute a formal process for collaboration between the programs. CDC coordinated an interagency forum to discuss U.S. global health policy through Project Horizon, yet the results of and impact of this effort have not been published. In order for coordination efforts to be effective, some assert, that related efforts might also need to be strengthened. For example, the International Health Office at DOD, which is responsible for leading coordination efforts, does not appear to oversee the funding or coordination of key DOD programs that impact global health, such as DHAPP and GEIS.", "Consensus is emerging that Congress might also need to consider how to improve intra-agency and interagency coordination and integration of U.S. global health programs in the field. The 111 th Congress has urged OGAC to expand efforts to address other health and development challenges through PEPFAR programs, such as health workforce shortages and access to treatment for tuberculosis, as well as access to education (see H.Rept. 111-187 ). Politically sensitive issues, however, like family planning and reproductive health, have been more complicated to integrate. According to a USAID official, although U.S. maternal and child health programs are mostly integrated with family planning and reproductive health initiatives, HIV/AIDS services are not and are provided in separate clinics. ", "The Lantos-Hyde Act enables organizations who receive PEPFAR funds to opt out of aspects of HIV prevention, treatment, or care programs that they find objectionable for moral or religious reasons. Supporters of these protections argue that faith-based and other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that provide services to the poor and others in need may not accept U.S. funding to expand their programs without such assurances. They maintain that respecting these groups' views is essential on moral and practical grounds, as these organizations often have underlying religious ethics in their activities as well as long-standing relationships with the communities in which they work.", "Critics of the conscience clause assert that when providers act to withhold information from HIV-positive mothers about contraception and family planning strategies, HIV prevention efforts are weakened. Some health experts propose that HIV/AIDS services be provided in existing health clinics to minimize the stigma some might face when attending an HIV/AIDS clinic; improve the likelihood that HIV-positive mothers might have access to services that could prevent them delivering HIV-positive children; and benefit from some of the considerable resources provided for HIV/AIDS services (including laboratory services, workforce, and supply systems).", "Appendix A. Definitions of Global Health and Global Health Assistance", "WHO defines health as, \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" That definition, however, is expansive and makes it difficult to identify when that \"state\" has been achieved. Scholars have noted that the use of the term \"global health\" has increased in the past 15 years but question whether a clear definition has emerged among public health experts. However, experts seem to agree that global health differs in several key ways from other terms that have been widely used in the last 60 years to refer to international approaches to health, such as tropical health and international health. In the past, terms such as tropical health and international health focused on disease challenges in developing countries, which may have been viewed as having little or limited impact on more developed countries. Today, the use of the term global health seems to suggest that health in rich and poor countries is closely connected. One study found that the term \"global health\" denotes mutual vulnerability. For example, many countries recognize the universal threat that pandemic influenza and increasing disease resistance pose to available treatments. In addition, health challenges that once primarily affected industrialized countries, like chronic diseases (including heart disease, cancer and diabetes) and injuries caused by modern transportation, now disproportionately kill people in developing countries. ", "The Committee on the U.S. Commitment to Global Health at the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which is comprised of preeminent health experts, published a definition of global health in 2009 that seems to reflect how the concept of global health has evolved and how wide a range of factors it includes:", "[T]he goal of improving health for all people in all nations by promoting wellness and eliminating avoidable disease, disability, and death. It can be attained by combining population-based health promotion and disease prevention measures with individual-level clinical care. The U.S. global health enterprise involves many sectors (both governmental and nongovernmental) and disciplines (within and beyond the health sciences), and is characterized by intersectoral, interdisciplinary, and international collaboration.", "Similarly, there is not yet a universal definition of \"health assistance,\" though many definitions seem to acknowledge the range of factors that impact health and can be used to improve it. While few advocacy groups, NGOs, and think tanks formally define \"global health assistance,\" their attention to certain issues suggests that some areas of consensus do exist in practice. For example, many of these organizations address HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, maternal and child health, reproductive health and family planning, and hunger and malnutrition as part of their global health programs. A growing number of these groups highlight other global health issues, such as chronic disease, the impact of climate change and urbanization on health, the importance of international medical research on a range of diseases that impact both poor and rich countries, and equal access to medicine and health technology. While many groups are increasingly advocating for coordinated support of related development sectors (such as education, infrastructure development, road construction, agriculture, and women's rights), most deem assistance in these areas to be complementary to rather than inclusive of global health assistance. However, it appears the water and sanitation sector is increasingly considered by some groups to be part of global health, due to its links to many diseases including diarrhea and cholera.", "In a 2009 report that examined the range of actors that contributed to U.S. health assistance, the Kaiser Family Foundation, defined U.S. global health assistance as: ", "U.S. policy (legislation, regulations, executive orders, guidance, and other relevant policy statements), activities, initiatives, programs, and funding used to address health problems that transcend national boundaries with the goal of improving health by reducing avoidable disease, disabilities, and deaths.

", "Although zoonotic infections affect human health, there is no consensus on whether related interventions should be counted towards U.S. global health assistance.
