The budget also proposes to eliminate the BCA sequester on mandatory programs in FY2015. These proposals yield a deficit for FY2015 that is slightly higher than what is currently projected in the CBO baseline.", "Congressional consideration of FY2015 budget and appropriations legislation has already begun. The BBA contained a provision directing the House and Senate Budget Committee chairmen to file spending and revenue levels in the Congressional Record that would be enforceable in the same manner as a concurrent budget resolution for FY2015 if an agreement on a budget resolution could not be reached by April 15, 2014. However, nothing would preclude Congress from acting on a budget resolution for FY2015 even after those levels have been filed.

Therefore, it is important to understand what projections include and the assumptions on which they are based. Baseline projections are included in both the President's budget and the congressional budget resolution.", "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) computes current law baseline projections using assumptions set out in budget enforcement legislation. Since Congress and the President have resolved certain questions related to expiring tax policy and have enacted specific policies set to control discretionary spending over the next decade, there are fewer policy uncertainties affecting the baseline levels under current law. More specifically, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA; P.L. 112-240 ; see additional discussion below) permanently set into law many individual tax rates and tax policy provisions. On the spending side, baseline discretionary spending levels are largely constrained by the caps and automatic spending reductions enacted as part of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ) and further modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA; P.L. 113-67 ; see additional discussion below). In addition to these current law assumptions, macroeconomic assumptions, specifically of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, inflation, and interest rates, will also affect the baseline estimates and projections.", "However, the CBO baseline also incorporates certain assumptions currently in law, but that have historically been revised prior to the policy change actually taking effect. Specifically, the CBO baseline assumes that sharp reductions in Medicare's payment rates for physician services will take effect as scheduled in April 2015 and that certain expired and expiring tax provisions will not be extended. The projections in the baseline also contain additional uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future federal borrowing and healthcare costs. Minor changes in the economic or technical assumptions that are used to project the baseline also could result in significant changes in the outyear deficit levels.", "Current baseline projections show continued reductions in the budget deficit over the next several years, from 4.1% of GDP in FY2013 to 2.6% of GDP in FY2015, and roughly similar deficits as a percentage of GDP through FY2018. These declining deficit figures, relative to the past few fiscal years, are primarily due to continued improvements in the economy, restraints on discretionary spending, and certain assumptions used in constructing the baseline (i.e., certain tax provisions will expire as scheduled under current law). This would result in budget deficits that slightly reduce the level of debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP through FY2018. In other words, these budget deficits would be fiscally sustainable. However, after FY2018, deficit levels are projected to rise again, reaching 4.2% of GDP by FY2022 and 4.0% of GDP by FY2024. Under the baseline assumptions, budget deficits are projected to average 3.5% of GDP over the FY2015 to FY2024 period. (See Table 1 below.)", "CBO also provides projections based on alternative policy assumptions, which illustrate the levels of spending and revenue if current policies continue, rather than expire as scheduled under current law. If Medicare payment rates for physician services remain the same, expiring tax provisions are extended, and the provisions of the Budget Control Act's automatic spending reduction process do not remain in effect for FY2015 and beyond, CBO projects a cumulative increase in the budget deficit by more than $2.3 trillion relative to the current law baseline, including increased debt service costs, over the FY2015 to FY2024 period.

Over the last several fiscal years, spending and revenue have deviated significantly from historical averages primarily as a result of the economic downturn and policies enacted in response to financial turmoil. As the economy recovers, the budget deficit continues to fall. In FY2013, the U.S. government spent $3.5 trillion and collected $2.8 trillion in revenue resulting in a budget deficit of 4.1% of GDP, the lowest imbalance in five years.

Discretionary spending is controlled by annual congressional appropriations acts. Mandatory spending encompasses spending on entitlement programs and spending controlled by laws other than annual appropriation acts. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid make up the bulk of mandatory spending. Congress sets eligibility requirements and benefits for entitlement programs, rather than appropriating a fixed sum each year. Therefore, if the eligibility requirements are met for a specific mandatory program, outlays are made automatically. Net interest comprises the government's interest payments on the debt held by the public, offset by small amounts of interest income the government receives from certain loans and investments.", "In FY2000, total outlays equaled 18.2% of GDP. In FY2009, outlays peaked at 24.4% of GDP. Outlays have fallen since then, but remain at levels above the historical average. In FY2013, total outlays were 20.8% of GDP. Under the CBO baseline, total outlays are projected to be 22.4% of GDP in FY2024.

In FY2013, discretionary spending totaled 7.2% of GDP. Since FY2000, discretionary spending as a share of GDP has increased 5.3% a year, on average. Increases in discretionary spending over this period have largely been a result of increases in security spending and, more recently, the funding provided in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ). On average, from FY2000 to FY2013, defense discretionary outlays grew 5.9% per year in nominal terms, while non-defense discretionary outlays grew 4.6% per year in nominal terms. However, by FY2018, according to CBO's baseline projections, discretionary spending will fall to 5.8% of GDP, its lowest level ever. Discretionary spending in FY2024 is projected to total 5.2% of GDP. The projected decline in discretionary spending in the baseline over the next decade is largely due to the reductions under current law contained in the Budget Control Act.", "Mandatory spending totaled 12.2% of GDP in FY2013, up from 9.7% of GDP in FY2000, as shown in Figure 2 . Mandatory spending peaked in FY2009 at 14.5% of GDP. Mandatory spending levels have been elevated mainly as a result of increases in outlays for income security programs. Though the economic recovery is expected to lower mandatory spending on certain programs over the next few fiscal years, the growth in mandatory spending is projected to resume its upward trend towards the end of the decade due to increases in certain entitlement programs. As a result, under current law, CBO projects that mandatory spending will total 13.9% of GDP in FY2024, higher than the FY2013 level.", "In addition to their size relative to the economy, the components of federal spending can also be examined relative to each other. In FY2013, mandatory spending totaled 58.8% of total outlays, discretionary spending totaled 34.8% of total outlays, and net interest comprised the remaining 6.4% of total outlays. The largest mandatory programs, Social Security, Medicare, and the federal share of Medicaid, constituted 48.0% of all federal spending in FY2013. By FY2024, mandatory and net interest spending are projected to increase, thereby reducing discretionary spending's share of total outlays. Mandatory spending is projected to rise to 62.3% of total outlays while discretionary spending's share is projected to fall to 23.1% in that year. Net interest spending is projected to rise to 14.7% of total outlays in FY2024.", "Because discretionary spending represents roughly one-third of total federal outlays, some budget experts contend that to achieve significant reductions in federal spending, reductions in mandatory spending are needed. Other budget and social policy experts contend that cuts in mandatory spending would cause substantial disruption to many households, because mandatory spending comprises important parts of the social safety net.

The debt limit also imposes a form of fiscal accountability that compels Congress, in the form of a vote authorizing a debt limit increase, and the President, by signing the legislation, to take visible action to allow further federal borrowing when nearing the statutory limit. Since February 2013, however, three consecutive pieces of legislation have suspended the debt limit accompanied by specific dates upon which the suspension expires. The debt limit is currently suspended as a result of the Temporary Debt Limit Extension Act ( P.L. 113-83 ) through March 5, 2015. It should be noted that the debt limit by itself has no effect on the borrowing needs of the government. The debt limit, however, can hinder the Treasury's ability to manage the federal government's finances when the amount of federal debt approaches this ceiling. In those instances, the Treasury has had to take unusual and extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations, leading to inconvenience and uncertainty in Treasury operations at times.

The Proposed Budget, however, is the one that illustrates the resulting budget outlook if all of the policies proposed by the President were implemented. Whether or not a certain policy proposal increases or decreases the deficit depends on which baseline is used as the starting point. Ultimately, the question of whether or not the amount of deficit reduction is sufficient can only be measured by actual budget outcomes (i.e., whether the budget deficit is higher or lower in the future relative to today) and whether or not the budget is on a sustainable path.", "There are no real limits on what assumptions can be used to construct the Adjusted Baseline as opposed to the BBEDCA baseline, whose parameters were set by legislation. The Adjusted Baseline in the FY2015 budget assumes, for example, increases in spending as a result of eliminating the reduction in Medicare physician payments under the SGR formula. Because this policy serves to increase the deficit, this policy has no cost in the Administration's Proposed Budget when it is measured against the constructed Adjusted Baseline. If it were measured under the BBEDCA baseline, the SGR fix would increase the deficit. In other words, because the Administration assumes that Medicare physician payments would be maintained at current year levels in its Adjusted Baseline, at a cost of $110 billion between FY2015 and FY2024, this proposal does not increase the deficit in the Proposed Budget.", "A similar methodology can be used in understanding how the funding for Overseas Contingency Operations is being accounted for in each baseline. Both the Adjusted Baseline and BBEDCA baseline assume that OCO funding will continue at current year levels, adjusted for inflation. In the Proposed Budget, the Administration assumes a reduction in OCO funding. As a result, the Proposed Budget allocates a reduction in the deficit of $695 billion over the FY2015-FY2024 period for reduced OCO costs relative to the Adjusted Baseline and the BBEDCA baseline."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The FY2015 Budget Resolution", "paragraphs": ["The budget committees in the House and Senate each work to develop a budget resolution as they receive information and testimony from various sources, such as the Administration, CBO, and congressional committees with jurisdiction over spending and revenues.

CBO's projections, however, assume steady economic growth over the next 10 years, taking into account that changes in economic conditions will average out over the period.

However, significant deficit reduction at this time may be harmful to the ongoing economic recovery. On the other hand, the longer that the country continues without a plan to stabilize its fiscal future, the more costly reform (i.e., more severe reductions in spending or larger increases in taxes) may ultimately be.

Persistent deficits, however, lead to growing levels of federal debt that may lead to higher interest payments and may also have adverse macroeconomic consequences in the long term, including slowing investment and lowering economic growth. Since the debt cannot grow faster than GDP indefinitely, large deficits will eventually need to be reduced through increases in taxes, reductions in spending, or both.", "The federal government faces long-term budget challenges. Some measures of fiscal solvency in the long term indicate that, under current policy, the United States faces major future imbalance, specifically as it relates to rising health care costs and the likely impact on government-financed health care spending. Even as Congress and the President worked to enact deficit reduction legislation (i.e., the BCA), legislators are seen not to have made significant changes to the part of the budget that is projected to grow. Therefore, many budget analysts believe that additional savings are required to put the budget on a sustainable path over the long term. Further, over the last two years, many of those deficit reduction provisions have been softened. Under the current law baseline, deficits continue to be projected over the budget window.", "CBO, GAO, and the Administration agree that the current mix of federal fiscal policies is unsustainable in the long term. The nation's aging population, combined with rising health care costs per beneficiary, may keep federal health costs rising faster than per capita GDP. CBO projected in September 2013 that under current policy, federal spending on federal health programs (including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and exchange subsidies) would grow from 4.7% of GDP today to 7.6% of GDP in 2035, and 13.5% by 2085. The 2013 Economic Report of the President also projected that future federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid would rise significantly under current law projections. Though these forecasts are highly uncertain, it seems probable that spending on these programs will rise as a share of GDP over time.", "In addition, growing debt and rising interest rates are projected to consume a greater share of future federal spending. Under current law, CBO projects that spending to finance the federal debt will grow rapidly from 1.3% of GDP today, to 4.5% of GDP in FY2035, and 11.4% of GDP in FY2085. GAO's recent long-term fiscal simulations, under an alternative policy scenario, projected that debt held by the public as a share of GDP would exceed the post-World War II historical high in about 15 years.", "Keeping future federal outlays at 20% of GDP, or approximately at its historical average, and leaving fiscal policies unchanged, according to CBO projections, would require drastic reductions in all spending other than that for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, or reining in the costs of these programs. As shown in Table 3 below, under CBO's extended baseline, maintaining the debt to GDP ratio at today's level (73%) through FY2038 would require an immediate and permanent cut in non-interest spending or revenues or some combination of the two in the amount of 0.9% of GDP (or about $150 billion in FY2014 alone) in each year. Maintaining this debt-to-GDP ratio beyond FY2038 would require additional savings. If policy makers wanted to lower future debt levels relative to today, the annual spending reductions or revenue increases would have to be larger. For example, in order to bring debt as a percentage of GDP in FY2038 down to the same level it was in FY2008 (39% of GDP), spending reductions or revenue increases or some combination of the two would need to total roughly 2.1% of GDP (or $360 billion in FY2014 alone) in each year.", "As the economic recovery continues, Congress may focus more effort on reducing the deficit and reining in the debt. This would require less spending, more revenue, faster-than-average economic growth, or a combination of these things. Debt requires interest payments that can strain budgets if debt levels and interest rates are high.
