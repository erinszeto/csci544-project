However, it differs from the latter provision in that under proposed subsection 101(b)(1)(D), a reasonable expectation that a non-U.S. person will possess foreign intelligence information, without more, appears sufficient for that person to be categorized as an \"agent of a foreign power.\" In addition, under the proposed new definition, a non-U.S. person who is \"reasonably expected to control, transmit, or receive foreign intelligence information while in the United States\" would also be considered an \"agent of a foreign power.\" The proposed definition does not appear to require an action or intent to act for the benefit of a foreign power or against the interests of the United States, nor does it require any ill intent.

Current subsection 101(f)(4) deals with the installation or use of a surveillance device in the United States \"for monitoring to acquire information, other than from a wire or radio communication, under circumstances in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes.\" However, unlike current subsection 101(f)(1), the new definition does not explicitly distinguish between interception of the communications of U.S. persons and those of non-U.S. persons, nor is it restricted to acquisition of the contents of communications. The current subsection 101(f)(1) requires the person intentionally targeted to be in the United States, while the proposed provision requires a reasonable belief that the person at whom surveillance is intentionally directed be in the United States.
