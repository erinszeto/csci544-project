Antidumping duties are used to counter the effects of imports sold at unfairlylow prices on the domestic market.

Otherswould change antidumping and countervailing-duty remedies. The congressional proposals followdifferent approaches to the same goal -- to ease the procedural burden in obtaining relief andimprove the chances that U.S. industries would obtain relief. In so doing, the legislation would make it less likely that industries would press Congress to directly restrict imports throughprotectionist legislation.", "The 106th Congress did pass one change to U.S. trade remedy law, the so-called Byrdamendment. The 107th Congress did not act on trade remedy legislation, but treatment of traderemedy laws in trade negotiations was a major point of contention during the debate over legislationto grant the President trade promotion authority. Several bills that would amend U.S. trade remedylaws have been introduced in the 108th Congress.", "Trade remedy legislation is largely supported by those industries, such as steel, that are mostsensitive to foreign competition.

The rationale underlying safeguard relief is that while the benefits of tradeliberalization are distributed throughout a national economy, the adverse effects -- loss of profits,worker layoffs, firm and plant closures -- are concentrated in specific, import-sensitive industries.Safeguard relief is designed to give the injured industry the opportunity to adjust, minimizing thedestabilizing effects of trade. ", "In addition to these \"economic\" arguments, many trade specialists have argued that traderemedies are means by which the United States has been able respond to the concerns of theadversely affected sectors of the economy and achieve a domestic political consensus on tradeliberalization.

A negative ITC determination terminates theinvestigation. If the two final determinations are affirmative, then extra duties are placed on importsto be paid by the importer. The determinations are subject to judicial review.", "Both the DOC and the ITC must take into account a number of criteria in making theirrespective determinations. In CVD cases, the DOC must consider evidence of direct subsidies orupstream subsidies (subsidies provided to inputs the benefits of which are passed on to the finalproducer) and, if found, what would be the net countervailable subsidy. In AD cases the DOC mustfirst determine the \"normal value\" of the import (based on the price in the exporting country's homemarket, on the price of the export of the product to a third country market, or on a \"constructed\"price, depending on the availability of data). The DOC must compare the \"normal value\" with theactual price of the import in question to determine whether dumping is taking place and, if so, whatthe dumping margin is.In either procedure, the ITC must make two determinations: (1) Is thedomestic industry being materially injured or facing a threat of material injury? (2) Are the importsin question a cause of the material injury. U.S. law establishes deadlines under which the respectiveagencies must make their determinations.

In addition, the impact on overallU.S. national interests would likely be greater than in the case of AD and CVD determinations. ", "The stricter standards and procedures are probably a significant reason why U.S. industrieshave used and received relief much more often from AD and CVD programs than safeguard. Between 1984 and 2002, 397 AD cases and 120 CVD cases resulted in relief. (10) Whereas during the sameperiod, seven safeguard cases resulted in relief.
