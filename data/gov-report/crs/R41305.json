Barron, an assistant professor at Harvard Law School, during her time as a professor there.", "The article provides an overview of two traditional dichotomies in administrative law on which courts rely in choosing between whether to accord deference to agency interpretations of statutory provisions: (1) the use of formal or informal procedures, such as the procedures set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and (2) the general or particular applicability of agency decisions, such as whether an agency action binds more than one party. The authors propose a new method of determining what type of judicial review should apply to agency actions. They term this approach the Chevron nondelegation doctrine and emphasize its roots in ideas of political accountability and discipline of agency action.", "Under Barron and Kagan's Chevron nondelegation doctrine, the agency's interpretation would receive a type of substantial deference from the courts, known as \"Chevron deference,\" if the individual designated by Congress to carry out the statute (the statutory delegatee) has formally adopted the agency's decision after a meaningful review and issued the decision under her name. The agency's interpretation would receive a weaker type of judicial deference, known as Skidmore deference, if the statutory delegatee subdelegated her decisionmaking authority to a lower-level agency official (other than her close advisors). Thus, under the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, the choice between whether agencies or courts should interpret and resolve ambiguous statutes would depend on the question of who in the agency makes the interpretation\u2014a high- or low-level agency employee.", "If adopted by the Supreme Court, the Chevron nondelegation doctrine would appear to result in a major reformulation of the Court's jurisprudence regarding which agency actions receive Chevron deference. Courts generally do not focus on the identity of the agency decisionmaker, but rather view agencies as a single entity and do not differentiate in the levels of deference that they grant to decisions issued by civil servants or political appointees, branch chiefs or headquarters officials, agency heads or low-level employees.", "Barron and Kagan's proposed Chevron nondelegation doctrine would address a phenomenon of \"judicial channeling\" that the authors call \"unfortunate\"\u2014that an agency's discretion in choosing from the multitude of legitimate modes of agency decisionmaking is both influenced and limited by the courts' application of the more substantial Chevron deference to decisions undertaken with greater procedural formality or that apply more generally.

Courts both interpret statutes and grant varying levels of deference to agency interpretations when examining questions such as whether an agency's action is in excess of its delegated statutory authority. According to Barron and Kagan, judicial deference to agency interpretations of legislative gaps presently depends on the formality of the procedures used by the agency and whether the agency's decision has general or particular applicability. Barron and Kagan find that the Supreme Court's focus on these dichotomies of proceduralism and generality \"fail[s] to generate the most appropriate distribution of interpretive power.\" Instead, the authors advocate drawing the line between administrative and judicial power to resolve statutory ambiguities on the basis of the position and authority of the agency actor who makes the decision, rather than the agency's use of formal procedures or the agency's issuance of a generally applicable decision.

The premise of the nondelegation doctrine is that Article I of Constitution vests legislative power in Congress to make the laws that are necessary and proper, and \"the legislative power of Congress cannot be delegated\" to other branches of government. There are two rationales for the nondelegation doctrine\u2014a separation of powers argument and a checks and balances argument\u2014in addition to several policy justifications. ", "Before the New Deal, the nondelegation doctrine consisted of several Supreme Court rulings that pronounced that Congress may not delegate its legislative powers. In each of these cases, and others as well, the delegations were in fact, if not in name, approved under various theories. Modern delegation doctrine may trace its inception to J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States , where the Court noted that in order to govern effectively Congress must seek the assistance of other branches and observed that the extent of the assistance \"must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental co-ordinaton.\" A congressional delegation of legislative authority would be sustained, the Court announced, whenever Congress provides an \"intelligible principle\" that executive branch officials must follow and that their actions may be evaluated against. Stated otherwise, it is \"constitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated authority. Private rights are protected by access to the courts to test the application of the policy in the light of these legislative declarations.\"", "The Court has struck down two legislative delegations as lacking an \"intelligible principle\" under the nondelegation doctrine. In Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan , the Court found no \"intelligible principle\" when Congress provided the President with the authority to prohibit the interstate transfer of petroleum without providing any standards or limits constraining when such authority was to be exercised. Similarly, in A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States , Congress was found to have created an unauthorized delegation of legislative authority when it gave the President the authority to enact \"codes of fair competition.\" In support of its decision in Schechter , the Court noted both that \"fair competition\" was not a term which could easily be defined and that the breadth of the President's authority was markedly different from other cases in which executive officials had been delegated solely the authority to establish prices or issue licenses.", "The Court has not struck down a congressional delegation to an executive agency since these two New Deal cases in 1935. After these cases, the Court has continued to discuss the nondelegation doctrine, while upholding congressional delegations of legislative power to executive agencies, and has sanctioned many delegations that lacked optimal legislative specificity. The Court also has construed legislation to impose more requirements than is textually required in order to avoid constitutional nondelegation issues. After the Court's 2001 decision in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc. , which did not find a violation of the nondelegation doctrine, the nondelegation doctrine has been declared by several commentators to be, if not \"dead,\" at least \"on life support, with the Supreme Court neither willing to pull the plug nor prepared to revive it.\"", "The Chevron nondelegation doctrine proposed by Barron and Kagan would apply Chevron deference to agency decisions based on internal agency decisionmaking processes. Under their Chevron nondelegation doctrine, Chevron deference would be accorded to lawful agency decisions that are made by the individual to which the relevant statute has delegated the decisionmaking authority, who would typically be the agency head. Chevron deference would be due if this congressionally-designated agency official met two conditions: (1) the statutory delegatee (or her senior advisors ) formally adopted the agency's decision as her own and issued the decision under her name, and (2) the statutory delegatee (or her immediate advisors) conducted a meaningful review of the agency's decision. If the statutory delegatee subdelegates her decisionmaking authority, or if a decision is made by a lower-level agency official, that agency interpretation would not be eligible for Chevron deference, but could instead still potentially receive Skidmore deference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barron & Kagan's Chevron Nondelegation Doctrine", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Barron and Kagan's law review article compares its proposal for a new method of judicial deference to agency decisionmaking, which the authors refer to as the Chevron nondelegation doctrine, to the congressional nondelegation doctrine. As discussed above, the Supreme Court has already elucidated several types of judicial deference to agency action, including Chevron and Skidmore deference. Under the Chevron nondelegation doctrine proposed in the article, whether an agency decision receives Chevron or a lesser type of deference for its actions depends on whether one or two delegations have occurred. The first delegation is the delegation of legislative power from Congress to a particular agency official. The second delegation is of decisionmaking power from the designated agency official to others within the agency. ", "Issues that may arise with the first delegation are addressed under the congressional nondelegation doctrine: Congress may delegate authority if it provides an \"intelligible principle\" that agency officials must follow and that their actions may be evaluated against. Issues that may arise with the second delegation would be addressed through the principles of the Chevron nondelegation doctrine outlined in the article: if the individual designated by Congress makes the decision that fills in a legislative gap, courts should defer to the agency decision under Chevron , but if a lower-level agency official provides the interpretation, courts should exercise their interpretive authority to resolve statutory ambiguities. ", "The article refers to this choice between whether agencies or courts will resolve ambiguities in statutory interpretation as \"institutional choice.\" The Chevron nondelegation doctrine would make this institutional choice between the agencies and the courts dependent on \"institutional design.\" Institutional design is a question of who within the agency exercises the interpretive authority to resolve a statutory ambiguity: the individual designated by Congress, who would usually be a high-level agency official, or a lower-level agency official.", "The article discusses two \"dichotomies\" of administrative law on which the Supreme Court relies to make the institutional choice or, in other words, to determine \"the most appropriate distribution of interpretive power,\" between agencies and courts\u2014(1) formal versus informal procedures and (2) general versus particular applicability of agency decisionmaking and rulings. The article then introduces a third calculation\u2014the centralized versus decentralized nature of agency action or \"institutional design.\" ", "As an example of the first dichotomy, formal versus informal procedures, the article compares the major rule issued after notice-and-comment rulemaking in Chevron with the tariff classification ruling issued in Mead after more \"streamlined\" processes. Barron and Kagan critique the Court's preference for formal procedures for \"fail[ing] to acknowledge the costs\" of using formal APA procedures. As an example of the second dichotomy, general versus particular decisionmaking, the rule in Chevron applied generally to all \"new or modified major stationary sources,\" while the Mead tariff classification ruling had particular effect in that the tariff classification ruling applied to the \"particular transaction\" of three-ring binder day planners. The authors note the Supreme Court's suggestion that general agency decisions \"should receive greater judicial deference\" and remark that agencies have valid reasons to choose between making decisions with either general or particular effects.", "Instead of relying on these two dichotomies, Barron and Kagan would examine whether the agency decision was centralized or decentralized, by focusing on the whether the statutory delegatee or a lower-level agency official took responsibility for the agency decision. Agencies would receive Chevron deference for resolutions of statutory ambiguity personally made by statutory delegatees. Courts would resolve questions of legislative ambiguities if lower-level agency officials made the agency decision. For example, the Chevron rule was issued by a high-level official at the center of the agency hierarchy\u2014the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\u2014and that rule received what became known as Chevron deference from the Supreme Court. The initial Mead tariff classification ruling was issued by a Customs Service official in one of the 46 port-of-entry offices, in other words, a lower-level agency official, while the two subsequent rulings were issued by the director of the Commercial Rulings Division at Customs Headquarters. The Court held that Chevron deference was not applicable to Customs Service tariff classification rulings. ", "According to Barron and Kagan, their Chevron nondelegation doctrine would have the advantages of political accountability and disciplined agency decisionmaking and would avoid the reported disadvantages of the congressional nondelegation doctrine\u2014excessive centralization and the infeasibility of judicial enforcement. Due to the Court's differing views on when agency decisions should receive Chevron deference, the authors \"see some potential for the Court to move toward, and even converge on,\" their Chevron nondelegation doctrine."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "I. Background", "paragraphs": ["The background section of the article provides an overview of Chevron and then discusses the questions that courts and commentators grappled with post- Chevron \u2013 such as what types of agency decisions (those in formal or informal adjudications, those exempt from notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures) should receive Chevron deference. The authors then offer statistics comparing the volume of regulations promulgated with notice-and-comment procedures to agency decisions issued without notice and comment; they state that the \"mass of agency action\" takes place outside of notice-and-comment procedures. ", "The authors frame as one of the \"principal questions of administrative law\" whether (1) courts will accept agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes that appear in forms other than notice-and-comment rulemaking (such as administrative adjudications that do not follow formal APA procedures) or (2) courts will use independent judgment to resolve statutory ambiguities. It would appear that this is a reformulation of the question of \"institutional choice\" between agencies and courts resolving statutory ambiguities that the authors discussed earlier in the article. Barron and Kagan then discuss Christensen v. Harris County and United States v. Mead Corporation as cases that address this question. ", "In Christensen , the Supreme Court did not accord Chevron deference to an agency interpretation issued in an opinion letter. As the opinion letter lacked the force of law, like other agency \"policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines,\" it could only qualify for Skidmore deference. In Mead , the Supreme Court also held that Chevron deference did not apply to the Custom Service tariff classification rulings that purported to be \"binding ... until modified or revoked\" and that were supposed to represent the agency's official position on a specific transaction. The Mead Court reasoned that, in the statute at issue, the \"terms of the congressional delegation give no indication that Congress meant to delegate authority to Customs to issue classification rulings with the force of law.\" Rather, the Court said that the Customs classification rulings were \"best treated like 'interpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines'\" and that such rulings may merit Skidmore deference. ", "The article then discusses the role of congressional intent in the Mead majority and dissent and analyzes Mead through the lens of the two dichotomies of administrative law the authors outlined earlier: formality of procedures and generality in administrative decisionmaking. In the case when the statute was ambiguous, the Court said that various \"indicators\" could be used to decide if Congress wanted the agency's decision to have the force of law and if Chevron deference was due. Such indicators of congressional intent for the agency's actions to have the force of law include the use of formal procedures, such as notice-and-comment rulemaking and formal adjudication, as well as the general applicability of the agency's action\u2014in other words, that it binds more than the parties to the ruling. The authors view formal procedures as establishing a safe harbor for agency actions to receive Chevron deference, although the court reserved the right to grant Chevron deference to agency actions taken without formal procedures. Chevron deference would appear to be least likely to be granted in particular, as opposed to general, cases. Justice Scalia, dissenting, focused instead on whether, assuming that Congress had not spoken to the question at issue, Chevron deference should be granted because the agency's interpretation was \"authoritative.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "II. Congressional Intent", "paragraphs": ["According to Barron and Kagan, the type of judicial review that should apply to different agency actions and the amount to which courts defer to agency decisions cannot be determined by looking at actual congressional intent, because Congress rarely states what type of judicial deference (e.g., Chevron , Skidmore ) should apply to different types of agency decisions. Instead, the authors suggest a type of \"constructive\" or \"fictional\" congressional intent that should apply when determining whether courts should defer to agency decisions under Chevron . This constructive congressional intent \"should arise from and reflect candid policy judgments\" about institutional choice\u2014whether, with regard to different types of agency action, agencies or courts should resolve questions of statutory interpretation and fill in legislative gaps.", "According to the authors, in the Chevron decision and the years afterward, Chevron deference to agencies was explained and justified through several different theories: (1) the \"institutional competencies\" theory, which could be viewed as the Court's establishment of \"a common law of judicial review responsive to institutional competencies\" such as agencies' \"accountability and deliberativeness\" in interpretive decisionmaking; (2) the statutory theory, which connected deference to agencies with congressional delegation of responsibilities to agencies\u2014ambiguities in statutes could be viewed as congressional delegations to agencies to explain such ambiguities in regulations; and (3) separation of powers principles, which would grant deference to agencies rather than courts for decisions that interpret ambiguous statutes. ", "Lately, mostly as a result of the influence of Justice Scalia, the predominant theory for granting Chevron deference to agencies is the statutory theory. According to the authors, in a law review article, Justice Scalia focused on the statutory theory as a \"valid theoretical justification\" for Chevron deference because the statutory theory connects congressional intent to deference to agency interpretations, even if congressional intent is \"presumed.\" ", "However, the authors assert that Justice Scalia's emphasis on congressional intent in the statutory theory as the proper justification for Chevron backfired with the Court's decision in Mead . While the statutory theory concerned a \"presumed\" or \"fictional\" congressional intent that when Congress delegated the power of statutory implementation to an agency, that Congress also granted the agency interpretive power, the Mead Court's decision focused on actual congressional intent. According to the authors, Mead 's emphasis on actual congressional intent reaffirms congressional control over \"whether and when Chevron deference should operate.\" ", "The authors outline and then rebut two opposing constitutional arguments questioning whether Congress has the final say over the operation of Chevron deference: (1) \" Chevron arises from the Constitution because courts must refrain from 'policymaking'\" and (2) \" Chevron violates the Constitution because courts must possess dispositive power over 'legal interpretation.'\" With regard to the first argument, the authors state that policymaking and legal interpretation could not be exclusively assigned to the agencies or the courts because they are \"intertwined\" in areas of statutory ambiguities. With regard to the second argument, despite any constitutional separation of the policymaking and legal interpretation functions, once Congress makes an institutional choice between agencies and courts for the resolution of statutory ambiguities, that congressional choice should lead \"other constitutional interpreters,\" presumably the agencies and courts, to \"assume\" that that congressional choice \"involves the exercise of appropriate authority.\"", "In the context of Congress's lack of specification as to whether Chevron should apply, the authors then critique Mead as clouding the role of the courts in determining when Chevron applies, particularly when Congress does not make the decision (and it most often does not) about whether Chevron should apply. When Congress has considered the issue, the authors note that Congress has altered Chevron deference to grant interpretive power to the courts instead of the agencies. The authors believe that Congress's silence on whether Chevron should apply is more attributable to Congress not considering the issue of whether interpretive power should be placed within agencies or courts than congressional agreement with Chevron deference to agency interpretations.", "Barron and Kagan next discuss a theory about congressional delegations to agencies to make decisions with the \"force of law\" that would provide the agencies with authority to interpret the law as well. The theory holds that congressional delegations to an agency to take actions that have a binding effect, such as statutory commands to promulgate rules or adjudicate, should be viewed as Congress's allocation of power to the agency, as opposed to the courts, to resolve statutory ambiguities. The authors then proceed to rebut this theory by: (1) stating that Congress may want judicial review of agency resolutions of statutory ambiguities, (2) offering pre- Chevron examples of when Congress and the courts separated agencies' ability to make laws from agencies' authority to interpret laws, and (3) proposing and offering examples of the opposite scenario\u2014that Congress may grant an agency the authority to interpret laws without giving the agency the authority to make decisions with the force of law until courts review the agency's decision. ", "The authors state that whether an agency action has formal procedures and general effect is not relevant to the question of actual congressional intent as to whether and when Chevron deference should apply. They point out that Congress allows agencies to forego procedural formalities and choose between issuing general or particular decisions and state that \"Congress never has suggested a differential scheme of judicial review.\" Rather, they assert that the APA's judicial review provision \"cuts across all these distinctions,\" which would appear to include whether the agency acts with procedural formalities or issues a general or particular decision.", "Barron and Kagan then use Mead as an illustration of their assertion that actual congressional intent is an unreliable means of determining whether Chevron deference should apply. They note that \"[t]he statute at issue in [ Mead ] contains unusual indicia of legislative intent regarding judicial review of agency decisions\" in that the \"most natural understanding\" of a presumption of correctness for a tariff classification decision would be that the court should defer to the Customs determination regarding a specific statutory term unless the agency's determination was unreasonable under step two of Chevron . However, according to the authors, the Mead Court did not view this statutory provision in the same way and reached the opposite conclusion of what the statute appeared to require. Therefore, they find that the Mead Court's \"failure\" to examine statutory language \"in any sustained or coherent way bodes ill for a method of defining [when Chevron deference applies] that focuses on statutory interpretation.\"", "Since the authors view actual congressional intent as an unreliable method of determining whether Chevron deference should apply, the authors state that the Court must create a \"constructive substitute\" for actual congressional intent. Barron and Kagan outline three options for this \"constructive substitute\" for actual congressional intent: (1) an \"appeal to constitutional principles,\" such as separation of powers; (2) an assumption of congressional self-interest; and (3) an assessment by the courts of \"policy judgments based on institutional attributes.\" The authors believe that the third choice, which focuses on the Court's \"own sense of sound administrative policy,\" is the \"only workable approach\" with regard to the placement of interpretive power in the hands of the agencies or the courts. ", "The first option, an appeal to constitutional principles, indicates that Congress decides whether to grant power to resolve statutory ambiguities to the courts or agencies. If Congress does not allocate this authority, the Court would be \"force[d]\" to look to constitutional principles, which, in turn, lead back to Congress and merely \"restate the dilemma.\" The second option, an examination of implicit congressional intent \"reflecting legislative self-interest\" or congressional aggrandizement, lacks theoretical and practical support and would be \"impossible\" to implement as a \"scheme of judicial review of interpretive decisions.\" The third option tracks Chevron 's approach\u2014courts would address congressional silence on the matter of judicial review by \"focus[ing] on the policy consequences\" of allowing agencies or courts to make different kinds of decisions. If Congress has not determined whether agencies or courts should possess interpretive authority, then, under the third option, courts would \"assess how and when different institutions promote accountable and considered administrative governance,\" in other words, political accountability and disciplined agency decisionmaking. ", "Returning to the formality of procedures and general versus particular applicability dichotomies, Barron and Kagan then assert that the third option underlies the Court's approach in Mead . They view congressional intent to grant Chevron deference to agency actions that arise out of formal procedures as the Court's \"own determination of when agencies should be 'assumed generally' to make better interpretive decisions than [the] courts.\" They also see the Court's question of whether an agency decision is generally applicable, in that it binds more than the parties to the proceeding, as the Court's determination of when agencies should receive Chevron deference from courts. The authors offer three potential rationales for the Court attributing its own policy judgments on agency actions to congressional intent: (1) highlighting Congress's ability to reverse the Court's judgment, (2) underscoring the \"'judicial' nature\" of the Court's actions, and (3) obscuring an attempt by the Court to increase its own power. In the next section, Barron and Kagan evaluate the Mead Court's policy judgments that were based on institutional attributes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "III. Proceduralism and Generality", "paragraphs": ["The authors examine two views of the Mead Court's policy judgments: (1) as \"case-by-case inquiry\" as to whether Chevron deference applies, with unpredictable results, and (2) as a function of the two dichotomies of administrative law\u2014the use of formal or informal procedures and general or particular decisionmaking\u2014with Chevron deference granted to \"more formal and general forms of decision making.\" ", "First, the authors discuss a view of the Mead Court's lack of a bright line rule for when Chevron deference should apply as a type of \"partial reversion\" to the pre- Chevron era of judicial deference to agency decisionmaking. The authors analogize this view of Mead as an after-the-fact balancing decision to the pre- Chevron deference era's examination of factors including \"the scope and nature of the delegation, the importance and complexity of the interpretive question, the degree of the agency's expertise, and the thoroughness and history.\" This view of Mead as an unstructured or unpredictable case-by-case inquiry into whether Chevron deference applies would present problems for agencies and the public in that uncertainty as to Chevron 's application would lead agencies to use \"excess caution and wasted effort\" and impact agencies' decisionmaking processes. However, the authors do not agree with this view of the Mead decision. ", "Next, the authors examine a second view of Mead as establishing a structured safe harbor for when Chevron deference applies to agency interpretations of ambiguities in statutes. Although the APA permits the use of less formal procedures for certain types of rulemaking and adjudication, if the agency uses notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures or formal adjudication procedures, the court will apply Chevron deference. Additionally, the more particular (or less general) an agency's decisions are, the less likely the agency is to retain the \"possibility of interpretive control\" or receive Chevron deference. The authors refer to the consequences of choosing formal procedures and general decisionmaking as \"judicial channeling\"\u2014the agency's discretion in choosing formal or informal procedures for its decisionmaking would be affected by the lesser level of judicial deference that would apply if the agency uses informal procedures.", "The authors then evaluate the negative consequences of Mead 's \"judicial channeling\" by returning to a discussion of the two dichotomies of formal versus informal procedures and general versus particular agency actions. With regard to procedural formality, Barron and Kagan explore two arguments in favor of granting Chevron deference to agency decisions made using formal procedures that they define as (1) prophylactic and (2) preferential. The first prophylactic, or protective, argument holds that by not granting Chevron deference for agencies' use of informal procedures, courts will guarantee that agencies will use formal procedures when required by law. The second preferential argument posits that if agencies use formal procedures, they should receive Chevron deference as a benefit for more accountable and deliberative decisionmaking. ", "The authors find that the arguments in favor of applying Chevron deference to agency decisions undertaken using formal procedures do not justify Mead , but rather (a) respond to a problem that could be solved by the courts directly examining whether an agency did not follow the proper procedures, (b) encourage the use of formal procedures when they are not mandated or when inappropriate, (c) discount the provisions of the APA that do not require formal procedures, (d) increase the chance that agencies will not delineate their views on a matter before undertaking an enforcement action, (e) fail to recognize the values of informal procedures, and (f) add to the ossification of the rulemaking process because formal procedures \"consume significant agency time and resources and thereby inhibit needed regulatory (or ... deregulatory) initiatives.\" Finally, Barron and Kagan question the inherent value of notice-and-comment procedures, noting that the increased effort that agencies place in their rulemaking proposals may lead agencies to be less responsive to concerns expressed during the rulemaking process and that the notice-and-comment process has become \"a forum for competition among interest groups, rather than a means to further the public interest.\"", "Barron and Kagan then discuss Mead 's \"suggest[ion] that informal agency action should get Chevron deference only (though not necessarily) when that action ... formally binds parties outside the proceeding\" as an apparent assumption that general agency decisionmaking merits more deference than particular or limited agency decisionmaking. The authors view the Mead Court's suggestion about Chevron deference for informal agency action as potentially supported by two reasons: that general rules (1) \"force[] an agency to engage in more comprehensive analysis\" or (2) \"show[] a firmer commitment by the agency to the decision.\" They then appear to rebut the first reason by finding that case-by-case decisionmaking \"may reflect a deeply reasoned judgment\" that proceeding case-by-case would \"promote the sensible development of the law\" because the issues at hand may be of a \"specialized and varying\" nature or too novel for a general decision. With regard to the second reason, the authors indicate that case-by-case decisionmaking \"shows no more uncertainty\" than a court would show if it decided to confine its holding in a particular case to narrower grounds. Barron and Kagan find that Mead 's focus on general decisionmaking would lead to \"overbroad, premature, or otherwise ill-advised judgments.\"", "Barron and Kagan would discard Mead 's emphasis on formal procedures and general decisionmaking because its proposed shift to such decisionmaking could be more time-consuming and expensive and because it may lead to \"worse results\" that do not take into account the potential for future variances.

First, the Chevron nondelegation doctrine does not prevent internal delegations, but rather affects the type of deference ( Chevron or Skidmore ) that such delegations are afforded by courts. Second, high-level agency officials can more easily comply with a nondelegation doctrine than can Congress, while at the same time \"leaving most of the effort associated with policymaking in the bureaucracy.\" ", "In other words, while the nondelegation doctrine would place a greater burden on Congress to take actions or \"do nothing\" due to the constitutional requirements for legislative action, Barron and Kagan argue that under the Chevron nondelegation doctrine it is more feasible for the delegatee to monitor the agency. The authors point to the agency's more limited decisions and functions, the delegatee's ability as a single administrator or a board or commission to act \"with greater expedition,\" and the delegatee's choice of various processes to meet the Chevron nondelegation doctrine's requirement for meaningful review of agency action.", "Additionally, Barron and Kagan argue that centralization of decisionmaking authority would not \"diminish[] the quality of agency decisionmaking by subordinating the knowledge, experience, and professionalism of lower-level employees.\" The authors acknowledge that agency decisionmaking may become more political as a result of increased political accountability, but find that the benefits of centralization outweigh agencies' bureaucratic qualities\u2014\"excesses of tradition and inertia\" that may \"blind them to new and beneficial policy approaches.\" The authors also view their Chevron nondelegation doctrine as a method of deference that would encourage exchanges between upper and lower-level agency perspectives because statutory delegatees will still rely on lower-level agency employees to provide options for agency policies and decisions. ", "Even if the Chevron nondelegation doctrine's centralization of decisionmaking authority did \"suppress expertise in a way more hazardous than [the authors] acknowledge,\" they find that their approach would be \"self-limiting.\" By \"self-limiting,\" the authors mean that the agency's need to issue timely decisions and the burdens imposed by conducting upper-level review would preclude all agency decisions from undergoing such review.

One of the reasons they offer for this proposition is that the statutory delegatee's \"sense of professional responsibility\" may counsel her against indiscriminately adopting agency interpretations. Another reason that the statutory delegatee would choose not to adopt an agency interpretation is that a subdelegatee's decision may still be upheld by a court, albeit without Chevron deference. Additionally, the statutory delegatee would face political risks if she formally adopted an \"ill-considered, aberrant, or unpopular decision,\" such as criticism from the President, Congress, interest groups, or the media, because adoption would make it more difficult for the delegatee to deny involvement in the interpretation's issuance. Finally, different branches of an agency may pressure the statutory delegatee not to formally adopt an interpretation that then would receive Chevron deference from the courts without meeting the meaningful review requirement. In this last scenario, internal divisions of the agency may either not want to follow the processes necessary to receive Chevron deference or may want to distance their own division from the agency's interpretation in later litigation.", "The authors then discuss how the courts should address attempts by statutory delegatees to rubberstamp agency decisions.

The ability of an agency to receive Chevron deference may differ in the case of a vacancy in a position filled by a single statutory delegatee, to which the Vacancies Act would apply, as opposed to vacancies on multi-member boards or commissions, to which the Vacancies Act does not apply and which typically require a quorum and simple majority of members to issue binding decisions. ", "A vacancy in an advice and consent position, such as the head of a single administrator agency, may be filled temporarily by an acting official.

Another potential argument for granting Chevron deference to such temporary officials under the Chevron nondelegation doctrine would be that there are a limited number of individuals that could be appointed pursuant to the Vacancies Act. These individuals are \"higher level officers,\" some of whom have gone through the confirmation process for their position, and they are authorized to perform the functions and duties of the office, albeit temporarily. A potential argument for denying Chevron deference under the Chevron nondelegation doctrine and potentially granting only Skidmore deference is that acting official would only serve in the position of the statutory delegatee for the limited time of the appointment.", "Vacancies on multi-member boards that result in the lack of a quorum generally would prevent the agency from issuing binding decisions at the board or commission level. For example, the Federal Election Commission (FEC), which has six commissioners, had five vacancies for approximately a six-month period in 2008, and, as a result, lacked a quorum. These vacancies prevented the agency from issuing advisory opinions and beginning audits of political committees. The FEC was also unable to move forward on enforcement matters because each stage of an enforcement matter (reason to believe, investigation, probable cause, and conciliation) requires the votes of four Commissioners. ", "In another example, the operations of the five member National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) were impacted in a 27-month period spanning from 2008 to 2010 due to the vacancies in three of the five seats. Before the Board's membership was reduced from four to three members, the Board delegated its authority to a three-member group. The recess appointment of one of the three members then expired, and the Board only had two members who, the Board argued, constituted a quorum of the three member group; these two members decided almost 600 cases. In New Process Steel, L.P. v NLRB , the Supreme Court said that while it was neither \"insensitive to the Board's understandable desire to keep its doors open despite vacancies,\" nor \"unaware of the costs that delay imposes on the litigants,\" the proper reading of the Board's quorum requirements and the delegation clause \"requires that a delegee group maintain a membership of three in order to exercise the delegated authority of the Board.\"", "One result of such vacancies may be that all agency decisions issued by lower-level employees at multi-member boards or commissions during this time would be eligible for Skidmore deference. One potential way to avoid such a scenario would be to allow Chevron deference for agency decisions issued by other upper level individuals, who would include, according to Barron and Kagan, senior advisors to the statutory delegatees, such as chiefs of staff or special assistants, as well as officials with supervisory authority, such as the agency general counsel.

This would appear to be the case if only courts do not undertake a case-by-case review of when the statutory delegatee has conducted a seemingly standardless meaningful review prior to formally adopting an agency decision. For example, a court could find that the delegatee has not undertaken an adequate review and instead consider the agency's interpretation under Skidmore 's less deferential standard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "\"Mass of Agency Action\" Receiving Skidmore Deference", "paragraphs": ["One possible implication of the \"mass of agency action[s]\" issued by lower-level employees only potentially receiving Skidmore deference could be that the courts may decide more cases without deferring to the agency's interpretation. This could theoretically lead to more uncertainty among regulated parties and the agency as to how much deference courts will accord particular decisions. An increase in the number of court decisions on agency decisions by lower-level officials that could potentially receive Skidmore deference could occur at the same time that the courts potentially lessen their scrutiny of high-level agency decisions if, as Barron and Kagan argue, courts should only act to address rubberstamping if the statutory delegatee has always failed to conduct a meaningful review of the agency's action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interim Final Rules", "paragraphs": ["Another potential issue of the Chevron nondelegation doctrine concerns the timing of the decision. As the delegatee's decision to adopt an agency interpretation must occur before the agency issues its interpretation in final form, this may raise a question of what level of deference a statutory delegatee's adoption of an \"interim final rule,\" which is issued pursuant to a good cause finding but without notice and comment, would receive. Barron and Kagan state that the statutory delegatee cannot ratify the final agency decision after its issuance. Interim final rules have binding effect if validly promulgated, although agencies may modify such rules to take into account post-promulgation comments from the public.

", "Congress may decide against delegating interpretive authority to agencies for myriad reasons: (1) agencies may give greater attention to special interests because these groups may be more organized than the general public, particularly in the notice-and-comment rulemaking process; (2) agencies may affect the marketplace or act in ways that may be viewed as attempts to retain or increase their power; and (3) required rules and procedures may make agency action slow and inefficient. If Congress decides to delegate its legislative authority to an agency to interpret a statute, Congress can control the delegation of such authority by writing broad or narrow statutes, eliminating procedural requirements, and maintaining a supervisory role over the power it has given to the agencies.", "If the Chevron nondelegation doctrine were adopted, its emphasis on granting Chevron deference to high-level agency decisions, which the statutory delegatee has adopted as her own after a meaningful review, could potentially lead Congress to become more specific in its delegations, to ensure that the voluminous amount of agency decisionmaking that occurs at the lower levels of an agency also receives Chevron deference. For example, rather than delegate a decision that requires input from the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Congress could consider delegating authority to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, or even the head of CDER."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
