His case ignited impassioned debate in Mongolia. Some saw it as an object lesson in the difficulty of holding a politically powerful and internationally-connected figure to account. Others saw it as a politically-driven vendetta that brought into question Mongolia's commitment to human rights and the rule of law. ", "Immediately after the former President's arrest, his supporters denounced the charges as politically motivated. His son, a United States-educated banker, described the government's treatment of his father as \"a purge\" and alleged that the government sought \"to keep him away from the election and remove him from politics.\" Enkhbayar was then, and remains today, head of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), a breakaway party formed in 2011after the original MPRP changed its name to the Mongolian People's Party. Enkhbayar's arrest came two months before parliamentary elections and it made him ineligible to run for office.

The IAAC stated that it had sought to question Enkhbayar for months and arrested him only after he repeatedly ignored its summonses.

Influential figures in the international community, including UN Secretary General Bank Ki-moon, expressed concern about the government's treatment of the former President.

It also has reserves of rare earth elements, although their size is not yet known. In the short-term, however, Mongolia is grappling with declining foreign direct investment, weak mineral exports, a resulting serious imbalance in its balance of payments, high inflation, and rapid increases in non-performing loans in the banking sector. In June 2014, the World Bank called for a \"structural shift in the economic policy framework to restore economic and financial stability,\" with a focus on tighter monetary policy, and better enforcement of lending regulations and of Mongolia's Fiscal Stability Law.\" It has also called for \"a more prudent resource revenue management system,\" so that Mongolia can begin accumulating savings from its resource revenues.", "In the medium- to long-term, Mongolia faces several existential questions related to its economic development. One is how to avoid the \"natural resource curse\" that has afflicted some other resource-rich countries, involving such problems as currency pressures, ballooning government budgets, corruption, and environmental degradation. Mongolia is experiencing a taste of all those issues now, but economists do not judge it yet to be in the full throes of a \"natural resource curse.\" A second challenge is how, in a democracy, to balance the need for legal guarantees for foreign investors with the perceived need to be responsive to popular pressure to renegotiate or otherwise change the terms of contracts in order to provide the Mongolian state and public with greater rewards, particularly in extractive industries.", "A third challenge is how to overcome constraints related to Mongolia's land-locked status and limited domestic transportation networks. All goods leaving or entering Mongolia must traverse the territory of one of Mongolia's two powerful neighbors, China and Russia. (Mongolia is separated from Kazakhstan in the west by 30 miles of Russian territory.) Within Mongolia, to get to either neighbor's border, goods must currently be either trucked on mostly unpaved roads, or transported on one of just two railway lines. Mongolia's main railway is a single-track, with passing places, which runs 690 miles from the Russian border in the north to the Chinese border in the south. An eastern railway runs 148 miles from Choybalsan to the Russian border. Although the government of Mongolia has ambitious rail development plans, it currently is constructing only one new rail line to the Chinese border from the eastern coal mining regions of the Gobi desert, principally to transport coal.\u00a0The line is slated for completion in 2016.

China is currently both Mongolia's largest foreign investor and its biggest trading partner. The almost $6 billion in two-way trade between Mongolia and China is nearly four times the volume of trade between Mongolia and its second largest trading partner, Russia. (See Table 1 below.) As of mid-2012, Chinese investment in Mongolia accounted for just under one third of total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country. Mongolia's National Security Concept document, adopted in 2010, directs the government to, \"Design a strategy whereby the investment of any foreign country does not exceed one third of overall foreign investment in Mongolia.\" Mongolia's reliance on trade with and investment from China makes it particularly vulnerable to the effects of slower growth in China."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Investment Climate", "paragraphs": ["Mongolia has sought to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) as a way to raise capital for exploitation of its mineral resources, introduce financial and managerial expertise and new technologies, and diversify its economic partners.
