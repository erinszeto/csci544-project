In the decade prior to the introduction of the first measles vaccine in 1963, most children got measles while growing up. Each year, approximately 3-4 million people in the United States caught the infection, an estimated 400 to 500 people died, and 48,000 were hospitalized. As recently as 2013, the World Health Organization estimated 145,700 deaths globally from measles.", "In 1954, John F. Enders and Dr. Thomas C. Peebles collected blood samples from several ill students during a measles outbreak in Boston, MA, in an attempt to create a measles vaccine. By 1963, Enders and colleagues had successfully created a measles vaccine and licensed it in the United States. Today, the measles vaccine is combined with mumps and rubella (MMR) or with mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV).", "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and CDC recommend that all children receive two doses of MMR vaccine, the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second at 4 to 6 years of age.

", "According to the CDC, the risks associated with the MMR vaccine \"causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small\" and receiving the vaccine \"is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.\" However, as is the case with every medication, the MMR/MMRV vaccine is not 100% safe. It can result in what CDC characterizes as \"mild problems,\" such as fever (1 out of 6 people) or mild rash (1 out of 20 people); \"moderate problems,\" such as seizure caused by fever (1 out of 3,000 doses) or temporary joint stiffness or pain, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4); and \"severe problems,\" such as serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out a million doses) or deafness. The rarity of these severe problems makes it difficult to ascertain whether they are caused by the vaccine.", "It should be noted that among the issues that has resulted in pockets of lower rates of MMR/MMRV vaccination have been concerns over the safety of the measles vaccine itself, in particular concerns that the vaccine may cause autism. While the perception is real and may be influencing some parent's decisions to vaccinate their children, the scientific link between autism and the MMR vaccine has been studied extensively and has overwhelmingly been found to be unsubstantiated.

What has changed in recent years is the number of measles importations into the U.S. due to the continued high rates of measles in some parts of the world combined with pockets within the U.S. where vaccination rates are low.

In addition to the VCP is CDC's Section 317 immunization program, which is funded by annual discretionary appropriations and provides grants to states, territories, commonwealth trusts, and several cities for vaccine purchase and programs (e.g., outreach and disease surveillance). The President's FY2016 budget request includes a projected $560.5 million for the Section 317 program. According to CDC, in calendar year 2014, the VCP and Section 317 programs spent $38.3 million on the purchase of MMR vaccine for children.

With regard to communicable disease outbreaks, these powers may include the enactment of mandatory vaccination laws. The Supreme Court has upheld the power of states to institute a mandatory vaccination program as an exercise of its police powers. In Jacobson v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts , the Supreme Court upheld a state law that gave municipal boards of health the authority to require the vaccination of persons over the age of 21 against smallpox, and determined that the vaccination program had \"a real and substantial relation to the protection of the public health and safety.\" In upholding the law, the Court noted that \"the police power of a State must be held to embrace, at least, such reasonable regulations established directly by legislative enactment as will protect the public health and the public safety.\" ", "Likewise, the Court has recognized state and local power to require students to be vaccinated. In Zucht v. King , the Supreme Court upheld a local ordinance requiring vaccinations for schoolchildren. The Court invoked Jacobson for the principle that states may use their police power to require vaccinations, and noted that the ordinance did not bestow \"arbitrary power, but only that broad discretion required for the protection of the public health.\" In turn, lower courts have given considerable deference to the use of the states' police power to require immunizations to protect the public health. For example, West Virginia does not offer a religious exemption from school vaccination requirements, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has rejected free exercise, equal protection, and substantive due process challenges to the law. Similarly, New York permits religious exemptions only if a parent holds \"genuine and sincere religious beliefs\" against vaccination, and permits school districts to bar unvaccinated children from school during an outbreak. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has upheld the law against substantive due process, free exercise, and equal protection claims.", "Many states also have laws providing for mandatory vaccinations during a public health emergency or outbreak of a communicable disease. Generally, the power to order such actions rests with the governor of the state or with a state health officer. For example, a governor may have the power to supplement the state's existing compulsory vaccination programs and institute additional programs in the event of a civil defense emergency period. Or, a state health officer may, upon declaration of a public health emergency, order an individual to be vaccinated \"for communicable diseases that have significant morbidity or mortality and present a severe danger to public health.\" In addition, exemptions may be provided for medical reasons or where objections are based on religion or conscience. However, if a person refuses to be vaccinated, he or she may be quarantined during the public health emergency giving rise to the vaccination order. State statutes may also provide additional authority to permit specified groups of persons to be trained to administer vaccines during an emergency in the event insufficient health care professionals are available for vaccine administration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Authority", "paragraphs": ["Although states have traditionally exercised the bulk of authority in this area, the federal government does have jurisdiction over public health matters. The Commerce Clause states that Congress shall have the power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.\" Accordingly, under the Public Health Service Act, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has authority to make and enforce regulations necessary \"to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.\" Regulations issued pursuant to this authority include quarantine and isolation measures to halt the spread of certain communicable diseases. However, no mandatory vaccination programs are specifically authorized, nor do there appear to be any regulations regarding the implementation of a mandatory vaccination program at the federal level during a public health emergency. ", "With regard to foreign countries, the Secretary has the power to restrict the entry of groups of aliens for public health reasons. This power includes the authority to issue vaccination requirements for immigrants seeking entry into the United States. Currently, certain vaccines specified in statute, and other vaccines recommended by the ACIP for the general U.S. population, are required for immigrants who seek permanent residence in the United States, and for people currently living in the United States who seek to adjust their status to become permanent residents. CDC has determined that two diseases for which vaccines are recommended for routine use by the ACIP\u2014for human papillomavirus (HPV) and zoster (shingles)\u2014do not have the potential to cause outbreaks, and are therefore not required for admission. Vaccination requirements may be waived when the foreign national receives the vaccination, if the civil surgeon or panel physician certifies that the vaccination would not be medically appropriate, or if the vaccination would be contrary to the foreign national's religious or moral beliefs. ", "Likewise, the military has broad authority in dealing with its personnel, both military and civilian, including the protection of their health. Military regulations require U.S. troops to be immunized against a number of diseases, including tetanus, diphtheria, influenza, hepatitis A, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and yellow fever. Inoculations begin upon entry into military service, and later vaccines depend upon troop specialties or assignments to different geographic areas of the world. Courts have upheld the legality of military mandatory vaccination orders.
