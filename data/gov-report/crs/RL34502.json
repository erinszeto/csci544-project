In addition, auction revenues offer a unique opportunity to reduce the overall costs of the emissions program. Several economic studies indicate that if used in the most efficient manner, overall costs could be minimized by almost 50%.", "A greenhouse gas (GHG) emission cap-and-trade program would create a valuable new commodity: the GHG emission allowance.

Studies have estimated profits could be maintained in the energy production and electricity generation sectors, if approximately 20% of allowances were provided to those sectors at no cost. Members may also consider allotting allowance value to consumers, particularly low-income households, who are expected to bear the majority of the compliance costs via higher energy prices. Another option would involve distributing the allowance value to support various objectives: technology development, energy efficiency improvements, biological sequestration, climate change adaptation efforts, or non climate-related purposes, such as deficit reduction.

In general, the regulatory structure varies by the type of facility and/or the state in which the electricity is generated. In 2007, the more traditional, price-regulated electric utilities generated approximately 60% of the total net electricity generated in the United States.

Under a no-cost distribution system, utilities would have mitigation costs and opportunity costs associated with the allowances (discussed above).", "If policymakers auction allowances to electric utilities, both price-regulated and competitive-market utilities would include the cost of purchasing emission allowances in the price of electricity.

Consumers in competitive areas would not receive the benefit of \"free allowances\" and would thus face disproportionate price increases. This consequence would erode the effectiveness of the cap-and-trade program, because consumers would likely not receive a price signal that is strong enough to encourage conservation or energy efficiency improvements.", "The effects of this inefficient outcome may be magnified, because approximately 75% of coal-fired electricity was generated by price-regulated utilities in 2007. Thus, consumers that utilize more-carbon intensive electricity would face a weaker price signal than consumers using less carbon-intensive electricity.", "The price disparities that consumers with comparable fuel portfolios would experience under different electricity regulatory structures would be both unfair and inefficient.

For example, during the first five years of the program established by S. 2191 , fossil fuel-fired power plants would receive 19% of the emission allowances at no cost. This percentage would gradually decline to zero by 2031."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Offset Reductions in Distortionary Taxes", "paragraphs": ["Economic theory generally supports a tax policy that would reduce taxes on favored activities (increased employment or personal income) and increase taxes on less desirable behavior (increased pollution).

In the early 1990s, some economists suggested that the double-dividend effect would be strong enough to keep the overall costs to society relatively small or even negative. However, more recent economic studies indicate that the costs imposed by the cap-and-trade program could act as an additional tax, which would most likely (at least in the United States) exceed the benefits of revenue recycling.", "Several economic studies have estimated the cost savings to society that auction revenues could provide. A cap-and-trade program is expected to impose an economic cost on society. A frequently cited study found that auctioning allowances could reduce the projected costs between 21% and 47%. The range of potential cost savings reflects different uses of the auction revenues. If policymakers were to distribute the revenues to U.S. households in \"lump-sum\" payments\u2014for example, increase the standard tax deduction or mail payments to households\u2014the cost savings would be on the lower end of the spectrum.

Covered sources have demonstrated this behavior in two cap-and-trade programs, in which the vast majority of allowances was provided at no cost: the European Union's Emission Trading System (EU-ETS) and the U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions trading program.", "Because of cost pass-through, consumers, particularly households, are ultimately expected to bear the majority of the costs associated with a cap-and-trade program. Figure 5 illustrates the relative distribution of costs to different groups in a cap-and-trade program. The figure is based on a cap-and-trade scenario that would auction 100% of the emission allowances to fossil fuel producers (often referred to as \"upstream\" sources). Households and businesses experience the vast majority (89%) of the costs. Moreover, the household percentage is potentially understated, because many businesses would likely pass through some of their increased energy/electricity costs in the form of higher prices for their goods and services.", "The figure is instructive for the allocation debate, because it shows a starting point for cost distribution.

S. 2191 would distribute the majority of its auction revenues (approximately 52%) to promote energy-related technologies: low-carbon energy sources, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and cellulosic biofuels. Energy efficiency: Improvements in energy efficiency could make considerable contributions in achieving GHG emission reductions. Although energy efficiency may involve technology advancements, new technologies must be used in order to realize the efficiency gains. In some cases, parties may need incentives beyond the efficiency gains to induce behavioral changes. For example, allowance value could be distributed to support efficiency gains at places\u2014residences, commercial buildings\u2014that are unlikely to be covered by an emissions cap. Biological sequestration: Trees, plants, and soils sequester carbon, removing it from the earth's atmosphere. Allowance values could be allotted to provide financial incentives for landowners to engage in activity\u2014for example, conservation tillage, reforestation\u2014that would increase sequestration on their land. Although some of these actions may qualify as offsets (if allowed in a cap-and-trade program), some activities may need additional incentives or be unable to satisfy the offset approval process. Adaptation efforts: Some level of global warming (and associated effects) will occur regardless of emission reduction efforts taken today, because previous and current GHG emissions will have long term climate impacts. Therefore, some contend that investment (e.g., allowance value) should focus on preparing communities to adapt to the effects of a changing climate. Deficit reduction: Another proposal for the use of allowances or auction revenue is to address a budget deficit that may result from a cap-and-trade program. A portion of the allowances or auction proceeds could be set aside to offset projected revenue shortfalls. This option is sometimes described as making the program \"revenue-neutral.\" In addition, Congress may consider using allowance value to offset shortfalls beyond those that are related to the cap-and-trade program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Policy Considerations", "paragraphs": ["The distribution of allowance value would present policymakers with a series of trade-offs.

Some argue that using auction revenues to offset tax reductions is an unlikely outcome. In general, when the government obtains new revenue, it tends to fund new or existing programs rather than reduce existing taxes. Indeed, none of the cap-and-trade bills in the 110 th Congress has proposed to use revenues in this manner.", "Moreover, the most efficient manner of revenue recycling would generally spread the cost reductions throughout the economy, while certain groups would be expected to bear a disproportionate percentage of the costs of a cap-and-trade program.
