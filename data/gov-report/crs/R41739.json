What is fundamentally fair in a given situation depends in part on the objectives of a given system of law weighed alongside the possible infringement of individual liberties that the system might impose. In the criminal law system, some basic objectives are to discover the truth, punish the guilty proportionately with their crimes, acquit the innocent without unnecessary delay or expense, and prevent and deter further crime, thereby providing for the public order. Military justice shares these objectives in part, but also serves to enhance discipline throughout the Armed Forces, serving the overall objective of providing an effective national defense.", "The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that \"no person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Due process includes the opportunity to be heard whenever the government places any of these fundamental liberties at stake. The Constitution contains other explicit rights applicable to various stages of a criminal prosecution. Criminal proceedings provide both the opportunity to contest guilt and to challenge the government's conduct that may have violated the rights of the accused. The system of procedural rules used to conduct a criminal hearing, therefore, serves as a safeguard against violations of constitutional rights that take place outside the courtroom."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Courts-Martial", "paragraphs": ["The Constitution, in order to provide for the common defense, gives Congress the power to raise, support, and regulate the Armed Forces, but makes the President Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. Article III, which governs the federal judiciary, does not give it any explicit role in the military, and the Supreme Court has taken the view that Congress's power \"To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces\" is entirely separate from Article III. Therefore, courts-martial are not considered to be Article III courts and are not subject to all of the rules that apply in federal courts.", "Members of the Armed Forces are subjected to rules, orders, proceedings, and consequences different from the rights and obligations of their civilian counterparts. As such, it might be said that discipline is as important as liberty interests in the military justice system. The Constitution specifically exempts military members accused of a crime from the Fifth Amendment right to a grand jury indictment, from which the Supreme Court has inferred there is no right to a civil jury in courts-martial. However, in part because of the different standards provided in courts-martial, their jurisdiction is limited to those persons and offenses the military has a legitimate interest in regulating. Courts-martial jurisdiction extends mainly to servicemembers on active duty, prisoners of war, and persons accompanying the Armed Forces in time of declared war, as well as certain violators of the law of war.", "Under Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to raise and support armies; provide and maintain a navy; and provide for organizing and disciplining them.

The President implemented the UCMJ through the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), which was initially prescribed by Executive Order 12473 (April 13, 1984). The MCM contains the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM), the Military Rules of Evidence (MRE), and the UCMJ. The MCM covers almost all aspects of military law. Military courts are not considered Article III courts but instead are established pursuant to Article I of the Constitution, and as a result are of limited jurisdiction.

The President is authorized to prescribe the punishments which a court-martial may impose within the limits established by Congress. In addition, a servicemember may be tried at a court-martial for offenses not specifically covered through the use of the General Article\u2014UCMJ Article 134, which states that all \"crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special, or summary court martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense.\" The Armed Forces have used Article 134 to assimilate state and federal offenses for which there is no analogous crime in the UCMJ in order to impose court-martial jurisdiction.

This inquiry may range from an examination of the charges and an investigative report or summary of expected evidence to a more extensive investigation, depending on the offense(s) alleged and the complexity of the case. The investigation may be conducted by members of the command or, in more complex cases, military and civilian law enforcement officials. Once evidence has been gathered and the inquiry is complete, the commander can choose to dispose of the charges by (1) taking no action, (2) initiating administrative action, (3) imposing non-judicial punishment, (4) preferring charges, or (5) forwarding to a higher authority for preferral of charges. The first formal step in a court-martial, preferral of charges, consists of drafting a charge sheet containing the charges and specifications against the accused. The charge sheet must be signed by the accuser under oath before a commissioned officer authorized to administer oaths. Once charges have been preferred they may be referred to one of three types of courts-martial: summary, special, or general. The seriousness of the offenses alleged generally determines the type of court-martial. The court-martial must be convened by an officer with sufficient legal authority, that is, the \"convening authority,\" who will generally be the commander of the unit to which the accused is assigned.", "Many recent military justice cases have raised the question of the mental capacity of the accused. An individual may not be tried by court-martial if he is suffering from a mental disease or defect such that he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or is unable to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense. In the event the mental capacity or mental responsibility, or both, of the accused is questioned, an examination may be ordered by the convening authority and/or the military judge. The examination, often referred to as an RCM 706 board, must answer the following four questions: (1) at the time of the alleged criminal conduct, did the accused have a severe mental disease or defect; (2) what is the clinical psychiatric diagnosis; (3) was the accused, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct and as a result of such severe mental disease or defect, unable to appreciate the nature or wrongfulness of his conduct; and (4) is the accused presently suffering from a mental disease or defect to the point that he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings or to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense? ", "The report of the RCM 706 board may lead to the case being suspended, charges being dismissed by the convening authority, administrative separation of the accused from military service, or the charges being tried by court-martial. Although an accused may be found competent to be tried by court-martial, that determination does not prohibit the accused from claiming the defense of lack of mental responsibility. In order to prevail on a defense of lack of mental responsibility, the accused must prove by clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, he was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his acts. Regardless of an initial competency determination, additional examinations may be ordered at any stage of the proceedings if the accused's mental capacity is questioned.

It is a separate and co-equal branch of the federal government, independent of the executive and legislative branches, designed to be insulated from the public passions. Its function is not to make law but to interpret law and decide disputes arising under it. Federal criminal law and procedures are enacted by Congress and housed primarily in Title 18 of the U.S. Code . The Supreme Court promulgates procedural rules for criminal trials at the federal district courts, subject to Congress's approval. These rules, namely the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Fed. R. Crim. P.) and the Federal Rules of Evidence (Fed. R. Evid.), incorporate procedural rights that the Constitution and various statutes demand. ", "Unlike with the federal courts, the Supreme Court does not promulgate procedural rules for military courts-martial. As discussed above, Congress regulates the Armed Forces largely through Title 10 of the U.S. Code . The military courts-martial system is specifically addressed in the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Chapter 47 of Title 10. Article 36 of the UCMJ authorizes the President to prescribe rules for \"pretrial, trial, and post-trial procedures, including modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial.\" Such rules are to \"apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts\" insofar as the President \"considers practicable\" but that \"may not be contrary to or inconsistent\" with the UCMJ. Pursuant to that delegation, the President created the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) and the Military Rules of Evidence (MRE).

While the promulgated RCM and the MRE are applicable to all courts-martial, the jurisdiction and authorized punishments vary among the different courts-martial types. The function of the summary court-martial is to \"promptly adjudicate minor offenses under a simple procedure\" and \"thoroughly and impartially inquire into both sides of the matter\" ensuring that the \"interests of both the Government and the accused are safeguarded and that justice is done.\" However, special and general courts-martial function to adjudicate more serious offenses with more severe punishments and thus the procedures are more complex.", "Although a discussion of the RCM and MRE is beyond the scope of this report, the procedures employed in courts-martial are intended to afford servicemembers basic constitutional rights.

In the case of enlisted members above pay grade E-4, the summary court-martial may not adjudge confinement or hard labor without confinement and can only reduce them to the next lower pay grade. Summary courts-martial are composed of one commissioned officer who need not be a lawyer. The accused must consent to the proceedings and normally is not entitled to a lawyer.

Contrary to civilian criminal trials, the agreement of only two-thirds of the members of a court-martial is needed to find the accused guilty. Otherwise, the accused is acquitted. There are no \"hung juries\" in courts-martial. Regardless of the offenses tried, the maximum punishment allowed at a special court-martial is confinement for one year; hard labor without confinement for up to three months; forfeiture of two-thirds' pay per month for up to one year; reduction in pay grade; and a bad-conduct discharge.

This investigation, known as an Article 32 hearing, is meant to ensure that there is a basis for prosecution. An investigating officer, who must be a commissioned officer, presides, and the accused has the same entitlements to counsel as in special courts-martial. However, unlike in a civilian grand jury investigation, where the accused has no access to the proceedings, the accused is afforded the opportunity to examine the evidence presented against him, cross-examine witnesses, and present his own arguments. If the investigation uncovers evidence that the accused has committed an offense not charged, the investigating officer can recommend that new charges be added. Likewise, if the investigating officer believes that evidence is insufficient to support a charge, he can recommend that it be dismissed. Once the Article 32 investigation is complete, the investigating officer makes recommendations to the convening authority (CA) via the CA's legal advisor. The legal advisor, in turn, provides the CA with a formal written recommendation, known as the Article 34, UCMJ advice, as to the disposition of the charges.

This review is recognized as the accused's best hope for relief, as the CA has broad powers to act on the case. Upon review of the record of trial and the SJA's recommendation, the CA may, among other remedies, suspend all or part of the sentence, disapprove a finding or conviction, or lower the sentence. The CA may not increase the sentence. Once the CA takes action on the case, the conviction is ripe for an appeal.

In the specific case, the CA dismissed the conviction of an Air Force officer who had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to prison at a court-martial for the sexual assault of a civilian. The authority of the CA to modify the findings and sentence of the court-martial is a matter of command prerogative involving the sole discretion of the convening authority.
