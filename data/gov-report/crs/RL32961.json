The report's primary focus is on veterans and not military retirees . While any person who has served in the armed forces of the United States is regarded as a veteran, a military retiree is someone who has completed a full active duty military career (almost always at least 20 years of service), or who is disabled in the line of military duty and meets certain length of service and extent of disability criteria, and who is eligible for retired pay and a broad range of nonmonetary benefits from the Department of Defense (DOD) after retirement. A veteran is someone who has served in the armed forces (in most, but not all, cases for a few years in early adulthood), but may not have either sufficient service or disability to be entitled to post-service retired pay and nonmonetary benefits from DOD. Generally, all military retirees are veterans, but all veterans are not military retirees.", "Currently, VA health care services are generally available to all honorably discharged veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces who are enrolled in VA's health care system. In general, veterans have to enroll in the VA's health care system to receive care from VA. Typically veterans are enrolled in priority enrollment groups based on service-connectedness and income (described later in this report). Persons enlisting in one of the armed forces after September 7, 1980, and officers commissioned after October 16, 1981 must have completed two years of active duty or the full period of their initial service obligation to be eligible for benefits. Veterans discharged at any time because of service-connected disabilities are not held to this requirement. Also eligible on a more limited basis are members of the armed forces Reserve components called to active duty and who serve the length of time for which they were activated, and National Guard personnel who are called to active duty by a federal declaration and serve the full period for which they were called. These servicemembers can receive care from VA for an initial two-year period for conditions presumably related to military service and for proven service-connected conditions thereafter.", "To provide some context on veterans' health care issues, the first part of this report provides a brief history of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and an overview of the evolution of eligibility for VA health care.

Established in 1946 as the Department of Medicine and Surgery, it was succeeded in 1989 by the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration, and renamed the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in 1991. The veterans' medical system was first developed to provide needed care to veterans injured or sick as a result of service during wartime. When there was excess capacity in VA hospitals, Congress gave wartime veterans without service-connected conditions access to VA hospitals, provided space was available and the veterans signed an oath indicating they were unable to pay for their care. At the end of World War II, the federal government undertook the task of increasing the number of VA medical facilities to meet the expected demand for health care for veterans returning with injuries or illnesses sustained during hostilities. The primary focus of the expansion was to immediately tend to the medical needs of returning combatants for acute care and then to address the long-term rehabilitation needs of more seriously injured veterans. Within a few years after the cessation of hostilities, the initial demand for acute care services for service-connected conditions diminished and VA initiated what was later to become its specialized services mission, in part because services such as spinal cord injury care, blind rehabilitation, and prosthetics were almost non-existent in the private medical market during the late 1940s.", "The VA system has evolved and expanded since World War II. Congress has enlarged the scope of the VA's health care mission and has enacted legislation requiring the establishment of new programs and services. Through numerous laws, some narrowly focused, others more comprehensive, Congress has also extended to additional categories of veterans' eligibility for the many levels of care the VA now provides. No longer a health care system focused only on service-connected veterans, the VA has also become a \"safety net\" for the many lower-income veterans who have come to depend upon it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transformation of VHA", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, VA has transformed its health care system through structural and organizational changes. In the early 1990s VA recognized that its system might want to respond to certain changes taking place in the private health care market and began a process of restructuring and rationalizing services. VA established regional networks and decentralized certain budgetary authority to these networks. Furthermore, advances in medical technology, such as laser and other minimally invasive surgical techniques, allowed care previously provided in hospitals to be provided on an outpatient basis. Similarly, development of psychotherapeutic drugs to treat mental illness have led to fewer and shorter hospital admissions for psychiatric patients, as well as the deinstitutionalization of many long-term psychiatric patients. With the passage of eligibility reform legislation in 1996 ( P.L. 104-262 ) and in response to changing trends in medical practice, VA began to shift its focus from primarily inpatient hospital care to outpatient care in order to provide more accessible and efficient delivery of health care to veterans.", "Today, VA operates the nation's largest integrated health care system. VHA is divided into 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs, see Appendix A for a map of VISNs). Each network includes a management office responsible for making basic budgetary, planning and operating decisions. Each office oversees between five and 11 hospitals as well as community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), nursing homes and readjustment counseling centers (Vet Centers) located within each VISN. In FY2005, VA operated 157 hospitals, 750 CBOCs, 134 nursing homes and 42 domiciliary care facilities. ,", "Unlike other federal health programs (such as Medicaid and Medicare), the VA is a direct service provider rather than a health insurer or payer for health care services. VHA offers a standardized medical benefits package that includes a full range of outpatient and inpatient services with an emphasis on preventive and primary care. As defined in regulations, VA medical benefits include among other things, preventive services, including immunizations, screening tests, and health education and training classes, primary health care diagnosis and treatment, prescription drugs, comprehensive rehabilitative services, mental health services including professional counseling, home health care, respite (inpatient), hospice, and palliative care, and emergency care. Some veterans are also eligible to receive long-term care including nursing home care, domiciliary care, adult day care, and limited dental care.", "In FY2005, there were 7.7 million enrolled veterans, and 4.8 million unique veteran patients received care from VA. That same fiscal year, VA treated 768,651 inpatients, 89,961 veterans in nursing home care units or in community nursing home facilities, and 30,118 veterans in home and community-based facilities. The VHA's outpatient clinics registered more than 52 million visits by veterans in FY2005.", "In addition to providing direct health care to veterans, since 1946 VA has been authorized to enter into agreements with medical schools and their teaching hospitals. Under these agreements, VA hospitals provide training for medical residents and students and appoint medical school faculty as VA staff physicians to supervise resident education and patient care. Across the nation, VA is currently affiliated with 107 medical schools, 54 dental schools, and over 1,000 other schools offering students allied and associated education degrees or certificates in 40 health profession disciplines. More than one-half of all practicing physicians in the U.S. received at least part of their clinical educational experiences in the VA health care system. In FY2005, more than 87,000 health care professionals received training in VA medical centers. VA is also the largest employer of registered nurses in the United States, with 32,582 nurses on its payroll in FY2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolution of Veterans' Eligibility for VA Health Care", "paragraphs": ["To understand some of the issues facing veterans' health care programs discussed later in this report, it is important to get a sense of how veterans' eligibility for health care has evolved over time. While a full description of this evolution is beyond the scope of this report, this report will provide a brief overview. Generally, veterans' eligibility for VA health care services has evolved from treating veterans with service-connected conditions or veterans with low incomes to veterans with nonservice-connected conditions and higher incomes. Moreover, VA's health care coverage has changed from not having a well-defined medical benefits package to a standardized benefits package.", "Eligibility criteria used to determine which veterans must be served by VA and what type of medical care that they can be provided has undergone many changes since the establishment of VA. Congress has made several major changes throughout the years concerning the provision of hospital care, outpatient care and nursing home care. Initially veterans could receive care only for treatment of service-connected conditions that were incurred or aggravated during wartime service. In 1924, Congress gave access to hospital care to World War I veterans with nonservice-connected conditions on a space available basis who signed an oath of poverty. In 1943, hospital care was extended to World War II veterans with nonservice-connected conditions and outpatient care was limited to those with service-connected conditions. However, with the passage of P.L. 86-639 in 1960, Congress authorized VA to provide outpatient treatment for nonservice-connected conditions in preparation for or to complete treatment of hospital care. In 1973, with the passage of the Veterans Health Care Expansion Act ( P.L. 93-82 ), Congress further extended outpatient treatment for nonservice-connected veterans to \"obviate the need of hospital admission.\"", "By 1985, VA was authorized to provide most categories of veterans with hospital, nursing home, and domiciliary care. However, VA was not required or obligated to do so. This is evidenced by the use of the phrase \"may provide\" in the statutes. In 1986, with passage of P.L. 99-272 , Congress established three categories of eligibility for VA health care. The law provided that hospital care shall be provided, free of direct charge, to veterans within Category A. The term \"shall\" was interpreted by many as meaning \"entitled\" to hospital care. These Category A veterans were defined to include those with service-connected disabilities, low-income veterans without such disabilities, and certain \"exempt\" veterans, including (for example) former prisoners of war, those exposed to Agent Orange, recipients of VA pensions, and those eligible for Medicaid. Moreover, P.L. 99-272 provided that Category A veterans may be provided outpatient and nursing home care. The term \"may\" was interpreted by many as meaning \"eligible\" for outpatient and nursing home care. Veterans not in Category A were assigned to either Category B or Category C on the basis of current income and net worth; VA could furnish care to these veterans on a resources-available basis. Veterans not eligible for Category B on the basis of either income or net worth were placed in Category C. Veterans in Categories B and C were eligible to receive care but were not entitled to care.", "It should be noted that the terms eligibility and entitlement had different meanings under the VA health care system than under other public health care programs such as Medicare. For instance, all beneficiaries who meet the basic eligibility requirements for Medicare are entitled to all medically necessary care under the Medicare benefits package. Under the VA health care system, the term \"eligible\" meant that VA \"may\" provide care, and the term \"entitled\" meant that VA was required or \"must\" provide care. However, neither being eligible for nor being entitled to health care services guaranteed the availability of health services. Since funding for VA health care was, and still is, based on fixed annual appropriations, once the funds were expended VA could no longer provide care, even to veterans who were entitled to care. Being entitled to care essentially gave veterans a higher priority for care than being eligible for VA health care."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Eligibility Reform", "paragraphs": ["Although from time to time Congress expanded access to VA health care, certain criteria that accompanied these expansions were an apparent source of frustration not only for veterans, but also for VA physicians and VA administrative staff who applied and enforced these provisions. As mentioned earlier, some veterans were entitled to outpatient care only if it was for pre- and post-hospitalization and to obviate the need for hospital care. As illustrated in Figure 1 , for most categories of veterans, eligibility for outpatient care was subject to the obviate the need for hospitalization criterion. Only two categories of veterans were not subject to this criterion: they were veterans with a service-connected disability rated 50% or more who were entitled to care, and nonservice-connected veterans with special status, such as former prisoners of war, who were only eligible for care.", "However, the obviate the need statutory authority was interpreted by VA medical centers in several different ways. Some medical centers interpreted it as care for any medical condition, whereas other medical centers interpreted this statutory authority as care for only certain medical conditions. Similarly, since there was no defined health benefits package prior to eligibility reform, veterans were often uncertain about whether they were entitled to certain services or were merely eligible to receive some services. Likewise, VA health care providers complained that when treating certain veterans, they could only treat the service-connected conditions and not the entire patient, although the nonservice-connected condition could affect the veteran's overall health.", "These limitations were addressed by Congress with the passage of the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996 ( P.L. 104-262 ). This act required VA to establish priority categories and operate a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care if sufficient resources were not available to serve all veterans seeking care. It also substantially revised statutes governing care for veterans, putting inpatient and outpatient care on the same statutory footing so that VA can provide care the patient needs in the most medically appropriate setting. The intent of these changes was to expand the services VHA could provide to veterans while eliminating statutory barriers to providing care in the most economical manner, and to lower the expenses associated with providing care to veterans.", "VHA began enrolling veterans beginning October 1, 1998. A detailed list of priority enrollment groups is provided in Appendix B . , Table 1 provides details on eligibility for VA health care prior to the enactment of P.L. 104-262 , as it relates to the current priority enrollment groups. For example, as illustrated in Table 1 , veterans with service-connected conditions rated 50%-100% currently are correlated to Priority Group1 veterans. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated 0%-40% may either be Priority Group 2 or Priority Group 3 depending upon their disability rating. These veterans, along with other veterans discharged for disability, would have had the clearest entitlement to VA services prior to eligibility reform.", "Although the prior eligibility criteria have no direct correlation to today's enrollment priority groups, in general, Category A correlated with Priority Groups 1 through 6, and Category C correlated with Priority Groups 7 and 8. Category B (not shown in Table 1 ) included veterans with nonservice-connected disabilities who may have received hospital and nursing home care if they were unable to defray the cost of the said care based on a defined income threshold. Category B most closely correlated with veterans in Priority Group 4 and certain veterans classified in Priority Group 5. Former Category B veterans cannot be isolated in Table 1 because it is spread among multiple priority groups.", "Today, 10 years after the passage of the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, when Congress dramatically restructured the VA health care system, VA has experienced unprecedented growth in demand for medical care. The total number of veteran enrollees has grown by 79.5% from FY1999, the first year of enrollment, to FY2005 ( Figure 2 ). During this same period the number of unique veterans receiving medical care has grown by 49.2%\u2014from 3.2 million veteran patients in FY1999 to 4.8 million veteran patients in FY2005 ( Figure 2 ). This growth in demand for care, and the budgetary constraints placed on the federal budget has once again opened the debate in Congress as to what categories of veterans should have priority to receive care. Some in Congress are concerned about the growing costs, question the current eligibility for VA medical care, and suggest that it should be narrowed. They believe that VA's primary responsibility is to care for veterans with service-connected medical problems and that the system should not be providing care to veterans with nonservice-connected conditions with incomes above certain mean-tests. However, most of the veterans currently enrolled in VA were eligible for, if not entitled to, certain care from VA prior to the 1996 reforms. The reform act clarified and expanded veterans' access to outpatient care. It also built in mechanisms to limit enrollment in the event that VA funding was insufficient to meet the demand for care. Most of the issues discussed in the next section are linked to these fundamental concerns."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Health Care Issues in the 109th Congress", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Shortly after the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on September 11, 2001, military personnel began deploying to Afghanistan.

The Administration's response to this concern has been that \"if PTSD appears in a non-enrolled combat veteran following the end of his or her two-year period of eligibility, and is subsequently determined to be service-connected, that veteran would then become eligible for enrollment in Priority Group 1, 2, or 3, and thus they would be able to receive needed care.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Mental Health and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)", "paragraphs": ["With the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress is greatly concerned about VA's current and future capacity to treat mental health issues of these new veterans.

People who suffer from PTSD often relive the experience through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty sleeping, and feel detached or estranged; these symptoms can be severe enough and last long enough to significantly impair the person's daily life.

Early in the Iraq War, the Army surveyed 3,671 returning veterans and found that up to 17% of the soldiers were already suffering from depression, anxiety and symptoms of PTSD. Other studies have indicated that protracted warfare in Iraq\u2014with its intense urban street fighting, civilian combatants and terrorism\u2014could drive PTSD rates even higher.

Reportedly, there is less stigma associated with disclosing PTSD symptoms in VA settings, but there are perceived risks associated with disclosure within military settings. Nondisclosure could result in servicemembers not receiving early intervention and an underestimation of the future demand for VA mental health services.", "For more than two decades, Congress has highlighted the importance of PTSD services for veterans. In 1984 Congress established the Special Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (Special Committee) to determine VA's capacity to provide assessment and treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and to guide VA's educational, research and benefits activities with regard to PTSD. The Special Committee is composed of PTSD experts from across a broad spectrum of VA's Mental Health and Readjustment Counseling Services (RCS).

It estimates that an estimated 40% of OEF and OIF casualties returning by the way of Walter Reed Army Medical Center report symptoms consistent with PTSD. Moreover, the Special Committee in its 2004 report concluded that \"VA must meet the needs of new combat veterans while still providing for veterans of past wars. Unfortunately, VA does not have sufficient capacity to do this.\"", "GAO reported in September 2004 that VA does not have a reliable estimate of the total number of veterans it currently treats for PTSD and lacks the information it needs to determine whether it can meet an increased demand for PTSD services. In February 2005, GAO reviewed 24 of the Special Committee's 37 recommendations and reported that VA has not fully met any of the 24 recommendations. Specifically, GAO determined that VA has not met 10 recommendations and has partially met 14 of these 24 recommendations.", "According to VA, it has undertaken many efforts to improve PTSD care delivered to veterans.

The IG reported that about 25% of the 2,100 PTSD awards it reviewed were based on inadequate evidence of the occurrence of a traumatic event (stressor). VA conducted its own review of the 2,100 cases reviewed by the IG. VA's preliminary findings showed that some of the decisions on PTSD claims were premature. According to VA, it found that a large percentage of cases judged to have insufficient evidence were older cases in which VA statutes prohibit a change in the rating decision.

This discussion will use mandatory funding to refer to these policy proposals.", "To understand mandatory funding proposals, it is essential to understand how VA programs are funded presently. Under current law, VA programs are funded through both mandatory and discretionary spending authorities. The following programs are among mandatory spending programs: cash benefit programs, i.e., compensation and pensions (and benefits for eligible survivors); readjustment benefits (education and training, special assistance for disabled veterans); home loan guarantees; and veterans' insurance and indemnities. Each of these programs is an appropriated entitlement program that is funded through annual appropriations. With any entitlement program, because of the underlying law, the government is required to provide eligible recipients with the benefits to which they are entitled, whatever the cost. With these mandatory veterans' programs, Congress must appropriate the money necessary to fund the obligation. If the amount Congress provides in the annual appropriations act is not enough, it must make up the difference in a supplemental appropriation. Like other entitlement programs, spending automatically increases or decreases over time as the number of recipients eligible for benefits varies. Certain of these VA entitlement benefits are indexed for inflation; the benefit amount will increase automatically based on the measured increase in the cost-of-living adjustment.", "The remaining programs, primarily VA health care programs, medical facility construction, medical research, and VA administration, are funded through annual discretionary appropriations. Congress must act each year to provide budget authority for discretionary programs. As a discretionary program, the amount of funds VHA can spend on health care programs for veterans is limited by the amount of its appropriation.", "Generally the mandatory funding proposals that have been suggested by veterans' advocates are based on a formula that takes into account the number of enrolled and nonenrolled veterans eligible for VA medical care, and the rate of medical care inflation. Proponents believe that mandatory funding will eliminate the year-to-year uncertainty about funding levels and close the gap between funding and demand for veterans' health care. Opponents believe that with these proposals spending for VHA will increase significantly as enrollment in the VA health care system soars; in most of the proposed funding formulas, automatic funding increases are primarily based on enrollment figures. Furthermore, critics believe that a static funding formula cannot adequately take into consideration the changing needs of veterans, which could affect the funding level necessary to provide a different mix of services, and that Congress is better able to evaluate the funding needs through the current appropriation process. At a recent hearing, Chairman Buyer of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee stated that \"According to the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], mandatory funding would cost nearly half-a-trillion dollars over ten years. That would be a costly experiment. In contrast, the strong discretionary budgets of the past decade have proven responsive to change.\"", "As highlighted by some budget analysts, changing veterans' medical care into a mandatory budget authority will not solve the issue of closing the gap between funding and demand for veterans' health care, since Congress could place caps on spending for mandatory programs through budget reconciliation language which could limit spending on veterans' health programs. Since Congress can act to change the formula or cap the spending amounts, the issue of uncertainty in funding amounts may not be resolved either.", "Assured Funding for Veterans Health Care Act, 2005 ( H.R. 515 ) was introduced during the first session. This proposal would require the Secretary of the Treasury to make mandatory appropriations for VA health care based on the following formula: the amount of funds available for VA medical care in FY2007 would equal 130% of the total obligations made by VA for medical care programs in FY2005. The amounts in succeeding years would be adjusted for medical inflation and growth in the number of veterans enrolled in VA's health care system and other non-veterans eligible for care from VA. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 515 would result in a net increase in direct spending totaling about $179 billion over the 2007-2010 period, and $518 billion over the 2007-2015 period.

VA asserted that it would improve its forecasting models to ensure that projections adequately reflect future need. Also, some believe that the CARES plan does not focus enough on future nursing home needs, would leave VA short of beds in a few decades, and thus VA would not have any choice but to privatize some parts of the health care system. Moreover, some veterans' groups believe that CARES is only about closing \"surplus\" hospitals and do not believe that CARES will result in the building of new and modern facilities.

The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) system (VA's electronic health record system) is currently in more than 1,300 VA facilities to maintain the records of over 5 million veterans. CMS and VHA are collaborating to configure VistA technology so that it might be adopted for use in the private physician office setting nationwide. The new product will be known as \"The VistA-Office EHR,\" and the targeted release date is July 2005.", "Since the late 1990s, VA has been generally recognized as a leader in patient safety. In 1999, the VA established a National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) to lead the agency's patient safety efforts and develop a culture of safety throughout the VA health care system. The NCPS developed an internal, confidential, non-punitive reporting and analysis system, the Patient Safety Information System (PSIS), which permits VA employees to report both adverse events and close calls without fear of punishment. Other countries such as Australia, Japan, Denmark, the United Kingdom have adopted strategies from portions of VA's patient safety program. Furthermore, the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organization's (JCAHO) patient safety goals have been influenced by VA's advances in this area. In May 2000, the VA signed an agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS), an independent, external reporting system. The PSRS, which was inaugurated in 2002 at VA hospitals nationwide, is operated by NASA. It is intended to provide VA employees with a \"safety valve\" that allows them confidentially to report close calls or adverse events that, for whatever reason, would otherwise go unreported.", "In the area of pharmaceutical purchasing, VA has been able to obtain prescription drugs at competitive prices. VA has been successful in using a number of purchasing arrangements to obtain substantial discounts on prescription drugs. For the bulk of its pharmaceutical purchases, VA obtains favorable prices through the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). By statute, in order to be able to obtain reimbursement for drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries, manufacturers must offer their drugs on the FSS. FSS prices are intended to be no more than the prices manufacturers charge their most-favored non-federal customers under comparable terms and conditions. VA also buys some brand-name drugs for prices less than- those listed under the FSS. For example, by statute VA can buy brand-name drugs- at a price at least 24% lower than the non-federal average manufacturer price (NFAMP), which may be lower than the FSS price for many drugs. In addition, VA has obtained some drugs at lower than FSS prices through national contracts with a single manufacturer based on a competitive-bid process. VA may solicit competitive bids for therapeutically equivalent drugs and may select one winner based on price alone for exclusive or preferred use on their formularies. Often VA and DOD consolidate their buying power and negotiate contracts together. In FY2003, the total cost avoidance was estimated to be $376 million for VA and DOD contacts. ,", "Several measures ( H.R. 376 , H.R. 563 , H.R. 1626 , H.R. 4610 , H.R. 4652 , S. 123 , S. 563 ) were introduced in the first session of this Congress to allow the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered Medicare Part D pharmaceuticals similar to VA. However, many veterans' advocates have voiced concerns that if prices offered to VA were extended to Medicare recipients or other entities, it would result in increased prices for VA, since pharmaceutical companies will not give the same price discounts that it presently offers VA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary Travel Program", "paragraphs": ["In general, the beneficiary travel program reimburses certain veterans for the cost of travel to VA medical facilities when seeking health care. P.L. 76-432, passed by Congress on March 14, 1940, authorized VA to pay the actual travel expenses, or instead an allowance based upon the mileage traveled by any veteran traveling to or from a VA facility or other place for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care. P.L. 85-857, signed into law on September 2, 1958, authorized VA to pay necessary travel expenses to any veteran traveling to or from a VA facility or other place in connection with vocational rehabilitation counseling or for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care. However, this law changed VA's travel reimbursement into a discretionary authority by stating that VA \"may pay\" expenses of travel. On April 13, 1987, VA published final regulations that sharply curtailed eligibility for the beneficiary travel program. The Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988, P.L. 100-322 , section 108, in large part restored VA travel reimbursement benefits. It required that if VA provides any beneficiary travel reimbursement under section 111 of Title 38 U.S.C. in any given fiscal year, then payments must be provided in that year in the cases of travel for health care services for all the categories of beneficiaries specified in the statute. In order to limit the overall cost of this program, the law imposed a $3 one-way deductible applicable to all travel, except for veterans otherwise eligible for beneficiary travel reimbursement who are traveling by special modes of transportation such as ambulance, air ambulance, wheelchair van, or to receive a compensation and pension examination. In order to limit the overall impact on veterans whose clinical needs dictate frequent travel for VA medical care, an $18-per-calendar-month cap on the deductible was imposed for those veterans who are pre-approved as needing to travel on a frequent basis.", "Therefore, under current law, veterans are reimbursed at the rate of $0.11cents per mile (or at $0.17 cents a mile if called for a repeat compensation and pension exam) and are subject to a $3 (one-way) deductible for each visit, not to exceed $18 per calender month. A veteran will be fully reimbursed for each visit within the same calender month once the $18 deductible is met. It should be emphasized that veterans who are traveling by special modes of transportation such as ambulance, air ambulance, wheelchair van, or to receive a compensation and pension examination are paid full reimbursement and are not subject to this deductible. Table 4 provides details on veterans who are currently eligible to receive travel benefits.", "With the rise in gasoline prices throughout 2005 and 2006, several measures ( H.R. 3147 , H.R. 3948 , H.R. 4025 , S. 996 , S. 3276 ) were introduced to change the method of determining the mileage reimbursement rate and also to eliminate the current deductible amount. However, none of these bills has seen any legislative action.
