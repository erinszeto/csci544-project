Supporters of such directives assert that federal dollars should be spent on disciplines they perceive to be more closely tied to research in the national interest (e.g., national security or health) and that such direction falls within Congress's oversight role. Opponents argue that scientists managing NSF programs ought to determine the distribution of funding by scientific field based on their deep knowledge of research merits and needs in each field, and how these needs are best balanced across NSF's research portfolio. ", "In recent years, a substantial portion of NSF (and other agency) funding has come through continuing appropriations. Continuing appropriations acts\u2014often known as continuing resolutions or CRs\u2014that provide short-term funding until appropriations decisions are finalized can lead to uncertainty for agencies. On one hand, CRs allow for ongoing appropriations discussions without a funding gap. On the other hand, they may lead to reductions or delays in agency operations, such as hiring staff, granting awards and contracts, and beginning new projects, as CRs typically prohibit new activities not funded in the previous fiscal year. Since FY1997, CRs have been enacted on average almost six times per year and provided an average of almost five months of funding annually. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-56 , Division D), provides funding for NSF through December 8, 2017, at the FY2017 level, subject to a 0.6791% across-the-board decrease.", "Further, when funding for an agency and its programs remains at prior year levels, overall purchasing power of appropriated monies is effectively reduced due to the impacts of annual inflation, which has been targeted at 2% by the Federal Reserve in recent years. Both the House and Senate committee reports direct \"not less than the fiscal year 2017 enacted level\" for multiple programs. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 , though current dollar appropriations for NSF have generally increased since FY2010, inflation-adjusted appropriations have remained flat on average. Some analysts argue that even small sustained losses in federal science funding may lead to long-term negative impacts to scientific research and innovation. This may be particularly true for basic research, which often has more uncertainty and longer timelines for generating returns on investment than applied research. Others argue that appropriations levels have remained strong for NSF given the budget constraints of recent years and that funding from other public and private sources should be sought to support scientific research broadly."], "subsections": []}]}}
