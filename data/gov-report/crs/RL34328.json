The act responds to concerns that the United States may not be able to compete economically with other nations in the future due to insufficient investment today in science and technology research and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce development. The America COMPETES Act is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. It is designed to focus on two perceived concerns believed to influence future U.S. competitiveness: inadequate research and development funding to generate sufficient technological progress, and inadequate numbers of American students proficient in science and mathematics or interested in science and engineering careers relative to international competitors.", "The act authorizes funding increases for the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) laboratories, and the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008-FY2010. If maintained, the increases would double the budgets of those entities over seven years. The act establishes the Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 Energy (ARPA-E) within DOE, designed to support transformational energy technology research projects with the goal of enhancing U.S. economic and energy security. A new program, Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, would establish multidisciplinary institutes at DOE National Laboratories to \"apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations,\" according to the act.", "Among the act's education activities, many of which are focused on high-need school districts, are programs to recruit new K-12 STEM teachers, enhance existing STEM teacher skills, and provide more STEM education opportunities for students. The new Department of Education (ED) Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow and existing NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship programs provide opportunities, through institutional grants, for students pursuing STEM degrees and STEM professionals to gain teaching skills and teacher certification, and for current STEM teachers to enhance their teaching skills and understanding of STEM content. The act also authorizes a new program at NSF that would provide grants to create or improve professional science master's degree (PSM) programs that emphasize practical training and preparation for the workforce in high-need fields.", "The America COMPETES Act is an authorization act. New programs established by the act will not be initiated and authorized increases in appropriations for existing programs will not occur unless funded through subsequent appropriation acts. The 110th Congress provided FY2008 appropriations to establish ED's Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program, and NIST's Technology Improvement Program (TIP), which replaced the existing Advanced Technology Program. The 111th Congress provided FY2009 appropriations to establish DOE's ARPA-E and NSF's PSM program. Although some America COMPETES Act research and STEM education programs received appropriations at or above authorized levels in FY2009, others did not.", "As Congress deliberates the FY2010 budget, an issue for Congress is what level, if any, will it provide America COMPETES Act programs an appropriation, and whether or not the President's budget request will propose to do so. Several programs newly authorized in the act have never been appropriated funds. An issue for these programs is whether or not they will receive the funding necessary to establish them.

To be competitive, U.S. companies must engage in trade, retain market shares, and offer high quality products processes and services. Scientific and technological advances can further economic growth because they contribute to the creation of new goods, services, jobs, and capital, or increase productivity. Such advances can compensate for possible disadvantages in the cost of capital and labor faced by firms by enhancing the quality or efficiency in the production of existing goods and services. Scientific advances, government activity, the organization and management of firms, and serendipity can all influence technological progress regardless of economic conditions. In addressing U.S. competitiveness, two policy approaches have primarily been used. One relies on direct measures that include budget outlays and the provision of services by government agencies. The other uses indirect measures such as financial incentives and legal changes.", "Since World War II, the United States has used a combination of direct and indirect approaches to enhance current and future U.S. competitiveness. Following World War II, the Steelman report was issued expressing concerns about U.S. competitiveness: \"the future is certain to confront us with competition from other national economies of a sort we have not hitherto had to meet.\"", "Interest in the competitiveness issue perhaps reached its peak in the 1970s, when some experts became concerned that Japan, Europe, and newly industrialized countries were becoming major competitors with the United States. The United States had lost market share in autos, cameras, stereos, television sets, steel, machine tools, and microelectronics. Some also expressed concerns that U.S. technological superiority, as exhibited by the balance of trade in high-technology products, was declining as the U.S. share of world exports on research and development (R&D)-intensive goods fell while the Japanese share rose. Other indicators were lower productivity growth in the United States than Japan, a narrowing in the gap of the production in the number of scientists and engineers graduating from U.S. universities and those engaged in R&D in the United States compared to Japan and West Germany, the relative proficiency of U.S. high school students in science and mathematics, and a decline in the number of patents granted to Americans while those to foreign inventors doubled. The cause, some believed, was due to U.S. expenditures for civilian R&D falling behind that of Europe and Japan, or some European countries and Japan deriving more economic benefit from their R&D expenditures.", "Congress responded by taking a number of actions including passing the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 ( P.L. 96-480 ), the Patent and Trademark Act Amendments of 1980 (known as the Bayh-Dole Act, P.L. 96-517 ), the Federal Technology Transfer Act ( P.L. 99-502 ), the National Cooperative Research Act ( P.L. 98-462 ), and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 ( P.L. 100-418 ). In addition, the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology, or SEMATECH, consortium, an on-site test facility and a conduit for new technological advances for the U.S. semiconductor industry, was created.", "Additional congressional actions also focused on increasing corporate spending on research and development in response to competitiveness concerns included the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act ( P.L. 97-34 ) and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 ( P.L. 99-514 ), which provided for a research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit. The Small Business Development Act ( P.L. 97-219 ; P.L. 99-443 ) established a set-aside of federal R&D funds to support work in innovative small firms. ", "The competitiveness concerns continued until the mid-1990s when the United States economy and technological innovation improved. Actions were taken by U.S. manufacturers to improve their quality and efficiency, universities and national laboratories increased their linkages to U.S. companies, and the United States was successful in many innovation-based industries such as Internet applications, biotechnology, and nanotechnology while the Japanese economy was in a decline.", "Now that the nation has entered the 21 st century, today's competitiveness concerns tend to be focused on issues related to globalization\u2014that is, a global economy\u2014along with some of the same concerns discussed in previous competitiveness debates\u2014these include whether or not federal science and engineering research funding is sufficient, questions about STEM education quality, and the number of Americans obtaining science and engineering degrees. Much of what Americans consume or buy is produced in other countries, and much of what Americans produce is exported abroad. For example, a growing number of the largest U.S. companies rely on international markets for over 50% of their sales and employ more foreign workers than domestic. This globalization has a growing impact, both positive and negative, on the economic futures of American companies, workers, and families. Increasing integration with the world economy can make the United States more productive, leading to increases in living standards and real disposable incomes. However, rising trade with low-wage developing countries increases workers' concerns about job loss, lower wages, and benefits as American companies take actions to compete in a global economy. The information technology revolution has expanded these competitiveness concerns to U.S. white collar jobs.", "Three broad trends influence today's globalization of the economy. The first is technology, which has sharply reduced the cost of communication and transportation that previously divided markets. The second is a dramatic increase in the world supply of labor producing goods and services traded internationally. The third is government policies that have reduced barriers to trade and investment.", "The America COMPETES Act includes policies that address each of these trends. The act addresses these issues by authorizing primarily direct measures in each of these policy areas. In addition, the act authorizes two committees\u2014one inside government and the other outside government\u2014to look at indirect policy mechanisms.", "With respect to technology, some believe that today's federal funding of basic science and engineering research is inadequate to generate the technological progress needed to create new industries and the associated jobs. The act responds to that concern by increasing federal funding of basic research at the federal agencies primarily responsible for funding physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science\u2014fields that are considered to be major contributors to competitiveness due to their potential for innovation and job creation. In addition, the America COMPETES Act renames and refocuses an existing program that helps fund high-risk research and development at small and medium-sized businesses.", "With respect to labor, the act takes actions that are intended to make the U.S. labor pool more competitive with the world supply of labor. Currently, some believe that inadequate numbers of American students are proficient in science and mathematics. In addition, the number of Americans pursuing post-secondary STEM degrees is considered to be low relative to students in countries considered to be U.S. competitors. The act responds to these concerns by initiating a number of actions to increase the quality and quantity of STEM teachers as well as mechanisms to encourage more American students to undertake advanced STEM classes and post-secondary STEM degrees.", "With respect to government trade and investment policies, the act authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify possible actions the United States might undertake. This includes, for example, studying and reviewing the costs faced by U.S. businesses engaged in innovation compared with foreign competitors.", "Beyond the America COMPETES Act, other recent legislative initiatives propose federal efforts that", "encourage industry to spend more on research and development, promote joint research activities between companies, foster cooperative work between industry and universities, facilitate the transfer of technology from federal laboratories to the private sector, and provide incentives for quality improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues for Congress", "paragraphs": ["The America COMPETES Act had strong bipartisan support; however, while some experts believe that actions should be taken to make the United States more competitive, others do not.

For an individual domestic firm, the focus of competitiveness is trade and the firm's ability to compete for market share against imports from abroad or to compete with foreign firms in overseas export markets. From this perspective, a key measure of competitiveness is the economy's trade balance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Trade Balance", "paragraphs": [" Table 1 shows U.S. trade in advanced technology products. This includes about 500 commodity classification codes representing products whose technology is from a recognized high technology field (e.g., biotechnology) or that represent the leading technology in a field. The United States long ran a surplus in these products, but that surplus dropped sharply in 2000 and turned into a deficit in 2002. The U.S. trade balance in high technology products was last in surplus in 2001.", "In 2002 to 2005, the United States ran a trade deficit in high technology products which grew roughly ten billion dollars per year, from $16.6 billion to $43.6 billion. In 2006 this deficit dropped to $38.1 billion, but in 2007 resumed its former path of growing ten billion dollars per year, to $52.6 billion, but in 2008, this deficit grew to only $55.5 billion. This deficit does not necessarily imply that the United States is losing the high technology race, since many of the high technology imports are from U.S. companies (particularly electronics manufacturers) who assemble the products overseas. However, this growing deficit may warrant closer policy scrutiny."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foreign Direct Investment", "paragraphs": ["For a U.S. multinational corporation, one based in the United States but with production facilities abroad, competitiveness is defined as the ability of its overseas operations to compete for market share with firms from foreign host countries or firms from third countries. From this perspective, a key measure of competitiveness is the degree to which these firms invest their resources in the United States or in other countries (known as \"foreign direct investment\"). As shown in Figure 1 , foreign direct investment in the United States declined sharply after 2000, when a record $300 billion was invested in U.S. businesses and real estate, but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006.", "Domestic labor is likely to share some of the same concerns of the firms and corporations for whom they work, but is also likely to define competitiveness as the firm's ability to compete against foreign firms in export markets or in markets within the United States. Competition is viewed as being between different investment sites and the ability of the United States to compete with foreign countries as a location for what domestic labor views as a job-creating business investment. Key measures for domestic labor are the level of employment and the wages received from employment in the economy.", "The United States is both the largest recipient of foreign direct investments as well as the largest investor abroad. Investment by U.S. firms abroad was $249 billion in 2006 (see Figure 1 ). While some view these investments as an economic gain, others express concern about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages. Seventy percent of U.S. foreign direct investment, however, is concentrated in high-income developed countries and the share of investment going to developing countries has fallen in recent years. As a result, most economists conclude that direct investment abroad is due to a broad restructuring of U.S. manufacturing industries and does not lead to fewer jobs or lower incomes overall for Americans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce and Wages", "paragraphs": ["NSF statistical analysts have indicated that determining the science and engineering workforce and the jobs created as a result of science and engineering is a challenging task. NSF identifies five broad categories of science and engineering occupations: computer and mathematical scientists, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists, and engineers.", "This classification, however, does not account for all those with science and engineering degrees who use this knowledge in their occupations. For example, a chemist who teaches high school chemistry and an engineer who manages a manufacturing plant are classified as a teacher and a manager, respectively, and are not included in NSF's analysis of the science and engineering (S&E) workforce. In addition, there are those who are in science- and engineering-related occupations who use science and engineering knowledge in their jobs, but who may or may not have degrees in science and engineering: for example, a patent attorney or a physician. Some also use their S&E training in nominally non-S&E occupations such as writers, salesmen, financial managers, and legal consultants. As the need for science and engineering knowledge has increased for a growing number of occupations, traditional accounting of such occupations provides less understanding of the science and engineering workforce and it could be considerably larger, perhaps two to three times, than provided in government analyses by the NSF, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and the U.S. Census Bureau.", "According to the National Science Board (NSB), depending on the definition and perspective used, the size of the science and engineering workforce varied between approximately 5.0 million and 21.4 million individuals in 2006. NSB suggests that the most relevant number may be 17.0 million, which in 2006 was the number of individuals who had at least one degree in a science and engineering field, or 21.4 million, which also includes those who have degrees in an S&E related field such as health or technology. According to the NSB, these numbers reflect the many ways science and technical knowledge is used in the United States. This is quite different from that of NSF's science and engineering occupation data (5.0 million in 2006), the U.S. Census Bureau's data (3.9 million in 2005), or BLS data (5.4 million for S&E and 7.4 for STEM occupations in May 2006). A third option is provided by NSF's data that is based on workers' own reporting of their need for at least a bachelor's degree level of science and engineering knowledge (12.9 million in 2003).", "Statistical analysts also find challenging accounting for the need of all workers to have a basic understanding of STEM and of the workers whose employment is related to new technologies. Figure 2 provides an analysis that shows how the skills needed for employment have changed due to computerization. This computerization has reduced the need for routine manual and cognitive tasks and replaced them with high-level tasks. This analysis found that \"Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain sixty percent of the estimated relative demand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nominally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact.\"", "The most long-term analysis of S&E workforce trends is that of the U.S. Census Bureau. As shown in Figure 3 , the number of workers in science and engineering occupations grew significantly\u20147.7 times larger in 2000 than in 1950. This growth rate is higher than that of the total labor force, which grew 2.3 times, and that of all managers and professionals, which grew 4.9 times. The STEM growth rate in the 1990s was a little more than three times that of the overall labor force.", "More recent data of STEM workforce trends from BLS shows mixed results. These data show a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the employed civilian workforce beginning in 2000. On the other hand, BLS reports that science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, compared to a growth of 13% in all occupations during the same time period. It is anticipated that approximately 65% of the growth in science and engineering occupations will be in the computer-related occupations. Faster than average growth is expected as well in the life sciences, social sciences, and the science and engineering-related occupations of post-secondary teachers, healthcare practitioners and technicians, and science managers. In addition, unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. And, as discussed above, it is important to remember that these projections involve only the demand for strictly defined S&E occupations, and do not include the wider range of jobs in which S&E degree holders often use their training.", " Figure 4 shows that the compensation for those in most STEM occupations is above those for the entire U.S. labor force while the growth rate in compensation is about the same. For all STEM workers, compensation ranges from $53,000 to $58,000 per annum compared to $47,000 to $49,500 for people in the professions, and $31,500 to $34,500 for all workers in 2005.", "The mean real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased an average of 15% across all fields from 1993 to 2003. In 2003, median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree had the highest salary, $65,000\u2014higher than non-S&E bachelor's degree recipients whose salary at that stage of their career was $49,000. There can be a great deal of variance, however, among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competitiveness in Perspective", "paragraphs": ["The Council on Competitiveness contends that these traditional measures of competitiveness\u2014trade balance, foreign direct investment, level of employment and wages\u2014do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. For firms, factors such as foreign affiliate sales, intrafirm trade, fragmentation of global supply chains, and lack of inclusion of services and intangibles such as knowledge and intellectual property are not incorporated into today's assessment of the nation's competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness also suggests that due to the global economy, assessing a nation's trade balance is not as useful a measure as it once was. Today, competition is not as much domestic companies competing with foreign companies (as captured in trade balances), but a world where \"value is created through intangible assets flowing through constantly shifting global networks of multinational firms.\" For individuals, the Council on Competitiveness suggest that factors such as pension funds, real estate, value of healthcare benefits, and purchasing power should be additional measures to understand an individual's prosperity. They also propose assessing whether or not prosperity is equivalent across all levels of society, and the potential individuals have to improve their prosperity through their own efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "General Issues", "paragraphs": ["The America COMPETES Act is based on a set of assumptions such as the following:", "STEM knowledge is necessary for all Americans, not just those entering science and engineering careers. American K-12 students do not have sufficient proficiency in STEM due to a lack of teachers with education or training in STEM. Scientists, engineers, and teachers with STEM degrees or enhanced STEM knowledge will generate more enthusiasm for STEM in students than those without such degrees; more enthusiastic students will lead to a better-trained and more competitive workforce. An insufficient number of Americans obtain degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics compared to the nation's economic competitors. More Americans need to be encouraged to pursue such fields so that the United States has the workforce necessary to generate the new ideas that led to the new industries. Individuals who obtain STEM degrees are smart people who can work in a variety of occupations beyond those traditionally assumed for those who earn such degrees. Science and engineering research is important to U.S. competitiveness because of its influence on U.S. economic growth. Current science and engineering basic research funding, particularly in the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science, is insufficient compared to other countries with whom the United States competes. Additional federal funding of basic science and engineering research will make the nation more competitive by creating whole new industries, and the related jobs, and enhancing existing ones.", "These assumptions are based on a variety of analyses. For example, in K-12 STEM education, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) compared the scores of U.S. 15-year-old students in science and mathematics literacy to the scores of their peers internationally in 2006. American students scored an average of 489 points on science literacy, lower than the OECD average of 500 points, and 474 points in mathematics literacy, lower than the OECD average score of 498. Further, another study found that middle school mathematics teachers in the United States are not as well prepared to teach mathematics as many of their counterparts in five other countries, and this inadequate teacher preparation joins deficiencies in mathematics curriculum as reasons contributing to lower scores for American middle-schoolers.", "The United States has one of the lowest rates of first university degrees awarded in STEM fields to that in non-STEM degree production in the world according to NSF data. In 2002, STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States compared to an international average of 26.4%.", "In science and engineering research, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, with support from the National Science Foundation, has developed a research and development satellite account to estimate the effect of investment in research and development on U.S. economic growth. By this analysis, if R&D were treated as investment, it would have accounted for 5% of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004.", "These are illustrations of the many analyses available that emphasize such themes. Some, however, question these fundamental assumptions. They question, for example, if the United States invests in federal research programs, to what extent can the U.S. exclusively benefit from those investments? Since research is international, could not any country benefit from these investments? At what point is the nation's research investment sufficient to reach its goals? In STEM education, is this not a state and local issue? Can the federal government really have any major influence in this policy area? Will STEM education investments take too long to reach fruition relative to other investments? Will federal investments in research and STEM education provide jobs for all Americans as opposed to just scientists and engineers? Others question whether or not the actions in the act are by themselves sufficient to enhance U.S. competitiveness as many other factors beyond STEM research and education contribute to U.S. competitiveness.", "Further, some question the fundamental premise that any action is necessary at all regarding U.S. competitiveness. They question whether or not science and engineering research and STEM education are problems at all. These analysts express doubts as to whether additional scientists and engineers in the United States are needed given current workforce projections, and why if the demand is so high, salaries for those in STEM occupations are not higher. Other analysts indicate that the quality and number of scientists and engineers in China and India are exaggerated.", "Another set of issues focuses on the possible unintended side-effects of implementation. For example, will the act result in an oversupply of scientists and engineers? Can the doubling of funding for some research programs be properly managed? Will the agencies who receive these funds face the same challenges as NIH faces today once the funding declines?", "Assuming that policymakers' concerns about U.S. competitiveness are sufficient for a response, both direct (such as increased funding) and indirect measures (such as tax policy) are proposed by proponents. The act focuses on direct measures while studying possible indirect measures that can be taken. When looking at technology development, those favoring direct government assistance contend that the government's scarce resources should focus on technologies that have the greatest promise, as determined by industry and indicated by industry's willingness to match funds. Those favoring indirect measures contend that the market is superior to government in deciding which technologies are worthy of investment, and worry about potential political interests' influences on an agency's decision to assist one technology in preference to another. Indirect policy mechanism proponents instead support policies that enhance the market's opportunities and abilities to make such choices.

The specific rate of increase in the America COMPETES Act is based on the National Academies Rising Above the Gathering Storm report, which called for the federal government to increase its investment in long-term basic research by 10% annually over the next seven years. The National Academies committee that developed the report concluded that this rate of change was necessary, particularly in the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences, because federal funding in these fields has remained relatively flat for 15 years. According to the National Academies, agencies are less likely to support high-potential high-risk research when funding is stagnant. In addition, this type of research tends to be overlooked when there are inadequate funds to support all proposals that independent external reviewers rate as very good or excellent. Corporations are unlikely to fill this need, according to the National Academies; they fund little basic research, as it typically offers greater benefits to society than its sponsor, and is riskier than shareholders are willing to tolerate.", "The National Academies committee reviewed proposals from a wide variety of organizations before determining that a 10% annual increase over a seven-year period would be most appropriate. In particular, the NSF Authorization Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-368 ) authorized doubling NSF's research budget over five years. The committee took this into account and expanded it to other federal agencies. In sum, \"The committee believes that this rate of growth strikes an appropriate balance between the urgency of the issue being addressed and the ability of the research community to apply new funds efficiently.\"", "The Administration has not indicated why it selected a 7% annual rate, that would provide a doubling-path for these research activities over 10 years, as an appropriate rate of increase for these agencies.

The United States currently ranks first on the international competitiveness rankings available. As stated in the legislation, the goal of the act is to maintain this ranking even as other nations increase their science and technology investments and activities.", "There are evaluation mechanisms within the act as well as longitudinal analysis conducted by international organizations that assess competitiveness by ranking the ability of the United States to compete compared with other countries. These mechanisms use a combination of inputs, outputs, and outcomes to make their assessments.", "In assessing the nation's competitiveness and the evaluation mechanisms discussed in more depth below, it is important to keep the following caveats in mind.", "There are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness: numerous indicators of innovation activity are available. These indicators are quantitative assessments of actions that play a role in the innovation process, but adding these indicators together is not necessarily an accurate assessment of innovation or a nation's competitiveness. Other factors such as necessity or serendipity may also play a critical role. The ability to evaluate the quality of an innovation, its contribution to improved quality of life, and its value to economic growth is limited and can differ depending on a company or individual's perspective. There is no guarantee that inputs, such as increased spending for research and development, will lead to new or enhanced technologies. And, should technologies result or improve, there is no guarantee that they will be \"innovative\" or used in the marketplace or by society. Further, innovation may occur regardless of research and development due to market demand, perceived need, or minor alterations in existing products and processes. The federal government, the industrial sector, and universities all play a major role in funding R&D and innovation. Innovation measures often focus on research and development funding without differentiating between the two. While federal funding of basic research is the primary focus of the America COMPETES Act, the industrial sector also plays a critical development role in technological innovation and advancement in both the public and private sector. University-industry cooperation is also a critical component serving as a liaison between basic research and industry through the education and training of scientists, engineers, and managers. In relating R&D funding to gross domestic product, it is important to keep in mind that while much of U.S. R&D funding is for defense-related research, that is not the case in other countries. Analyzing non-defense R&D may provide a different picture than all of R&D. In examining industry R&D, the nature of the investment may be an important factor such as the degree of funding spent on research versus development, and the degree of funding spent in particular industrial sectors. For example, more industry funding might be spent on electronic equipment research in one country, while another may spend more of its industrial R&D funding on transportation. Although patent data can be an indicator of the state of innovation, not all that results from R&D, such as new ideas, are able to be patented and some companies and individuals choose not to patent in order to prevent disclosure of an idea or plans for an activity, or because of the time needed to obtain a timely patent relative to marketplace needs. The number of scientists and engineers may or may not reflect a nation's innovative capacity as new industries have been developed by individuals with and without college degrees.", "In sum, there are no guarantees that any particular action will result in innovation or enhanced competitiveness. Instead, the focus of government policy is on creating an environment where innovation has an opportunity to flourish with the result that the United States is competitive with the other nations who are also taking steps to increase their innovation environment.
