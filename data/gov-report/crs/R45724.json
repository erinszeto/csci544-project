The original Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress was constituted during the 79 th Congress (1945-1946) for the purpose of strengthening the role of Congress and its committees in the lawmaking process. In 1965, Congress reincarnated this joint committee to suggest additional changes in how the two chambers operate, and the committee was reconstituted during the 102 nd and 103 rd Congresses (1991-1994). While these efforts were bicameral in nature, other examinations of congressional operations, such as that being undertaken by this panel, have been focused primarily on the House.

The select committee, however, is composed of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans (like the House Ethics Committee). 2. Service on the select committee does not count toward the committee membership limitations in House Rule X. 3. Members of the select committee are appointed by the Speaker based in part on recommendations of the minority leader. By comparison, placement on a standing committee generally occurs on the basis of a three-step process: first, recommendations of a party's steering committee are made; second, each party must approve those recommendations; third, committee assignment resolutions ratifying each party's selections are adopted on the House floor.
