It excludes appointments to regulatory boards and commissions and independent and other agencies, which are covered in other CRS reports.", "The appointment process for advice and consent positions consists of three main stages. The first stage is selection, clearance, and nomination by the President. This step includes preliminary vetting, background checks, and ethics checks of potential nominees. At this stage, if the position is located within a state, the President may also consult with Senators who are from his party. The second stage of the process is consideration of the nomination in the Senate, most of which takes place in committee. Finally, if a nomination is approved by the Senate, the President may then present the nominee with a signed commission, making the appointment official.", "During the 111th Congress, the President submitted to the Senate 347 nominations to executive department full-time positions. Of these 347 nominations, 293 were confirmed; 16 were withdrawn; and 38 were returned to him in accordance with Senate rules. For those nominations that were confirmed, an average of 73.2 days elapsed between nomination and confirmation.

Officers of the United States are those individuals serving in high-ranking positions that have been established by Congress and \"exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States\" (emphasis added).

There are a number of steps in this stage of the process for most Senate-confirmed positions. First, with the assistance of, and preliminary vetting by, the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, the President selects a candidate for the position. Members of Congress and interest groups sometimes recommend candidates for specific PAS positions. They may offer their suggestions by letter, for example, or by contact with a White House liaison. In general, the White House is under no obligation to follow such recommendations. In the case of the Senate, however, it has been argued that Senators are constitutionally entitled, by virtue of the advice and consent clause noted above, to provide advice to the President regarding his selection; the extent of this entitlement is a matter of some debate. As a practical matter, in instances where Senators perceive insufficient pre-nomination consultation has occurred, they have sometimes exercised their procedural prerogatives to delay or even effectively block consideration of a nomination.", "During the clearance process, the candidate prepares and submits several forms, including the \"Public Financial Disclosure Report\" (Office of Government Ethics (OGE) 278), the \"Questionnaire for National Security Positions\" (Standard Form (SF) 86), a supplement to SF 86 (\"86 Supplement\"), and sometimes a White House Personal Data Statement. The vetting process often includes a background investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which prepares a report that is delivered to the White House. It also includes a review of financial disclosure materials by OGE and an ethics official for the agency to which the candidate is to be nominated. If conflicts of interest are found during the background investigation, OGE and the agency ethics officer may work with the candidate to mitigate the conflicts. At the completion of the vetting process, the nomination is ready to be submitted to the Senate.", "The selection and clearance stage has often been the longest part of the appointment process. There have been, at times, lengthy delays, particularly when many candidates have been processed simultaneously, such as at the beginning of an Administration, or where conflicts needed to be resolved. Candidates for higher-level positions have often been accorded priority in this process. At the end of 2004, in an effort to reduce the elapsed time between a new President's inauguration and the appointment of his or her national security team, Congress enacted amendments to the Presidential Transition Act of 1963. These amendments encourage a President-elect to submit, for security clearance, potential nominees to high-level national security positions as soon as possible after the election. A separate provision of law, enacted as part of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, lengthens, during presidential transitions, the potential duration of a temporary appointment by 90 days. ", "For a position located within a state (e.g., U.S. attorney, U.S. marshal, and U.S. district judge), the President, by custom, frequently has nominated an individual recommended by one or both Senators from that state (if they are from the same party as the President). In instances where neither Senator is from the President's party, he usually has deferred to the recommendations of party leaders from the state. Occasionally, the President has solicited recommendations from Senators of the opposition party because of their positions in the Senate.", "If circumstances permit and conditions are met, the President could give the nominee a recess appointment to the position (see section entitled \" Recess Appointments \" below). Recess appointments have sometimes had political consequences, however, particularly where Senators perceived that such an appointment was an effort to circumvent their constitutional role. Some Senate-confirmed positions, including many of those in the executive departments, may also be temporarily filled under the Vacancies Act.", "A nominee has no legal authority to assume the duties and responsibilities of the position; a nominee who is hired by the agency as a consultant while awaiting confirmation may serve only in an advisory capacity. Authority to act comes once there is Senate confirmation and presidential appointment, or if another method of appointment, such as a recess appointment or a temporary appointment, is utilized. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Senate Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In the second stage, the Senate alone determines whether or not to confirm a nomination. The way the Senate has acted on a nomination has depended largely on the importance of the position involved, existing political circumstances, and policy implications. Generally, the Senate has shown particular interest in the nominee's views and how they are likely to affect public policy. Two other factors have sometimes affected the examination of a nominee's personal and professional qualities: whether the President's party controlled the Senate, and the degree to which the President became involved in supporting the nomination.", "Much of the Senate confirmation process occurs at the committee level. Administratively, nominations are received by the Senate executive clerk, who arranges for the referral of the nominations to committee, according to the Senate rules and precedents. Committee nomination activity has generally included investigation, hearing, and reporting stages. As part of investigatory work, committees have drawn on information provided by the White House, as well as information they themselves have collected. Some committees have held hearings on nearly all nominations; others have held hearings for only some. Hearings provide a public forum to discuss a nomination and any issues related to the program or agency for which the nominee would be responsible. Even where confirmation has been thought to be a virtual certainty, hearings have provided Senators and the nominee with opportunities to go on the record with particular views or commitments. Senators have used hearings to explore nominees' qualifications, articulate policy perspectives, or raise related oversight issues.", "A committee may decline to act on a nomination at any point\u2014upon referral, after investigation, or after a hearing. If the committee votes to report a nomination to the full Senate, it has three options: it may report the nomination favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation. A failure to obtain a majority on the motion to report means the nomination will not be reported to the Senate. If the committee declines to report a nomination, the Senate may, under certain circumstances, discharge the committee from further consideration of the nomination in order to bring it to the floor.", "The Senate historically has confirmed most, but not all, executive nominations. Rarely, however, has a vote to confirm a nomination failed on the Senate floor. Unsuccessful nominations usually do not make it past the committee stage. Failure of a nomination to make it out of committee has occurred for a variety of reasons, including opposition to the nomination, inadequate amount of time for consideration of the nomination, or factors that may not be directly related to the merits of the nomination.", "Senate rules provide that \"nominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at which they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session without being again made to the Senate by the President\u2026\" In practice, such pending nominations have been returned to the President at the end of the session or Congress. Pending nominations also may be returned automatically to the President at the beginning of a recess of more than 30 days, but the Senate rule providing for this return is often waived."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointment", "paragraphs": ["In the final stage, the confirmed nominee is given a commission bearing the Great Seal of the United States and signed by the President and is sworn into office.

Such recess appointments expire at the end of the next session of the Senate. ", "Presidents have occasionally used the recess appointment power to circumvent the confirmation process. In response, Congress has enacted provisions that restrict the pay of recess appointees under certain circumstances. Because most potential appointees to full-time positions cannot serve without a salary, the President has an incentive to use his recess appointment authority in ways that allow them to be paid. Under the provisions, if the position falls vacant while the Senate is in session and the President fills it by recess appointment, the appointee may not be paid from the Treasury until he or she is confirmed by the Senate. However, the salary prohibition does not apply", "(1) if the vacancy arose within 30 days before the end of the session of the Senate;", "(2) if, at the end of the session, a nomination for the office, other than the nomination of an individual appointed during the preceding recess of the Senate, was pending before the Senate for its advice and consent; or", "(3) if a nomination for the office was rejected by the Senate within 30 days before the end of the session and an individual other than the one whose nomination was rejected thereafter receives a recess appointment.", "A recess appointment falling under any one of these three exceptions must be followed by a nomination to the position not later than 40 days after the beginning of the next session of the Senate. For this reason, when a recess appointment is made, the President generally submits a new nomination for the nominee even when an earlier nomination is pending. ", "Although a recess appointee whose nominations to a full term is subsequently rejected by the Senate may continue to serve until the end of his or her recess appointment, a provision of the FY2008 Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act may prevent him or her from being paid after the rejection. ", "From the 110 th Congress on, Congress has periodically used specific scheduling practices in an attempt to prevent the President from making recess appointments. The evolution of these practices, the President's response to them, and associated controversies are beyond the scope of this report. Detailed information may be found in other CRS reports. Notably, these practices were used only once during the 111 th Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Temporary Appointments", "paragraphs": ["Congress has provided limited statutory authority for the temporary filling of vacant positions requiring Senate confirmation.

", "A temporary appointment made under the FVRA is limited to 210 days from the date of the vacancy, but the time restriction is suspended if a first or second nomination for the position is pending. In addition, during a presidential transition, the 210-day restriction period does not begin to run until either 90 days after the President assumes office, or 90 days after the vacancy occurs, if the vacancy occurs during the 90-day inauguration period.

For most presidentially appointed positions requiring Senate confirmation, the pay levels fall under the Executive Schedule, which, as of the end of the 111 th Congress, ranged from level I ($199,700) for cabinet-level offices to level V ($145,700) for the lowest-ranked positions.

It shows the name of the nominee or recess appointee, position involved, date of nomination or appointment, date of confirmation, and number of days between receipt of a nomination and confirmation. Actions other than confirmation (i.e., nominations returned to or withdrawn by the President) are also noted. Some individuals were nominated more than once for the same position, usually because the first nomination was returned to the President.", "The appointment action tables that list more than one nomination also give statistics on the length of time between nomination and confirmation. Each appointment action table provides the average \"days to confirm\" in two ways: mean and median. Both are presented because although the mean is a more familiar measure, it can be influenced by extreme values (\"outliers\") in the data, while the median does not tend to be influenced by outliers.

Presenting both numbers provides a more accurate portrayal of the central tendency of the data.", "For a small number of positions in this report, the two tables may give slightly different titles to the same position. This is a result of the fact that the titles used in the nomination the White House submits to the Senate, the title of each position as established by statute, and the title of the position used by the department itself are not always identical. The first table in each department profile, the table listing the incumbents at the end of the 111 th Congress, relies upon data provided by the department itself in listing the positions. The second table presented, the list of Appointment Action within each department, relies primarily upon the Senate nominations database of the Legislative Information System (LIS).
