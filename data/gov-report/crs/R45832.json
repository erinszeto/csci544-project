Energy efficiency\u00e2\u0080\u0094providing the same or an improved level of service with less energy\u00e2\u0080\u0094over time can reduce agency expenses, particularly at an agency like DOD, where energy represents roughly 2% of the department's annual budget.", "Since the 1970s, Congress mandated energy requirements for federal agencies. Legislation required reductions in fossil fuel consumption and increases in renewable energy use and efficiency targets for government fleets and buildings. The National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA, P.L. 95-619 ) requires federal agencies to report annually on energy management activities. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct05, P.L. 109-58 ) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140 ) amended and addressed additional energy management targets for the federal government. As the largest energy consumer in the federal government, DOD drives total federal energy management goal achievements. The annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) has included provisions related to DOD energy management and authorities. With one exception, the NDAA for FY2018 ( P.L. 115-91 ), each NDAA since 1993 contains a section on \"authorized energy conservation projects.\" Further, NDAAs have contributed to internal DOD energy management protocol. Throughout several administrations, Presidents have issued executive orders to establish energy management guidelines and targets for the federal government. The Trump Administration's Executive Order 13834, \"Efficient Federal Operations\" (E.O. 13834), directs the heads of agencies to maintain annual energy reductions and efficiency measures that reduce costs and meet statutory requirements for renewables, among other things, but does not set specific targets.", "DOD categorizes energy into two types\u00e2\u0080\u0094 installation energy and operational energy . DOD's installation energy (i.e., energy for fixed installations and non-tactical vehicles) is subject to federal energy management requirements. Although DOD energy use has trended downward since the 1970s, DOD has not met all federally mandated targets and reporting on progress has been challenging. DOD's operational energy (e.g., energy required for sustaining military forces and weapons platforms for military operations) is not subject to federal energy management requirements. This represents around 70% of total DOD energy use. Operational energy consists largely of petroleum products purchased on the open market by the Defense Logistics Agency. This leaves DOD and its spending susceptible to oil price volatility.", "Reviewing how these federal energy management goals impact DOD's mission could be an overarching consideration for Congress. Making operational equipment more fuel efficient could increase range and decrease refueling convoys; however, the challenge is maintaining combat readiness and mission operations. Congress may consider legislation addressing operational energy, such as setting a standard fuel efficiency target or a requirement for alternative fuel use. Congress may also consider continuing to leave operational energy efficiency goals to be determined by DOD or each military branch.", "In many cases, federal energy management goals in statute or executive order established targets for FY2015 (e.g., EISA petroleum and alternative fuel consumption targets were due no later than October 1, 2015). Several agencies, including DOD, did not reach the targeted goals. Congress may assess how and whether setting specific targets enhances the agency's mission and reduces costs for DOD. This approach may include addressing target dates or baselines. Congress may consider removing statutory targets altogether, and direct heads of federal agencies to establish protocols that foster efficiency and cost reductions that serve the mission of the agency.", "Managing an organization as large and complex as DOD presents certain challenges. One of the challenges DOD faces in meeting these targets is implementing appropriate financing mechanisms. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct92, P.L. 102-486 ) amended NECPA and authorized alternative financing methods for federal energy projects, including energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) and utility energy service contracts (UESCs). ESPCs have become a preferred means of making energy efficiency improvements because, in part, funds do not have to be directly appropriated (or programmed). With $2.9 billion awarded in FY2017, these contracts can assist with increasing efficiency and meeting renewable energy management goals. Training and guidance for utilizing ESPCs and UESCs is provided to all federal agencies through the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP).

", "While tracking energy management compliance may come at a cost (e.g., labor, data collecting, etc.), the data can be used to indicate progress toward greater efficiency and could demonstrate whether or not a program has proven effective and provided cost savings. The 2016 DOE Task Force report notes that one of the major challenges in evaluating the energy efficiency of projects in the federal government is the lack of data concerning, \"building profiles, energy usage, and energy spending over time.\" "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Renewable Energy Credit Ownership", "paragraphs": ["Additionally, Congress may consider clarifying REC ownership in legislation, instead of directing DOE to issue guidance on qualifications to meet federal targets. For instance, DOE's implementation guidance for EPAct05 requires DOD and all federal agencies to retain ownership of RECs to count toward the 7.5% renewable electricity consumption goal. However, 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g), a 25% renewable energy production goal for DOD, does not make purchasing RECs mandatory. ", "Further, according to a 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, DOD project documentation of renewable energy goals was not always clear, especially when determining whether or not a project contributed toward a particular goal. If Congress opts to require DOD to maintain ownership of RECs to meet all relevant energy goals, proper data and measurement collection may be a factor to consider. Additionally, if Congress were to require agency ownership of RECs, DOD's progress toward 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g) may decline. For instance, the 2016 GAO report reviewed documentation of 17 DOD renewable energy projects. All 17 projects contributed to 10 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a72911(g), but 8 of those projects did not contribute to EPAct05. ", "In practice, military services may not necessarily retain ownership of RECs associated with all projects. Some DOD services may find that relinquishing REC ownership is within the best interest of the service and the particular contract, despite not qualifying for the EPAct05 requirement. The Navy, for instance, has had difficulty meeting renewable energy consumption targets under EPAct05, noting in the FY2017 AEMRR : \"The Navy's performance regarding the renewable electricity goal is a function of the strategic decision to allow other parties to monetize the value of RECs associated with its financed energy projects.\" In certain projects, military services might decide to relinquish REC ownership. In some instances of ESPC/UESC contracts, RECs can be leveraged to finance additional project improvements. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financing Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["DOD has steadily decreased its buildings' energy intensity in response to mandated energy reduction goals through investment in energy conservation projects. One of the challenges DOD faces in meeting these targets is implementing appropriate financing mechanisms. ESPCs have become a preferred means of making energy efficiency improvements because, in part, funds do not have to be directly appropriated (or programmed). However, as Energy Savings Contractors (ESCOs) assume a certain risk in guaranteeing savings through ESPCs, the risk is factored into their cost. DOD has been increasing reliance on UESCs and ESPCs. With $2.9 billion awarded in FY2017, these contracts can assist with increasing efficiency and meeting renewable energy management goals without up-front appropriated funds for the investment. Congress may consider options to increase the effectiveness of these mechanisms in attaining federal energy management goals. "], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Training", "paragraphs": ["One option may be to increase training and awareness of UESCs and ESPCs. A Senate Committee on Armed Services report ( S.Rept. 115-125 ) accompanying NDAA FY2018 ( S. 1519 ) directed the Secretary of Defense to assess ESPCs and the potential savings through increased training. DOD disagreed with the need for more training, noting in the AEMRR FY2017, \"the financial risk is too high to implement these training improvements based on assumptions about future savings and therefore [DOD] will not commit limited resources to an assessment that would draw from efforts focused on energy resilience and mission assurance.\" Further, DOD has stated that training improvements do not necessarily guarantee behavioral changes that would contribute to energy and costs savings. ", "It is difficult to determine project savings if data is not being collected appropriately and consistently. Eight reports since 2013 by GAO, DOD Inspector General (DOD IG), and U.S. Army Audit Agency evaluated challenges with DOD utilizing ESPCs. The recommendations highlighted a lack of developed guidance for ESPC training, data management, and contract administration. According to a summary DOD IG report in February 2019, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installation, and Environment, as well as Navy, Air Force, and DLA ESPC program managers, did not collect ESPC project data due to decentralization and not requesting performance and savings data, despite DOD instruction. Five reports noted that base contracting officials were not complying with the measurement and verification requirements under Section 432 of EISA for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness of the requirements.", "Training and guidance for utilizing ESPCs and UESCs is provided to all federal agencies through FEMP. However, challenges remain. During a December 2018 House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy hearing, Leslie Nicholls, Strategic Director for FEMP, noted that measurement and verification is \"not necessarily consistently applied and utilized throughout the federal government.\" She further noted that FEMP would like to continue training both at the technical level and for contracting officers. As noted in the February 2019 DOD IG report, DOD branches were implementing the IG recommendations regarding ESPC guidance. Congress may consider the value of training and guidance for proper measurement and data verification, and whether better data would demonstrate accurate cost savings of ESPCs and USECs relative to the cost of training.", "Appendix A.
