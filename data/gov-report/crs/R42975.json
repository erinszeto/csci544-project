The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act) mandates the preparation of audited annual financial statements for certain funds and accounts from a number of executive branch agencies, with 10 agencies selected to provide audited annual financial statements for all agency accounts. The latter provision was expanded to every agency covered under the CFO Act (commonly referred to as CFO agencies) in the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA) and to every executive agency in the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002 (ATDA). In addition, the CFO Act requires the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to furnish an annual financial management status report and a government-wide five-year financial management plan, and GMRA requires the Secretary of the Treasury to provide government-wide annual consolidated financial statements to be audited by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).", "GAO has documented improvements to federal financial reporting since the enactment of the CFO Act. Demonstrable progress has been in evidence across numerous financial management indicators, including timeliness, consistency, and auditability. In FY2012, 21 of 24 CFO agencies received unqualified (clean) audit opinions on their annual financial statements, which means that their statements were free of material misstatements and accord with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Government-wide, the U.S. consolidated financial statements have received a disclaimer of opinion every year since they were first required under GMRA.

Each statutorily mandated report addresses these objectives, albeit with varying degrees of emphasis. ", "Budgetary integrity. A federal financial report may satisfy the budgetary integrity objective if it provides information on \"how budgetary resources have been obtained and used.\" The Statement of Budgetary Resources, which must be included in agencies' annual financial statements, accords with the budgetary integrity objective by providing information on budgetary resources, obligations, and outlays.", "Operating performance. A federal financial report may meet the operating performance objective by providing information on program and activity costs and accomplishments, as well as management of the reporting entity's assets and liabilities. An example is the Statement of Net Cost required in agencies' annual financial statements. The Statement of Net Cost specifically addresses the operating performance objective through its inclusion of information on program costs and the net cost of operations for the entire reporting entity, amongst other cost-related items.", "Stewardship. The stewardship objective concerns the government's financial position, defined as \"a point-in-time snapshot of an entity's economic resources and the claims on those resources,\" and financial condition, which also conveys information about current financial health, as well as future expectations. The Financial Report of the United States Government , the annual report on government-wide financial and performance information required by law, documents whether the government's financial position improved or worsened over the reporting period, indicates whether current budgetary resources are sustainable to meet future obligations, and presents other key indicators of the government's financial position and condition. In so doing, it permits the reader to evaluate whether the government has been an effective steward of the nation's resources.", "Systems and control. The systems and control objective states that federal financial reports should assist readers in determining whether financial management systems, internal accounting, and administrative controls are sufficient to satisfy the three previous objectives of budgetary integrity, operating performance, and stewardship.

In so doing, it links appropriations to accountability. Justice Joseph Story, who served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1811-1845, stated, \"Congress is made the guardian of this treasure; and to make their responsibility complete and perfect, a regular account of the receipts and expenditures is required to be published, that the people may know, what money is expended, for what purposes, and by what authority.\" More recently, one Senator has observed of the appropriations-accountability link, \"This is Congress's most important check on the executive branch in the Constitution's entire scheme of checks and balances. Congress cannot know that the executive branch is obeying the first part of the appropriations clause (spending) of the Constitution without confidence in the second (accountability).\"", "Several measures subsequently established provisions for federal financial reporting that expanded on the constitutional mandate. In 1791, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a resolution on statements of receipts and expenditures. It resolved", "That it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to lay before the House of Representatives, on the fourth Monday of October in each year, if Congress shall then be in session, or if not then in session, within the first week of the session next following the said fourth Monday of October, an accurate statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public moneys, down to the last day inclusively of the month of December immediately preceding the said fourth Monday of October, distinguishing the amount of the receipts in each State or District, and from each officer therein; in which statements shall also be distinguished the expenditures which fall under each head of appropriation, and shall be shown the sums, if any, which remain unexpended, and to be accounted for in the next statement, of each and every of such appropriation.", "Two pieces of legislation enacted during the Progressive Era further expanded on federal financial reporting requirements. The Dockery Act of 1894 required the Secretary of the Treasury to provide Congress with \"an accurate, combined statement of the receipts and expenditures during the last preceding fiscal year of all public moneys.\" Appropriations legislation for FY1908 legislative, executive, and judicial expenses contained a section that required the Secretary of the Treasury to include estimates of current and future public revenue and expenditures in its annual report to Congress.", "Finally, the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950 (BAPA) made significant changes to federal reporting requirements, and arguably was the foundation for present-day financial reporting.

Poor internal controls have also had financial repercussions, according to Deputy Inspector General Blair.

The OIG identified 13 areas of material weakness in DOD's financial reporting for FY2012.

DOD spends billions of dollars each year to maintain key business operations intended to support the warfighter, including systems and processes related to the management of contracts, finances, supply chain, support infrastructure, and weapon systems acquisition.

Failure to obtain an unqualified opinion on its FY2017 financial statements would have resulted in (1) the cessation of authorities on reprogramming and availability of funds authorized under the act, (2) a prohibition of expenditures of funds for major defense acquisition program activities beyond Milestone B, and (3) a reorganization of the CMO position. S. 3487 was referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services and was not enacted by the 112 th Congress.", "Representative Lee introduced companion legislation ( H.R. 6528 ) in the House on September 21, 2012. H.R. 6528 differed from the Senate version in that it did not amend the auditability requirement. It would have imposed a 5% reduction in the discretionary budgetary authority of any agency required to produce an annual auditable financial statement that failed to (1) submit a financial statement for the previous fiscal year or (2) obtain either an unqualified or qualified audit opinion by an independent external auditor. The bill excluded from reduction accounts for military, reserve, and National Guard personnel and the Defense Health Program Account of DOD. In addition, the President would have been permitted to waive the reduction in discretionary budget authority if it jeopardized national security or members of the Armed Forces in combat. H.R. 6528 was not enacted by the 112 th Congress.", "In the 113 th Congress, Representative Lee introduced the Audit the Pentagon Act of 2013 ( H.R. 559 ).

The DART Act directs DHS to obtain an unqualified audit opinion beginning with its FY2013 annual financial statements.
