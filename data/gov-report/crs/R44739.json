", "Commodity certificates can be purchased at the PCP for grains and oilseeds or the effective AWP for rice and upland cotton. Commodity certificates are useful when the relevant PCP or AWP is lower than the market loan rate such that the certificate can be purchased at a discount to the marketing loan rate. A producer purchases the certificate at the PCP or AWP for the volume of crop under marketing assistance loan, then immediately returns the certificate to USDA to pay off the loan. Thus, the producer re-acquires the crop being held as collateral for the loan in exchange for the certificate that he or she has just purchased from USDA.

This refers to the indirect price support provided to producers of sugar beets and sugarcane, and to the direct price guarantees provided to the processors of both crops in the form of a marketing assistance loan at statutorily fixed prices. USDA administers the U.S. sugar program at no budgetary cost to the federal government by limiting the amount of sugar supplied for food use in the U.S. market, thus indirectly supporting market prices. This indirect subsidy is implicit and not subject to budgetary restrictions. Furthermore, there is no citizenship requirement for a sugar processor; however, the sugar cane and sugar beets being processed under the U.S. sugar program price guarantees must be of U.S. origin. Title I (Subtitle D) dairy program . This refers to the margin protection program (MPP) for dairy producers created under the 2014 farm bill (\u00a71401-\u00a71431). Participants may benefit from two potential types of support: an implicit premium subsidy, and an indemnity-like payment made when MPP price triggers are met. The fees or premiums charged for participating in the MPP are set in statute rather than being set annually by an actuary based on historical data and market conditions. Thus, the subsidy is implicit to the premium paid with no limit on the level of participation. Similarly, any payments made under the MPP are not subject to payment limits. Title XI c rop - and livestock-related insurance premium subsidies and indemnity payments . These refer to federal premium subsidies for both catastrophic and buy-up insurance coverage, and to any indemnity payments made under either of these coverage levels. To be eligible to purchase catastrophic risk protection coverage, the producer must be a \"person\" as defined by USDA; and for eligibility to purchase any other plan of insurance, the producer must be at least 18 years of age and have a bona fide insurable interest in a crop as an owner-operator, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper. Premium subsidies are not subject to any limit on the level of participation or underlying value. Similarly, indemnity payments made under crop insurance are not subject to payment limits.

In other words, in a situation where no policy support is available, most producers would make production decisions based primarily on market conditions. If these conditions hold, then tighter payment limits (i.e., a smaller role for government support policies) would imply that more land would be farmed based on market conditions, and less land would be farmed based on policy choices. ", "Supporters of payment limits use both economic and political arguments to justify tighter limits. Economically, they contend that large payments facilitate consolidation of farms into larger units, raise the price of land, and put smaller, family-sized farming operations and beginning farmers at a disadvantage. Even though tighter limits would not redistribute benefits to smaller farms, they say that tighter limits could help indirectly by reducing incentives to expand, thus potentially reducing upward price pressure on land markets. This could help small and beginning farmers buy and rent land. Politically, they believe that large payments undermine public support for farm subsidies and are costly. In the past, newspapers have published stories critical of farm payments and how they are distributed to large farms, non-farmers, or landowners. Limits increasingly appeal to urban lawmakers, and have advocates among smaller farms and social interest groups.", "Critics of payment limits (and thus supporters of higher limits or no limits) counter that all farms are in need of support, especially when market prices decline, and that larger farms should not be penalized for the economies of size and efficiencies they have achieved.

", "Selecting a particular dollar value as a limit on annual government support payments involves a fundamental choice about who should benefit from farm program payments. This has important, but complex, policy implications. For example, numerous academic studies have shown that government payments are usually capitalized into cropland values, thus raising rental rates and land prices. Higher land values disfavor beginning and small farmers who generally have limited access to capital. As a result, critics contend that there is a lack of equity and fairness under the current system of farm program payments that appears to favor large operations over small, and that payment limits are really about farm size.

The 2014 farm bill established a single aggregate limit of $125,000 for combined annual payments under the LDP and MLG benefits of the marketing assistance loan program and the PLC and ARC programs (which replaced the previous CCP and ACRE programs). As a result, in those situations where marketing assistance loan benefits are negligible and an individual relies primarily on either PLC or ARC, then his/her individual limit has been significantly expanded.

Suppose that under the 2014 farm bill that same producer now relies almost exclusively on the PLC program for support (in part since direct payments were eliminated by the 2014 farm bill). In this case, his/her annual payment limit has been nearly doubled from $65,000 for CCP to a new $125,000 limit for PLC payments.

An example of such a per-unit payment limit is the 85% payment reduction factor applied to base acres receiving payments under either the PLC or ARC programs.

For example, while federal income tax data are not available for the $900,000 cap level, published data from 2013, a year of record-high farm income, found that only about 0.7% of all farm sole proprietors and share rent landlords reported AGI in excess of $1 million. Thus, it is likely that consolidating the separate AGI farm and non-farm limits into a single AGI limit with a higher bound has restored eligibility for farm program payments to some farm operations that had previously been disqualified. Other major exemptions from the AGI limit include state and local governments and agencies, federally recognized Indian tribes, and CRP contracts entered into prior to October 1, 2008.", "Furthermore, the 2014 farm bill shifted the farm safety net focus away from traditional revenue support programs and toward crop insurance programs, which are not subject to the AGI cap. During the five-year period of 2011-2015, federal crop insurance premium subsidies averaged $6.8\u00a0billion annually. Extending the AGI cap to crop insurance subsidies was considered during the 2014 farm bill debate, however, concerns were raised that the elimination of subsidies for high-income participants could affect overall participation to the extent that it could damage the soundness of the entire program. In contrast, USDA estimates that in most years, less than 0.5% of farms and less than 1% of premiums would be affected by the $900,000 income cap if it were extended to crop insurance participation as well as to farm programs.
