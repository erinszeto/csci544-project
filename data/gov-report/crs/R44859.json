Peter Mutharika took office in June 2014 after besting Banda in presidential elections that year.", "Malawi's economy is agriculturally centered, undiversified, and import-dependent for many inputs. Its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranks among the lowest in the world. A regional drought in 2015-2016 hit the domestic agricultural economy hard and left an estimated 6.7 million Malawians acutely food insecure as of early 2017. Malawi is heavily reliant on donor aid; in 2014, it ranked as the world's fifth most aid-dependent country or territory with respect to the amount of development assistance received relative to government expenditures. A major corruption scandal emerged during the Banda administration in 2013 and remains an ongoing political concern and an object of continuing policy and judicial action. It prompted many European and multilateral agency donors to withhold direct budget support to Malawi, and such holds continue.

Malawi and Tanzania have been engaged in a long-running dispute over competing sovereign claims to Lake Malawi (also known as Lake Nyasa), in part fueled by the prospect that it may contain deep-water fossil fuel reserves. The dispute reemerged in early 2016, when Malawi lodged a diplomatic protest with Tanzania's government after the latter published an official map showing the international border equally splitting the lake zone between the two countries. This depiction was at odds with Malawi's claim to the entire lake, based in part on mappings and the administrative history of the lake during the colonial period.", "Regional mediation efforts, which had stalled in recent years, are being facilitated by Mozambique's former president, Joaquim Chissano. In February 2017, President Mutharika announced that mediation efforts would resume. Meanwhile, Malawi's government has allowed exploration for oil and gas in the lake to continue, drawing criticism from environmentalists and UNESCO. Some analysts contend that economic plans for the lake, which also include a shipbuilding plant, may remain stymied by uncertainty linked to the ongoing border dispute. In May 2017, the Malawian government announced that it would lodge a legal case over the dispute with the International Court of Justice in the Hague.", "Refugee Influx. Between late 2015 and April 2016, roughly 10,000 Mozambicans crossed into southern Malawi as refugees fleeing renewed fighting between the Mozambican government and an armed opposition party known as RENAMO.

That presidential election and the accompanying legislative races were the first multi-party elections held after a democratic transition spurred by social unrest and broad opposition to Kamuzu Banda's arguably authoritarian, patriarchal, and personalistic one-party rule. During Muluzi's two terms, political pluralism grew and market-based economic reforms took hold, as did allegations of corruption. Muluzi faced term limits and was succeeded in 2004 by Bingu wa Mutharika, whose first term was economically successful, but marred by increasing signs of a semi-authoritarian leadership style, which became more pronounced in his second term. He tried to expel Joyce Banda from her position as vice president, but she resisted and left Wa Mutharika's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to form her own People's Party (PP). The government harshly repressed mass protests in 2011, resulting in 20 deaths and about 500 arrests. ", "These developments prompted various international donors to withhold aid. In January 2011, the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) paused implementation of its five-year, $350 million Compact in Malawi.

Banda, Africa's second female president (after Liberia's Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf), also won plaudits as an international advocate for women's rights; her tenure was seen as a sign of increasing gender equality in a region where male leaders have predominated. Her socioeconomic development and business experience also earned her a reputation as a leader with a personal commitment and the expertise necessary to advance equitable national growth and development, and as a model for other African leaders in this regard. Banda's administration drew high-level U.S. bilateral engagement, including meetings with President Obama and with Members of Congress. The MCC also reinstated its Compact after Banda took office.", "After a brief political honeymoon, Banda faced criticism over various issues. Perhaps most important were her decisions to devalue the local currency, liberalize fuel prices, and pursue other internationally backed, market-based reforms. These resulted in economic hardship and multiple labor strikes; inflation rose and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, already among the world's lowest, dropped from $347 (2011) to $223 (2013). Her administration's arrest of Peter Mutharika and several of his associates on treason charges in relation to their alleged attempts to engineer Mutharika's extra-constitutional succession of his late brother prompted protests. In 2013, Banda drew criticism over a state embezzlement scandal known as \"Cashgate\" (see below) and over the sale of a presidential jet, the proceeds of which were largely used to repay debts to an arms dealer and not to purchase food aid, as initially announced.

These factors, along with poor physical and communications infrastructure (despite expanding cell phone access), contribute to high transport and import costs and inhibit economic growth and trade. Such structural challenges are the focus of state economic development and reform efforts. Key government policy objectives include private sector growth, trade liberalization and pricing control reductions, reduction of administrative overhead costs, civil service reforms, and the streamlining of investment licensing procedures. Several state firms have been or are being privatized. The government is also seeking to develop the mining sector. Malawi's first uranium mine, completed in 2009, has helped to diversify export earnings moderately. ", "Agriculture employs a large percentage of the labor force and is a key source of export earnings, but is subject to world market price shocks and weather-related risks, especially in the often arid far south. Most Malawians are smallholder farmers who produce food for direct subsistence needs and cash crops, notably tobacco, which is by far the top export. Many are also laborers on tea and sugar plantations. Malawi has a small manufacturing base focused on agricultural processing and limited consumer goods production, but Malawi's formal sector and skilled workforce are small.

When a corruption affair known as \"Cashgate\" came to light in 2013, most members of the European and multilateral agency Common Approach to Budget Support (CABS) group of donors, which had previously provided joint direct budget support to Malawi, instituted a hold on such aid. That hold remains in place. Most members of CABS, along with the United States, currently provide project-based or otherwise targeted development aid, rather than direct budget support, notably for social services, humanitarian needs, and infrastructure and public institutional development.", "Despite Cashgate investigations and prosecutions under the Banda and Mutharika governments and reported efforts by both administrations to prevent a recurrence of such an affair, donors remain concerned over government budget execution capacity and the potential for corruption. In January 2017, such concerns were substantiated with the emergence of allegations that the Malawian government had purchased maize from neighboring Zambia at an inflated price through opaque middlemen.
