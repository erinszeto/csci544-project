Some add the death penalty as a sentencing option in the case of pre-existing federal crimes such those outlawing attacks on mass transit. Some make procedural alterations such as those governing federal habeas corpus provisions for state death row petitioners. Other proposals offered during the 109 th Congress would have followed the same pattern: some new crimes; some new penalties for old crimes; and some procedural adjustments. Other than the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, P.L. 109-248 , 120 Stat. 587 (2006), which makes a federal capital offense commit a murder in the course of any of several federal sex offenses, none of the other proposals were enacted. Several, however, passed in one House or the other. Among these, H.R. 1279 would have amended the venue provision for capital cases and would have made it a federal capital offense to use the facilities of interstate commerce to commit multiple murders and another to commit murder during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense. As would have H.R. 4472 . H.R. 1751 ; and H.R. 4472 would have made it a federal capital offense to murder a federally funded public safety officer.

In 1974, Congress established a revised procedure for imposition of the death penalty in certain air piracy cases. In 1994, when Congress made the procedural adjustments necessary to revive the death penalty as a sentencing option for other federal capital offenses, it replaced the air piracy procedures with those of the new regime. At least one court, however, held that the new procedures could not be applied retroactively to air piracy cases occurring after the 1974 fix but before the 1994 legislation, in the absence of an explicit statutory provision.", "The Reauthorization Act adds an explicit provision to the end of the 1994 legislation. The amendment provides for the application of the existing federal capital punishment procedures, 18 U.S.C. ch.228, after consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors in place in capital air piracy cases prior to the 1994 revival. It also provides for severance should any of the pre-1994 factors be found constitutionally invalid, and includes a limiting definition of the \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\" aggravating factor in section 46503 to avoid the vagueness problems that might otherwise attend the use of such an aggravating factor.", "The conference report on the Reauthorization Act notes that the changes apply to a relative small group of individuals responsible for murders committed during the course of hijackings in the mid 1980s who would otherwise be eligible for parole within 10 years of sentencing and could not be effectively sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.", "H.R. 1763 and H.R. 3060 contained comparable provisions, but lacked the severability clause found in the Reauthorization Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Habeas Corpus in State Capital Cases", "paragraphs": ["Federal law provides expedited habeas corpus procedures for state death row inmates in those states that qualify for application of the procedures and have opted to take advantage of them. Subject to a one time 30 day extension, district courts with whom habeas petitions are filed by a prisoner challenging his state capital conviction or sentence must make a final determination within the sooner of 60 days after the case is submitted for decision or 450 days after the application is filed. In such cases, the court of appeals has 120 days after the final briefs have been submitted to render a decision; the court has 30 days to consider a petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc and another 30 days to render an en banc decision should it grant rehearing. No such judicial deadlines apply in other federal habeas cases.", "Before enactment of the Reauthorization Act, these expedited procedures found in chapter 154 applied in capital cases only if the state met certain conditions. \"A state must [have] establish[ed] 'a mechanism for the appointment, compensation, and payment of reasonable litigation expenses of competent counsel' in state postconviction proceedings, and 'must [have] provide[d] standards of competency for the appointment of such counsel.'\" As of enactment of the Reauthorization Act apparently, few if any states had sought and been found qualified to opt in.", "Critics implied that the states have been unable to take advantage of the expedited capital procedures only because the courts have a personal stake in the outcome. The solution, they contended, was the amendment found in section 507 of the Reauthorization Act, which allows the Attorney General to determine whether a state qualifies, permits the determination to have retroactive effect, and allows review by the federal appellate court least likely to have an interest in the outcome, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Opponents raised separation of powers issues and questioned whether the chief federal prosecutor or the courts are more likely to make an even handed determination of whether the procedures for providing capital defendants with qualified defense counsel are adequate.", "Under the Reauthorization Act, states opt-in or have opted-in as of the date, past or present, upon which the Attorney General determines they established or have established qualifying assistance of counsel mechanism. Opting-in to the expedited procedures of chapter 154 only applies, however, to instances in which \"counsel was appointed pursuant to that mechanism [for the death row habeas petitioner], petitioner validly waived counsel, petitioner retained counsel, or petitioner was found not to be indigent.\" The earlier provision required that the mechanism include competency standards for appointed counsel. The Reauthorization Act removed the requirement, but granted the Attorney General regulatory authority sufficient to establish such standards.", "The Act establishes a de novo standard of review for the Attorney General's determination before the D.C. Circuit. It also extends the expedited time deadline for U.S. district court action on a habeas petition from a state death row inmate from 6 to 15 months (180 days to the sooner of 450 days after filing or 60 days after the completion of all pleadings, hearings, and submission of briefs). The Streamlined Procedures Acts in the House and Senate, H.R. 3035 and S. 1088 , would have made similar changes in the opt in procedure, but set a different standard for appellate review of the Attorney General's decision, and would have included a wide range of habeas amendments unknown to the Reauthorization Act.", "In McFarland v. Scott , 512 U.S. 849, 859 (1994), the Supreme Court held that federal district courts might stay the execution of a state death row inmate upon the filing of a petition for the appointment of counsel but prior to the filing of a federal habeas petition in order to allow for the assistance of counsel in the filing the petition. In an amendment described as overruling McFarland , the Reauthorization Act amends federal law to permit a stay in such cases of no longer than 90 days after the appointment of counsel or the withdrawal or denial of a request for the appointment of counsel.", "S. 956 , H.R. 2388 , and H.R. 3132 contained a common amendment governing federal habeas cases of an individual convicted under state law of killing a child, proposed 28 U.S.C. 2254. Habeas under section 2254 would have been unavailable in such cases except for claims that both (1) relied on a new constitutional interpretation made retroactively applicable by the Supreme Court or on evidence that the petitioner could not reasonable have been previously discovered and (2) were predicated upon facts in the face of which no reasonable judge or jury would have found the petitioner guilty but for the constitutional error, proposed 28 U.S.C. 2254(j)(1), (2).", "Under the bills, judicial consideration of claims that met the dual criterion would have been subject to deadlines under which evidentiary hearings had to be (1) requested within 90 days of the state's answer to the petition and granted or denied within 30 days, (2) held within 60 days and completed within 150 days, and (3) decided within 15 months of the state's answer; the state\u00c2\u00a0could enforce deadlines through a mandamus petition to the court of appeals, proposed 28\u00c2\u00a0U.S.C. 2254(j)(3). Appellate courts would have had 120 days to pass upon an appeal, 30 days to consider whether to grant a hearing en banc, and 120 days to decide a case en banc, proposed 28 U.S.C. 2254(j)(4).", "The rights of victims under 18 U.S.C. 3771(b) to be notified, attend, and participate in relevant criminal proceedings would have been expanded to include habeas proceedings under an amendment found in each of the bills, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3771(b).", "Proponents pointed to examples of delays of up to 20 years between conviction and the completion of habeas proceedings to explain the amendment; they contended that the Supreme Court has upheld past restrictions on protracted federal habeas proceedings conducted on behalf of state prisoners; and they argued the appropriateness of confining relief to those who can establish their innocence.", "Critics claimed the amendment was unnecessary and that great care should be taken before closing the doors of the federal courts to claims that a state criminal court has convicted an accused and imposed the death penalty in an unconstitutional manner. Some observers might have suggest that the participation of victims in the habeas process is more likely to prolong it than to streamline it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Capital Procedures in Drug Cases", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the Reauthorization Act, federal law provided two sets of death penalty procedures for capital drug cases, the procedures applicable in federal capital cases generally and the procedures specifically applicable in federal capital drug cases.

S. 155 , H.R. 970 , H.R. 1279 , and H.R. 4472 would each have rewritten 18 U.S.C. 3235. Section 3235 provides that where possible capital cases should be tried in the county in which the crime occurred. Section 3235 is followed by a section that states that murder and manslaughter cases should be tried where the death-causing injury was inflicted regardless of where death actually occurs, 18 U.S.C. 3236. Section 3236 is followed in turn by a section that provides that multi-district crimes may be tried where they are begun, continued, or completed and that offenses involving the use of the mails, transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, or importation into the United States may be tried in any district from, through, or into which commerce, mail, or imports travel.", "At least one federal appellate court has held that the specific instruction of section 3236 overrides the general instructions of section 3237(a) only with regard to \"unitary\" murder offenses, such as murder by a federal prisoner. Section 3236 does not apply, the court held, to \"death resulting\" cases, cases where murder is a sentencing element rather than a substantive element of the offense, such as in cases of a violation of 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(use of a firearm during and relating to the commission of crime of violence), the sentence for which is determined in part by whether death resulted from the commission of the offense.", "The proposal would have repealed the \"county trial\" language of section 3235 and would have replaced it with language reminiscent of the multi-district terms of section 3237(a): \"(a) the trial of any offense punishable by death shall be held in the district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began, continued, or was completed. (b) If the offense, or related conduct, under subsection (a) involves activities which affect interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into the United States, such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred,\" proposed 18 U.S.C. 3235.", "Although it is far from certain, the proposal appeared intent upon repealing both the \"county trial\" feature of section 3235 and, by indirection, the section 3236 override of multi-district section 3237 in murder cases. The manslaughter features of 3236 would presumably have continued in place since they are not capital cases and thus by definition are beyond the reach of the proposed capital venue provisions of the amended section 3235.", "The proposal would have operated in the shadow of two constitutional provisions and of two Supreme Court cases which construe them. Article III declares that \"[t]he trial of all crimes . . . shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed.\" The Sixth Amendment directs that, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\"", "The Supreme Court in United States v. Cabrales held that in light of these provisions the crime of money laundering committed in Florida could not be tried in Missouri where the laundered funds had been criminally generated\u00e2\u0080\u0094absent other circumstances. Shortly thereafter, the Court held in United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno , that the crime of using a firearm during and in relation to the crime of kidnaping could be tried in New Jersey into which the victim had been carried, notwithstanding the fact that the firearm was acquired and used in Maryland after the victim had been moved there from New Jersey. The Court reasoned (1) that a crime may be tried wherever one of its conduct elements occurs; (2) that the kidnaping constituted a conduct element of the offense of using a firearm during and in relation to the crime of kidnaping; (3) that the kidnaping was a form of continuous conduct beginning where the victim was seized (in Texas) and continuing (to New Jersey and then into Maryland) until he was released or escaped; (4) that the kidnaping could be tried in New Jersey; and (5) consequently the firearm use charge could be tried in New Jersey.", "It is not clear how the proposal would have fared in light of Cabrales and Rodriguez-Moreno . It says \"(a) the trial for any offense punishable by death shall be held in the district where the offense was committed or in any district in which the offense began, continued, or was completed. (b) if the offense, or related conduct, under subsection (a) involves activities which affect interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an object or person into the United States, such offense may be prosecuted in any district in which those activities occurred,\" proposed 18 U.S.C. 3235. It would appear to permit trial of an offense in a district in which related conduct affecting interstate or foreign commerce occurs even if the offense itself is committed entirely in another district. The Cabrales ' money generating drug trafficking in Missouri would seem to qualify as conduct related to the laundering in Florida for purposes of the proposal, and yet in Cabrales that was not enough. Nor would the proposal always appear to meet Rodriguez-Moreno 's \"conduct element\" standard. There is nothing in the proposal that requires that the \"related conduct affecting interstate commerce\" be an element of the offense to be tried. In fact, the alternative wording\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"if the offense, or related conduct . . . involves activities which affect interstate commerce\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094seems to contemplate situations in which affecting commerce is not an element, conduct or otherwise, of the offense."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mitigating and Aggravating Factors", "paragraphs": ["The death penalty may be imposed in a federal capital case only after consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in 18 U.S.C. 3592 and only if at least one aggravating factor is found.

The omission, although perhaps surprising to some, appeared inconsequential since execution of the mentally retarded is constitutionally proscribed. The bill also would have required notice to the government and would have permitted the government to request an independent mental health examination when a defendant intended to enter mental retardation as a mitigating factor for capital sentencing purposes, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3593(b). The existing statute mentions no such requirements. Presumably recourse to the proposed procedure would have been more infrequent in those cases where the district court conducted a pre-trial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the mental retardation of the accused precluded imposition of the death penalty following any conviction.", "Present law permits a capital jury to unanimously recommend a sentence of death or of imprisonment without possibility of release; if they do not, the court is to sentence the defendant to any lesser sentence authorized by law, i.e., imprisonment for life or a term of years.

The federal appellate courts are divided on the question over whether section 3005 now entitles a defendant to the assistance of two attorneys in all capital cases or only in those in which the government actively seeks the death penalty. The proposal would have explicitly authorized the government to strike for cause potential jurors in capital cases whose opposition to the death penalty \"would prevent or substantially impair the performance\" of their duties as jurors, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3005(b).

Section 3592(b) lists three aggravating factors for treason and espionage cases, i.e., (1) the offender has a prior espionage or treason conviction, (2) the offense involved a grave risk to national security, and (3) the offense involved a grave risk of death.", "Violation of section 2339D is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 10 years, 18 U.S.C. 2339D(a). H.R. 3060 would have made no change in section 2339D, but it would have amended section 3591(a)(1) of the capital procedures provisions to say that violations of sections 2381 (treason), 794 (espionage), or 2339D (terrorist training) might be punished by death if execution were found justified after considering the mitigating and aggravating factors listed in section 3592, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3591(a)(1). It also would have amended the list of 3592(c) aggravating factors to add a fourth factor, i.e., the defense involved substantial planning by the defendant, proposed 18 U.S.C. 3592(c)(4). Assuming the conforming amendment to section 2339D\u00e2\u0080\u0094making it a capital offense\u00e2\u0080\u0094was an oversight and in spite of the proposal's caption (\"addition of terrorism to death penalty offenses not resulting in death\"), it is not clear that the courts would permit imposition of the death penalty for a violation of section 2339D unless the offense also involved a first degree murder. The Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual punishment clause precludes imposing the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman by an individual already under a sentence of life imprisonment at the time of the rape; it precludes imposition of the death penalty even in the case of murder unless the defendant at least acted intentionally or acted\u00c2\u00a0with reckless indifference to human life while participating in a felony involving a murder; and since the Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia , it has never been called upon to approve, and consequently has never approved, imposition of the death penalty for a crime that did not involve murder."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Moratorium", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 4923 / S. 122 would have repealed federal death penalty provisions and would have barred imposition or execution of any capital sentence for violation of federal law.
