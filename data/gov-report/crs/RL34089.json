The Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act (S. 1082) on May 9, 2007. The House passed the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (H.R. 2900) on July 11, 2007.", "At its core, the legislation renews authority for two key user fee programs that are set to expire on October 1, 2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250). These account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue, and 19% of FDA's total FY2008 program level budget. Without the reauthorizations, and absent a substantial increase in FDA's annual appropriations, the agency would lose a significant source of funding. FDA had warned that a failure to reauthorize the user fee programs before August 1, 2007, would require the agency to issue layoff notices, but the agency has reportedly forestalled that necessity by switching to reserve funds.", "In addition to user fee programs, the bills reauthorize two other FDA authorities related to prescription drugs for pediatric populations, which are also due to expire on October 1, 2007: the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA; P.L. 107-109) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA; P.L. 108-155). These laws provide marketing exclusivity incentives and requirements for studying pediatric use of on-patent and off-patent drugs. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 also contain provisions related to drug safety, pediatric medical devices, clinical trial registration, and the creation of a new nonprofit entity to assist FDA with its mission. The bills' overlapping provisions are similar, but not identical.", "S. 1082 contains some additional provisions that are not present in H.R. 2900, on the topics of food safety, prescription drug importation, and domestic pet turtle market access. Attempts to expand the legislation to address several other FDA-related issues, for example, follow-on biologics and genetic testing, have thus far been unsuccessful. Differences between the bills may be addressed in conference.", "This report contains background information about the FDA relevant to S. 1082 and H.R. 2900.

The bills are the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act ( S. 1082 ), and the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 ( H.R. 2900 ). S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 represent the most comprehensive FDA legislation since the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA; P.L. 105-115 ).", "The primary driver of the legislation is the renewal of FDA's authority for two key user fee programs set to expire at the end of FY2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188 ), and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250 ). FDA had reportedly urged Congress to complete its reauthorization efforts before August 1, 2007 (rather than by the program's termination date of October 1, 2007), because of a requirement that FDA notify employees at least 60 days in advance of layoffs, which would be necessary without PDUFA and MDUFMA funds. The media report that FDA has switched to reserve funds to forestall the issuance of layoff notifications, the effect of which is a hiring freeze at FDA. In addition, the FDA Commissioner has reportedly stressed that the funding uncertainty is harming the morale of employees: 30% of whom are at a point where they can retire.", "The bills also would reauthorize two other expiring authorities, which are related to pediatric pharmaceuticals: the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA; P.L. 105-115 ; reauthorized in P.L. 107-109 ), and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA; P.L. 108-155 ). In addition, the bills address a number of other issues of concern to Congress and to the public.", "The FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), regulates the safety of most human foods, all animal feeds, and certain other products such as cosmetics. The agency also regulates the safety and effectiveness of human drugs, biologics (e.g., vaccines), medical devices, and animal drugs. Those products regulated for effectiveness must be reviewed and approved by FDA before they can be placed in commerce, a process called premarket approval . (FDA is tasked with postmarket surveillance for these products as well.) Products regulated only for safety may enter commerce with little FDA oversight, though the agency may inspect production facilities and require that certain good manufacturing practices be carried out. FDA has the statutory authority to withdraw from commerce any product it regulates that it determines to be unsafe.", "Media coverage of issues related to the safety of food (e.g., spinach), drugs (e.g., Vioxx), and medical devices (e.g., cardiac stents) have brought congressional attention to FDA's performance and the funding it has available to carry out its statutory responsibilities. For those products requiring premarket approval, a central issue for the 110 th Congress is how best to balance the need for the agency to help speed the products it regulates to market if they are safe and effective, and correct them or keep or remove them from the market if they are not. For human foods, animal feeds, and other products not requiring premarket approval, key issues relate to FDA's ability to assure product safety and protect public health by preventing health threats from occurring, or by identifying and responding to problems quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drug and Device User Fees", "paragraphs": ["In order to bring revenue into FDA to help speed products to market, Congress has passed several measures authorizing FDA to collect user fees from the products' manufacturers. Some have questioned whether the agency's reliance on fees it collects from the companies that it regulates is appropriate, calling instead for greatly increased appropriations for the agency. Nevertheless, efforts to reauthorize the two expiring user fee authorities (PDUFA and MDUFMA) are already underway.", "Income from PDUFA and MDUFMA represents, by far, the largest proportion of FDA's user fee revenue, and a significant proportion of the agency's overall budget. According to FDA's FY2008 budget request, PDUFA will generate $339,195,000, and MDUFMA will generate $47,500,000. Combined, these fees would account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue, and 19% of its total program level budget in FY2008.", "PDUFA was first enacted in 1992 ( P.L. 102-571 ), and has been reauthorized twice; once by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA, P.L. 105-115 ), and a second time by the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-188 ). PDUFA authorizes the FDA to collect fees from companies that produce certain human drugs and biological products, and to use the revenue for the review of new product applications. PDUFA also incorporates, by reference, performance goals aimed primarily at reducing FDA premarket review times.", "MDUFMA, first enacted in 2002, established user fees for FDA's review of medical device applications. Like PDUFA, MDUFMA incorporated, by reference, performance goals for many types of premarket device reviews. MDUFMA also allowed third-parties to conduct establishment inspections, and added new regulatory requirements for reprocessed single-use devices.

In 1997, Congress gave FDA a tool, in BPCA, to encourage pediatric drug research\u2014extended marketing exclusivity in exchange for trials investigating a drug's effect on pediatric populations. Meanwhile, FDA's attempts to require, as part of new drug applications, assessments of how new drugs would affect pediatric populations were stopped by the courts until Congress, in 2003, codified that requirement in PREA.

This is because fewer children need medical devices than adults, and because children have physical attributes (e.g., size, biochemistry, growth rates), activities, and environmental influences that vary from those of adults. The result has been characterized as a critical need for pediatric medical devices that help diagnose and treat diseases and conditions affecting children.

In some instances, only a small proportion of people who will take the drug are susceptible to a specific effect, requiring a large swath of the population to use a drug before the adverse effect is seen. S. 1082 and H.R. 2900 include provisions focused on buttressing FDA's system for collecting data on marketed products, sifting through the massive amounts of information to identify situations that merit FDA action, and providing new authorities to allow FDA to require manufacturers to take some actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Clinical Trials Databases", "paragraphs": ["Medical journals tend only to publish the results of clinical trials demonstrating a product's effectiveness, as negative studies do not draw readers in the same way.

However, others note that the most expert members in the field are often those involved directly or indirectly in the activities about which FDA is seeking advice, creating the potential for such conflicts. In 2006 and 2007, the media has reported that FDA advisory committees are biased in favor of drug approval, and that many committee members have conflicts of interest.

First enacted in 1992, PDUFA gives FDA a revenue source\u2014fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2014to supplement direct appropriations. At the time, FDA, consumers, and manufacturers all sought to shorten the time between a manufacturer's submission of an application and the agency's decision on whether to approve the product. Therefore, PDUFA restricted the use of collected funds to new product review, and established a mechanism for agency-industry collaboration to create performance goals that set targets primarily for review times.", "As a result of PDUFA, application review times decreased, and the addition of fee revenue raised the level of the premarket review activities relative to that for postmarket activities. Congress, therefore, in reauthorizing PDUFA in 1997 (PDUFA II) and 2002 (PDUFA III), gave FDA limited authority to use some of the fees for postmarket drug safety activities.

In 1962, the Harris-Kefauver Amendments to the FFDCA added product effectiveness to the premarket requirements. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 maintained the focus on premarket review. However, as previously noted, until a very large number of individuals have taken a drug, a rare adverse effect may not occur or a very common condition may not be recognized as drug-associated. FDA, therefore, cannot assert that any drug is completely safe. Instead, it considers whether, given the available information, the drug is safe enough when used correctly by the types of individuals and for the diseases or conditions for which it was tested. FDA and others must remain alert to new information as those drugs are used more widely. In recent years, researchers revealed that a few widely used (and advertised) drugs were more dangerous than known or expected. Some felt that the public health and regulatory problems were compounded by questions about: (1) industry's reticence in sharing its knowledge of possible risks; and (2) FDA's authority, ability (resources), and willingness to identify and correct postmarket safety concerns. As a result, FDA asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to examine its handling of drug safety. IOM responded with a 2006 report that addressed the agency's organizational culture, science and expertise, regulation, communication, and resources. At the same time, many consumers, health experts, and Members of Congress looked for ways to enhance FDA's actions to protect the public.", "S. 1082 (Title II, Drug Safety) and H.R. 2900 (Title IX, Enhanced Authorities Regarding Postmarket Safety of Drugs) reflect those concerns.
