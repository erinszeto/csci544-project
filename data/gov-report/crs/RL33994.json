That said, some underlying tensions, such as with the security sector, remain to be resolved. Timor-Leste faces many serious challenges as it seeks to establish a stable democracy and develop its economy. Prior to 2006 the international community's main concern focused on possible tensions in East Timor's relations with Indonesia. Since 2006 the main threat to East Timor has been internal strife resulting from weak, or collapsed, state institutions, rivalries among elites and between security forces, a poor economy, unemployment, east-west tensions within the country and population displacement. The reintroduction of peacekeeping troops and a United Nations mission, the flow of revenue from hydrocarbon resources in the Timor Sea, and improved political stability are helping East Timor move towards more effective and democratic government. East Timor has significant energy resources beneath the Timor Sea. A key issue is how this wealth will be conserved and spent in the years ahead.", "With the assistance of a transitional United Nations administration, East Timor emerged in 2002 as an independent state after a long history of Portuguese colonialism and, more recently, Indonesian rule. This followed a U.N.-organized 1999 referendum in which the East Timorese overwhelmingly voted for independence and after which Indonesian-backed pro-integrationist militias went on a rampage, destroying much of East Timor's infrastructure and killing an estimated 1,300. Under several different mandates, the United Nations has provided peacekeeping, humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, and capacity building to establish a functioning government. On February 26, 2009, the U.N. Security council extended the mandate of U.N. Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) for another year.", "Many challenges remain, including the need for economic development and sustained support by the international community.

(See \" Chronology \" below.) The Australian military contingent was the largest with some 1,100 troops in country. The peacekeepers were deployed at the invitation of the East Timorese government. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1704 of August 25, 2006, established the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT) had a civilian component as well as up to 1,608 police personnel and up to 34 military liaison and staff officers. UNMIT's mission included supporting the East Timorese government in \"consolidating stability, enhancing a culture of democratic governance, and facilitating political dialogue among Timorese stakeholders in their efforts to bring about a process of national reconciliation.\"", "The source of the strife of 2006 can be traced to divisions within the dominant Fretilin party dating to their period of struggle against the Indonesians. Some Fretilin elites went into exile while others, including Xanana Gusmao, stayed behind to fight in the military wing of Fretilin, Falintil, which he commanded. One way these divisions manifest themselves is in splits within and between the military and police forces. The allegiance of most of the military to Gusmao appears to have played a role in the creation of paramilitary units within the police. Divisions between the military and the police can be traced to the recruitment process. Many recruited into the military \"were Xanana loyalists\" while a U.N. decision led to over 300 individuals who had earlier served in the Indonesian police force in East Timor to be hired into the new police of East Timor. In the words of the International Crisis Group report, \"personal and institutional tensions between a president committed to pluralism and a ruling party (Fretilin) with distinctly authoritarian tendencies, politicisation of the police, lack of any regulatory framework for the security forces more generally and the in-bred nature of a tiny political elite with 30 years shared history allowed matters to get out of control.\"", "The event that triggered the strife and political turmoil of 2006 can be traced to former Prime Minister Alkatiri's dismissal of 591 members of the 1,500-man military in March 2006. Those dismissed had protested their conditions and pay and claimed discrimination against members of the force from western districts of East Timor. Most of the upper echelons of the military were drawn from the eastern districts, or Loro Sa'e, while much of the political leadership and the police are from the western districts, or Loro Munu. In July 2006, it was reported that the police had broken into factions, with some taking their weapons to join rebels in the hills. The March 2006 dismissal of the protesting troops led to rioting, looting, a number of deaths, and the fleeing of tens of thousands of mostly eastern East Timorese from the capital, Dili, beginning in April 2006. Alkatiri stepped down in June as a result.", "Former Prime Minister Alkatiri was accused by his opponents of forming \"hit squads,\" which he denied. A U.N. investigation found him to have failed \"to use his firm authority to denounce the transfer of security sector weapons to civilians.\" Former Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for authorizing the transfer of weapons to pro-Fretilin supporters and a Fretilin-linked hit squad. Lobato reportedly had a \"frosty\" relationship with Gusmao and had bought large quantities of arms for the police and had established two paramilitary police units.", "One of the leaders of the violent protests of March 2006, which resulted in the mutiny of soldiers from western districts, was Major Alfredo Reinado. Reinado's support base was drawn from the west. Reinado and 50 of his supporters escaped from prison in August 2006. Australian forces failed to capture Reinado on March 11, 2007. The operation was ordered by the East Timor government. The decision to apprehend Reinado was apparently taken after he persuaded a border patrol unit to hand over their assault rifles on February 25, 2007. The government had previously been in negotiations with Reinado for killing a soldier while fighting against East Timorese army units. Although Reinado had not been a major political figure in East Timor, he had attracted much support among young men who were increasingly resentful of the foreign military presence in East Timor. Reinado was resentful of Fretilin for ordering the dismissal of protesting troops.", "Another dimension of the escalating violence in East Timor is the gangs of largely unemployed youth. Unemployment and underemployment is estimated to be as high as 70% in East Timor. With the collapse of law and order in the wake of the May 2006 police and military clashes, gang violence swept through Dili, leading to further deaths, the displacement of more Dili residents from the capital, and the widespread destruction of property.

A total of nearly $40 million was reportedly contributed in 2006. In February and March 2007, security incidents again increased, leading to restrictions on the movement of humanitarian personnel. Humanitarian access became an issue; in addition, there were concerns about the protection and security of those displaced and for non-governmental organizations and U.N. operations providing assistance.
