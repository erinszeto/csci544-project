{"id": "R43994", "title": "Sick Leave for Federal Employees: In Brief", "released_date": "2015-04-20T00:00:00", "summary": ["This brief provides an overview of sick leave for federal employees, including leave options for employees when sick leave has been exhausted. Full-time federal employees can earn up to 104 hours (13 days) of sick leave per year and are entitled to use such leave for four primary reasons: (1) personal medical needs, (2) care of a family member, (3) death of a family member, and (4) adoption of a child.", "A federal employee might experience a situation in which he or she does not have enough accrued sick leave to cover a prolonged absence from work for personal or family medical reasons. In these instances, a federal employee can often use alternative leave options to cover the absence. Alternative paid leave options include advanced sick leave, using annual leave for sick leave purposes, and voluntary leave donation programs. Alternative unpaid leave options include leave without pay and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-3).", "In recent years, both the Administration and Congress have attempted to expand the availability and use of paid leave for family care and related activities. On January 15, 2015, President Obama signed a presidential memorandum that appears to encourage expanded use of existing paid leave for parental activities. Namely, the memorandum directed agencies to ensure that their policies offer the maximum amount of advanced annual and sick leave for childbirth or adoption, or care of a newborn or newly adopted child.", "Legislation has also proposed enhancements to leave options available to federal employees for purposes of family care. Specifically, H.R. 532 (114th Congress) has proposed paid leave for parental responsibilities and H.R. 2698 (113th Congress) proposed short-term disability insurance that could be used for purposes of childbirth or adoption. Expansion of existing unpaid leave options for care of sick relatives or bereavement has also been proposed (see, for example, S. 846 and S. 226 in the 113th Congress). Finally, H.R. 3028 (112th Congress) proposed expanded voluntary leave donation programs to include the donation of sick leave to federal employees experiencing a medical emergency."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Sick Leave Use and Accrual", "paragraphs": ["According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), sick leave is defined as a \"paid leave of absence from duty.\" Federal employees are entitled to use sick leave for four primary reasons: (1) personal medical needs, (2) care of a family member, (3) death of a family member, and (4) adoption of a child. Table 1 describes specific medical situations that warrant the use of sick leave. Federal employees must formally request and receive approval from their respective agencies in order to receive their sick leave entitlements.", "Federal employees earn paid sick leave hours at varied accrual rates depending on their employment status ( Table 2 ). For example, a full-time federal employee accrues four hours of sick leave per bi-weekly pay period (a total of 104 hours, or 13 days, per year). There is no limit on the amount of sick leave hours an employee can accumulate and carry over to a new leave year. In contrast, accumulation of annual leave is subject to statutory ceilings at the end of a leave year, at which point a \"use or lose\" policy is enforced. ", "Federal employees can receive service credit for unused sick leave at the time of retirement. For example, an employee covered under the Civil Service Retirement System or Federal Employees Retirement System with 30 years of service and one year of accumulated sick leave would be considered to have 31 years of service for purposes of annuity computation.

As such, a new employee might not have the sick leave necessary to manage an unforeseen medical emergency. The following sections summarize leave options that are available to federal employees who must be absent from work due to medical reasons, but do not have the amount of sick leave hours necessary to cover the absence.

Table 3 describes the specific personal or family medical situations that may warrant advancement of sick leave.", "It is important to note that the leave amounts listed in Table 3 represent the maximum number of sick leave hours employees can receive, not necessarily what employees will receive, from their respective agencies. A gencies have wide discretion in determining (1) whether to offer advanced sick leave to their employees, (2) the total number of sick leave hours advanced, and (3) the specific requirements and approval procedures for granting advanced sick leave. It is possible that employees might receive less advanced sick leave hours than the maximums depending on their agencies' specific sick leave policies.

Such requests, however, must be approved by the employee's supervisor and \"may be denied.\" A federal employee can also request advanced annual leave for sick leave purposes, including pregnancy, childbirth, or bonding with a baby. Similar to advanced sick leave, advanced annual leave provides, at an agency's discretion, an employee with annual leave hours that have not yet been accrued. In contrast to advanced sick leave, however, the total amount of annual leave advanced may not exceed the total number of annual leave hours that the employee would accrue in the given leave year.

Such paid leave would be in addition to any accrued annual or sick leave an employee chooses to use for parental purposes. The bill would also allow employees to use paid parental leave without first exhausting their accrued annual or sick leave. Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which governs the majority of federal paid leave policy, already allows federal employees to substitute accrued annual or sick leave for FMLA unpaid leave.

Whereas the 2015 presidential memorandum proposes maximization of existing paid leave categories for parental responsibilities not covered under current laws governing sick leave (care of a healthy newborn or newly adopted child), FEPPLA proposes the development of a new paid leave category for parental responsibilities covered under current sick leave law (childbirth, adoption, or foster care)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Proposed Amendments to FMLA Regarding Federal Employee Leave", "paragraphs": ["Past legislation has proposed changes to the FMLA to provide additional unpaid leave to federal employees for certain family activities.

In contrast, work-related injuries would be covered by the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). A federal employee may elect to purchase short-term disability insurance from a private insurance provider to cover a prolonged medical absence from work. The amount of time covered and income replaced depends on the specific disability insurance plan.

In 2008, OPM submitted a proposal to Congress to establish a short-term disability insurance program for federal employees to cover non-work related injuries or disabilities. According to OPM, a primary purpose of the program was to ensure that there was \"an opportunity for employees, particularly new employees, to obtain additional income protection for recovery from accidents or illnesses or for maternity purposes.\" OPM further stated that the program would have been \"especially beneficial to new employees who have not had sufficient time in service to accrue a bank of leave.\" ", "Under the proposal, a federal employee would have been able to enroll in a short-term disability plan through an approved insurance provider as part of his or her federal benefits package. Enrollment in the program would have been voluntary, and federal employees would have been responsible for paying 100% of insurance premiums.
