{"id": "R42763", "title": "Sequestration: A Review of Estimates of Potential Job Losses", "released_date": "2012-10-01T00:00:00", "summary": ["Policymakers and economists have expressed concern that spending cuts and tax increases (commonly referred to as the \"fiscal cliff\") may push a slowly growing economy into recession in 2013. In summer 2012, policymakers particularly focused on how sequestration as delineated in the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) might affect employment in the near term. (Sequestration refers to an automatic cancellation of a portion of federal agencies' budgetary resources.) Effective on January 2, 2013, the BCA imposes across-the-board spending cuts split about equally (in dollar terms) between the budgets of non-exempt defense and nondefense discretionary and mandatory programs, a 2% limit is placed on cuts to Medicare's budget as well.", "This report reviews several studies that have estimated the potential effect of the sequestration process on employment. Their findings indicate that reduced federal spending would create or maintain fewer jobs than otherwise would have existed, and that cuts in the budgets of different agencies affect the pattern of job loss by occupation, industry, and state. These results suggest that achieving deficit reduction by means other than the BCA's about equal split of automatic budget reductions between non-exempt defense and nondefense programs might alter the composition of employers and employees most adversely affected, but the impact on total U.S. employment may be similar.", "The expenditures of federal agencies create or maintain jobs in three ways. Direct jobs result from paying the salaries of their employees and contracting with firms in various industries (e.g., shipbuilding) to produce goods (e.g., aircraft carriers). The contractors use a portion of their federal awards to buy products from firms in other industries (e.g., navigational instruments manufacturing) that the recipients of federal funds use in their finished products. The jobs supported by the purchases of federal contractors are referred to as indirect jobs. When the workers in direct jobs (e.g., employees of shipbuilders) and indirect jobs (e.g., employees of navigational equipment manufacturers) spend their paychecks on final goods and services (e.g., at grocery store and doctors' offices), additional jobs are supported by federal spending. These are referred to as induced jobs.", "One study estimated that a $48 billion sequester of Defense Department funds in 2013, compared with a baseline budget (without BCA cuts) for the calendar year, might support 907,000 fewer direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Job losses were forecast to diminish relative to the baseline after peaking in 2014 at about 1.2 million, with laid-off workers predicted to find new jobs in other industries as the economy adjusts to lower federal spending and employment recovers to the baseline forecast for 2022. Another analysis applied a 7.8% reduction to the National Institutes of Health budget for extramural awards, which are made to universities and other nongovernmental research facilities. It estimated that almost 34,000 direct, indirect, and induced job losses might result from such a program cut in FY2013. A third study, which reduced the budgets of Education Department and Head Start programs by 8.4%, put direct job loss among early childhood support personnel, elementary and secondary school educators, postsecondary faculty, and other support personnel at 80,500. Another analysis projected that a 2% reduction in Medicare's budget ($10.7 billion) in 2013, compared with a baseline budget, might support 500,000 fewer direct, indirect, and induced jobs. Of that total, almost 212,000 are direct jobs in such occupations as nurses, housekeepers, independent contractors, and medical residents."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["On January 2, 2013\u2014absent congressional action\u2014largely across-the-board spending cuts will be automatically imposed as stipulated in the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA; P.L. 112-25 ). The term used to describe an automatic cancellation of budgetary resources to achieve the policy goal of deficit reduction is sequestration . The approaching fiscal cliff has led to forecasts of a possible recession in 2013, and concern among policymakers about the impact of sequestration on employers and their employees.", "Several studies have estimated the potential effect on employment of cutting the budgets of different agencies and programs.

The act reduces the budget deficit in two ways. First, it places statutory limits on the amount of most spending through the annual appropriations process from FY2012 to FY2021, and it enforces the caps through sequestration in any year in which Congress appropriates an amount greater than the discretionary spending limit for that year. Second, it creates an automatic process to reduce spending by $1.2 trillion over the FY2013-FY2021 period through a combination of sequestration and lower statutory caps on discretionary spending if the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was established by the BCA, does not develop and submit to Congress an alternative proposal that achieves at least equivalent budget savings. Because the committee failed to agree upon a deficit reduction plan, the sequestration process is scheduled to go into effect on January 2, 2013.", "Generally speaking, the BCA would evenly split (in dollar terms) the $1.2 trillion in automatic reductions over the nine-year period between defense and nondefense spending categories. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is required to determine the annual amount of spending to be cut from defense and nondefense budgets after 18% attributable to debt service savings ($216 billion) is subtracted from the act's $1.2 trillion in deficit savings ($984 billion), or almost $54.7 billion from the defense and $54.7 billion from the nondefense budget functions per fiscal year from 2013 through 2021 ($984 billion divided by nine years). Within the defense and nondefense functions, the annual amount of spending reductions must then be divided proportionally between their respective discretionary and mandatory programs. Many programs are exempt from sequestration (e.g., Social Security and Medicaid) however. The BCA also limits cuts in Medicare payments to 2%. To offset this limit, the BCA requires the OMB to increase and reallocate the sequester proportionally across non-exempt non-Medicare mandatory spending and nondefense discretionary programs. In addition, the BCA allows the Administration to exempt any military personnel account if Congress is so notified by August 10. Because the OMB exempted all military accounts in letters to the Senate President and to the House Speaker dated July 31, 2012, the sequester of other defense programs must be increased uniformly to offset the exemption. The end result, as delineated in the BCA, will be spending cuts in four categories: defense discretionary appropriations, defense mandatory (direct) spending, nondefense discretionary appropriations, and nondefense direct spending.", "On August 1, 2012, Jeff Zients of the OMB testified that \"it is impossible at this time to determine the exact amount of the reductions that will be required in any given account or program\" because appropriations for FY2013 have not been enacted. Members of Congress expressed their dissatisfaction with the lack of information from the Administration on implementation of the BCA by passing the Sequestration Transparency Act. President Obama signed the bill into law on August 7, 2012 ( P.L. 112-155 ). It required the Administration to provide a detailed report to Congress on the budget accounts that will be subject to sequestration and on the percentages by which the accounts will be reduced to achieve the savings required by the BCA.", "The OMB report, released in mid-September 2012, provided the following preliminary estimates of percentage reductions in FY2013: 9.4% for non-exempt defense discretionary appropriations and 10% for non-exempt defense direct spending; 8.2% for non-exempt nondefense discretionary appropriations and 7.6% for non-exempt direct spending; and 2% for Medicare. The studies examined below use reductions for 2013 that differ somewhat from those of the OMB because they were prepared before the Administration issued its report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Review of Empirical Estimates of the Employment Effect of Sequestration", "paragraphs": ["Spending by the federal government supports (creates or maintains) jobs in three ways. It does so directly by paying the salaries of federal employees and by contracting with firms in various industries (e.g., shipbuilding) to produce final products (e.g., an aircraft carrier).

Federal government spending also supports jobs indirectly when contractors use a portion of their federal awards to buy outputs from businesses in other industries (e.g., navigational instruments manufacturing) that are incorporated in the finished products of prime contractors. The jobs supported by (dependent on) the purchases of prime contractors are referred to as indirect jobs .

In this case, the model is used to trace the output by industry that results from the government (e.g., the Department of Defense, DOD) and consumers (e.g., employees of suppliers to shipbuilders and of the DOD) purchasing final products (e.g., aircraft carriers and groceries). The model expresses these transactions as the value of output supported by one dollar of spending (demand) in a given industry. Productivity factors (the ratio of employment to output) are then applied to each industry to translate the output supported by one dollar of demand to the employment supported by one dollar of demand.

Budget reductions under the BCA in the following years were estimated to result in fewer annual job losses.", "Of the estimated 2.1 million job losses,", "746,000 were direct jobs (277,000 federal civilian jobs and 469,000 prime contractor jobs), 433,000 were indirect jobs at suppliers and other firms that depend on prime contractors for business, and 959,000 were induced jobs (i.e., jobs throughout the economy supported by workers in direct and indirect jobs spending a portion of their paychecks).", "The study estimated a small difference between the number of direct, indirect, and induced job losses due to a $56.7 billion reduction in FY2012-FY2013 in DOD spending (1,090,000) and the number of direct, indirect, and induced job losses due to a $59.0 billion reduction in spending by nondefense agencies (1,047,000). The number of induced job losses due to DOD budget cuts (482,000) also was estimated to differ little from the number of induced job losses due to budget cuts at nondefense agencies (476,000). Differences were greater in the estimation of direct job loss due to DOD budget cuts (326,000, including 48,000 civilian DOD jobs) and direct job loss due to budget cuts at nondefense agencies (421,000, including 229,000 nondefense agency jobs). Differences similarly were substantial in the estimation of indirect job loss associated with defense and nondefense budget cuts (282,000 and 151,000 jobs, respectively).", "The industries estimated to experience the greatest direct and indirect job losses also differed considerably. Federal government employees could face much larger direct and indirect job losses as a result of cuts to nondefense budgets (268,000 jobs) than to the defense budget (56,000 jobs). In the private sector, employees at professional and business services firms could face the largest direct and indirect job losses (180,000) due to nondefense budget cuts and manufacturing employees might incur the largest job losses (223,000) due to DOD budget cuts.", "Based on the FY2010 distribution of federal compensation and procurement disbursements, the model also produced estimates of potential employment effects on a state-by-state basis. The report noted, however, that \"[a]ctual agency budget reductions will have a different pattern depending on how each agency chooses to absorb these cuts in their operating programs and public service requirements.\" The areas estimated to experience the largest job losses due to federal budget cuts are California, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Texas, and Virginia.

Job losses were estimated to decrease thereafter relative to the baseline as the economy adjusts to reduced federal spending (demand). Laid-off workers are predicted to find new jobs because, as is usual after a demand shock, spending is predicted to increase in sectors of the economy other than the federal government and overall employment is predicted to recover to the baseline for 2022.", "On an industry basis, manufacturing was estimated to experience the largest job losses in absolute and percentage terms relative to the baseline forecast. Some manufacturing industries projected to initially experience job losses were also projected to experience job growth in the out-years relative to the baseline as the economy adjusts to lower government expenditures. Motor vehicle equipment manufacturing, which is consumer oriented, and construction and agricultural equipment manufacturing, which is export oriented, are two examples of this pattern provided by Inforum. In contrast, Inforum found that large direct suppliers of manufactured goods to the DOD (e.g., aerospace vehicles, ships, and specialized defense equipment) would not recoup all lost sales and jobs by the end of the projection period. Although most industries within the service sector were projected to lose jobs relative to the baseline due to defense budget cuts, \"once the shock of lower government spending subsides [wholesale and retail] trade, financial services and other services all have modestly higher levels of employment, compared to the baseline.\"", "Inforum used its State Employment Modeling System to allocate the above-described industry results from the LIFT model to approximate the state-by-state employment effect of projected cuts to the defense budget. It also relied on data in the 2011 version of Projected Defense Purchases: Detail by Industry and State: Calendar Years 2010 Through 2016 , which DOD produces from the Defense Employment and Purchases Projection System (DEPPS, another Inforum economic model).
