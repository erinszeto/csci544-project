There are a host of federal criminal laws that prohibit obstructions of justice. The six most general outlaw obstruction of judicial proceedings (18 U.S.C. 1503), witness tampering (18 U.S.C. 1512), witness retaliation (18 U.S.C. 1513), obstruction of congressional or administrative proceedings (18 U.S.C. 1505), conspiracy to defraud the United States (18 U.S.C. 371), and contempt (a creature of statute, rule and common law). All but Section 1503 cover congressional activities.", "The laws that supplement, and sometimes mirror, the basic six tend to proscribe a particular means of obstruction. Some, like the perjury and false statement statutes, condemn obstruction by lies and deception. Others, like the bribery, mail fraud, and wire fraud statutes, prohibit obstruction by corruption. Some outlaw the use of violence as a means of obstruction. Still others ban the destruction of evidence. A few simply punish \"tipping off\" those who are the targets of an investigation. A good number of these apply in a congressional context.", "Many of these offenses may also provide the basis for racketeering and money laundering prosecutions, and each provides the basis for criminal prosecution of anyone who aids and abets in or conspires for their commission.", "Moreover, regardless of the offense for which an individual is convicted, his sentence may be enhanced as a consequence of any obstruction of justice for which he is responsible, if committed during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing for the offense of his conviction.

It consists of four somewhat overlapping crimes: use of force or the threat of the use of force to prevent the production of evidence (18 U.S.C. 1512(a)); use of deception or corruption or intimidation to prevent the production of evidence (18 U.S.C. 1512(b)); destruction or concealment of evidence or attempts to do so (18 U.S.C. 1512(c)); and witness harassment to prevent the production of evidence (18 U.S.C. 1512(d)). The offenses have similar, but not identical, objectives and distinctive elements of knowledge and intent. Section 1512 also contains free standing provisions that apply to one or more of the offenses within the section. These deal with: affirmative defenses (18 U.S.C. 1512(e)); jurisdictional issues (18 U.S.C. 1512(f),(g),(h)); venue (18 U.S.C. 1512(i)); sentencing (18 U.S.C. 1512(j)); and conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 1512(k))."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Obstruction by Violence (18 U.S.C. 1512(a))", "paragraphs": ["Subsection 1512(a) has slightly different elements depending upon whether the offense involves a killing or attempted killing\u201418 U.S.C. 1512(a)(1), or some other use of physical force or a threat\u201418 U.S.C. 1512(a)(2). In essence, they condemn the use of violence to prevent a witness from testifying or producing evidence for an investigation and set their penalties according to whether the obstructive violence used is a homicide, an assault or a threat. In more exact terms, they declare:", "Unless countermanded by subsection 1512(j), subsection 1512(a)(3) provides the sanctions for both subsection 1512(a)(1) and (a)(2). Homicide is punished as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1111 and 1112, that is, murder in the first degree is punishable by death or imprisonment for life; murder in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment for any term of years or for life; voluntary manslaughter is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years and involuntary manslaughter by imprisonment for not more than 8 years. Attempted murder, assault, and attempted assault are punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 years; and a threat to assault punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years.", "Subsection 1512(j) provides that the maximum term of imprisonment for subsection 1512(a) offenses may be increased to match the maximum term of any offense involved in an obstructed criminal trial.", "\"To establish a crime under the [disclosure to a] 'law enforcement officer' section of the Act, the government must prove that (1) the defendant killed or attempted to kill a person; (2) the defendant was motivated by a desire to prevent the communication between any person and law enforcement authorities concerning the commission or possible commission of an offense; (3) the offense was actually a federal offense; and (4) the defendant believed that the person in (2) above might communicate with the federal authorities.\"", "There are two statutory defenses to charges under \u00a71512. One covers legitimate legal advice and related services, 18 U.S.C. 1515(c), and is intended for use in connection with the corrupt persuasion offenses proscribed elsewhere in \u00a71512 rather than the violence offenses of subsection 1512(a). The other statutory defense is found in subsection 1512(e) and creates an affirmative defense when an individual engages only in conduct that is lawful in order to induce another to testify truthfully. The defense would appear to be of limited use in the face of a charge of the obstructing use or threat of physical force in violation of subsection 1512(a).", "Subsections 1512(f) and 1512(g) seek to foreclose a cramped construction of the various offenses proscribed in \u00a71512. Subsection 1512(f) declares that the evidence that is the object of the obstruction need not be admissible and that the obstructed proceedings need not be either pending or imminent. Whether the defendant's misconduct must be shown to have been taken in anticipation of such proceedings is more difficult question.", "The Supreme Court rejected the contention that language like that found in subsection 1512(f) (making \u00a71512 applicable to obstructions committed before any official proceedings were convened) absolved the government of having to prove that the obstruction was committed with an eye to possible official proceedings. That case, the Arthur Andersen case, however, involved the construction of subsection 1512(b) which requires that the defendant be shown to have \"knowingly\" engaged in the obstructing conduct. Subsection 1512(a) has no such explicit \"knowing\" element. Yet, the government must still show that the offender's violent act was committed with the intent to prevent testimony or the disclosure of information to law enforcement authorities.", "By virtue of subsection 1512(g), the government need not prove that a \u00a71512 offender knew of the federal status of the obstructed proceeding or investigation. Thus, for instance, to prove an information obstruction offense, it need show no more than that the offender intended to prevent the flow of information to law enforcement authorities concerning a federal crime ; it need not demonstrate that the offender intended to prevent the disclosures to federal authorities .", "As a consequence of subsection 1512(h), murder, attempted murder, or the use or threat of physical force\u2014committed overseas to prevent the appearance or testimony of a witness or the production of evidence in federal proceedings in this country or to prevent a witness from informing authorities of the commission of a federal offense or a federal parole, probation, supervised release violation\u2014is a federal crime outlawed in subsection 1512(a) that may be prosecuted in this country.", "As a general rule, the courts will assume that Congress intends a statute to apply only within the United States and to be applied consistent with the principles of international law\u2014unless a contrary intent is obvious. Subsection 1512(h) supplies the obvious contrary intent. Since a contrary intent may be shown from the nature of the offense, the result would likely be the same in the absence of subsection 1512(h). In the case of an overseas obstruction of federal proceedings, the courts could be expected to discern a congressional intent to confer extraterritorial jurisdiction and find such an application compatible with the principles of international law. The existence of extraterritorial jurisdiction is one thing; the exercise of such jurisdiction is another. Federal investigation and prosecution of any crime committed overseas generally presents a wide range of diplomatic, legal and practical challenges.", "Subsection 1512(i) states that violations of \u00a71512 or \u00a71503 may be prosecuted in any district where the obstruction occurs or where the obstructed proceeding occurs or is to occur.

The section serves as an alternative to a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 371 that outlaws conspiracy to violate any federal criminal statute. Section 371 is punishable by imprisonment for not more than five years and conviction requires the government to prove the commission of an overt act in furtherance of the scheme by one of the conspirators. Subsection 1512(k) has no specific overt act element, and the courts have generally declined to imply one under such circumstances. Regardless of which section is invoked, conspirators are criminally liable as a general rule under the Pinkerton doctrine for any crime committed in the foreseeable furtherance of the conspiracy.", "Accomplices to a violation of subsection 1512(a) may incur criminal liability by operation of 18 U.S.C. 2, 3, 4, or 373 as well. Section 2 treats accomplices before the fact as principals. That is, it declares that those who command, procure or aid and abet in the commission of a federal crime by another, are to be sentenced as if they committed the offense themselves. As a general rule, \"[i]n order to aid and abet another to commit a crime it is necessary that a defendant in some sort associate himself with the venture, that he participate in it as in something he wishes to bring about, [and] that he seek by his action to make it succeed.\" It is also necessary to prove that someone else committed the underlying offense.", "Section 3 outlaws acting as an accessory after the fact, which occurs when \"one knowing that an offense has been committed, receives, relieves, comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder his or her apprehension, trial, or punishment.\" Prosecution requires the commission of an underlying federal crime by someone else. An offender cannot be both a principal and an accessory after the fact to the same offense. Offenders face sentences set at one half of the sentence attached to the underlying offense, or if the underlying offense is punishable by life imprisonment or death, by imprisonment for not more than 15 years (and a fine of not more than $250,000).", "Although at first glance section 4's misprision prohibition may seem to be a failure-to-report offense, misprision of a felony under the section is in essence a concealment offense. \"The elements of misprision of a felony under 18 U.S.C. 4 are (1) the principal committed and completed the felony alleged; (2) the defendant had full knowledge of that fact; (3) the defendant failed to notify the authorities; and (4) defendant took steps to conceal the crime.\" The offense is punishable by imprisonment for not more than three years and/or a fine of not more than $250,000.", "Solicitation to commit an offense under subsection 1512(a), or any other crime of violence, is prohibited in 18 U.S.C. 373. \"To establish solicitation under \u00a7373, the Government must demonstrate that the defendant (1) had the intent for another to commit a crime of violence and (2) solicited, commanded, induced or otherwise endeavored to persuade such other person to commit the crime of violence under circumstances that strongly corroborate evidence of that intent.\" Section 373 provides an affirmative statutory defense for one who prevents the commission of the solicited offense. Offenders face penalties set at one half of the sanctions for the underlying offense, but imprisonment for not more than 20 years, if the solicited crime of violence is punishable by death or imprisonment for life.", "A subsection 1512(a) violation opens up the prospect of prosecution for other crimes for which a violation of subsection 1512(a) may serve as an element. The racketeering statutes (RICO) outlaw acquiring or conducting the affairs of an interstate enterprise through a pattern of \"racketeering activity.\" The commission of any of a series of state and federal crimes (predicate offenses) constitutes a racketeering activity.

Money laundering is punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years, a fine ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 depending upon the nature of the offenses, and the confiscation of related property.", "A subsection 1512(a) offense is by definition a crime of violence.

It also bans any attempt to so intimidate, threaten, or corruptly persuade . The term \"corruptly\" in the phrase \"corruptly persuades\" as it appears in subsection 1512(b) has been found to refer to the manner of persuasion, the motive for persuasion, and the manner of obstruction. Prosecution for obstructing official proceedings under subsection 1512(b)(2) will require proof that the defendant intended to obstruct a particular proceeding. Prosecution for obstructing the flow of information to law enforcement officials under subsection 1512(b)(3), on the other hand, apparently requires of no such nexus. A subsection 1512(b)(3) investigation obstruction offense prosecution, however, does require proof that \"the offense in question was actually a federal offense and that the defendant believed that the witness\u2014toward whom the defendant engaged in [intimidating, threatening, corruptly persuasive or] misleading conduct\u2014might communicate with federal authorities.\" The defendant's belief that a witness might confer with federal authorities can be inferred from the nature of the offense and \"additional appropriate evidence.\"", "The attributes common to \u00a71512 as a whole, apply to subsection 1512(b); some of which may fit more comfortably in a subsection 1512(b) corrupt persuasion setting than they do in a 1512(a) violence prosecution. The affirmative defenses in subsections 1512(e) and 1515(d) are prime examples. Subsection 1512(e) removes by way of an affirmative defense good faith encouragements of a witness to speak or testify truthfully, although it does not excuse urging a witness to present fabrications as the truth. Subsection 1515(d) makes it clear that bona fide legal advice and related services cannot be used to provide the basis for subsection 1512(b) corrupt persuasion prosecution. Conversely, charges of soliciting a crime of violence\u201418 U.S.C. 373\u2014or of using a child to commit a crime of violence\u201418 U.S.C. 25\u2014are more likely to be prosecutorial companions of a charge under subsection 1512(a) than under subsection 1512(b).", "On the other hand, the extraterritorial and venue statements of subsections 1512(h) and 1512(i) are as readily applicable to subsection 1512(b) persuasion prosecutions as they are to a subsection 1512(a) violent obstruction case. The same can be said of aiding and abetting, accessories after the fact, misprision, and predicate offense status under RICO or the money laundering statutes.

The protection reaches wherever incriminating testimonial communication is compelled whether in criminal proceedings or elsewhere.

An individual's voluntarily created papers and records are by definition not compelled communications and thus ordinarily fall outside the privilege as well.

The gist of the protection is in the requirement, expressed in terms, that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable.\" At the same time, it pointed out that as in the case of a grand jury inquiry probable cause is not a prerequisite for a reasonable subpoena. In later years, it explained that where a grand jury subpoena is challenged on relevancy grounds, \"the motion to quash must be denied unless the district court determines that there is no reasonable possibility that the category of materials the Government seeks will produce information relevant to the general subject of the grand jury's investigation.\" The administrative subpoena standard has been cited on the those infrequent occasions when the validity of a congressional subpoena has been challenged on Fourth Amendment grounds. Contempt convictions have been overturned, however, when a Fourth Amendment violation taints the underlying subpoena or question.", "Perhaps most unsettled of all is the question the extent to which, if any, the separation of powers doctrine limits the subpoena power of Congress over members and former members of the other branches of government. As a practical matter, however, the other branches of government ultimately control the prosecution and punishment for statutory contempt of Congress, at least under the current state of the law. Section 194 states that the United States Attorney to whom Congress refers a violation of \u00a7192 has a duty to submit the matter to the grand jury.

This includes anyone who \"occupies a position of public trust with official federal responsibilities.\" Although there is a statutory definition of \"official act,\" it has been a matter of some dispute, perhaps because of its sweeping language. The question becomes particularly difficult when the bribery charge alleges that a bribe was provided in exchange for some unspecified official act or acts or for some general course of conduct. The application difficulties seem to have been exemplified by one appellate panel which held that governmental plea bargain practices fell within the reach of \u00a7201's prohibitions.

Section 1346 defines \"scheme to defraud\" to include a scheme to deprive another of honest services. The courts have construed their common elements in the same manner. Thus, what constitutes a scheme to defraud is the same in both instances: any act or omission that \"wrong[s] one in his property rights by dishonest methods or schemes and usually signif[ies] the deprivation of something of value by trick, deceit, chicane or overreaching.\" The deception that is part of the scheme, however, must be material; that is, it must have a natural tendency to induce reliance in the victim to his detriment or the offender's benefit. Both crimes require a specific intent to defraud, and they are punishable regardless of whether the scheme succeeds. As for the jurisdictional element, the \"statute doesn't require that a defendant be able to anticipate every technical detail of a wire [or postal] transmission, before she may be held liable for causing it. It's enough if she 'sets forces in motion which foreseeably would involve' use of the wires.\" ", "Both statutes refer to a \"scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses ... \" The extent to which that phrase encompasses intangibles has not always been clear.

There, it upheld application of the mail fraud statute to a scheme to deny a newspaper its pre-publication property right to its confidential information. The Court later confirmed that the wire fraud statute could be used against a smuggling scheme that deprived a governmental entity of its intangible right to collect tax revenues.", "In the wake of McNally , Congress expanded the scope of the mail and wire fraud statutes with the passage of 18 U.S.C. 1346, which defines the \"scheme to defraud\" element in the fraud statutes to include a scheme \"to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\" Section 1346 extends mail and wire fraud to prohibit the deprivation of the intangible right to honest services of both public and private officers and employees. ", "Until construed more narrowly by the Supreme Court in Skilling , some of the lower courts understood it to proscribe bribery, kickbacks and as well as various forms of self-dealing committed to the detriment of those to whom the offender owed a fiduciary duty of some kind. In the public sector, it was thought to condemn dishonesty in public officers and employees, although the exact scope of that proscription remained largely undefined. Some lower courts said that honest services fraud in the public sector \"typically occurs in either of two situations: (1) bribery, where a public official was paid for a particular decision or action; or (2) failure to disclose a conflict of interest resulting in personal gain.\" The bribery examples caused little pause; more perplexing were the issues of how broadly the conflict-of-interest provision might reach and what atypical situations might come within the honest services fraud prohibition.

For example, a final offense level of 15 means a sentencing range of from 18 to 24 months in prison for a first time offender (criminal history category I) and from 41 to 51 months for a defendant with a very extensive criminal record (criminal history category VI). Two levels higher, at a final offense level of 17, the range for first time offenders is 24 to 30 months; and 51 to 63 months for the defendant with a very extensive prior record.
