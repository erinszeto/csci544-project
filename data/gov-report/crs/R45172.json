As a result, trade relations are likely to refocus onto various bilateral trade issues such as the rising U.S. bilateral merchandise trade deficit with Vietnam, Vietnam's desire to be recognized as a market economy, and various elements of each nation's trade policies and regulations. Congress may play a role in each of these trade issues.", "Over the last 20 years, the U.S. merchandise trade balance with Vietnam has gone from a surplus of $110 million in 1997 to a deficit of more than $38 billion in 2017. The 2017 bilateral merchandise trade deficit with Vietnam was the 5th largest for the United States. U.S. exports declined in 2017 by nearly $2 billion compared to 2016, while U.S. imports from Vietnam increased by more than $4 billion. Given President Trump's focus on nations with which the United States has a bilateral merchandise trade deficit, Vietnam's trade policies and practices may face increased scrutiny from his Administration in the months ahead.", "One issue that was prominent during the TPP negotiations, and will likely remain an issue during the 115th Congress, were changes in U.S. laws regulating catfish imports that the Vietnamese government saw as protectionist, including the 2008 Farm Bill (P.L. 110-246) which shifted the inspection of catfish from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Given the views expressed by some Senators, catfish import regulation may be addressed if the Senate considers the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2).", "A new trade issue that may arise is U.S. arms sales to Vietnam. In May 2016, President Obama ended the remaining restrictions on lethal arms sales to Vietnam that had been in place since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. President Trump has indicated that he sees U.S. arms sales to Vietnam as an important method of reducing the bilateral merchandise trade deficit. While Vietnam has made few purchases of U.S. military equipment and materials since the removal of the restrictions, Vietnamese officials indicate that more requests may be submitted. In certain circumstances, Congress can play a role in the approval or disapproval of such arms sales.", "Each nation has raised other concerns about the other's trade policy. Vietnam would like the United States officially to recognize it as a market economy and sign a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). The United States would like Vietnam to increase U.S. imports, reduce certain technical barriers to trade, and implement various labor reforms.", "The importance of Vietnam's trade relations with the United States may be influenced by two proposed regional trade agreements. Vietnam is a party to the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which was signed in March 2018, as well as the proposed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP); the United States is not. The implementation of either trade agreement is likely to increase Vietnam's trade flows to the other nations in the trade agreements, and decrease its trade with the United States.", "The 115th Congress may play an important role in one or more of these issues, as have past Congresses. No legislation has been introduced regarding trade relations with Vietnam, but other legislation, such as H.R. 2, may contain relevant provisions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, economic and trade relations between the United States and Vietnam remained virtually frozen, in part a legacy of the Vietnam War. On May 2, 1975, after the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) defeated U.S. ally the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), President Gerald R. Ford extended President Richard M. Nixon's 1964 trade embargo on North Vietnam to cover the reunified nation. Under the Ford embargo, bilateral trade (including arms sales) and financial transactions were prohibited. ", "Economic and trade relations between the two nations began to thaw during the Clinton Administration, building on joint efforts during the Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations to resolve a sensitive issue in the United States\u2014recovering the remains of U.S. military personnel declared \"missing in action\" (MIA) during the Vietnam War. The shift in U.S. policy also was spurred by Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia. President Bill Clinton ordered an end to the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam on February 3, 1994, and on July 11, 1995, the United States and Vietnam restored diplomatic relations. Two years later, President Bill Clinton appointed the first U.S. ambassador to Vietnam since the end of the Vietnam War. ", "Bilateral relations also improved in part due to Vietnam's 1986 decision to shift from a Soviet-style central planned economy to a form of market socialism. The new economic policy, known as doi m oi (\"change and newness\"), ushered in a period of 30 years of rapid growth in Vietnam. Since 2000, Vietnam's real GDP growth has averaged over 6% per year. Much of that growth was generated by foreign investment in Vietnam's manufacturing sector, particularly its clothing industry. ", "The United States and Vietnam signed a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) on July 13, 2000, which went into force on December 10, 2001. As part of the BTA, the United States extended to Vietnam conditional most favored nation (MFN) trade status, now known as normal trade relations (NTR). Economic and trade relations further improved when the United States granted Vietnam permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status on December 29, 2006, as part of Vietnam's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). In June 2007, the United States and Vietnam signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), and set up a ministerial-level Trade and Investment Council to discuss issues related to the implementation of the TIFA and WTO agreements, as well as trade and investment policies in general. ", "Since signing the TIFA, Vietnam has indicated a desire to foster closer trade relations. In 2008, Vietnam applied for acceptance into the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program and the two nations started negotiations of a bilateral investment treaty (BIT). Both those initiatives, however, receded in importance once Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations got underway in 2008. The United States also has expressed an interest in closer economic relations, but has told the Vietnamese government that it needs to make certain changes in the legal, regulatory, and operating environment of its economy to conclude the BIT agreement or to qualify for the GSP program. ", "For the first few years following the end of the U.S. embargo in 1994, trade between the two nations grew slowly, principally because of Vietnam's lack of NTR (see Figure 1 ). However, following the granting of conditional NTR in December 2001, trade flows between the United States and Vietnam grew quickly. According to both nations' official trade statistics, merchandise trade nearly doubled between 2001 and 2002. Bilateral trade continued to climb after the United States granted PNTR status to Vietnam in 2006. U.S . imports from Vietnam slid 4.7% in 2009 because of the U.S. economic recession, but have rebounded sharply since 2010. According to U.S. trade statistics, U.S. exports to Vietnam declined by nearly $2 billion in 2017, but Vietnamese trade statistics show an increase in imports from the United States of almost $500 million.", "The growth in bilateral trade also has created sources of friction over specific goods. A rapid increase in Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States led to the implementation of a controversial monitoring program from 2007 to 2009. The growth in Vietnam's catfish exports (also known as basa , swai , and tra ) has also generated tensions between the two nations (see \" Catfish \" section below). The recent growth of new merchandise exports from Vietnam, such as electrical machinery, may become subject to future bilateral trade friction. ", "A possible area for growth in U.S. exports to Vietnam is arms sales (see \" Arms Sales \" section below). In May 2016, President Obama announced that he would lift the remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam. The Trump Administration has repeatedly signaled its interest in increasing arms sales to Vietnam, and has reportedly made such sales a priority for the Defense Department, the State Department, and the U.S. embassy in Hanoi. So far, such arms sales have been limited, despite the expressed interest displayed by both governments.

The bilateral trade deficit also was discussed during President Trump's meeting with Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang in Hanoi in November 2017. ", "Since 2001, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit with Vietnam has risen significantly, resulting in its rise from 45 th largest in 2001 to the 5 th largest bilateral deficit in 2017 (see Table 1 ). The increase in the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam has been largely driven by substantial and successive increases in the import of new types of goods from Vietnam, starting in the early 2000s with clothing, apparel and footwear, and then from 2012 to 2017 expanding into electronics and machinery. This growth largely reflects changes in Asia's regional supply chains, in which major manufacturers from China, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and other nations have relocated some of their production facilities to Vietnam, resulting in an increase in Vietnamese exports.

Since 1999, Vietnamese exports of basa , swai , and tra frozen fish fillets have secured a growing share of the U.S. market, despite the objections of the U.S. catfish industry and the actions of the U.S. government. In 2017, the United States imported almost $345 million in catfish from Vietnam.", "Over the last 16 years, the United States has taken several actions that have had an impact on the import of Vietnamese catfish (see Table 2 ). In 2002, Congress passed legislation that prohibited the labeling of basa , swai , and tra as \"catfish\" in the United States. In August 2003, the U.S. government imposed antidumping duties on \"certain frozen fish fillets from Vietnam,\" including basa , swai , and tra . In June 2009, the ITC determined to keep the duties in place \"for the foreseeable future.\" According to the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP), the number of companies exporting catfish to the United States declined from 30 to 3 following the imposition of antidumping duties.

In addition, an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal referred to the possible reclassification of basa , swai , and tra as catfish as \"protectionism at its worst.\" Vietnam also pointed to U.S. anti-dumping measures on Vietnamese shrimp and plastic bags as an indication of U.S. protectionism.

Effective April 12, 2010, all basa and tra exported from Vietnam needed certificates for hygiene and food safety issued by the National Agro-Forestry-Fisheries Quality Assurance Department. In addition, MOARD and the Ministry of Industry and Trade contracted U.S.-based Mazzetta Company to train Vietnamese fish breeders on how to comply with U.S. standards.

The top U.S. exports to Vietnam included aircraft; electrical machinery; cotton; machinery and mechanical appliances; edible fruit and nuts; and oil seeds. The juxtaposition of these two lists reveals product categories that may warrant watching for their emerging importance in bilateral trade, as well as a connection between some of the top trade commodities. Particularly noticeable in 2017 was the rise of electrical machinery as the leading import from Vietnam; in 2014, it was the third largest import after the two apparel categories.

Similarly, Vietnam imports wood from the United States that may end up in the furniture that is imported by the United States from Vietnam. There is also a significant amount of cross-trade in electrical machinery as parts and components are shipped back and forth across the Pacific Ocean.

Electrical machinery constituted more than 23% of total U.S. imports from Vietnam in 2017. According to interviews with foreign investors in Vietnam, there is great potential for growth in this sector because of Vietnam's relatively inexpensive, skilled workers.
