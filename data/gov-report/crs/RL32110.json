Drawing much attention during congressional debate were the agreement's sugar provisionsto allow additional sugar from the region to enter the U.S. market. To assuage concerns expressedby some Members, the Administration pledged prior to Senate passage to take steps to ensure thatall sugar imports, including those under DR-CAFTA, do not exceed a \"trigger\" that could underminethe U.S. Department of Agriculture's ability to manage the domestic sugar program. Sugar producersand processors responded that USDA's pledge did not address their long-term concerns, andcontinued last-minute efforts to defeat the agreement.", "In DR-CAFTA, the United States and six countries will completely phase out tariffs andquotas -- the primary means of border protection -- on all but four agricultural commodities tradedbetween them in stages up to 20 years. The four exempted products are as follows: for the UnitedStates, sugar; for Costa Rica, fresh onions and fresh potatoes; and for the four other CentralAmerican countries, white corn. The Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, andNicaragua have approved the agreement; Costa Rica's legislature is currently considering it. As ittakes effect on a rolling basis, the U.S. agricultural sector will over time gain free access to the sixhighly protected markets on a reciprocal basis, matching these countries' current duty-free entry fornearly all their agricultural exports to the United States. Other provisions establish safeguards forspecified agricultural products to protect U.S. and the region's producers from sudden import surges;prohibit the use of export subsidies between partners; and establish a mechanism to address sanitaryand phytosanitary barriers to agricultural trade.", "DR-CAFTA's provisions, once fully implemented, are expected to result in trade gains,though small, for the U.S. agricultural sector. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)estimates that $328 million in additional exports (primarily grains, meat products, and processedfood products) would be offset by a $52 million increase in imports (largely reflecting additionalaccess granted for sugar and beef from the six countries). Of the $2.7 billion increase in total U.S.exports that the ITC projects under DR-CAFTA, 12% would be attributable to the U.S. agriculturalsector.", "Most U.S. commodity groups, agribusiness and food manufacturing firms, and the AmericanFarm Bureau Federation (a general farm organization) supported DR-CAFTA, expecting to benefitfrom the guaranteed increased access to these six markets. Cotton producers announced theirsupport only after one major textile trade association came out in favor of it. The U.S. sugar industrystrongly opposed the additional access for sugar imports from these countries, fearing its economicimpact on domestic producers and processors. Two cattlemen trade organizations held differingpositions on the agreement's beef provisions. The National Farmers Union (a general farmorganization) opposed DR-CAFTA.

According to the ITC, these small declines would largely reflect the movement of laborand resources in the DR and Central American countries away from producing the latter products(which already benefit from preferential duty-free access to the U.S. market) to the more profitabletextile, apparel, leather products, and sugar sectors, which expand output to take advantage of theagreement's openings in the U.S. market. Under DR-CAFTA, U.S. agricultural imports from the sixcountries would increase 1.3% ( Table 4 ).

U.S. corn and rice exports to the region would see littlechange in the short term, but would rise as the six countries' quotas expand. Once quotas are fullyphased out, U.S. grain exports are expected to increase substantially. The ITC estimates that by theend of the 15-20 year transition period, annual U.S. grain exports to the region likely would increaseby at least 20% ($120 million), based on 2003 prices -- broken out among corn ($75 million), roughrice ($35 million), and milled rice ($10 million). Though the impact of these additional sales in thelong run is small (equal to 1.2% of 2003 U.S. grain exports worldwide), the ITC views the potentialincrease as offering significant market opportunities for U.S. corn and rice producers.

Similar coalitions sent nearly identical letters onSeptember 3, 2004, and February 1, 2005, to each Member of Congress. (12) ", "Processed Foods. Foodmanufacturers view the six countries as strong markets for U.S. processed foodproducts, pointing out that such exports already account for some 25% of their totalfood imports and are increasing faster than any other U.S. agricultural export. Withprocessed foods facing average tariffs of 15% in the Central American countries and20% in the Dominican Republic, an analysis prepared for the Grocery ManufacturersAssociation (GMA) estimated that the elimination of tariffs and quotas on key foodproducts could result in an 84% increase (from $359 million to $662 million) in U.S.exports to the region one year after DR-CAFTA is fully implemented. Growth isforeseen in particular in exports of snack foods, confectionary products, and soups. GMA expects other long-term benefits for its member companies with the adoptionof new rules that \"will lead to a stronger, more predictable business climate in theregion.\" Examples cited are dealer protections that give manufacturers moreflexibility and efficient product distribution, enhanced intellectual property andinvestor protections that are viewed as better protecting trademarks and providing amore secure business environment for increased sales of branded products, andimpetus for further integrating the region's market that results in economies of scalefor production and distribution and increased demand for U.S. food products.

It pointed out that the agreement improves existingaccess to an already leading market for U.S. rice exports, reduces high import duties,remedies tariff discrimination against certain forms of rice, and extends preferentialduty treatment that is not available to any other rice-exporting country. In particular,DR-CAFTA preserves existing access for U.S. rough (unmilled) rice, and providesfor immediate guaranteed access for milled and brown rice. The Central Americancountries agree to establish separate TRQs for rough and milled rice (the DominicanRepublic created TRQs for brown and milled rice) totaling almost 407,000 metrictons in year 1, increasing slowly over 18 to 20 years to almost 609,000 MT. Thiscompares to U.S. rice exports to the six countries of 714,000 MT in 2004 (valued at$184 million). In-quota rice imports from the United States would no longer besubject to applied tariffs ranging from 29% to 99%. The separate TRQs, the RiceFederation notes, will allow end users in these countries to chose between rough andmilled rice, and over time, enable U.S. exporters to sell higher-value rice to thesemarkets.

Each countryagrees to create duty-free TRQs for pork cuts totaling 13,613 MT in year 1, whichthen annually rise slowly to equal 29,040 MT in year 15, after which quotas andtariffs disappear altogether. In 2004, U.S. pork sales to all six countries totaled 8,442MT (valued at $16 million). In-quota pork imports from the United States during thistransition will no longer face applied tariffs that now range from 15% to 47%. TheNPPC anticipates that the income growth from free trade with the region will boostdemand for pork, even though at present most consumers in the region do not eatmeat on a regular basis. The NPPC also notes that SPS discussions have led allcountries to recognize the U.S. meat inspection system and to accept pork from anyUSDA-inspected facility. (15) ", "Corn and Corn Products. TheNational Corn Growers Association (NCGA) viewed the DR-CAFTA as creatingnew export opportunities for U.S. corn farmers and locking in the current U.S.market share in the region. It expects the agreement to stimulate U.S. exports of cornco-products like corn gluten feed and meal, distillers dried grains (DDGs), cornstarches, corn oil, and sweeteners (e.g., high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)). The sixcountries will reduce tariffs on some corn products (such as HFCS) within 15 years,with tariffs eliminated immediately on corn gluten products, starch, oils, and DDGs. The Corn Refiners Association (CRA) also supported the agreement, seeing excellentexport prospects for these value-added products that have averaged $19 million inrecent years. CRA notes that the sweetener provisions in DR-CAFTA are\"unambiguous,\" unlike those in NAFTA, which have led to the \"total loss\" of amarket for U.S.-produced HFCS.

Thereafter, each country's quota (exceptNicaragua's) would increase by about 1.5% each year in perpetuity, but the 10%-45%tariff on over-quota imports (depending upon the country) would remain in placeindefinitely. Costa Rica would eliminate its tariff on U.S. white corn over 15 years;the Dominican Republic will continue current duty-free treatment.", "Poultry. The National ChickenCouncil, National Turkey Federation, and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Councilsupported the agreement. The agreed-upon provisions largely reflect a frameworkthat the U.S. poultry sector developed with the poultry sectors in Central America,which trade negotiators on both sides adopted with minor changes. This frameworkwas based on the consensus reached between the private sectors in the U.S. and theregion that there be \"restricted access to the most sensitive [poultry] products andmore generous access for those products that are less sensitive.\" (17) ", "Applied tariffs on fresh and frozen poultry imports imposed by some of thesecountries can range up to 164%. According to USDA, U.S. poultry exports to the sixcountries in the 2000-2004 period averaged each year just above 73,000 MT andwere valued at $51 million. Chicken leg quarters accounted for some 55% of thevalue of all U.S. poultry sold to these countries.", "Under DR-CAFTA, the six countries will provide immediate duty-free accesson chicken leg quarters. Each country will create a TRQ on leg quarters that slowlyincreases as tariffs are eliminated in 17 to 20 years, depending on country. CostaRica's TRQ of 330 MT in year one would grow by 10% each year. The other CentralAmerican countries (each with its own minimum quota level) will establish aregional TRQ of 21,810 MT in the first year, which would rise slowly through year12. Beginning in year 13, the TRQ would be not less than 5% of regional chickenoutput. The Dominican Republic agreed on an initial TRQ for leg quarters of 550MT, growing by 10% annually. All countries' tariffs on other poultry products (e.g.,wings, breast meat, and mechanically de-boned chicken) will be reduced at a fasterpace, with many eliminated within 10 years. The Dominican Republic will alsoestablish separate TRQs for mechanically de-boned chicken (phased out over 10years) and for turkey products (with a 15-year phase-out).", "Dairy Products. The NationalMilk Producers Federation, the U.S. Dairy Export Council, and the InternationalDairy Foods Association supported DR-CAFTA. They viewed this agreement asproviding an opportunity to export more U.S. dairy products to the region on aduty-free basis while minimizing imports from these countries. The dairy industrynoted that U.S. export access to the six countries offsets the market access that U.S.negotiators granted to Australia (a major dairy exporter) under that FTA. (18) Theagreement's provisions largely reflect the outcome of discussions held betweenrepresentatives of the U.S. and Central American dairy sectors. The longesttransition period to free trade in DR-CAFTA applies to dairy products traded in bothdirections, with provisions structured to provide nearly reciprocal access in theamounts traded between the U.S. and the five Central American countries during the20-year transition period. U.S. dairy exporters, though, will receive more access tothe Dominican Republic market than the other way around. The U.S. dairy sectorpointed out that the agreement's declining tariffs and preferential quotas will improveU.S. competitiveness vis-a-vis the European Union, New Zealand, and Canada,which also sell to these countries.", "For each country, DR-CAFTA creates duty-free TRQs for six dairy products:cheese, milk powder, butter, ice cream, fluid milk and sour cream (U.S. only), andother products. High over-quota tariffs and safeguards (imposed when importsexceed specified volumes) are phased out over the 20-year transition period. Quotaamounts agreed upon by negotiators differ by country and by type of product.", "The United States will receive quota access in the six markets combined inyear 1 for almost 10,100 MT of dairy products. Quotas in the Central Americancountries will expand by 5% each year; those in the Dominican Republic willincrease by 10% annually. For non-quota products, the United States gainsimmediate duty-free access in these markets for whey and lactose. From 2000 to2004, U.S. dairy exports (some products subject to quotas, others not) to the sixcountries averaged 20,700 MT ($52 million) annually, according to USDA.", "In return, the six countries together would receive in year 1 duty-free quotaaccess to the U.S. market for over 6,800 MT of specified dairy products. U.S. quotaswould each year grow by 5% for the Central American countries, and by 10% for theDominican Republic. In 2000-2004, U.S. dairy imports from these six countriestotaled an annual average of 18,290 MT (valued at $7.4 million).", "Sugar. The new preferentialquotas offered by the United States for sugar from the six countries are in additionto the minimum level of duty-free access they already have to the U.S. market. Together, they are allowed to sell each year a minimum of 311,700 MT of raw canesugar under their respective shares of the U.S. sugar import quota. This represents28% of the 1.117 million MT market access commitment that the United States hasentered into with some 40 countries around the world. Under DR-CAFTA, CostaRica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republiceach will receive varying levels of duty-free access for a combined additional109,000 MT of sugar in year 1 -- a 35% increase over their current level. Increasingon average about 3% per year, by year 15, these countries will have access for anadditional 153,140 MT of sugar in the U.S. market above the 2004/05 current level. Thereafter, their preferential quotas combined will increase by almost 2% (2,640MT) annually in perpetuity. The U.S. over-quota tariff (calculated by the ITC to be78% in 2003) will stay at the current high level indefinitely, and not decline. Negotiators agreed upon a \"compensation\" mechanism that the United States canexercise at its sole discretion in order to manage U.S. sugar supplies. If activated, theUnited States commits to compensate the six countries for sugar they would not beable to ship to the U.S. market under the above market access provisions.", "The U.S. sugar industry (producers of sugar beets and sugarcane andprocessors of their crops) opposed DR-CAFTA, claiming that the additional sugarimports allowed under its provisions combined with those envisioned in additionalFTAs being negotiated \"will destroy the domestic sugar industry ... and overwhelman already abundantly supplied market.\" It also viewed DR-CAFTA as setting aprecedent for including sugar in the other free trade agreements that the BushAdministration is negotiating. The industry has continually advocated that sugartrade issues be instead addressed multilaterally in the WTO trade negotiations. Itsmembership wrote to President Bush (January 14, 2004), and the lead U.S.agricultural trade negotiator (March 23, 2004), to restate its opposition and to requestthat the Bush Administration reconsider the sugar access commitments offered theCentral American countries, and withdraw the access commitment granted to theDominican Republic. (19) ", "In response, the USTR pointed out that the additional access granted all sixcountries will equal about 1.2% of current U.S. sugar consumption in year 1, and1.7% in year 15. (20) The Trade Representative argued that the sugarsector will be protected by the sugar compensation mechanism, a prohibitive tariffon above-quota imports, and the prohibition on third-country transshipments of sugarthrough any of the six countries to the U.S. market.", "The Sweetener Users Association (SUA), composed of industrial users ofsugar and other caloric sweeteners and the trade associations that represent them,supported the DR-CAFTA. It argued this agreement will enhance competition in theU.S. sugar market, increase export opportunities for other U.S. food and commoditysectors in the six countries, and have a positive employment effect on the U.S.confectionery and other sugar-using industries by reducing incentives for them torelocate offshore to take advantage of lower-priced world sugar. (21) TheInternational Dairy Foods Association and the National Confectioners Associationsimilarly favored the agreement, because of the access provided for additionalimports of sugar. Imperial Sugar Company, an investor-owned sugar processor,supported DR-CAFTA. Since it relies almost completely upon foreign sugar for theraw sugar refined at its cane refinery in Savannah, Georgia, its president argued thatthe \"ability to secure ... imported sugar ... is critical to maintaining ourcompetitiveness\" and ability to provide buyers with a sufficient supply of refinedsugar. (22) ", "Responding to the ITC's analysis of DR-CAFTA's impact on the U.S. sugarsector (see page 10), the American Sugar Alliance (ASA), speaking for producers andprocessors, stated it \"seriously underestimates the danger of the [agreement] for ourindustry.\" The ITC report, according to the ASA, did not take into account the U.S.commitment under NAFTA to allow free access to sugar imports from Mexicostarting in 2008 and potential obligations to open the U.S. sugar market to importsfrom other sugar-exporting countries with which the United States is negotiating freetrade agreements. Sugar import obligations in addition to those in CAFTA, ASAargued, would cause lower prices, more bankruptcies, and lost jobs. The SweetenerUsers Association responded that the ITC's projections \"appear to be overstated\" -- by not considering the additional demand for sugar created by U.S. populationgrowth over time and USDA's authority to limit the amount of domestic sugar thatcan be marketed to ensure that no change in domestic prices occurs.", "Background on Sugar Deal. Theprospect that there might not be enough votes to approve the Administration's draftbill to implement DR-CAFTA during its \"mock markup\" by the Senate FinanceCommittee on June 14, 2005, prompted a commitment by Secretary of AgricultureJohanns to sit down with Members to discuss their concerns about the agreement'ssugar provisions. Members of Congress from districts and states where sugar cropsare grown subsequently met with USDA and White House officials to discussoptions. Proposals presented by some Members on behalf of the sugar producers andprocessors reportedly included (1) earmarking the additional sugar imported underDR-CAFTA and any future trade agreements for the production of ethanol by U.S.sugar processors, to be subsidized by the federal government, (2) an immediateresolution of the ongoing trade dispute about Mexican sugar access to the U.S.market, and (3) a commitment to continue the current features of the sugarprogram. (23) ", "On June 22, USDA Secretary Johanns responded with a proposal to Membersthat would have USDA administer the domestic sugar program through FY2008(when current authority expires) so that total U.S. sugar imports would never exceed1.532 million short tons. This is the statutory level that triggers the suspension of\"marketing allotments\" -- a mechanism agreed to by sugar processors to limit salesof domestically-produced sugar to ensure that the total supply of sugar available tomeet domestic demand does not result in market prices falling below effectivesupport levels. Should allotments be triggered, the sugar industry argued that thestocks of sugar they would be free to release into the market, when added to theadditional imports, would depress prices low enough to result in USDA acquiringsugar as price support loans came due. This would result in program outlays andUSDA not able to meet the \"no-cost\" objective called for by the 2002 farm bill. (24) ", "To keep imports below the trigger level, USDA proposed to donate surpluscommodities in its inventories or make cash payments to compensate sugar exportersin Central America or Mexico for sugar they would not ship to the U.S. market underDR-CAFTA's and NAFTA's terms. The commitment would reportedly extend onlythrough the end of current sugar program authority (the 2007 crop, or FY2008). (25) ", "Additional discussions continued, with sugar industry representativesparticipating in the last session held June 27. The Administration at that point shiftedfocus to address the concerns of a smaller group of Members, and in discussions withSenators Chambliss and Coleman, agreed to commit in writing those steps thatUSDA would take if imports under current trade agreements (including DR-CAFTA)exceeded the trigger level. Senate Finance Committee consideration of S. 1307 (the DR-CAFTA implementation bill) was delayed one day,until the letter was finalized and accepted by the two Senators as an adequateresolution to their concerns. ", "The Secretary's June 29th letter to the chairmen of the House and SenateAgriculture Committees pledged to \"preclude\" the entry of additional sugar importsif they will exceed the trigger, and place the sugar program at risk, by: (1) makingpayments using agricultural commodities to sugar exporters in other countries inreturn for their not shipping sugar to the U.S. market, and (2) purchasing or divertingexcess imported sugar for restricted non-food use, such as ethanol. He alsocommitted to completing a study to be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2006, on thefeasibility of converting sugar into ethanol. (26) The sugarindustry early in the talks had proposed a sugar-for-ethanol program based upon theavailability of a federal subsidy. Administration negotiators rejected that request,opting instead for to use surplus sugar imports for ethanol if needed, and to conducta study.", "Reactions by Members to the letter were mixed, with some skeptical aboutthe assurance and others remaining opposed, in part because of the possible costs thatUSDA might incur in meeting its pledges. The U.S. sugar industry rejected theAdministration's \"repackaged, short-term offer,\" stating that it did not address theirlong term concerns about (1) sugar that could enter in future trade agreements, (2) itsobjectives for a resolution of the dispute on Mexico sugar access to the U.S. market,and (3) the continuation of the features of the current sugar program after FY2008. A spokesman for the ASA vowed to work to defeat DR-CAFTA. (27) ", "Congressional Budget Office Estimate. In its analysis of the DR-CAFTA implementation bill ( H.R. 3045 , S. 1307 ), CBO estimated that the domestic sugar program \"will likelycost an additional $500 million over the 2006-2015 period\" as a result of theagreement's guaranteed access for sugar from the six countries. CBO based itsestimate on its March 2005 assumptions about sugar market conditions over thisperiod, taking into account other trade agreement commitments (particularly thosewith Mexico under NAFTA's sugar provisions). However, the CBO analysisacknowledges that current sugar market conditions indicate costs \"would likely belower in 2006 and possibly lower in 2007, with no significant change in later years.\" A USDA official responded that this analysis was unrealistic, adding that there wouldbe \"virtually no cost\" in 2006 and 2007 under the agreement's sugar provisions. Aspokesman for the U.S. sugar industry stated that the CBO analysis \"confirmsCAFTA would make it impossible for the United States to maintain a sugar programthat operates at no cost to federal taxpayers.\" (28) ", "Cotton. The National CottonCouncil of America (NCC) on May 10, 2005, announced it will now supportDR-CAFTA. Because NCC's diverse membership includes cotton producers,ginners, cottonseed handlers, warehousers, merchants, cooperatives, and textilemanufacturers, the organization's position reflected a shift from an earlier consensusreached among all of these interests expressing concern about this trade agreement. The resolution adopted states that the agreement \"should provide the United Statesthe best opportunity to supply apparel manufacturers and other end-usemanufacturing industries in the western hemisphere\" with U.S. cotton fiber and U.S.produced cotton textile products. The NCC also urged the Administration to addressthe U.S. cotton industry's trade priorities, seeking in particular action on increasedtextile competition (e.g., from China). The council initially opposed DR-CAFTAand had called upon Congress to defer considering the agreement until its textileprovisions were \"thoroughly reviewed and significantly improved.\" The NCC'sreversal followed the decision of the National Council of Textile Organizations(NCTO) on May 5, 2005, to support DR-CAFTA. (29) Two othertrade associations representing textile firms -- the National Textile Association andthe American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition -- opposed this agreement.", "Though the NCC favors reciprocal liberalization in cotton fiber trade, it haspointed out that textile and apparel provisions in trade agreements can have \"as muchor more of an impact\" on the domestic cotton sector than simply their agriculturalprovisions. In other FTA negotiations to date, the NCC has sought NAFTA-typerules-of-origin that directly benefit U.S. textile workers and firms as well as those inFTA partner countries, but not those in third countries. For the most part, NAFTArules require that the cotton used in yarn (the fiber-forward rule) and the yarn usedin cotton textiles (the yarn-forward rule) must originate in the United States or in thepartner country for the product to qualify for preferential trade treatment. Anyrelaxation of such rules of origin, the NCC argues, opens the U.S. cotton and textilesectors \"to unfair, unbridled competition\" from third countries that transship textilegoods through a FTA partner country to take advantage of its duty-free access to theU.S. market. Because of its less restrictive rules of origin, the NCC initially opposedthe DR-CAFTA -- referring to its tariff preference levels (TPLs) and \"cumulation\"provisions for NAFTA-origin textiles that would allow third-country textile productsto qualify for preferential treatment.
