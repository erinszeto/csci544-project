A Party in a State-State dispute found to have violated a PTPA obligation is generally expected to remove the complained-of measure; remedies for non-compliance include compensation and the suspension of PTPA concessions or obligations (e.g., imposition of a tariff surcharge on the defending Party's products), with the defending Party having the option of paying a fine to the prevailing Party or, in some cases, into a fund that may be used to assist the defending Party in complying in the case. An investor-State tribunal may only make monetary awards and thus may not direct a PTPA Party to withdraw or modify the offending measure. If the defending State Party does not comply, the investor may seek to enforce the award under one of the international conventions for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards to which the United States and Peru are party. State-State dispute settlement may also be initiated against the non-complying Party.", "The PTPA State-State dispute settlement mechanism differs from earlier U.S. FTAs in that it applies to all obligations contained in the labor and environmental chapters of the PTPA instead of only domestic labor or environmental law enforcement obligations. In addition, in the event a Party is found to be in breach of one of these obligations and has not complied in the dispute, the prevailing Party may impose trade sanctions instead of, as under earlier agreements, being limited to requesting that a fine be imposed on the non-complying Party with the funds to be expended for labor or environmental initiatives in that Party's territory. The changes stem from a bipartisan agreement on trade policy between Congress and the Administration finalized on May 10, 2007 (May 10 agreement), setting out various provisions to be added to completed or substantially completed FTAs pending at the time. Among the aims of the agreement was to expand and further integrate labor and environmental obligations into the U.S. free trade agreement structure. The same approach to labor and environmental disputes is found in FTAs entered into with Colombia, Korea, and Panama, each of which continue to await congressional approval.", "Implementing legislation approving the PTPA and providing legislative authorities needed to carry it out was signed into law on December 14, 2007 (P.L. 110-138).

On July 19, 2011, however, the U.S. Department of Labor agreed to review a petition filed by a Peruvian labor union alleging that Peru had failed to effectively recognize collective bargaining rights in violation of the PTPA labor chapter. The fact-finding review could possibly lead to a State-State dispute proceeding if the United States considers that Peru has acted inconsistently with the agreement and efforts to settle the dispute through consultations are unsuccessful. To establish a PTPA violation, the United States must demonstrate that Peru has failed to adopt or maintain a law, regulation, or practice in a manner that affects trade or investment between the Parties. In addition, one case has been brought under the PTPA investor-State dispute settlement mechanism. In April 2011, a U.S. firm filed an arbitral claim alleging that Peru had violated its PTPA investment obligations in its treatment of a metallurgical smeltering and refining operation run by the claimant's affiliate in Peru."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) follows current U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) practice in containing two types of formal dispute settlement: (1) State-State, applicable to disputes between the Parties to the PTPA, and (2) investor-State, applicable to claims by an investor of one Party against the other Party for breach of PTPA investment obligations. Investor-State dispute settlement has been a key element of U.S. bilateral investment treaties, and with the inclusion of investment obligations in most U.S. FTAs, it has become a feature of these agreements as well.", "The dispute settlement provisions of the PTPA need to be considered in tandem with other PTPA obligations to understand the extent to which measures adopted or maintained by a PTPA Party may be the subject of dispute settlement under the agreement. Exceptions to PTPA obligations are also an element in assessing the scope of obligations undertaken by each Party. For example, general exceptions contained in World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements\u2014namely, Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and Article XIV of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)\u2014are incorporated into the PTPA for purposes of obligations involving trade in goods and services. The PTPA also contains an \"essential security\" exception, which, if invoked by a State Party in an investor-State arbitration or a general dispute settlement proceeding, will be found to apply.", "The United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act, which approves the PTPA and provides legislative authorities needed to carry it out, was signed into law December 14, 2007 ( P.L. 110-138 ).

A protocol of amendment, signed June 24 and June 25, 2007, which revises the PTPA to incorporate certain provisions involving labor, the environment, intellectual property, government procurement, port security, and investment, entered into force on the same day. The additional language stems from a bipartisan agreement on trade policy between Congress and the Administration finalized on May 10, 2007 (often referred to as the May 10 agreement), setting out various provisions to be added to completed or substantially completed FTAs pending at the time. Aimed at, among other things, expanding and further integrating labor and environmental obligations into the FTA structure, the May 10 agreement provides that labor and environmental obligations in an FTA are to be subject to the same general dispute settlement provisions, enforcement mechanisms, and remedies for non-compliance as the agreement's commercial obligations.

In general, resort to panels under FTA State-State dispute settlement has been uncommon and thus there has been relatively little experience with the operation of this mechanism over a range of agreements and issues. This may be the case because of FTA consultative arrangements that facilitate the informal resolution of disputes or questions over the scope of an agreement or its application in a particular instance before resort to more structured dispute settlement procedures is considered necessary. In addition, WTO dispute settlement is generally available where a dispute arises under both a WTO agreement and an FTA.", "On July 19, 2011, however, the Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA) of the U.S. Department of Labor accepted for review a petition by a Peruvian union representing tax agency workers filed under Chapter Seventeen of the PTPA, the agreement's labor chapter, alleging that Peru had violated the PTPA by failing to effectively recognize collective bargaining rights as required under Article 17.2.1 of the agreement. Article 17.5 of the PTPA permits individuals, firms, and other associations of a PTPA Party to file a submission with a PTPA Party on matters related to the labor chapter and directs Parties to review such submissions in accordance with domestic procedures. The aim of the OTLA review, which is expected to be completed within 180 days, is \"to gather information so that OTLA can better understand the allegations therein and publicly report on the U.S. Government's views regarding whether the Government of Peru's actions were consistent with the obligations set forth in the Labor Chapter of the PTPA.\" The United States may request consultations with Peru under Chapter Seventeen and, if the parties fail to resolve the matter within 60 days of any such request, the United States may request further consultations under the PTPA dispute settlement chapter. The review could possibly lead to further State-State dispute settlement proceedings if efforts to settle the dispute through consultations are unsuccessful. To establish a violation of an obligation under Article 17.2.1, the United States must demonstrate that Peru has failed to adopt or maintain a law, regulation or practice in a manner that affects trade or investment between the Parties. PTPA requirements and procedures for disputes arising under the PTPA labor chapter are discussed in greater detail later in this report.", "In addition, a notice of intent to initiate an arbitration under the PTPA investor-State dispute settlement provisions was submitted by the U.S. firm Renco Group, Inc., in late December 2010.
