On October 15, 1992, the United States ratified theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which entered into forceon March 21, 1994. This committed the United States to \"national policies\" to limit \"itsanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases,\" with a voluntary goal of returning \"emissions ofcarbon dioxide [CO 2 ] and other greenhouse gases [methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide(N 2 O),hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 )]\" at the \"endof the decade\" to \"their 1990 levels.\"", "Subsequently, in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, the United States participated in negotiations that ended with agreement on further reductions that could become legally binding. TheUnited States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, but President Clinton did not send it to the Senatefor advice and consent. President Bush has said that he rejects the Protocol, and former U.S.Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christine Todd Whitman told reporters that theAdministration would not be pursuing the UNFCCC commitment either. Instead, President Bushhas proposed to shift the nation's climate change program from a goal of reducing emissions per seto a goal of reducing energy intensity -- the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit ofeconomic productivity. Under the proposal, the intensity, which has been declining for a numberof years, would decline 18% between 2002 and 2012, as opposed to a 14% projected \"business asusual\" decline.", "Meanwhile, the UNFCCC \"end of the decade\" deadline has passed and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions continue on an upward trend, though with dips in 1991 and in 2001, attributed mostly toeconomic slowdowns. Based on historical data, 2001 emissions were about 13% in excess of theUNFCCC goal. Overall, from 1990 to 2001, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (weighted by globalwarming potential) have increased an average of about 1.1% per year. Projections suggest that U.S.emissions will continue to rise for at least the next decade.

The first two, economic growth and technologicalinnovation, have the greatest effect on variance in projections of CO 2 emissions (see Table4 ).

One is sequestration, which removesCO 2 from the atmosphere, thereby reducing gross emissions. The second is a series ofproposed trading mechanisms that could allow a country to take credit for reductions itsponsors in other countries. The United States was a strong supporter of including both thesevariables in the Kyoto Protocol. Sequestration could directly diminish a country's reductionrequirement; trading does not change a reduction requirement, but it could affect costs andwho would actually achieve the reductions.", "Carbon Sequestration. Atmospheric greenhouse gas levels are affected not only by emissions, but also by carbon sinks --processes that remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Activities that affectsequestration include farming and forestry practices. For example, a positive net growth oftrees removes carbon from the atmosphere; clearing forests typically releases carbon. Table1 , \"U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 1990 -2001,\" includes figures for carbon sequestrationfrom land-use activities and forestry, which are the difference between \"total emissions\" and\"net emissions.\"", "The UNFCCC states that signatory nations shall commit to \"promote sustainable management, and promote and cooperate in the conservation and enhancement, asappropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases ... , including biomass, forestsand oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems\" (Article 4(1)(d)).", "The Kyoto Protocol also would provide that sinks can be taken into account in calculating a nation's emissions and its reduction obligation. \"The net changes ingreenhouse gas emissions from sources and removals by sinks resulting from directhuman-induced land-use change and forestry activities, limited to afforestation, reforestation,and deforestation since 1990, measured as verifiable changes in stocks ... shall be used tomeet\" the 2008-2012 commitments (Article 3(3)). In general, then, a net increase inhuman-induced carbon sequestration from forestry practices between 1990 and 2008-2012would be subtracted from emissions during the period, thereby reducing the amount of actualemissions that will have to be curtailed. Conversely, net negative sequestration from forestrypractices would be added to the emissions that will have to be reduced.", "Just how this calculation would be done is not prescribed in the Protocol, and disagreements on how much carbon sequestration could be counted toward a nation'sreduction obligations were debated through several subsequent conferences. In July 2001,the Sixth Conference of Parties in Bonn (COP6) agreed to limits on sequestration activitiesthat could be credited against the Protocol's reduction requirements. Although the UnitedStates chose not to participate in these proceedings, the Conference stated in a footnote (26) thatunder the methodology agreed upon, the United States could take credit for net increases ofsequestration of up to 28 million metric tons per year.", "Emissions Trading. Emissions trading, strongly supported by the United States in the Kyoto negotiations, derives from the principleof economic efficiency -- that reductions, if necessary, should be achieved at the lowestcost. Trading mechanisms thus are designed to allow low-cost reductions to substitute forhigher-cost ones. The idea is that a country could achieve its reduction goal not only byreducing its domestic emissions, but also by reducing emissions elsewhere. Trading does notactually reduce a nation's reduction requirement, but it does allow it to contract for and tocount reductions elsewhere that are cheaper to achieve than domestic ones.", "The Kyoto Protocol provides for emissions trading mechanisms (27) that can be used to\"supplement\" domestic reductions; this offers the possibility that actual domestic greenhousegas reductions achieved by a party to the Kyoto Protocol will be less than the party's actualcommitment. Some portion of the reduction requirement could be shifted elsewhere. TheClinton Administration argued that emission trading would be critical to U.S. compliancewith Kyoto; (28) a Clinton Administration economicanalysis suggested that U.S. compliancecosts would drop from $193 per ton with no international emissions trading to $23 per tonwith global trading. (29) COP6 agreed that therewould be no quantitative limit on the amountof credit a country could receive from trading, but that domestic action must constitute asignificant part of a nation's reduction efforts. (30) With no quantitative limit on trading, anyestimate of actual domestic reduction required to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, or of thecosts involved, remains problematic -- and is moot as long as the United States declines toparticipate in the Kyoto process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The precise numerical projections of greenhouse gas emissions (or of proposedreductions) should be viewed as indicative (see Figure 3 ).

None of the reviewedscenarios using assumptions that diminish emissions -- low economic growth, putting offretirement of nuclear facilities, accelerated fostering of energy-efficient technologies, thePresident's voluntary program to reduce greenhouse gas intensity -- reverses the upwardtrend in aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 2010.
