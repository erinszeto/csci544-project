Through the Ticket to Work legislation, Congress sought to address several major work disincentives for individuals with disabilities. Ticket to Work provides a \"ticket\" or voucher to working-aged Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries to obtain employment and other support services. Services are furnished through the current system of state vocational rehabilitation (VR) agencies or a ticket holder's choice of an approved public or private sector, program-specific employment network (EN) to assist them in entering or re-entering the workforce. Additional provisions are briefly described below.", "The Ticket to Work program was phased in nationally in three stages, which began in February 2002 and concluded in September 2004. By statute, SSA contracts with program managers (PMs) to administer program aspects related to ENs and ticket holders. As of December 31, 2013, SSA has 666 ENs certified to provide employment support services for ticket holders in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Of the approximately 13.6 million \"active\" tickets that have been issued by SSA, 319,972 (approximately 2.4%) are \"in-use,\" that is, a disability beneficiary has assigned his or her ticket to an EN or state VR agency.", "P.L. 106-170 also directed SSA to establish supplementary work incentive programs designed to reduce dependence on disability benefits and encourage workforce participation. The Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) program was created to disseminate accurate information to Social Security disability beneficiaries on work incentive projects. SSA established cooperative agreements with community-based organizations to provide benefits planning, assistance, and outreach services to beneficiaries. In addition, SSA established the Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS) program with the aim of providing information and advice about how to obtain vocational rehabilitation, employment, advocacy, or other services that SSDI or SSI beneficiaries may need to secure or regain gainful employment.", "The Ticket to Work program underwent major regulatory changes in July 2008, which, among other adjustments, increased financial incentives for ENs and expanded the eligibility criteria for Social Security disability beneficiaries to participate. The program has come under increased scrutiny by policy makers due to low SSDI and SSI beneficiary participation and lower than expected return-to-work rates among ticket holders. In addition, a May 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) assessment reported a lack of oversight of the program that has led to service approaches among some ENs that are out of line with the general goal of the Ticket program, which is to reduce beneficiaries' dependence on benefits through earnings from work.", "Ticket to Work legislation also created state options to eliminate the dilemma faced by many beneficiaries\u2014choosing between work and health insurance coverage\u2014through provisions that allow for additional Medicaid eligibility options and an extension of Medicare eligibility.

The purpose of this program is to enhance work incentives for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries . The legislation created a \"ticket\" system to expand choices in the numbers and types of providers that SSDI and SSI beneficiaries may choose to assist them in receiving employment services. The legislation also expanded Medicare and Medicaid coverage for individuals with a disability who are working or could work. Most notably, the Ticket to Work program created a market for public and private providers of support services known as employment networks (ENs) to which Social Security disability beneficiaries can voluntarily assign their tickets in exchange for a range of employment support services. The goal of the Ticket program is to reduce dependence on disability benefits and help Social Security disability beneficiaries enter or reenter the workforce. ENs would then be eligible to receive payments from SSA based on ticket holders achieving employment \"milestones\" or outcomes.", "This report provides an overview of how the Ticket to Work program operates and addresses several issues related to the Ticket program.

SSDI is an insurance program for workers and their dependents for which benefits are paid to individuals who have a disability and have worked and made contributions to the U.S. Social Security system. Individuals who collect SSDI also become entitled to coverage under the Medicare health insurance program (Title XVIII of the Social Security Act) after a 24-month waiting period.", "SSI is a means-tested disability program for low-income individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled and have limited resources. In general, individuals are eligible for SSI if their countable income falls below the federal benefit rate (FBR) and they have countable resources of less than $2,000 for an individual. In most states, beneficiaries who collect SSI are automatically entitled to coverage under the federal-state Medicaid health insurance program (Title XIX of the Social Security Act).", "Individuals are considered to have a disability if they meet the definition established under the Social Security Act. Disability is defined as the inability to engage in any \"substantial gainful activity\" (SGA) due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to last for at least 12 months or result in death. SGA is defined in federal regulations as paid work involving significant and productive physical or mental duties. For 2014, the monthly SGA thresholds are $1,800 for individuals who are blind and $1,070 for individuals with other disabilities. SGA limits are adjusted annually to reflect growth in average wages.", "In 2013, approximately 12.2 million beneficiaries collected monthly SSDI or SSI benefits. Together these two programs represent the largest disability benefit system in the nation, with combined federal expenditures of approximately $146.8 billion in 2013. Although both SSDI and SSI include a number of work incentives and offer rehabilitation services to individuals with a disability, the number of people who leave the benefit rolls to work (i.e., engage in SGA) is very small. In 2012, 0.4% of SSDI beneficiaries actually left the disability rolls because of work.", "The small incidence of return-to-work has been partially attributed to the built-in disincentives of the SSDI and SSI programs.

Some contended that several reasons for the high rate of unemployment among beneficiaries included confusing rules, arcane procedures, and disincentives built into the Social Security disability programs. Advocates noted surveys showed that most working-age people with disabilities want to work and maintained that the numerous federal regulations and program rules have the effect of discouraging otherwise qualified and eager job seekers with disabilities from seeking employment. Return-to-work legislation subsequently became the subject of several legislative proposals, congressional hearings, and a major component of the Clinton Administration's comprehensive strategy to increase employment among individuals with disabilities.", "On March 18, 1998, President William J. Clinton established the Presidential Task Force on the Employment of Adults with Disabilities (PTFEAD). This Cabinet-level task force was charged with conducting an extensive public policy review with the goal of increasing the employment of individuals with disabilities and addressing other barriers to work among adults and young people with disabilities. PTFEAD produced a series of reports that analyzed existing federal programs and policies to determine and track changes that would be necessary to remove barriers to work, address issues surrounding health insurance coverage, and analyze employment outcomes of programs focused on youths with disabilities. Ultimately, PTFEAD's recommendations prompted the Clinton Administration to seek full funding in the FY2000 budget request for Ticket to Work programs.", "Along with several initial cosponsors in the 106 th Congress, Senator James M.

CBO estimated modest gains in Social Security beneficiaries' future participation in the proposed expanded network of employment support services, beyond the services that were primarily offered by state VR agencies. Overall, by FY2009, CBO projected that the Ticket to Work program (Title I of H.R. 1180 ) would reduce direct spending by $53 million and $32 million for the SSDI and SSI programs, respectively, through the combination of payments to ENs and the avoidance of payments to beneficiaries whose benefits would be suspended or terminated due to earnings from work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program", "paragraphs": ["The Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program was designed to address several barriers to work for individuals with disabilities through greater access to healthcare and a broader pool of employment service providers or ENs.
