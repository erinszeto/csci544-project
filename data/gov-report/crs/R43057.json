{"id": "R43057", "title": "U.S. Household Savings for Retirement in 2010", "released_date": "2013-07-23T00:00:00", "summary": ["Whether households have sufficient savings from which to ensure adequate income throughout retirement is a concern of households and, therefore, policymakers. The retirement income landscape has been changing over the past few decades. Although most households are eligible to receive Social Security benefits in retirement, over the past 30 years, the types of non-Social Security sources of retirement income have been changing. About half of the U.S. workforce is covered by an employer-sponsored pension plan. An increasing number of employers offer defined contributions (DC) pension plans (i.e., tax-advantaged accounts in which employee, and sometimes employer, contributions accrue investment returns) in lieu of traditional defined benefit (DB) pension plans (i.e., monthly payments to a retiree by a former employer). This shift in the nature of employer-sponsored pensions places more responsibility on workers to financially prepare for their own retirement. Households also save for retirement using Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), into which contributions, up to a specified limit, are tax-deductible for some individuals.", "Congress has several reasons for its interest in the retirement preparedness of American households: income from Social Security may be insufficient to provide for an adequate standard of living in retirement for U.S. households; congressional actions may encourage or discourage employer and household efforts to provide for their own well-being in retirement; and the U.S. Treasury will forego $117 billion in FY2013 as a result of tax policies that are designed to encourage employer and worker retirement savings. President Obama's FY2014 budget would prohibit contributions to DC pension plans and IRAs that have a value over $3.4 million. This threshold is specified to be equivalent to the maximum annual payment allowed from a DB pension plan, which is $205,000 in 2013.", "This report provides data on a variety of household wealth measures in 2010 from the Federal Reserve's triennial Survey of Consumer Finances. Although the amount of retirement assets is the primary focus of the report, other measures of wealth (such as the amount of total assets, financial assets, total debt, net worth, and housing equity) are also included. The report classifies the amount of assets and debt by the age of the head of the household for both single and married households. In general, the amount of household wealth is higher for married households than for single households. Household wealth generally increased as the age of the head of the household increased, although some measures decreased for those households in which the head of the household was aged 75 or older. In general, the median values were less than the average values, which is an indication that some households held relatively large amounts of wealth compared with most households.", "Among households with retirement assets, households in which the head is younger than 55 years old are more likely to own DC pension plan assets than they are likely to own assets from IRAs, whereas households in which the head is aged 55 or older are more likely to have IRA assets. In 2010, less than 1.0% of U.S. households had IRA or DC assets of $1.0 million or more.", "Ownership of a principal residence is likely to be a factor that affects the accumulation of retirement assets. Survey data suggest an important saving goal for younger households is home ownership, whereas preparing for retirement is an important saving goal for older households. As the age of the head of the household increases, the percentage of assets represented by the household's principal residence decreases, although there is not a discernible pattern to the percentage of wealth that retirement assets represent."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Americans financially prepare for retirement in a variety of ways: most individuals who work are eligible for Social Security benefits; about half the workforce is covered by an employer-sponsored pension; some save for retirement using Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs); others accumulate non-retirement financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds; and some accumulate non-financial assets, such as homes or other real estate or business ownerships. A persistent concern among policymakers is whether households will have sufficient resources to maintain their pre-retirement standards of living throughout retirement.", "A pension plan is a voluntary benefit that some employers provide to their workers. Employers who offer pension plans for their workers sponsor one or both types: defined benefit (DB) pension plans or defined contribution (DC) pension plans. In DB pensions, participants receive a monthly payment in retirement that is based on a formula that typically uses a combination of length of service, an accrual rate, and an average of final years' salary. In DC plans, of which 401(k) plans are the most common, workers contribute a percentage of their wages to an individually established account. Employers may also contribute a match to the DC plan, which is an additional contribution equal to some or all of the worker's contribution. The account accrues investment returns and is then used as a basis for income in retirement. Individuals may be eligible to make contributions to IRAs if they have earnings from work or by making a rollover contribution from an employer-sponsored pension.", "To encourage American households to save for retirement, Congress has authorized a variety of tax incentives for both employer-sponsored pensions and IRAs. Among the incentives are (1) an income tax deduction for employer contributions to DB pension plans; (2) the deferral of income taxes on employee and employer contributions to employer-sponsored DC retirement accounts; and (3) a tax deduction for some contributions to IRAs. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that in FY2013, the U.S. Treasury will forgo $117.2 billion of income as a result of the exclusion from income of contributions to, and earnings from, pension plans. The only larger tax expenditure in FY2013 is expected to be the exclusion of employer contributions for medical insurance premiums ($131.7 billion). Congress has expressed support for the goal of increasing U.S. household retirement income security. For example, in the 112 th Congress, the Senate passed resolutions supporting the goals of \"National Save for Retirement Week.\" ", "The nature of employer-sponsored pensions has changed over the past 30 years. When the first major pension legislation (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [ERISA; P.L. 93-406 ]) was passed, employer-sponsored pensions were mainly DB plans. Since 1974, fewer and fewer employers have been offering DB pensions, whereas an increasing number of employers offer DC pensions. Because of this shift, an increasing number of households have greater responsibility for their economic well-being in retirement. This trend is set to continue for the foreseeable future, and many households expect to rely on their DC accounts as a source of income in retirement. For example, among non-retirees surveyed by the Gallup in November 2012, 68% indicated that they expected a 401(k), IRA, or other retirement savings account to be a major source of income in retirement. ", "The amounts that Americans have saved for retirement are an important component of evaluating the effectiveness of public policies toward retirement income security and understanding how prepared American households are for retirement. Despite tax incentives to promote saving for retirement, 57% of Americans surveyed by Gallup in January 2013 reported that they were worried about outliving their savings after they retire. Many factors affect the accumulation of financial and non-financial assets by American households. Some of these factors include education; income; the number of children in a household; the amount, if any, of non-measured wealth, such as future Social Security or DB pension benefits; and tax policy as established by Congress.", "Households have a variety of choices about where to put their wealth and may have different reasons for saving. Households that are saving to purchase a home or for their children's education might be less likely to consider putting money into a retirement account. The Congressional Research Service's (CRS's) analysis of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) indicated that 29.1% of all U.S. households indicated that saving for retirement is their most important reason for saving and was the second most important reason for saving for an additional 9.1% of households.", "Although this report examines the amount of wealth (such as financial and retirement assets) that households own, it does not address the adequacy of these assets to provide financial security in retirement.

Net worth is the broadest wealth measure and is calculated as the value of household assets minus the value of household debt. Household assets include financial assets (such as checking accounts, savings accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, defined contribution retirement accounts, IRAs, and the cash value of life insurance) and non-financial assets (such as vehicles, housing and other real estate, and businesses). Retirement assets consist primarily of DC retirement account balances (such as 401(k), 403(b), 457(b) accounts, and the TSP) and IRAs. Household debt includes, among other debts, credit card debt, mortgages, installment loans, and loans from DC retirement accounts. Data in this report are from the 2010 SCF, which is a triennial household survey conducted by the Federal Reserve. The SCF collects information about the amount of regular payments that households receive (for example, from Social Security and defined benefit pensions), but it does not include the value of these payments in household wealth calculations.

Households in which the head is older than 74 years of age owned the lowest percentage of retirement assets of any age group (6.9% of single households and 9.7% of married households). Possible explanations for the low percentage among households in which the head is older than 74 years include (1) these households are most likely to be retired and thus have been drawing down their retirement assets and (2) these households are more likely to have a DB pension plan, which is a source of income in retirement but is not measured by the SCF.

As a result, there are large differences between the average and median values of most financial variables. A few very large observations produce a higher average value for a set of data but do not affect the median value.

For example, an individual who expects to receive DB income of $25,000 per year would face a retirement account limit that would provide an annuity of $180,000 per year ($205,000 - $25,000 = $180,000).", "Under the proposal, each person with a DB pension would have a different maximum DC account limit.

Some households that have retirement assets less than the proposed maximum of $3.4 million and benefits from a DB retirement plan could be affected by the proposed limit on retirement account balances. Households that expect to receive income from a defined benefit pension will face a retirement account balance less than $3.4 million because the receipt of a DB pension will reduce the IRA and DC account amounts needed to fund an annuity of $205,000.
