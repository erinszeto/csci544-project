The L-HHS-ED bill provides funding for all accounts subject to the annual appropriations process at the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Education (ED). It provides annual appropriations for most agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with certain exceptions (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration is funded via the Agriculture bill). The L-HHS-ED bill also provides funding for more than a dozen related agencies, including the Social Security Administration (SSA).", "Enacted Appropriations: On January 17, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76), which provided appropriations for FY2014 (see Division H for L-HHS-ED). This law provided $164 billion in discretionary funding for L-HHS-ED, which is about 4% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level ($157 billion) and about 3% less than the FY2014 President's Budget request ($171 billion). In addition, the FY2014 omnibus provided an estimated $612 billion in mandatory L-HHS-ED funding, for a total of $776 billion for L-HHS-ED as a whole. The FY2014 omnibus followed two government-wide continuing resolutions (CRs), which had provided temporary funding earlier in the fiscal year (P.L. 113-46 and P.L. 113-73). However, no government-wide CR was in place at the beginning of the fiscal year (October 1), resulting in a funding gap and government shutdown for affected projects and activities until the first government-wide CR for FY2014 was enacted on October 17, 2013 (P.L. 113-46).", "Earlier L-HHS-ED Congressional Action: Prior to the start of the fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee initiated action on a full-year FY2014 L-HHS-ED bill. On July 11, 2013, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported this bill (S. 1284, S.Rept. 113-71). As reported, S. 1284 would have provided $171 billion in discretionary L-HHS-ED funding. This amount is about 9% more than the FY2013 post-sequester funding level and about 1% more than the FY2014 President's request. In addition, the Senate committee bill would have provided an estimated $613 billion in mandatory funding, for a combined total of nearly $783 billion for L-HHS-ED as a whole.

Note that the most recently published 302(b) allocations do not reflect the revisions to overall caps established by the BBA. Note also that compliance with the discretionary spending caps is evaluated based on budget authority available in the current fiscal year , adjusted for scorekeeping by the Congressional Budget Office. As such, totals shown in this table may not be comparable to other totals shown in this report.", "Current Year Budget Authority", " Table A-1 displays the total L-HHS-ED current year budget authority for FY2014 discretionary and mandatory appropriations provided or proposed, by title, compared to comparable pre- and post-sequester FY2013 funding levels. The amounts shown in this table reflect total budget authority available for obligation in the fiscal year, regardless of the year in which it was first appropriated. (For a comparable table showing total budget authority in the bill, rather than current year budget authority, see Table 2 in the body of this report.) "], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
