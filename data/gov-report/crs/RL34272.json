Although most GHG reduction regimes address actual emissions, the national target in the United States\u2014as announced by the Bush Administration\u2014aims to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of the national economy. In 2002, the Bush Administration set a voluntary target of reducing the ratio of U.S. GHG emissions to the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 18% by 2012. According to the Administration, meeting this target would reduce intensity beyond that of intensity reductions expected under a business-as-usual scenario.

Critics of the Administration's intensity target have pointed out that (1) the intensity target is more precisely quantified at 17.5%; and (2) more recent data indicate that the U.S. intensity declined by 16.2% between 1990 and 2002. Thus, some observers have described the effect of the intensity target as \"negligible.\"", "Intensity targets are sometimes viewed with skepticism, because the intensity target proponents may imprecisely describe (or overstate) how reductions in emissions intensity would affect actual emission levels. For example, the Administration has stated that meeting the U.S. emissions intensity target would lead to GHG emission reductions. Arguably, such a description can be misleading, because the reductions would occur within the context of increasing U.S. emissions. In other words, U.S. emissions would continue to increase, but if the intensity target is met, the emissions increase would be less than business-as-usual. Moreover, there is some uncertainty as to whether the \"reductions\" will be achieved at all. The Administration's projected reductions are based on GDP forecasts. If the GDP increases at higher than projected rates, absolute emissions can increase beyond business-as-usual scenario, while still meeting the intensity target.", "Although some have questioned the environmental efficacy of intensity targets (i.e., their ability to lower GHGs), the effectiveness of an emissions target depends primarily on its stringency, not whether it applies to emissions intensity or absolute emissions.

A coal-fired power plant emits almost twice as much CO 2 (per unit of energy) as a natural gas-fired facility. Some energy sources\u2014e.g., hydropower, nuclear, wind, or solar\u2014do not directly release any CO 2 emissions. Although the transportation sector contributes a significant percentage of CO 2 emissions in most states (and 33% of U.S. CO 2 emissions in 2003\u2014the second highest sector), this sector utilizes a more homogenous fuel portfolio. In contrast to fuels used to generate electricity, transportation fuels do not demonstrate as much variance in their CO 2 emissions per unit of energy.

Conversely, the five states with the lowest levels generated electricity from a relatively high percentage of zero-emission energy sources in 2003.

States consume fuels (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) to generate electricity, but the electricity may be exported to and used in another state. The method for accounting for these exchanges influences the level of a state's carbon content of energy use. In the above carbon content of energy data ( Table 7 ), if one state uses an energy source (e.g., coal) to generate electricity and then sells the electricity to a consumer in a second state, the CO 2 emissions are attributed to the generating state, but the energy use is attributed to the consuming state.", " Table 9 lists the states in which electricity exports accounted for high percentages of energy use. Likewise, the table lists the states in which imported electricity accounted for high percentages of energy use. The import/export factor is especially prominent for states with high carbon content levels. The top four states for carbon content of energy use in 2003\u2014West Virginia, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana\u2014exported substantial portions of electricity in that year. Of the five states with low carbon content levels, the import/export factor appears most relevant in Idaho, where imported electricity accounted for 41% of its total energy use in 2003.", "Some may argue that this characteristic of the data artificially inflates the carbon content of energy use in exporting states, while artificially lowering the measure in states that import a significant amount of electricity. Consider Wyoming and Idaho, two states at opposite extremes of the carbon contents of energy use range. Two coal-fired power plants located in Wyoming are partially owned by electricity providers that serve customers in Idaho. Idaho customers are receiving some amount of coal-fired electricity from Wyoming (and Oregon and Nevada). This electricity is counted as energy use in Idaho, while the CO 2 emissions are attributed to Wyoming (or Oregon or Nevada).", "From another perspective, the example is less a critique of the carbon content of energy measure, and more a highlight of how electricity generation and use is measured. There is no system in place to physically track electricity upon generation. Therefore, it is impossible to precisely attribute imported electricity to its energy source. Moreover, exported electricity may come from energy sources other than coal. States may export electricity generated from low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as hydropower or nuclear. This factor adds another layer of complexity to the accounting. As the above Wyoming/Idaho example demonstrates, rough approximations might be established based on ownership data, but it may be difficult (if not impossible) to precisely assign the CO 2 emissions from an exporting state to the importing state. Thus, states that appear to be using low-carbon energy sources, may be importing high-carbon energy, in the form of electricity."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Consequences of Differences in State Emissions Drivers in the Context of a Federal Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Program", "paragraphs": ["As noted above, the states have, in some cases, vastly different levels of GHG emissions intensity and related underlying variables. If Congress were to enact a federal GHG emissions reduction program, these differences may lead to a wide range of impacts in the states. The range of impacts would depend on the logistics of the emissions reduction program and the ability of regulated entities to spread compliance costs.", "If Congress creates a mandatory GHG emissions reduction regime, the program would assign (directly or indirectly) a cost to emissions of carbon (or carbon-equivalents in the case of some GHGs). The stringency, scope, and design of the reduction regime would play a large role in determining costs and how the costs are distributed. For instance, Congress could include specific provisions\u2014e.g., a safety-valve or revenue recycling\u2014that would control costs or ease the burden on particular groups.", "Regardless of how Congress might design a GHG reduction program, a mandatory GHG reduction regime would affect states differently. In particular, the states' different energy intensities and carbon content of energy use indicate the states would experience different effects.", "States with relatively high levels of carbon content in their energy use ( Table 7 ) would likely see higher energy prices. These states typically use a high percentage of coal to generate electricity, thus electricity prices would likely increase in these states. The consumers' responses to these price increases would help determine impacts. Consumers may choose to conserve energy use or switch to alternative sources. The carbon price imposed by the emission reduction regime would provide incentives to switch from high-carbon to low-carbon fuel (e.g., from coal to natural gas). However, such a switch may be limited by the technology and infrastructure existing in a state, particularly in the electricity generation sector. Conventional coal-fired power plants in operation today, which account for approximately 50% of all electricity generation, cannot simply switch to another fuel source.", "The producers of coal-fired electricity may be able to pass along the additional carbon costs to consumers, but some state regulations may hinder a company's ability to include the additional costs in electricity prices. Differences in the states' regulatory structures may influence which groups ultimately pay for the additional carbon costs. In states with tighter regulatory control over prices, power companies may bear a relatively higher cost; in other states, consumers of electricity may bear a higher percentage of the costs, where companies are less constrained in passing costs along to customers in the form of higher prices.", "Depending on particular design elements of the emissions reduction program, some of these potential disproportionate effects might be alleviated. For example, if producers are expected to pay a higher percentage of the additional carbon costs, some of the emission allowances might be provided for free. If consumers are anticipated to pay a higher proportionate cost, the allowances could be auctioned. The auction's revenues could be returned to consumers, particularly to low-income households, which would be especially impacted by higher electricity bills.", "As discussed above, a state's import/export ratio of electricity may influence its carbon content of energy use (or fuel mix). This component adds a further layer of complexity when assessing the potential impacts of a carbon price. For example, depending on how emission allowances might be distributed under a federal cap-and-trade system, states that are net energy providers may receive financial gains, at least in the short-term. For instance, if power plants can pass along the mitigation costs (of carbon reduction) in higher electricity prices and receive their emission allowances for free (often referred to as \"grandfathering\") the companies may benefit financially. These potential gains to the likely regulated entities (e.g., coal-fired power plants) have been described as \"windfall profits,\" and have been recently observed in the European Union's Emission Trading System. The gains would be temporary, because under most cap-and-trade proposals, the cap decreases over time; thus, regulated entities would receive fewer allowances as the program progresses.", "If Congress enacts an emissions reduction program, states with high levels of energy intensity are likely to face higher costs than states with low energy intensity levels. As Table 4 shows, the high and low energy intensity levels can differ by a factor of four, which suggests that the impacts between the states at the ends of the spectrum could vary dramatically.", "Energy intensity levels are shaped by multiple factors. Some of these factors may be based on behavior or actions. These factors may be altered through public policy. For example, states could initiate policies or support programs that seek to change the driving behavior (i.e., VMT) of its citizens. Other factors\u2014especially a state's ratio of high and low carbon intensive industries\u2014are more structural, and thus more difficult (if not impractical) to alter through public policy.", "In addition, depending on the degree to which a state's energy intensity is influenced by its climate, a newly-imposed carbon price may have a greater impact. In these states, the demand for energy may be less elastic (i.e., responsive to price changes) than other states, because energy is more critical for daily life necessities, such as home heating. Low-income citizens may face a disproportionate burden, as a share of income, of price increases in states with substantial heating and/or cooling needs.", "States with high energy intensity may have a high percentage of carbon-intensive industries (e.g., manufacturing). These industries would likely see an increase in their operational costs due to the new carbon price, but they may be able to include the additional carbon costs in the price of their products (e.g., paper, cement, steel), thus spreading the costs to consumers in other states. However, passing along the carbon price to consumers may not be financially viable for producers. The ability of producers to pass along the carbon price would be determined by the competitiveness of the market and consumers' willingness to pay higher prices or forego purchases for a particular good. Consumers may seek out product substitutes or lower cost suppliers (which could include foreign producers not subject to a domestic carbon price).", "From another perspective, higher levels in emissions drivers, particularly the energy intensity variable, may suggest a state has comparatively more \"low hanging fruit\" or lower-cost options to meet emission reduction requirements. As noted above, the states with high energy intensities were also ranked poorly by ACEEE's energy efficiency scorecard. Although these states' energy intensity levels are primarily due to economic structure, there may be room for improvement\u2014via \"no regrets\" energy efficiency policies\u2014within the framework of their economic structure.", "Along these lines, states that currently use a substantial percentage of high-carbon fuels for energy purposes (particularly for electricity generation) may have more options in a carbon-constrained regime than states that are already utilizing a high percentage of low-carbon energy sources. For instance, if states in both categories were required to reduce current emissions by a set percentage, states using high-carbon fuels may seek low-carbon fuel substitutes, but states using low-carbon fuels would be limited in this regard. This comparison does not suggest that switching to low-carbon fuels will be easy (or inexpensive), but these states may have more ways to find emission reductions.", "Moreover, low-carbon fuel substitutes may not be distributed evenly across the states. Some states that currently use large proportions of high-carbon energy sources may be in better positions\u2014in terms of natural resource endowments and geography\u2014than other states looking for low-carbon substitutes. For example, there is more wind energy potential in the western and mid-western states than in states in the Southeast.", "The above comparison also highlights the importance of selecting a baseline year for an emission reduction program. If emissions caps are compared to 1990 levels, it would reward states for reductions made during the 1990s. If the reduction program's baseline is 2000, for example, the reductions made before that year would not count, and these states may have more difficulty finding lower-cost options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Greenhouse Gas Intensity Levels in the Context of an Emissions Reduction Program", "paragraphs": ["Several members in the 110 th Congress have introduced proposals that would establish a nation-wide GHG reduction program.
