Enactment of the law was motivated by severe financial panics in the 1790's that resulted in the imprisonment of many debtors. A second act was approved August 19, 1841 and repealed in 1843. Like its predecessor, the act of 1841 arose from a period of economic hardship and was short-lived. A subsequent law, the act of 1867, followed the financial disturbances incident to the Civil War. In effect for more than a decade, it was repealed in 1878. Thus, throughout a period of some 78 years, a national bankruptcy law was operative for only 16. After the repeal of the act of 1867, a period of some 20 years would pass before another bankruptcy act was forthcoming\u2014the act of 1898.", "The act of 1898 followed a depression of several years duration beginning in 1893. Among the reasons cited by Congress in support of a new and permanent bankruptcy law was the increasing availability to the public of an expanding network of federal courts, and increasing national growth of both population and commerce. The 1898 Act was amended at various times but underwent a comprehensive revision and modernization in 1938. These amendments, effected by a law known as the Chandler Act, recast the relief provisions that had been added to the 1898 Act, established wage earner plans, and substituted or replaced provisions dealing with real property arrangements and corporate reorganizations. Changes in the act subsequent to the 1938 amendments were relatively slight.", "Eventually, Congress perceived a need to modernize the bankruptcy laws, and, in 1970, it created a Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States to study and recommend changes in the law. The Commission became operational in June, 1971, and filed its final report with the Congress on July 30, 1973.", "Among the reasons expressed by Congress for enactment of a new and modernized Bankruptcy Code was that the substantive law of bankruptcy embodied in the act of 1898 reflected \"the horse and buggy\" era of consumer and commercial credit; that the widespread adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code in the early 1960's changed and expanded commercial financing; that bankruptcy relief for the consumer debtor was inadequate; and, that the bankruptcy court system was too frequently an inefficient and unfair forum.", "Hence, the stage was set for a national debate on the bankruptcy laws. In 1978, Congress repealed the act of 1898 in its entirety and enacted the present Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.", "Since the Code's enactment in 1978, it has undergone several major amendments. The Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 cured constitutional deficiencies in the bankruptcy court system and made a wide variety of substantive and technical amendments to the Code. The Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 instituted a nation-wide U.S. Trustee system and added a new operative chapter governing reorganizations of \"family farmers.\" In 1988, Congress enacted several substantive amendments to the Code, including the Retiree Benefits Bankruptcy Protection Act, which added a new section governing the rights of retirees of a corporation undergoing a chapter 11 reorganization.", "During the 101 st Congress, more amendments were enacted. In addition to technical amendments affecting swap agreements and forward contracts, legislation was passed altering the dischargeability under chapters 7 and 13, respectively, for debts for liability incurred while driving while intoxicated, criminal restitution, and student loans. The Comprehensive Thrift and Bank Fraud Prosecution and Taxpayer Recovery Act of 1990 made many amendments designed to strengthen criminal prosecution of and recovery from crimes against banks.", "The most recent congressional enactment making wide-reaching substantive and procedural amendments to the Code took place pursuant to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994. Among its highlights was the creation of a National Bankruptcy Review Commission, patterned after the 1970 Commission, to study and report within two years recommendations for legislative or administrative action to the President, the Congress, and the Supreme Court. The Commission issued its report on October 20, 1997. In a lengthy report of approximately 1300 pages, the Commission adopted as many as 172 recommendations dealing with, inter alia, consumer bankruptcy, business bankruptcy, municipal bankruptcy, and, bankruptcy jurisdiction, procedure, and administration. On the subject of consumer bankruptcy reform, the Commission could not reach consensus. Recommendations were adopted by a 5-4 split vote, which undermined the persuasive value and influence on the Congress of the Commission's report.", "Important procedural reform effected by the 1994 Act included express authorization for bankruptcy courts to conduct jury trials with the consent of parties thereto. The act also encouraged nation-wide creation of Bankruptcy Appellate Panels as intermediary, specialized review tribunals positioned between U.S. district court and the circuit courts of appeals. This law also incorporated sanctions into the Code for negligent or fraudulent bankruptcy petition preparers and amends federal criminal law to establish additional penalties for bankruptcy fraud.", "The 105 th Congress considered, but did not enact, major bankruptcy reform legislation. Several provisions were enacted, however, including the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act, permitting debtors to make substantial charitable donations prior to filing and during the course of a chapter 13 reorganization. Other provisions narrowed the dischargeability of student loans, and effected amendments to the automatic stay. During the 106 th and 107 th Congresses, bankruptcy reform legislation, including provisions to effect major changes to consumer bankruptcy, continued to be debated.
