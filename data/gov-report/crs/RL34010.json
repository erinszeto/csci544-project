Several types of domestic subsidies were identified as causing minimal distortion to agricultural production and trade, as identified in Annex II (the so-called Green Box) of the AA, and were provided exemption from WTO disciplines. Potential \"Green Box\" policies include outlays for conservation activities such as the Conservation Security Program and long-term land retirement programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program. Yet, certain aspects of both programs potentially are ambiguous or fall into \"gray\" zones concerning their compliance with WTO rules. This report is not a legal opinion, but describes both the CSP and CRP programs, the WTO Annex II provisions that govern compliance, and the potential issues involved in evaluating the compliance status of the two programs.", "The Conservation Security Program (CSP) makes payments to participating landowners who advance conservation and improvement of natural resources on tribal and private working lands. Payments are determined by the level (or tier) of participation, conservation activities completed, and acres enrolled. In FY2006, USDA spent $259 million supporting 19,375 CSP contracts covering 15.8 million acres. Federal outlays for CSP activities have yet to be notified to the WTO; however, it is likely that CSP payments will be notified as Green Box-compliant environmental program payments under paragraph 12 of Annex II. Inclusion under paragraph 12 hinges on the payments being limited to the cost of expenses incurred or income forgone in implementing conservation practices. CSP cost-share payments fit this requirement. However, other CSP payments either made in excess of costs incurred or income forgone, or made in the nature of bonus or incentive payments to induce participation, are more difficult to classify.", "The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) compensates producers for removing environmentally sensitive, privately owned land from production for 10 years or more to conserve soil and water resources. The CRP is the federal government's largest conservation and private land retirement program. In FY2006, CRP outlays totaled $1.8 billion and covered almost 37 million enrolled acres. CRP payments for the period 1996 through 2001 have been notified to the WTO as Green Box-compliant long-term resource retirement payments under paragraph 10 of Annex II. Inclusion under paragraph 10 hinges on the payments being used to retire land from marketable agricultural production for at least three years. Use of CRP land for agricultural production (e.g., cutting hay, grazing, or biomass production) potentially could disqualify the land from Green Box eligibility for that particular year; and potentially for all years of a long-term retirement contract if the productive activity is engaged in more frequently than once every four years. A potential alternative would be to reclassify the productive use of CRP land as a type of environmental program where payments would be subject to the criteria discussed under the CSP program.

CSP is administered by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Unlike the Conservation Reserve Program and some other NRCS programs, CSP provides payments for conservation on land that remains in production. NRCS implements CSP on a watershed basis in order to focus funding on high-priority areas that offer the greatest environmental impact per dollar spent. In FY2006, USDA spent $259 million supporting 19,375 new and existing CSP contracts (4,400 new CSP contracts were added in FY2006) covering 15.8 million acres (an average outlay of about $16.40 per acre).", "Based on a review (done with technical support from NRCS) of a producer's environmental resources and current conservation practices, each participating producer prepares a CSP contract including a stewardship plan that details the conservation activities that exist and/or are to be implemented. Contracts extend from 5 to 10 years. By statute (Section 2001 of the 2002 farm bill, P.L. 107-171 ), CSP participants qualify for one of three levels (or tiers) of participation, with each successive tier obligating the producer to meet a higher degree of resource management standards. Depending on the stewardship plan described in a CSP contract, participating producers may be eligible for four types of payments\u2014stewardship or base payments; cost-share payments on existing practices; one-time new practice cost-share payments; and enhanced payments. These are defined as follows."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stewardship or \"Base\" Payment", "paragraphs": ["This is a payment tied to the number of acres enrolled in CSP.

However, in practice, USDA has restricted payments to a substantially smaller share of implementation costs in an attempt to facilitate their calculation and minimize producer paperwork.

USDA has announced that it has no funding for new contracts in FY2007. As a result, CSP outlays in FY2007 will be limited to support for existing contracts and will likely be about the same as in FY2006. Most CSP spending is for cost-share payments.

If, however, CSP payments are made in the form of bonus or incentive payments that exceed the costs incurred or income forgone of implementing a particular conservation activity, then the \"Green Box\" compliance status of such payments could be called into question. Based on the way CSP payments are made, it appears that:", "cost-share payments fit \"cleanly\" into the paragraph 12(b) criteria of reimbursing for the extra costs or loss of income involved in complying with the CSP program; stewardship payments appear (at first glance) to have a \"bonus or incentive\" aspect in that they are simply based on participation (i.e., the number of acres enrolled and the level of participation by tier), thus making them questionable for the Green Box as environmental cost-share payments; and enhancement payments also fall into more of a gray zone in that they are described as sort of a \"bonus\" for exceeding contract practices, while it is unclear if they are limited in value to the often-difficult-to-measure added cost of implementing a higher level of environmental practice than otherwise called for in the contract.", "However, two considerations are noteworthy. First, the combined effect of the both the tier and reduction factors as applied to the stewardship payments is to reduce them to a minor share of the 2001 average rental rate used\u20141.25% for Tier I; 5% for Tier II; and 11.25% for Tier III. Since cost-share payments are limited to 75% of the practice cost (in actuality a much lower share is applied, as mentioned earlier), it appears unlikely that the combined value of the payments exceeds 100% of the WTO permissible cost-share value. Second, even the \"bonus-like\" nature of stewardship and enhancement payments could still be classified as Green Box eligible direct payments (rather than environmental payments) under the terms of paragraph 5 of Annex II, which allows for existing or new types of direct payments to be Green Box-eligible (i.e., to be exempt from amber box limits), provided they conform to criteria (b) through (e) in paragraph 6 in addition to the general criteria set out in paragraph 1, all of which are reprinted below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WTO, Agreement on Agriculture, Annex II, Paragraphs 1, 5, and 6", "paragraphs": ["Since stewardship payments are linked to the number of acres enrolled in the CSP, they would appear, at first glance, to violate paragraph 6(d)\u2014which states that payments may not be based on or related to a factor of production, such as land, currently in use. However, stewardship payments are essentially fixed at sign-up since both enrolled area and payment rate do not vary during the life of the contract\u2014enrollment in a CSP contract is derived from production activities on previously farmed acres, and thus a base for participation is established (and fixed) at sign-up, while the payment rate is based on average 2001 land rental rates. As a result, stewardship payments could arguably be described as direct payments that fit paragraph 6(b)-(e).", "Various policy analysts from both the European Union and United States have argued the merits of bonus-type conservation payments, suggesting that some incentive payment should be made WTO-legal since conservation activities have bona fide public good aspects and only minimally (if at all) distort trade, and without such bonus payments participation in conservation activities may be low. The WTO's Framework Agreement of August 2004 called for Doha Round negotiations to \"review and clarify\" the existing Green Box criteria. However, little discussion of Green Box criteria has taken place during the current Doha Round of WTO trade negotiations, and none of the Doha Round proposals includes any such provision to permit conservation bonus-type payments. It is unlikely that the Green Box will play a major part in a final Doha Round agreement should ongoing negotiations reach a successful conclusion.", "The vulnerability to WTO challenge of such ambiguous bonus-type payments is probably highly correlated with the value of subsidy outlays. USDA programs in general tend to attract more attention and are subject to more international scrutiny when subsidy payments are large and arguably market-distorting. By traditional U.S. commodity program standards, CSP funding has been relatively small. During FY2000-FY2006, USDA's Commodity Credit Corporation net outlays for total farm support programs (including commodity and conservation progams) averaged nearly $20 billion per year. In comparison, CSP funding during FY2003-FY2006 totaled $505.4 million. Furthermore, because CSP payments are explicitly targeted to conservation practices, they are fairly benign in terms of their market effects; that is, they likely are minimally trade-distorting if at all. However, if CSP funding levels were to expand greatly to several billion dollars per year they could attract greater critical scrutiny. In its March 2007 baseline projections of USDA outlays, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected CSP program outlays to increase steadily from $259 million in FY2006 to $769 million by FY2013.", "The Administration's farm bill proposal (released January 31, 2007) attempts to remove the payment ambiguity from the CSP program and make it fully WTO-compatible. USDA points out that some of the CSP payments, as currently structured, may be considered trade-distorting under WTO guidelines. To specifically address the WTO status issue, the Administration proposes removing the stewardship and cost-share payments, and replacing them with a single \"enhancement payment,\" but basing the calculation of these enhancement payments \"on factors such as income forgone by the producer and costs incurred by the producer to implement the ... conservation practices\" as stated in its proposed legislative language:", "\" (1) CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS.-", "\" (A) IN GENERAL.-The amount of a payment a producer would receive for performing either the progressive tier or master tier level of conservation practices shall be determined by the Secretary through rulemaking.", "\" (B) COSTS OF PRACTICES.-The Secretary shall establish the criteria for determining payment amounts under subparagraph (A) based on factors such as income forgone by the producer and costs incurred by the producer to implement the progressive tier or master tier level of conservation practices. \""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) Land Use Issues", "paragraphs": ["The Conservation Reserve Program, enacted in 1985, provides payments to farmers to take highly erodible or environmentally sensitive cropland out of production for ten years or more to conserve soil and water resources.
