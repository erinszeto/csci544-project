Disposition is an important asset management function because the costs of maintaining unneeded properties can be substantial. Moreover, properties the government no longer needs may be used by state or local governments, nonprofits, or businesses to provide benefits to the public. Finally, the government loses potential revenue when it holds onto certain unneeded properties that might be sold for a profit.", "Despite these drawbacks, federal agencies hold thousands of unneeded and underutilized properties. Agencies have argued that they are unable to dispose of these properties for several reasons. First, there are statutorily prescribed steps in the disposal process that can take months to complete. Second, properties may not be appealing to potential buyers or lessees if they require major repairs or environmental remediation\u2014steps for which agencies lack funding to complete before bringing a property to market. Third, key stakeholders in the disposal process\u2014including local governments, nonprofit organizations, and businesses\u2014are often at odds over how to dispose of properties.", "In addition, Congress may be limited in its capacity to conduct oversight of the disposal process because it currently lacks access to reliable, comprehensive real property data. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains a database with information on most federal buildings, but those data are provided to Congress on a limited basis. Moreover, the quality of the information in the database has been questioned, in part because of inconsistent reporting of key data elements, such as how much space within a given building is unneeded. The lack of data may also hinder congressional oversight on the extent to which agencies enter into leases rather than purchase space. Leasing space is typically more expensive than owning, and the government's \"overreliance on costly leased space\" is one of the primary reasons federal real property is designated as a \"high risk\" issue by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).", "The Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (P.L. 114-287) established a new, centralized process for disposing of unneeded space. Under FASTA, agencies are required to develop a list of disposal recommendations, which could include the sale, transfer, conveyance, consolidation, or outlease of any unneeded space, among other options. These recommendations are then to be submitted to the GSA Administrator and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and revision. The revised list of recommendations is then vetted by a newly established Public Buildings Reform Board, and returned to the OMB Director for final approval or disapproval.", "FASTA may address some of the obstacles agencies face when disposing of unneeded space. Properties on the recommendation list are exempt from certain statutory requirements, such as screening for public benefit, and FASTA provides funding for agencies to implement the board's recommendations. The use of a board to make disposal decisions may also reduce the impact of stakeholder conflict. In addition, FASTA requires GSA to create a public database with information that may enhance congressional oversight.", "There may be drawbacks to FASTA. The law does not provide Congress with an opportunity to vote for or against the list of recommendations, nor is Congress directly involved in the creation of the list. It is possible that philosophical differences between the board and the OMB Director could lead to an impasse that would effectively shut down the FASTA disposal process. The required database may not include some information that could be useful to Congress, such as the repair needs and condition of each building."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government holds a large and diverse real property portfolio that includes more than 2.8 billion square feet of building space, 496,000 structures, and 42 million acres of land. These assets have been acquired over a period of decades to help agencies fulfill their diverse missions. Agencies own and lease buildings, for example, that provide space for offices, health clinics, warehouses, and laboratories. As agencies' missions change over time, so, too, do their real property needs, thereby rendering some assets less useful or unneeded altogether. Health care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), for example, has shifted in recent decades from predominately hospital-based inpatient care to a greater reliance on clinics and outpatient care, with a resulting change in space needs. Similarly, the Department of Defense (DOD) reduced its force since the Cold War ended and has engaged in several rounds of base realignments and installation closures.", "As a consequence of shifting space needs, federal agencies hold thousands of properties\u2014particularly buildings\u2014that they no longer need. In FY2016, federal agencies owned 3,120 buildings that were vacant (unutilized), and another 7,859 that were partially empty (underutilized). Agencies are required to dispose of unneeded space and have a range of options for disposal, including transfer to another federal agency, demolition, sale, and conveyance to a state or local government or qualified nonprofit. Federal agencies have indicated, however, that their disposal efforts are often hampered by legal and budgetary disincentives, and competing stakeholder interests. The inability of agencies to dispose of unneeded space in a timely manner is one of the primary reasons the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has included real property management on its high-risk list since 2003.

Agencies must first offer to transfer properties they do not need (excess properties) to other federal agencies, who generally pay market value for excess properties they wish to acquire. Unneeded properties that are not acquired by federal agencies (surplus properties) must then be offered to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for use in accomplishing public purposes specified in statute, such as creating public parks or providing services to the homeless. Agencies may convey surplus properties to state and local governments, and qualified nonprofits, for public benefit at less than fair market value\u2014even at no cost. Surplus properties not conveyed for public benefit are then available for sale at fair market value or are demolished (or, in some cases abandoned) if the property could not be sold due to the condition or location of the property.", "Agencies have argued that these statutory requirements slow down the disposition process, compelling agencies to incur operating costs while the properties are being screened. For example, real property officials have said the McKinney-Vento Act ( P.L. 100-77 )\u2014which mandates that all surplus property be screened for homeless use\u2014can extend the time it takes to dispose of certain properties by months or years. Because public benefit conveyance requirements are set in law, agencies do not have the authority to skip screening, even for surplus properties that could not be conveyed anyway. Real property experts with the Army, for example, told auditors they had properties they believed could be disposed of only by demolition, due to their condition or location, but that still had to be screened, thereby adding as much as six months to the disposal process and forcing the Army to pay maintenance costs that could have been avoided.", "Statutes pertaining to environmental remediation or historic preservation also add time to the process. It may take agencies years of study to assess the potential environmental consequences of a proposed disposal and to develop and implement an abatement plan, as required by law. Similarly, the National Historic Preservation Act requires agencies to plan their disposal actions so as to minimize the harm they cause to historic properties, which may include additional procedures, such as consulting with historic preservation groups at the state, local, and federal levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disposal Costs", "paragraphs": ["Unneeded buildings are often among the older properties in an agency's portfolio. As a consequence, agencies sometimes find expensive repairs and renovations may be needed before the properties are fully functional, meet health and safety standards, and comply with historic preservation requirements. The poor condition of these properties may deter potential buyers or lessees, particularly if they must cover the cost of required improvements as a condition of acquiring the properties. Similarly, agencies that wish to demolish vacant buildings face deconstruction and cleanup costs that, at times, exceed the cost of maintaining the property\u2014at least in the short run\u2014which may encourage real property managers to retain a property rather than dispose of it. Federal agencies frequently cite the cost of complying with environmental regulations as a major disincentive to disposal.

The Department of the Interior (DOI) has said that the competing concerns of local and state governments, historic preservation offices, and political factors can stymie the disposal of some of its unneeded real property. Similarly, the VA has found that communities sometimes oppose disposals that would result in new development, and veterans groups have opposed disposing of building space if that space would be used for purposes unrelated to the needs of veterans. These conflicts can result in delay, or even cancellation of proposed disposals, which, in turn, prevent agencies from reducing their inventories of unneeded properties.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Availability and Quality of Real Property Data25", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) is the government's most comprehensive source of information about real property under the control of executive branch agencies. GSA manages the FRPP and collects real property data from 24 of the largest landholding agencies each year. Other agencies are encouraged, but not required, to report data to GSA. The data elements that participating agencies collect and report are determined by the Federal Real Property Council (FRPC), an interagency taskforce that is funded and chaired by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The other members of the FRPC are agency senior real property officers (SRPOs) and GSA.", "The FRPP contains data that could enhance congressional oversight of federal real property activities, such as the number of excess and surplus properties held by major landholding agencies and the annual costs of maintaining those properties. Historically, GSA has not permitted direct access to the FRPP by Congress on the grounds that the data are proprietary. GSA does respond to some requests for real property data from congressional offices, but GSA staff query the database and provide the results to the requestor.", "Some FRPP data are made public through an annual summary report posted on GSA's website, but the summary reports may be of limited use for congressional oversight. Most of the data are highly aggregated and limited information is provided on an agency-by-agency basis. Certain data, such as building utilization rates at each agency, or the number of excess and surplus properties each agency holds, are not available to Congress or the public. This can limit the ability of Congress to compare the performance of agencies, which in turn can limit its ability to identify the policies and practices used by the most successful agencies and hold poorly performing agencies accountable. ", "The quality of the FRPP data has also been questioned. GAO audits have found, for example, that real property data were unreliable in key areas, such as annual operating costs, and often were not reported correctly by agencies. Another GAO report reexamined weaknesses in FRPP data collection practices, noting that key data elements\u2014such as buildings' maintenance needs and utilization rates\u2014are not consistently and accurately captured in the database. The GAO report concluded that problems with FRPP data collection result in agencies \"making real property decisions using unreliable data.\"", "Data quality problems may result from changing definitions. The FRPC stopped reporting data on underutilized and not utilized buildings in its FY2011 real property report. It began reporting the data again in FY2013, but with different definitions than those used in FY2010. The old definitions were based on the amount of space occupied in a building, while the new definitions are based on the frequency with which space was in use. Under the new definitions, the FRPC reported 5,532 underutilized and not utilized buildings in FY2013, down from 77,700 in FY2010\u2014a 93% decrease in three years. By FY2014, the number of underutilized and not utilized buildings reported decreased to 4,971, a 94% decline from FY2010. Inconsistencies like this have led GAO to conclude that the FRPC's data on underutilized and not utilized federal real property are not reliable.", "The annual summary reports also omit data that might enhance congressional oversight. The FRPP contains, for example, the number of excess and surplus properties held by each agency and the annual operating costs of those properties\u2014issues about which Congress has expressed ongoing interest. The summary report, however, only provides the number and annual operating costs of disposed assets, thereby providing the \"good news\" of future costs avoided through disposition while omitting the \"bad news\" of the ongoing operating costs associated with excess and surplus properties the government maintains.

The percentage of square feet leased by GSA\u2014which leases property for itself and on behalf of many agencies\u2014is nearly equal to the percentage of square feet it owns. According to GAO, leasing space is typically more expensive than owning space over the same time period. GAO cited, for example, a long-term operating lease that cost an estimated $40.3 million more than if the agency had purchased the same building. ", "The decision to lease rather than purchase space may be driven by operational requirements\u2014such as the United States Postal Service (USPS) leasing space in areas that it believes will optimize the efficiency of mail delivery. Agencies often choose to lease rather than purchase space because of budget scoring rules, even if the decision to lease is not the most cost-effective long-term option. Under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, an agency must have budget authority up-front for the government's total legal commitment before acquiring space. Thus, if an agency were to construct or purchase a building, it would need up-front funding for the entire cost of the construction or acquisition, but leased space only requires the annual lease payment plus the cost of terminating the lease agreement.", "In addition to the budget scoring issue, some agencies have been granted independent leasing authority, which means they do not have to work with GSA to acquire leased space. Some agencies with independent leasing authority, such as the USPS and VA, have established in-house real property expertise, while other agencies with independent authority have not. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for example, entered into a $557 million, 10-year lease for 900,000 square feet, which the SEC's inspector general (IG) called \"another in a long history of missteps and misguided leasing decisions made by the SEC since it was granted independent leasing authority.\" The IG found that \"inexperienced senior management\" at the SEC made poor decisions that led to acquiring three times the amount of space needed\u2014the original estimate provided to Congress was for 300,000 square feet\u2014and bypassing other locations that were closer and less expensive."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act (FASTA)", "paragraphs": ["Real property disposition historically has been a relatively decentralized process.

As discussed earlier in this report, one of the primary reasons GAO has listed federal real property management as a high-risk area since 2003 is that the government increasingly acquires space through leases rather than by constructing or purchasing buildings. The prospectus approval process provides Congress with an opportunity to exercise oversight of GSA's lease decisions. Prior to seeking appropriations, GSA is required to obtain congressional authorization for constructing, purchasing, leasing, or renovating real property when the estimated cost of the project exceeds a given threshold. To that end, GSA submits a prospectus to two committees\u2014the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure\u2014for each proposal that exceeds the threshold. The prospectus provides detailed information about the project, including its location and estimated cost. By law, a project that exceeds the threshold may not receive appropriations unless both committees pass resolutions approving of the prospectus. ", "Given the size of its portfolio, and its role as the procurer of space for numerous other agencies, congressional oversight of GSA's prospectus-level lease proposals has broad implications. The usefulness of the prospectus approval process as an oversight tool, however, may be limited by the fact that GSA is not required to present data that directly compare the cost of leasing with the cost of owning space. This means that Congress may be unable to determine whether it is being asked to approve the most cost-effective option for meeting an agency's real property needs.", "One option for potentially improving oversight of GSA leases would be to mandate that GSA include comparative cost data in its prospectuses. This would not be a completely new step for GSA to take: in the 1980s and throughout the early part of the 1990s, GSA's lease prospectuses included a comparison of the costs of leasing space to constructing or buying it. GSA discontinued reporting comparative cost data in the mid-1990s, it said, because funding for construction and purchase alternatives was so limited that they were not considered realistic alternatives.
