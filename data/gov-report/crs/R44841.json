According to Freedom House, Venezuela has fallen from \"partly free\" under Ch\u00e1vez to \"not free\" under Maduro, an unpopular leader who has violently quashed dissent and illegally replaced the legislature with a National Constituent Assembly (ANC) elected under controversial circumstances in July 2017.

Ch\u00e1vez's commanding victory illustrated Venezuelans' rejection of the country's two traditional parties, Democratic Action (AD) and the Social Christian party (COPEI), which had dominated Venezuelan politics for the previous 40 years. Most observers attribute Ch\u00e1vez's rise to power to popular disillusionment with politicians whom they then judged to have squandered the country's oil wealth through poor management and corruption. Chavez's campaign promised constitutional reform; he asserted that the system in place allowed a small elite class to dominate Congress and waste revenues from the state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela , S. A. (PdVSA).", "Venezuela had one of the most stable political systems in Latin America from 1958 until 1989. After that period, however, numerous economic and political challenges plagued the country. In 1989, then-President Carlos Andres P\u00e9rez (AD) initiated an austerity program that fueled riots in which several hundred people were killed. In 1992, two attempted military coups threatened the P\u00e9rez presidency, one led by Ch\u00e1vez, who at the time was a lieutenant colonel railing against corruption and poverty. Ch\u00e1vez served two years in prison for that failed coup attempt. In May 1993, the legislature dismissed P\u00e9rez from office for misusing public funds. The election of former President Rafael Caldera (1969-1974) as president in December 1993 brought a measure of political stability, but the government faced a severe banking crisis. A rapid decline in the price of oil caused a recession beginning in 1998, which contributed to Ch\u00e1vez's landslide election. ", "Under Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela adopted a new constitution (ratified by a plebiscite in 1999), a new unicameral legislature, and even a new name for the country\u2014the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, named after the 19 th century South American liberator Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. Buoyed by windfall profits from increases in the price of oil, the Ch\u00e1vez government expanded the state's role in the economy by asserting majority state control over foreign investments in the oil sector and nationalizing numerous private enterprises. Ch\u00e1vez's charisma, use of oil revenue to fund domestic social programs and provide subsidized oil to Cuba and other Central American and Caribbean countries, and willingness to oppose the United States captured global attention. ", "After Ch\u00e1vez's death, his legacy has been debated. President Ch\u00e1vez established an array of social programs and services known as missions that helped reduce poverty by some 20% and improve literacy and access to health care. Some maintain that Ch\u00e1vez also empowered the poor by involving them in community councils and workers' cooperatives. Nevertheless, his presidency was \"characterized by a dramatic concentration of power and open disregard for basic human rights guarantees,\" especially after his brief ouster from power in 2002. Declining oil production, combined with massive debt and high inflation, have shown the costs involved in Ch\u00e1vez's failure to save or invest past oil profits, tendency to take on debt and print money, and decision to fire thousands of PdVSA technocrats after an oil workers' strike in 2002-2003. ", "Venezuela's 1999 constitution, amended in 2009, centralized power in the presidency and established five branches of government rather than the traditional three branches. Those branches include the presidency, a unicameral National Assembly, a Supreme Court, a National Electoral Council (CNE), and a \"Citizen Power\" branch (three entities that ensure that government officials at all levels adhere to the rule of law and that can investigate administrative corruption). The president is elected for six-year terms and can be reelected indefinitely; however, he or she also may be made subject to a recall referendum (a process that Ch\u00e1vez submitted to in 2004 and survived but Maduro cancelled in 2016). Throughout his presidency, Ch\u00e1vez exerted influence over all the government branches, particularly after an outgoing legislature dominated by chavistas appointed pro-Ch\u00e1vez justices to dominate the Supreme Court in 2004 (a move that Maduro's allies would repeat in 2015). ", "In addition to voters having the power to remove a president through a recall referendum process, the National Assembly has the constitutional authority to act as a check on presidential power, even when the courts fail to do so. The National Assembly consists of a unicameral Chamber of Deputies with 167 seats whose members serve for five years and may be reelected once. With a simple majority, the legislature can approve or reject the budget and the issuing of debt, remove ministers and the vice president from office, overturn enabling laws that give the president decree powers, and appoint the 5 members of the CNE (for 7-year terms) and the 32 members of the Supreme Court (for one 12-year term).

After domestic protests, a rebuke by then-Attorney General Luisa Ortega (a Ch\u00e1vez appointee), and an outcry from the international community, President Maduro urged the court to revise those rulings, and it complied.

The opposition boycotted, arguing that the elections were unconstitutional; a position shared by then-Attorney General Luisa Ortega and international observers (including the United States, Canada, the EU, and many Latin American countries). In an unofficial plebiscite convened on July 16 by the MUD, 98% of some 7.6\u00a0million Venezuelans cast votes rejecting the creation of a constituent assembly; the government ignored that vote.", "Despite an opposition boycott and protests, the government orchestrated the July 30, 2017, election of a 545-member National Constituent Assembly (ANC) to draft a new constitution.

President Ch\u00e1vez used the oil windfall to spend heavily on social programs and expand subsidies for food and energy, and government debt more than doubled as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) between 2000 and 2012. Ch\u00e1vez also used oil to expand influence abroad through PetroC aribe , a program that allowed Caribbean Basin countries to purchase oil at below-market prices.", "Although substantial government outlays on social programs helped Ch\u00e1vez curry political favor and reduce poverty, economic mismanagement had long-term consequences. Ch\u00e1vez moved the economy in a less market-oriented direction, with widespread expropriations and nationalizations, as well as currency and price controls. These policies discouraged foreign investment and created market distortions. Government spending was not directed toward investment to increase economic productivity or diversify the economy from its reliance on oil. Corruption proliferated.", "When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro took office in 2013, he inherited economic policies reliant on proceeds from oil exports. When oil prices crashed by nearly 50% in 2014, the Maduro government was ill-equipped to soften the blow. The fall in oil prices strained public finances. Instead of adjusting fiscal policies through tax increases and spending cuts, the Maduro government tried to address its growing budget deficit by printing money, which led to inflation. The government also tried to curb inflation through price controls, although these controls were largely ineffective in restricting prices, as supplies dried up and transactions moved to the black market. ", "Meanwhile, the government continued to face a substantial debt burden, with debt owed to private bondholders, China, Russia, multilateral lenders, importers, and service companies in the oil industry. Initially, the government tried to service its debt, fearing legal challenges from bondholders. To service its debt, it cut imports, including of food and medicine, among other measures. In August 2018, the Trump Administration imposed sanctions restricting Venezuela's ability to access U.S. financial markets, which exacerbated the government's fiscal situation.

In U.S. dollars, Venezuela's GDP has fallen from $331 billion in 2012 to $96 billion in 2018. Hyperinflation is rampant, creating shortages of critical supplies. The government has rapidly expanded the money supply to finance budget deficits, which has led to one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in history, comparable to Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000s.

Hyperinflation, as well as low foreign exchange reserves, which make it difficult for Venezuela to import goods and services, has created shortages of critical supplies (including food and medicine), leading to a humanitarian disaster and fueling massive migration (see \" Humanitarian Situation ,\" below). The government remains in default and continues to run unsustainable fiscal policies. Despite pledges to restructure the country's debt, the government has made no discernable progress in negotiations with private creditors and the country remains in default. According to one estimate, the government and state-owned companies owe nearly $8 billion in unpaid interest and principal.

Instead, the government has largely blamed the country's struggles on a foreign \"economic war,\" a thinly veiled reference to U.S. sanctions. In February 2018, as a way to raise new funds, the cash-strapped government launched a new digital currency, the \"petro,\" backed by oil and other commodities, which runs on blockchain technology. The government claims the petro raised $3.3 billion, but the amount raised has never been confirmed by an independent audit. Additionally, there are questions about the petro's operational viability: there are few signs of the petro being circulated within Venezuela or sold on any major cryptocurrency exchange.

Production has been challenged by aging infrastructure, bottlenecks created by PdVSA's inability to pay service companies and producers, and shortages of inputs (such as light crudes for blending) used to process its heavy crude oil. Massive debt (estimated at some $25 billion), combined with U.S. sanctions limiting the willingness of banks to issue credit to PdVSA and the fact that much of its production does not generate revenue, have added to the company's woes.

Venezuela reached an agreement with Crystallex to make a payment installment towards the $1.4 billion settlement in November 2018.

Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo have condemned Maduro's term as illegitimate, recognized the National Assembly as the only legitimate institution in the country, and lent support to Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the National Assembly.

Congress is likely to continue to fund and oversee foreign assistance for democracy and human rights programs to bolster civil society in Venezuela as well as humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans in neighboring countries. Congress could consider a measure to authorize U.S. humanitarian assistance as well. Other measures may be introduced to adjust the immigration status of Venezuelans living in the United States or to provide certain Venezuelans temporary protected immigration status. Congress may consider taking additional steps to try to influence the Venezuelan government's behavior in promoting a return to democracy through additional sanctions or other policies. Oversight issues may examine the role of external actors operating in Venezuela (such as Russia and China) and the impact of the crisis in Venezuela on the broader region.
