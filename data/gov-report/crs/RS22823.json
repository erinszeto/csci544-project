{"id": "RS22823", "title": "Overview of Labor Enforcement Issues in Free Trade Agreements", "released_date": "2016-02-22T00:00:00", "summary": ["Since 1993, the Administration has negotiated and Congress has approved 13 free trade agreements (FTAs) with labor provisions, and is considering additional FTAs. Based on similarity of language, these FTAs can be sorted into four groups, or \"models,\" which have evolved to contain successively greater levels of enforceability. This report first identifies the enforceable labor provisions in each model. Second, it identifies two types of labor enforcement issues: (1) those that relate to the FTA provisions themselves, including their definitions and their enforceability, and (2) those that relate to executive branch responsibilities, such as resource availability and determining dispute settlement case priorities. This report does not address other labor issues in the various free trade agreements, including cooperative consultation and capacity-building provisions."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The inclusion of enforceable labor provisions\u2014that is, those subject to dispute resolution procedures\u2014in various trade agreement authorities and related reciprocal trade agreements has evolved over time. At first, U.S. trade policy focused on lowering tariffs on goods. It was later extended to various types of nontariff barriers.", "Labor principles and standards are not subject to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and disciplines. The International Labor Organization (ILO), an arm of the United Nations founded in 1919, is the multilateral organization with responsibility for labor issues. For nearly 90 years, the ILO has been working to create, through adoption at its annual International Labor Conferences of Member countries, Conventions , which set international standards.", "The ILO has adopted at least 183 Conventions, eight of which define four \"core labor\" principles. This occurred when first, a U.N. Social Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1995 declared that four categories of principles and rights at work are fundamental: (1) freedom of association and collective bargaining; (2) the elimination of forced labor; (3) the elimination of child labor; and (4) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The ILO then responded by pulling these together as the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-Up . The Declaration commits all ILO Member States, whether or not they have ratified the specific conventions, to respect the labor principles in these four key areas. The Follow-Up , among other things, calls for reports by developing countries that have not ratified one or more of the core Conventions, on the status of their implementation of the various rights.", "The United States had unilaterally promoted the development of \"internationally recognized worker rights,\" principles similar to those in the ILO Declaration, through its trade preference laws for developing countries. These trade preference laws cover five main programs: the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), 1975; the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), 1983; the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), 1991; the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), 2000; and the Haiti Opportunity through Partnership Act (HOPE), 2006. These laws all require that as a condition of obtaining and maintaining program eligibility, beneficiary countries must take steps to afford their workers \" internationally recognized worker rights .\" These rights are listed in Trade Act of 1974, as amended (Section 507), as similar to ILO core labor principles listed above, except the U.S. list substitutes for the fourth principle listed above: \"acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.\" ", "In 1996, backed by the United States and other developed countries, the then-124-member WTO debated whether to form a committee to look into the relationship between trade and labor standards. Developing countries, in the majority, argued that the issue had no place in the WTO framework; was little more than a smokescreen for protectionism; and was a bid by industrial nations to undermine the comparative advantage of lower-wage trading partners. Ultimately they prevailed. The Singapore Ministerial Declaration, reporting on what they decided, stated that the ILO (rather than the WTO) would be the \"competent body to set and deal with ... internationally recognized core labor standards.\" The ILO has no enforcement tools, but rather promotes labor standards through consensus, moral suasion, and technical assistance.", "Inclusion of labor provisions in bilateral U.S. trade agreements has evolved. The first two U.S. FTAs with Israel, 1985, and Canada, 1988, did not include labor provisions. This pattern began to change after 1993, when a number of factors came into play. First, the United States began to undertake FTA negotiations with lesser-developed countries. Second, it became increasingly accepted that labor issues were related to trade and trade policy. Third, consensus broadened that globalization had both costs and benefits. The benefits tend to be broadly dispersed and include relatively higher economic growth and productivity and greater access to lower-priced goods. The costs tend to be concentrated in import-competing sectors where there may be downward pressure on wages and job displacement. In developing countries, pressures to become a low-cost producer can lead to diminished working conditions and diminished worker rights. Fourth, business groups have increasingly been willing to make some concessions to labor groups in order to promote trade agreements and pave the way for greater trade with and investment in developing countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Enforcement in U.S. Free Trade Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Since 1993, the United States has negotiated 13 FTAs that include 19 countries.

The last four agreements reflect a bipartisan compromise on labor language as delineated in the \"Bipartisan Trade Deal\" (popularly known as the \"May 10 th Agreement,\") jointly agreed to between the leadership in Congress and the Administration on May 10, 2007. This agreement calls for, among other things, several additional labor provisions in FTAs including: (1) a fully enforceable commitment that FTA countries will adopt, maintain, and enforce in their laws and practice, the basic international labor standards as stated in the 1998 ILO Declaration; and (2) the use of identical enforcement provisions for labor and the other provisions in the agreements.

The DOL receives information on foreign labor conditions from a number of sources including trade unions, Congress, Department of State labor officers at U.S. embassies, and the State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices .
