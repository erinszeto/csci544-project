Skeptics, however, worry that further intervention could prolong the housing slump, delay economic recovery, and affect outcomes based on the government's preferences.", "Since the housing bubble burst, the federal government has created multiple programs to aid homeowners, but their impact has been less than anticipated. Many measures have been proposed either to modify existing programs or to establish new efforts to improve the housing market. Three frequently discussed approaches are (1) reducing mortgage principal for borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth, (2) refinancing mortgages for borrowers who find themselves locked into paying high interest rates, and (3) renting out foreclosed homes.", "Principal reductions aim to improve the housing market by minimizing defaults and foreclosures, thus reducing collateral damage to the economy. However, principal reduction shifts the losses of borrowers to banks and other lenders. At the same time, principal reduction might improve the wider economy if it stimulates consumer spending, allowing borrowers to divert income from debt repayment to spending on other goods and services.", "Members of the 112 th Congress have introduced multiple bills that would reduce mortgage principal on certain loans. These include H.R. 1587 , the Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2011 (Representative John Conyers et al.); H.R. 3841 , the Principal Reduction Act of 2012 (Representative Maxine Waters et al.); H.R. 4058 , the Bankruptcy Equity Act of 2012 (Representative Earl Blumenauer et al.); and S. 2093 , the Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012 (Senator Robert Menendez). Principal reduction is also a component of a settlement reached between several mortgage servicers and 49 state attorneys general and the federal government. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator and conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, decided against allowing the enterprises to reduce principal for mortgages that they guarantee. All of these initiatives are discussed more fully in \" Principal Reduction \" below.", "A second approach, large-scale refinancing, helps borrowers who are current on their mortgage to refinance into a new mortgage with a lower interest rate. Because refinancing generally helps borrowers who are current, it is unlikely to have a major effect on the housing market, but it may prevent some foreclosures that could occur in the absence of a refinance. Some argue that refinancing would stimulate consumer spending. For example, a mortgage refinance could lower a borrower's monthly payment, freeing up more income that can be used to pay down debt or for non-housing-related spending. Some of the additional spending of borrowers may be offset by reduced income for investors. In a refinance, the previous owner of the mortgage is repaid on the loan earlier than expected and now faces reinvesting in a lower interest rate environment. Although some investors (including banks) may lose investment income from refinancing, other banks and mortgage originators benefit from the increased business associated with refinancing. Similarly, mass refinancing might cause Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two housing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), to lose investment income but gain from the reduced likelihood of default. It is unclear which effect would be larger.", "In his 2012 State of the Union address, President Obama proposed streamlining the existing program to refinance Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans and establishing a new mass refinancing plan for non-Fannie Mae and non-Freddie Mac loans.

These proposals are discussed more fully in \" Large-Scale Refinancing \" below.", "A third proposal, renting out foreclosed homes currently held by banks, GSEs, and other financial institutions, has the potential to stabilize housing prices by reducing the supply of homes on the \"for sale\" market. Current policy encourages lenders to sell foreclosed property quickly rather than rent out vacant homes. A successful rental program depends on house prices increasing in the future such that the rented properties can eventually be sold in a healthier market. In addition, renting foreclosed homes keeps the properties in use and reduces the collateral damage to communities. Unlike principal reductions and mass refinancing, renting foreclosed homes does not reduce existing homeowners' payments or increase their disposable income. Any impact on consumer spending is likely to be indirect through favorable effects on household net worth due to stabilizing house prices and preserving neighboring homeowners' equity. The program would only prevent foreclosure if, in lieu of foreclosure, it allowed delinquent homeowners to rent out their own homes.", "FHFA has started a pilot project to convert GSE foreclosed homes into rentals.

Goodman's estimates are shown in Table 3 . Of the approximately 80 million homes in the United States, nearly 55 million have a mortgage. Goodman divides the mortgages into five categories and assigns an estimated default rate for each category to calculate the number of homes in jeopardy of transitioning to default (i.e., being more than 60 days delinquent on the mortgage).", "The five categories, in order of highest to lowest default rate, are ", "(1) loans that are currently non-performing because the borrowers are no longer making their monthly payments; (2) loans that were non-performing but have become re-performing because the borrowers have resumed payment; (3) loans that have always been performing but have severe negative equity, meaning the borrower owes more on their mortgage than the home is worth; (4) loans that are always performing and the borrowers have moderate negative equity; and (5) loans that are always performing and the borrowers have positive equity. ", "Goodman includes a \"lower bound\" and a \"reasonable\" estimated default rate for each of the loan categories based on current trends in the foreclosure rate and the pace of economic recovery.", "Goodman's analysis suggests two broad types of policy approaches for improving the housing market. First, policies could attempt to keep people in their homes by lowering the default rates. Principal reduction and large-scale refinancing are two frequently discussed proposals attempting to accomplish this goal. Principal reduction generally involves lowering the amount of the mortgage that is owed for borrowers who are delinquent, have negative equity, or are both delinquent and have negative equity. Large-scale refinance proposals generally target borrowers who are current on their loans but cannot refinance because of their negative equity. Both proposals attempt to lower monthly payments for borrowers as well as reduce default rates by stimulating the economy through reducing or redistributing the debt burden of the mortgage. ", "The second approach implied by Goodman's analysis is to ease the transition of foreclosed homes into the market. Rather than flooding the market with foreclosed homes and potentially further lowering house prices, some have proposed converting the foreclosed homes into rental properties. Different proposals call for financial institutions either to rent the properties directly themselves or to sell properties in bulk to investors who would rent the vacant homes.", "The remainder of this report analyzes each of these three major policy proposals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Principal Reduction", "paragraphs": ["As a result of falling house prices, an estimated 11 million-15 million homeowners owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth. Borrowers in this situation are said to be \"underwater\" on their homes or in \"negative equity.\" Negative equity may impair a borrower's labor mobility, making it more difficult to sell the house and move for a new job, or limit the ability to use the house as collateral to take out a loan for a small business. Borrowers with negative equity are also more likely to default and enter foreclosure than borrowers with positive equity, partly because borrowers with negative equity are often unable to sell their home for enough to cover the amount owed if they are unable to make their monthly payments. Foreclosures can drive down home prices, forcing some borrowers further underwater and continuing the cycle of foreclosure. Figure 1 shows the rise and fall of a measure of home prices since 1987. To address these concerns, some Members of Congress have proposed reducing the mortgage principal for underwater borrowers.", "The amount that a borrower is underwater is often measured by the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The LTV ratio is the ratio of the amount that a borrower owes on the mortgage to the value of the house. An LTV of 100% means that a borrower owes the same amount as the value of the house. An LTV greater than 100% means that the borrower has negative equity, owing more than the house is worth. The more the LTV is above 100%, the more underwater the borrower is. Figure 2 shows the distribution of borrowers by the equity they have in their homes.", "Homeowners with a mortgage can generally be divided into three groups: (1) those with a loan that is government-insured through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government agency; (2) those with a mortgage owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (the GSEs); and (3) those with a privately owned mortgage. Most of the proposals discussed in this report focus on GSE loans and privately owned (non-GSE) mortgages.", "A borrower with a privately owned mortgage could see principal reduced independent of any government assistance program if the mortgage holder (i.e., bank, credit union, or other investor) believed it is in its best interest. Non-GSE borrowers could also see their principal reduced through the federal government's Home Affordable Modification Program's (HAMP's) Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA). Borrowers with a GSE mortgage, on the other hand, are ineligible for principal reductions because of policies set by Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).", "Several bills have been introduced in the 112 th Congress to reduce mortgage principal on some mortgages, including H.R. 1587 , the Home Foreclosure Reduction Act of 2011 (Representative John Conyers et al.); H.R. 3841 , the Principal Reduction Act of 2012 (Representative Maxine Waters et al.); H.R. 4058 , the Bankruptcy Equity Act of 2012 (Representative Earl Blumenauer et al.); and S. 2093 , the Preserving American Homeownership Act of 2012 (Senator Robert Menendez). Principal reduction is also a component of the settlement reached between several mortgage servicers and 49 state attorneys general and the federal government. The specifics of these proposals are discussed in \"Legislative Proposals for Principal Reduction\" below. The next section discusses some of the factors that influence whether a financial institution would offer a borrower a principal reduction."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Risks of Principal Reduction", "paragraphs": ["Some argue that principal reductions are almost always in the best interests of a borrower and a financial institution if a borrower is near foreclosure. For example, a borrower may take out a $180,000 mortgage to buy a $200,000 house (giving the borrower a loan-to-value ratio of 90%). If the borrower is having trouble making the monthly mortgage payment and the value of the house falls to $150,000, the borrower could face foreclosure. If the value of the house was greater than the amount owed, potentially the borrower could sell the home to pay off the mortgage or borrower against the equity in the house to make the monthly payment; however, because the borrower has negative equity, selling the house may not cover the mortgage. If the bank forecloses on the borrower and sells the house, it may only recover a fraction of what the house is worth, for example, $100,000. Advocates of principal reduction state that it is in the best interest of the financial institution to reduce principal by less than the amount they would lose in foreclosure.", "Multiple factors not captured by the above example may explain why principal reductions are not offered more frequently. When a borrower is delinquent, he or she is likely to fall into one of four categories. The borrower", "could become current on his mortgage without any assistance (Type 1); could default on the loan even if a loan modification is offered (Type 2); could become current on the loan but only if a modification is received (Type 3); and does not receive a modification and ends up in foreclosure (Type 4).", "When considering whether to offer a delinquent borrower a modification, the mortgage holder would prefer to only target the Type 3 borrower. No action by the mortgage holder changes the outcome for the first two types and is therefore not worth the expense associated with attempting to help. The challenge for the holder is in determining which of the four types of borrower any given delinquent borrower is. All borrowers have the incentive to claim to be Type 3. When offering a modification, the mortgage servicer (the financial institution that is in contact with the borrower and is tasked with making decisions about loan modifications) is therefore exposed to two different types of risk: self-cure risk and re-default risk. Self-cure risk is the risk that the servicer will offer a modification to the Type 1 borrower who would have become current without any assistance. Re-default risk is the risk that the servicer modifies a loan for the Type 2 borrower who re-defaults in spite of the modification. In addition, if it becomes known that a servicer is willing to offer a significant loan modification, then current borrowers have an incentive to default in order to become eligible for the modification. This then creates a third type of risk for the servicer, strategic default risk, which is the incentive created for borrowers to become delinquent even though they are current on their mortgage and can afford to pay. Principal reduction could, some argue, increase strategic default risk and create moral hazard.", "If the objective of a financial institution is to maximize profits, then it will only offer principal reductions if it is the option that best maximizes profits. For a principal reduction to maximize profits, the expected amount gained by helping the Type 3 borrower who would have failed without the assistance must be greater than the losses associated with helping those who may self-cure, re-default, or strategically default.", "Self-cure risk, re-default risk, and strategic default risk are present for all types of loan modifications, including changes to the interest rate and the balance of the loan. All borrowers, regardless of whether they \"need\" the modification, would benefit from decreased monthly mortgage payments.", "Other loss-mitigation strategies besides principal reduction may more effectively minimize the risks to the mortgage holder. For example, principal forbearance is the removal of a portion of the principal from the amount used to calculate monthly principal and interest payments for a limited period, but the forborne amount is due at the end of the loan term, potentially with interest. Borrowers who do not need the modification may find forbearance less appealing because it changes the timing on their payments but may not necessarily reduce the amount that they must ultimately pay. Alternatively, principal reduction can be paired with other approaches to minimize risk. For example, combining principal reduction with a shared appreciation mortgage, in which the borrower agrees to share some of the future gains when the house is sold with the lender, could minimize strategic default risk. These other loss-mitigation strategies are also discussed later in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of Principal Reduction", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Housing Market", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned previously, borrowers with negative equity are more likely to default and enter foreclosure than borrowers with positive equity. This can contribute to a negative spiral in which falling home prices lead to negative equity, which causes more foreclosures and a further fall in house prices.

Principal reduction could potentially interrupt this cycle by either reducing the amount of negative equity or increasing the amount of positive equity, depending on the amount of principal that is reduced and the types of borrowers a principal reduction program targets.", "Principal reduction could allow borrowers experiencing \"house lock,\" those unable to sell their home for enough to cover the balance of the mortgage, to sell their home if a principal reduction returns them to positive equity. If the goal is to stabilize the housing market, then allowing more borrowers to sell may be counterproductive. In addition, some worry that principal reductions would be a windfall for those borrowers who sell immediately and would impose unfair losses on lenders. To address these concerns, some propose reducing principal incrementally over a period of years or requiring homeowners to share part of the house price appreciation with the lender when it is sold.", "Some opponents of principal reduction argue that, because negative equity is concentrated in a few states, principal reduction would therefore benefit some parts of the country at the expense of others. Figure 4 shows the percentage of homeowners with negative equity by state. In that respect, a principal reduction policy may be similar to aid for natural disasters, which flows disproportionately to some geographic regions of the country."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumer Spending", "paragraphs": ["By stabilizing the housing market, principal reduction could stimulate the economy by reducing borrowers' monthly mortgage payments, allowing them to spend more on other goods and services. However, the additional money available to consumers comes at the expense of the owners of the mortgages; involuntary principal reduction reduces the amount that the mortgage holder will receive. Although borrowers gain and investors may lose in a principal reduction, the amount is not necessarily zero-sum. Given the potential additional spending by borrowers and decreased spending by investors, a net spending increase could occur through multiple channels. First, if borrowers spend more of an additional dollar than investors would have spent of the same dollar, then principal reduction would increase spending. Second, a significant percentage of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are held by foreign investors and the federal government. Reducing the investment income to those holders of MBS is unlikely to have a large negative impact on consumer spending in the United States. Third, by reducing the number of foreclosures that would have occurred and stabilizing home prices, principal reduction would help the wider economy by preserving household wealth and building consumer confidence. Research has found a positive correlation between household wealth and consumer spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Sector", "paragraphs": ["Assuming that the mortgage holders will reduce principal voluntarily when it is in their best interest, then a program requiring involuntary principal reductions would not be in the best interest of the mortgage holder. It would limit their choice set and potentially restrict their ability to maximize returns. If the mortgage holder is a bank or other lender, then the revenue that is lost by forgoing foreclosure and instead facing a less profitable option could cause the lender to curtail lending. A widespread curtailment of lending could cause interest rates to rise. However, the Federal Reserve could potentially offset a possible credit contraction through open market operations or an expansion of its balance sheet.", "Although principal reductions could reduce their revenues, mortgage holders could, nonetheless, potentially benefit from a principal reduction program through two channels. First, some experts argue that mortgage servicers face a host of competing incentives, not all of which encourage the servicer to act in the best interest of the loan holder. These incentives, as well as shortcomings in a servicer's operational infrastructure, could encourage the servicer to pursue foreclosure when the investor would be best served by a loan modification, such as principal reduction. Mortgage holders could benefit from a principal reduction program if servicers' misaligned incentives prevented the optimal number of principal reductions from occurring.", "Second, mortgage holders could suffer from coordination problems. Foreclosure may be individually rational but collectively irrational. If mortgage holders think house prices will continue to fall, it may be in each individual mortgage holder's interest to pursue foreclosure and maximize its immediate return, but collectively\u2014when all pursue foreclosure at the same time\u2014each is made worse off. A large surge of foreclosures could further drive down house prices and reduce the mortgage holder's recovery when the property is eventually sold.

This section analyzes one of the federal government's major initiatives to encourage non-GSE institutions to perform principal reductions, the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). Through HAMP's Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA), the federal government offers financial incentives to investors in non-Fannie and non-Freddie loans to reduce mortgage principal.", "HAMP is part of President Obama's Making Home Affordable (MHA) program, which he announced on February 18, 2009. HAMP provides financial incentives to mortgage servicers to lower eligible troubled borrowers' monthly mortgage payments to more sustainable levels. On March 26, 2010, HAMP announced the PRA. Under the PRA, participating servicers are required to consider reducing principal balances as part of HAMP modifications for homeowners who owe at least 115% of the value of their home. Servicers run two net present value (NPV) tests for these borrowers: the first is the standard NPV test, and the second includes principal reduction. If the NPV of the modification is higher under the test that includes principal reduction, servicers have the option to reduce principal. However, they are not required to do so. If the principal is reduced, the amount of the principal reduction will initially be treated as principal forbearance; the forborne amount will then be forgiven in three equal amounts over a three-year period as long as the borrower remains current on his or her mortgage payments. The Administration offers financial incentives to servicers specifically for reducing principal. The PRA went into effect on October 1, 2010. According to the Treasury Department, more than 60,000 PRA modifications were active as of January 2012. About 16,000 of these are active trial modifications, and about 44,000 are active permanent modifications.", "To encourage more principal reductions, the Treasury Department announced on January 27, 2012, that it would triple the incentive payments to investors. Investors will now receive 18 cents to 63 cents for each dollar of principal reduced, depending on the borrower's loan-to-value ratio. As discussed in the next section, Treasury has offered to expand the PRA to include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans by extending the incentive payments to them, but FHFA, the regulator and conservator of Fannie and Freddie, has decided against allowing the GSEs to participate.", "Some homeowners with non-Fannie and non-Freddie loans could also have their principal reduced as a result of the mortgage settlement between five banks and 49 state attorneys general and the federal government.

Of the $25 billion, $17 billion is expected to be allocated to aiding homeowners who want to stay in their homes but cannot afford to at their current payment levels.

Shortly after FHFA's announcement, the Treasury Department offered to extend the incentive payments that are part of HAMP PRA to the GSEs. FHFA analyzed the Treasury Department's offer and, in July 2012, determined that the GSEs would not participate in HAMP PRA.

FHFA then refines the analysis by adding additional assumptions and limiting criteria to create a model that can be used to simulate how the principal reduction program might actually operate.", "FHFA calculated as a baseline how much the GSEs might expect to lose if no modifications were offered at all to borrowers eligible for HAMP PRA. It then used the model to estimate how much the GSEs could expect to save if they offered eligible borrowers a standard HAMP modification (which does not include principal reduction) or a modification with the possibility of principal reduction. FHFA ran two NPV tests for borrowers that would be eligible for HAMP PRA, one with principal reduction and one without. For the test including principal reduction, FHFA included Treasury's principal reduction incentive payments to the GSEs as part of the benefit. Using the results of the NPV tests, it calculated an \"optimal\" modification for each borrower, defined as the modification that results in the highest expected NPV. FHFA then compared the savings of the optimal modification in which principal reduction was not an option to the optimal modification in which principal reduction was an option. The difference between the two is the estimated benefit to the GSEs of offering principal reduction. To calculate the benefit to the taxpayer of offering principal reduction, FHFA subtracted out the Treasury incentive payments.", "FHFA previously analyzed HAMP PRA in January 2012. The methodology used in FHFA's previous analysis has been criticized. For example, Laurie Goodman, a Senior Managing Director at Amherst Securities, identified three criticisms of the original methodology in her testimony before the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation and Community Development. At least some of these criticisms appear to have been addressed in the July 2012 analysis.", "First, Goodman noted that FHFA used the NPV model, a hypothetical model, in its January analysis and suggested that actual HAMP data had not been used to the fullest extent possible. FHFA's July 2012 analysis, however, continues to rely on the NPV model. If the GSEs implemented the HAMP PRA, the NPV model would likely be used as part of the program. FHFA therefore decided to use the NPV model in its analysis. The NPV model is \"updated over time as more information becomes available\" about the performance of the modifications, especially regarding re-default rates. Because HAMP results are used to calibrate the NPV model and FHFA used the NPV model in its analysis, HAMP results were used indirectly by FHFA in its analysis. FHFA used HAMP results directly in other instances, such as using its observed transition rate of current borrowers into delinquent borrowers.", "Second, Goodman cited four technical issues as flaws in the January analysis.", "FHFA used state level house price indices in its January analysis, obscuring the potential variation in house prices within a state. In the July analysis, FHFA used ZIP code level indices. When using ZIP code level indices, FHFA found a larger number of homeowners to be underwater, increasing the estimated number of households potentially eligible for HAMP PRA. FHFA's January analysis applied principal reduction to the entire portfolio of the GSEs rather than to individual loans that would be eligible for HAMP PRA. To address this concern, the July analysis attempted to determine the optimal modification for each individual loan that would be eligible for HAMP PRA. Goodman noted that the January analysis did not evaluate the actual HAMP program structure but a variant of it. The July analysis attempted to analyze the actual HAMP structure, but because FHFA was using a model, it made some simplifying assumptions. Those assumptions are described below in the \"Observations\" section. The January analysis used the loan attributes at origination rather than the current attributes of the loan. The July analysis attempts to model the current attributes for eligible borrowers by lowering the credit score of borrowers by 100 points since origination and using higher debt-to-income ratios. ", "Third, Goodman testified that FHFA \"did not consider any differentiation between loans with mortgage insurance versus loans without it,\" causing principal reduction to look less beneficial. Despite this criticism, FHFA's July analysis did not separately report results for loans with mortgage insurance and loans without mortgage insurance. FHFA did account for the existence of mortgage insurance on some loans because \"the Treasury NPV model assumes private mortgage insurance claims are paid in full in the event of default or re-default.\" Goodman argues that FHFA could design a principal forgiveness program in which only borrowers without mortgage insurance would be eligible and that the program would be beneficial to the GSEs; \"there is no question in my mind that forgiveness could be implemented for part of their book of business, without implementing it on the entire book of business.\" FHFA did not analyze a program as envisioned by Goodman."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned above, FHFA performed multiple analyses with each analysis building on the previous one. By adding additional assumptions and limiting criteria, FHFA's final results were presented as describing the reality of how the programs would actually operate.

Table 4 shows the results of FHFA's analyses 11 through 12c.", "For each analysis, Table 4 lists the assumptions used in FHFA's modeling as well as the number of loans eligible given their assumptions and the total unpaid principal balance of the eligible loans. FHFA estimated the expected losses if the eligible loans did not receive a modification. FHFA then calculated the reduction in losses if loans that were NPV positive received a Standard HAMP modification (if the loans were NPV negative, they did not receive modifications). Similarly, FHFA estimated the expected savings if eligible borrowers received their \"Optimal HAMP Modification,\" which includes principal reduction as an option. The difference between the expected savings resulting from the Optimal HAMP Modification and the Standard HAMP is the benefit to the GSEs of offering principal reductions. FHFA calculated the expected Treasury subsidy that would be paid to the GSEs as part of the principal reduction program. To calculate the Taxpayer Benefit, FHFA subtracted the Treasury Subsidy from the Enterprise Benefit.", "Analysis 11 presents FHFA's results assuming all HAMP eligible borrowers will enter into a HAMP modification. Under Analysis 11, nearly 500,000 borrowers would be eligible, resulting in averted losses of approximately $3.6 billion to the GSEs and $1.0 billion to the taxpayers. However, FHFA finds in its analysis that the majority of the savings\u2014$852 million of the $952 million\u2014would derive from borrowers who are more than a year delinquent. Of the $852 million, $606 million would come from severely underwater borrowers with LTV ratios above 140%. FHFA argues that, because past experience with HAMP indicates that the program is most effective for borrowers who are only a few months delinquent, the model's projected savings may be an overestimate. Analysis 11a removes borrowers who are more than 12 months delinquent and 11b removes borrowers more than 6 months delinquent; doing so eliminates most of the benefits found in Analysis 11.", "In addition, Analysis 11 assumes that 100% of eligible borrowers would participate. FHFA notes that recent experience shows a 15% - 25% take-up rate for HAMP eligible borrowers, but FHFA hopes to improve servicer performance to achieve a take-up rate of 50%. Analyses 12a, 12b, and 12c scale Analysis 11 by 50%, 25%, and 15%, respectively, to account for lower levels of participation. While the benefits to the GSEs and taxpayers are still positive, the benefits are correspondingly lower than in Analysis 11. Notably, FHFA finds that for Analyses 12a - 12c, 85% of the optimal HAMP modifications would be principal reductions.", "The results in Table 4 are not the final FHFA results. The table only accounts for the direct benefits and the direct costs of offering principal reduction. FHFA also attempted to account for indirect costs. One of the largest potential indirect costs involves so-called strategic modifiers, which FHFA defines as \"current borrowers who either claim financial hardship or who miss two consecutive mortgage payments to attempt to qualify for HAMP PRA, which includes principal forgiveness,\" but are able to make their payments. FHFA stated that because it is difficult to accurately predict the number of strategic modifiers, it decided to calculate the number of borrowers who would need to become strategic modifiers to eliminate the benefit to the GSEs and taxpayers, rather than try to estimate the expected number of strategic modifiers. FHFA found that, using the benefits in Analyses 12a - 12c, it would take 14,000 to 126,000 strategic modifiers to eliminate the GSEs' benefits of principal reduction and 3,000 to 19,000 strategic modifiers to eliminate the taxpayer benefits. In addition to strategic modifiers, FHFA listed other indirect costs of implementing a principal reduction program, including the additional operational costs, the opportunity cost of staff resources, and the long-term implications for mortgage credit pricing (if principal reduction causes investors to believe that future mortgage contracts are not as secure, they may require higher rates and reduce credit availability).", "After accounting for the direct benefits, direct costs, and indirect costs of allowing for principal reduction, FHFA concluded that principal reduction would increase GSE losses and taxpayer losses.

A mortgage refinance lowers a borrower's monthly payment, freeing up more income for non-housing related spending.

Although the existing lender has control over its own underwriting standards (the determination about who it will lend to), it does not have control over its competitors' underwriting standards.

If a borrower's home is valued at $200,000 and the borrower owes $160,000 or less on the mortgage (LTV below 80%), then the borrower is potentially eligible to refinance at a bank, credit union, or other traditional avenue. A financial institution that is refinancing a mortgage wants a borrower to have positive equity in the home to protect the value of the collateral in the event house prices fall. If a borrower has little or no equity in the home and house prices fall, then should the borrower default, the financial institution could not recover the full value of its loan by selling the house.", "In addition to insufficient equity, closing costs are a potential barrier to refinance for some borrowers.

A borrower may save a little each month from having a lower interest rate, but it is only worthwhile to refinance if the amount saved is greater than the cost of refinancing.

Zandi calculated that 6.8 million borrowers would refinance under the President's proposals, increasing growth of gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.1 percentage points this year.

Borrowers are more likely to refinance when it is in their best interest, such as when interest rates fall. When a borrower refinances, the remaining amount of principal that is owed is returned to the mortgage holder, requiring the mortgage holder to reinvest at a time when rates are low. Similar to what happens in a principal reduction, the gains to borrowers and the losses to investors in mass refinancing are not necessarily zero-sum. If borrowers spend more domestically of an additional dollar than investors would have spent of the same dollar, then refinancing would increase aggregate spending and support the economic recovery. In addition, a significant percentage of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are held by foreign investors and the federal government. Reducing the investment income to those holders of MBS is unlikely to have a large negative impact on consumer spending in the United States. See Figure 8 for a breakdown of the major investors in agency MBS by type of investor. Agency MBS include securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.

Loan level price adjustments, as well as other closing costs associated with getting a mortgage, such as an appraisal, may require more upfront expenses than a borrower can afford. In addition, HARP allows for more streamlined refinancing if performed through a borrower's existing servicer rather than a different servicer. This could potentially reduce competition and increase rates faced by borrowers. There are also questions about the capacity of originators to handle the increased refinance applications.

However, the Federal Reserve paper states that bulk sales can yield lower recoveries than individual sales in some cases because each property cannot be allocated to the highest individual bidder when sold in bulk. But it may take longer to sell properties individually, during which the properties deteriorate. Others predict that bulk investors will pay a premium for the opportunity to buy a large quantity at once rather than pay the expense of individually collecting properties.", "Third, to amass a sufficient number of properties, investors may need to obtain financing. However, financing for purchases of bulk pools of REO properties is not something that lenders traditionally offer. For example, Freddie Mac only allows investors to finance up to 4 homes and Fannie Mae sets the limit at 10 homes. Without more accessible credit, there may be a limited number of investors able to participate.", "In addition, not all communities are suited for a REO-to-rental program.

Second, foreclosures increase the supply of homes that are on the market, which typically drives down home prices. Lower home prices may benefit those who are looking to purchase homes, but they hurt those who currently own their homes.

The Federal Reserve white paper on housing notes that the current movement in relative prices\u2014prices that are falling or flat in the for-sale market but rising in the rental market\u2014provides evidence that it may be appropriate to transition REO properties to rentals in some areas.

In both options, REO is rented, but how and when the assets are eventually sold will impact the balance sheet of the institutions.", "If the REO properties are immediately sold in bulk to investors, then the institutions can have a relatively good idea of what price the properties can be sold given current trends, though some factors on the margin may influence the final price, such as whether auction methods are used or if financing is provided to facilitate the sale. However, if the institutions rent the properties for several years prior to eventually selling, then the direction of future house prices will significantly impact the price for which the properties are eventually sold. Supporters of policies that encourage institutions to rent for several years before selling are likely expecting future house prices to increase so that eventual sales occur in a more stable market. However, future asset prices are inherently unpredictable. If future house prices fall, then institutions would lose by postponing the sale of REO properties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consumer Spending", "paragraphs": ["Unlike principal reductions and mass refinancing, renting foreclosed homes does not reduce existing homeowners' payments or increase their disposal income.

After receiving more than 4,000 responses, FHFA announced the first property sales under its Real Estate-Owned (REO) Initiative on February 27, 2012. Under the REO Initiative, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac REO properties in the hardest-hit metropolitan areas are to be sold to qualified investors who agree to rent the properties for a specified number of years. Table 5 summarizes the Fannie Mae REO in the first transaction.", "Most of the properties in the first transaction (91.2%) are single-family homes or condominiums. However, most of the single-family homes and condominiums are already rented with fewer than 10% vacant. Because of their desire to see vacant homes rented out, some commentators expressed disappointment that a larger percentage of the homes were not vacant. Others argue that by starting with properties with existing tenants, FHFA can attract more investors for the first sale; by having existing renters, investors are ensured of a future stream of income and may therefore face less uncertainty in attempting to price this new asset class.", "It is unclear if FHFA will allow Fannie Mae (and possibly Freddie Mac in potential future sales) to retain an ownership stake in the properties or if they will be true sales.

Section 2 of H.R. 2636 makes clear that one of the goals of the proposed REO program is to increase the options available to financial institutions to maximize the value of their assets.

To be eligible, a delinquent borrower must have a mortgage originated by July 1, 2007, on a single-family property that has been used as the borrower's principal residence for at least two years prior to the foreclosure filing. In addition, the borrower's home must have had a purchase price less than the median purchase price for residences in the metropolitan statistical area (or state if not in an MSA) at the time of the purchase for the borrower to be eligible.
