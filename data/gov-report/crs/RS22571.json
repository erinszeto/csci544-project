A variety of tax, spending, or regulatory bills could draw funding from the Reserve to support liquid fuels or electricity policies. The House budget resolution (H.Con.Res. 99) would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund nearly identical to that proposed in H.R. 6. The Senate budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 21) would create three reserve funds with purposes related to those in H.R. 6.

This would yield a combined total of $14 billion for the Reserve over a 10-year period.

Proponents of the bill countered that record profits show that the oil and natural gas incentives were not needed.
