These individuals are widely referred to as \"wounded warriors.\"", "Provisions in the act reflect congressional concern about the quality and availability of medical, mental health, and dental care services for servicemembers returning from active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the difficulties that some of these individuals have experienced in their transition from military service to veteran status. The provisions vary in scope. Some of them alter specific aspects of existing services or benefits programs in either the Department of Defense (DOD) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Others call for comprehensive and long-term redesign of programs or systems in one or both of the departments. Congress and others have determined that certain programs and systems that involve both departments are particularly problematic in providing continuity and quality of care and services to wounded warriors. Among the problems addressed in the act are the efficient maintenance and transfer of servicemembers' health and benefits records between the departments, and the separate evaluations of disability by each department. Efforts to address these and other transition problems were already underway in both departments, partly in response to the recommendations of several DOD and independent commissions and task forces.
