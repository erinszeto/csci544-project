As these regulators address the potential benefits and risks of innovation, policymakers have demonstrated significant interest in understanding the types of technologies that may benefit consumers and financial markets while identifying the risks that new financial services may present. As Congress considers the potential tradeoffs of financial technology or fintech , it can be useful to understand how the financial system regulators are approaching these issues.", "The financial system regulators can be grouped into three general categories: (1) depository institution regulators, (2) consumer protection agencies, and (3) securities regulators. Each type of regulator has the authority to write rules, publish guidance, supervise institutions, and enforce compliance with the laws they implement. Further, there are similarities and differences among each regulator's mandate, which shed light on the approaches the regulators tend to take when considering new fintech.", "The banking regulators generally are responsible for banks and credit unions, particularly focusing on the safety and soundness of these institutions. They have limited authority to write rules for, supervise the operations of, or enforce actions against firms outside their jurisdiction. Some banking regulators are responsible for granting licenses, or charters, to financial institutions so they can operate as banks and credit unions. Fintech firms typically are not licensed banks or credit unions; however, banks and credit unions often form partnerships with fintech firms, and banking regulators have legal authority to examine these types of relationships. This third-party partnership supervision allows the regulators to supervise depository institutions' interactions with new fintech firms. Banks and credit unions also have an important role in the payments system. Banking regulators have used some of their rulemaking authorities to influence technological advances in the payments system as consumers continue to shift toward electronic payment tools, such as debit and credit cards.", "The consumer protection agencies generally are responsible for protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive business activities while maintaining a fair, competitive marketplace. Similar to banking regulators, consumer protection agencies have rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement authorities to implement and ensure industry compliance with consumer protection and competition laws, but consumer protection agencies have broader jurisdiction than banking regulators. For example, often they can directly regulate fintech companies and use their enforcement authorities to interact with fintech. In addition, they have promulgated rules pertaining to aspects of fintech. Consumer protection agencies generally balance the potential benefits of new technologies that could improve consumer outcomes with the potential risks to consumers posed by new, untested products entering the marketplace. This mandate allows consumer protection agencies to take enforcement actions to protect consumers and create safeguards from enforcement actions to protect companies offering financial services that benefit consumers or the market.", "Securities regulators generally are concerned with protecting investors, maintaining fair and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation. These regulators generally have limited concern for safety and soundness of the firms in their jurisdiction, focusing on disclosure requirements and contracts to promote investor protection and efficiency in the marketplace. Similar to the other regulators, they promulgate and enforce rules, but their mandate positions them somewhat differently than banking regulators and consumer protection agencies with respect to fintech. Securities regulators may endeavor to determine whether a new type of fintech product from a company counts as a security and how fintech is changing the way securities are offered. To this end, securities regulators tend to rely on their enforcement authority to ensure that new technologies do not violate securities laws."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Swiping a card to pay for something seems routine today; however, at one point in recent history, a piece of plastic with a magnetic strip capable of electronically communicating payment information between the banks of a consumer and a merchant was completely unprecedented.

Although the term was coined only recently, it likely would have been applied to a broad set of innovations, such as the advent of automated teller machines, or ATMs, in the 1960s and mobile payments in the 2000s. There is no singular definition of fintech, often making policy discussions around this topic complicated. Further, U.S. financial system regulation is fragmented across many regulators by industry, business practice, and geographical jurisdiction, so regulating fintech is multifaceted. ", "Each financial regulator has a different mandate, creating gaps and overlaps among their jurisdictions. Regulators have used various policy tools to approach the new technologies in a manner consistent with their mandate, which impacts both institutions under their direct jurisdiction and new firms that do not cleanly fit under one regulator's jurisdiction.

This report examines activities and proposals initiated after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank; P.L. 111-203 ) that are relevant to fintech. These can include fintech actions as defined by a regulator or actions pertaining to areas of financial services that intersect with technology but may not be explicitly considered fintech.

Banking regulators' broad set of authorities to supervise TSPs are provided by the Bank Service Company Act (BSCA; P.L.87-856). Specifically, the BSCA provides banking regulators with authority to examine and regulate third-party vendors that provide services to banks. ", "The banking regulators periodically issue and update guidance pertaining to third-party vendors. They issued interagency guidelines in 2001 that, among other things, require banks to provide continuous oversight of third-party vendors such as TSPs to ensure they maintain appropriate security measures. In 2017, the FDIC's Office of Inspector General issued an evaluation of TSP contracts, noting that many of the sampled institutional relationships did not adequately address the risks associated with TSP partnerships. In 2019, the FDIC issued a financial institution letter on TSP contracts, outlining the statutory obligations of firms pursuant to the BSCA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( P.L. 106-102 ) and encouraging financial institutions to ensure service provider contracts adequately address business continuity and incident response risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Brokered Deposits with Technology-Based Tools", "paragraphs": ["Rulemaking with a specific focus on fintech companies is relatively infrequent, but banking regulators occasionally issue rules or proposed rules that have some tangential impact on fintech companies, such as a recently proposed FDIC rule on brokered deposits.

Depository institutions are routinely examined to ensure their business lines are healthy and to make sure they comply with various laws. These regulators also write and provide guidance on rules for depository institutions to implement their legal authorities over certain business practices.", "Although the mandates and authorities for each agency are a bit different, the agencies all serve as primary federal regulators for some kind of depository institution. The type of depository institution depends on whether a bank is chartered at the federal or state level and whether it is a member of the Federal Reserve System. (See Table A-1 .) ", "Federal Reserve System", "The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (P.L. 63-43) established the Federal Reserve as the central bank of the United States, comprising the Board of Governors and 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The Board generally sets policy, which is carried out by the Reserve Banks. In addition to its responsibility as the central bank to set monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is also responsible for supervising and regulating state banks that are members of the system and all bank-holding companies.

The FDIC manages the Deposit Insurance Fund, which provides the funds necessary to insure deposits and to resolve failed banks.
