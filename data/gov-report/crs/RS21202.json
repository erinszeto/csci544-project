The program is designed to address problems of food insecurity, promote socialization, and promote the health and well-being of older persons through nutrition and nutrition-related services. In 2012, a reported 8.8% of U.S. households with one elderly member were food insecure, defined as households reporting low or very low food security. As the largest Older Americans Act program, the Title III nutrition services program received $814.7 million in FY2014, accounting for 44% of the act's total funding ($1.871 billion). In 2006, Congress enacted the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006 (P.L. 109-365), which extended the act's authorizations of appropriations through FY2011.

When adjusted for inflation, the total amount of funding appropriated for OAA nutrition services has decreased substantially over the past two decades ($814.7 million in FY2014 compared to $1,052.4 million in FY1990). This decline in relative funding has been experienced by the congregate nutrition and NSIP programs, while funding levels for the home-delivered nutrition programs have increased over the same time period. As a result, the number of home-delivered meals served has outpaced congregate meals, growing by 35% from FY1990 to FY2011; the number of congregate meals served declined by 40%. The faster growth in home-delivered meals is partially due to relatively higher growth in federal funding for home-delivered meals over that time period, as well as state decisions to focus funds on frail older people living at home.", "This report describes the nutrition services program authorized under OAA Title III, including the program's legislative history, purpose, and FY2014 funding level.

These funding transfers resulted in a decrease of 18.8% in funds that were originally allotted to states for the congregate program. As a result of funding transfers, available funds for home-delivered meals and supportive services increased by 14.7% and 13.8%, respectively. State initiatives to respond to the demand for home-based services by frail homebound older persons are an important factor in their decisions to transfer funds.

According to the survey, home-delivered meals recipients are particularly frail and are at risk for institutionalization, in part due to the requirement that participants be homebound. Almost four out of ten recipients (38%) reported needing assistance with one or more activities of daily living (ADLs, such as bathing, dressing, eating, and using the toilet); 11% of these recipients needed assistance with three or more ADLs.

Recipients were also more likely to have health and functional limitations that place them at nutritional risk. The report found the program plays an important role in participants' overall nutrition and that meals consumed by participants are their primary source of daily nutrients. The evaluation also found that the program leverages a fairly significant amount of nonfederal dollars: for every federal dollar spent, the program leveraged (at that time) on average $1.70 for congregate meals, and $3.35 for home-delivered meals from a variety of sources, including state, local, and private funds as well as participant contributions toward the cost of meals.", "The 2006 reauthorization legislation stipulated that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) conduct an evidence-based study of the program.

To date, AOA has not conducted this study. However, prior to the 2006 reauthorization AOA had begun the process to conduct a new evaluation of the Title III nutrition services program. According to AOA, this evaluation will contain (1) an evaluation of program impacts on participants' nutrition, health and well-being, socialization, and food insecurity; (2) a cost analysis that describes the cost per meal by cost categories and method of meal production; and (3) a process evaluation that examines the implementation of the program at the state and local levels and includes an assessment of the nutritional quality of the program meals.

", "Overall, GAO found that the lack of federal guidance and data make it difficult for states to estimate the full extent of need and unmet need for OAA Title III services, including nutrition services. The OAA requires that AOA design and implement uniform data collection procedures for states to assess receipt of services, as well as need and unmet need for Title III services. Although AOA does provide uniform procedures for states to measure receipt of services, the agency does not provide standardized definitions or measurement for states to use in measuring need or unmet need for services. As a result, states use a variety of approaches that are often limited in their ability to fully estimate need and unmet need among older adults. These approaches include maintaining waitlists, obtaining information and data from service providers, and surveying current recipients.

The AOA also identifies consolidating nutrition program funding between home-delivered and congregate nutrition programs as a targeted change for the next OAA reauthorization, so as to allow \"states more flexibility to direct services to identified needs, and allow more local input into funding allocations.\" ", "Congress may consider whether additional flexibilities are necessary, possibly consolidating Title III funding streams or increasing the proportion of funds available for states and AAAs to transfer, affording those entities that choose to transfer funds greater latitude to do so. Conversely, Congress may be concerned that funding transfers provide states and AAAs the ability to reallocate funding to services at a level different than otherwise appropriated. As a result, Congress may seek to further specify or limit funding flexibility.

Although the OAA authorizes states to implement cost-sharing as a requirement for some Title III services, the act does not permit cost-sharing as a requirement for participation in congregate and home-delivered meals programs. According to GAO, additional cost-sharing arrangements could provide additional funding for Title III programs. GAO also recommends that the HHS Secretary study the implementation of cost-sharing for OAA services with respect to \"the real and perceived burdens to implementing cost sharing for OAA services,\" which could include recommending legislative changes to the act. The AOA also identifies expanding consumer contributions as a targeted change for the next OAA reauthorization. Under this proposal, states could request a waiver to test either cost-sharing for nutrition and case management services, or to deny service to an individual for failure to make cost-sharing payments. Prior to waiver approval, states would be required to demonstrate no negative results from cost-sharing implementation.
