The new diplomacy elevates democracy-promotion activities inside countries. According to Secretary Rice in her February 14, 2006 testimony before Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the objective of transformational diplomacy is: \"to work with our many partners around the world to build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will respond to the needs of their people and conduct themselves responsibly in the international system.\" Secretary Rice's announcement included moving people and positions from Washington, D.C., and Europe to \"strategic\" countries; it also created a new position of Director of Foreign Assistance, modified the tools of diplomacy, and changed U.S. foreign policy emphasis away from relations among governments to one of supporting changes within countries.", "Except for needed appropriations, Congressional involvement in the implementation of the transformational diplomacy proposal appears to some observers to have been minimal.

As evidence, those concerned point to the fact that earlier versions of the Foreign Assistance Framework had no reference to \"poverty alleviation,\" the shifting of a large amount of foreign assistance funds from Development Assistance (DA) to the Economic Support Fund (ESF) in the Administration's FY2008 budget request, and the \"overwhelming focus on the capacity of states and little reference to the well being of the poorest,\" as evidence that long-term development was being subordinated to short-term strategic, diplomatic goals.

Congress may also exercise its oversight responsibilities to monitor the effect that transformational diplomacy has on achieving foreign policy goals, maintaining a top quality Foreign Service, and providing the best possible representation around the world. Some areas of consideration may include the following:", "Foreign Service Personnel and Security Issues\u2014Reports of personnel shortfalls at the Department of State, because of the staffing effects of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the new transformational diplomacy proposal, and the lack of authority to expand the number of positions may need to be addressed in future appropriations and authorizations. Concern about adequate security may also need to be monitored as Foreign Service personnel are regularly posted to more difficult and dangerous assignments. Monitoring the impact of transformational diplomacy on Foreign Service morale, recruitment, and attrition may be required to maintain a strong and effective diplomatic representation of America overseas in the future. Funding\u2014While the 110 th Congress passed the FY2007 Continuing Appropriations ( P.L. 110-5 ), which included funding for the Department of State, no FY2007 money was provided specifically to implement transformational diplomacy as requested by the Administration. Instead, funds were reprogrammed from other accounts within State to handle early implementation. In order to implement transformational diplomacy changes in FY2008, the Department of State is requesting a total of $124.8 million: $20.8 million for training, $14.6 million for Reconstruction and Stabilization, $39.9 million for global repositioning, $34.5 million for Foreign Service Modernization, and $15 million for public diplomacy. Through the appropriation and authorization process, Congress will likely provide oversight and funding for the plan. Foreign Assistance in the Future\u2014The Administration's foreign assistance reform proposals appear to some as already being amended by Congress. The Administration requested an increase in Economic Support Funds (ESF) and a decrease in Development Assistance (DA) funds in FY2008. According to the House Appropriations Committee's summary, the House shifted $365 million in requested ESF and International Disaster and Famine Assistance (IDFA) accounts to the DA account to \"reassert the role of USAID as the primary development agency of the U.S. Government.\" The enacted law ( P.L. 110-161 ) did not include the shift in funds. The Future of the Reconstruction and Stabilization Initiative\u2014Congress may consider whether to codify the existence S/CRS by adding its authorization to the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, and to increase S/CRS authority to lead and coordinate a government-wide response to international reconstruction and stabilization. Further, there continues to be a question of providing an authorization and funding for a Conflict Response Fund. Some supporters have suggested that such a fund might be created as a no-year revolving fund similar to the Emergency Refugee Migration Assistance (ERMA) fund. Also, the State Department requested authorizing legislation for the CRC. The Future of Transformational Diplomacy\u2014While many foreign policy experts generally agree that the world has changed and diplomacy must change with it, experts and foreign governments have raised concerns about specific aspects of the Administration's proposal. Secretary Rice said that \"Transforming our diplomacy and transforming the State Department is the work of a generation.\" If transformational diplomacy is perceived as negatively affecting U.S. interests around the world, the next administration may rethink or replace it. It is unclear how flexible the plan is and how difficult, in terms of financial and human resource costs, this plan may be to adjust or replace. Transformational diplomacy still does not address State's organizational structure, which was never fully reorganized when the U.S. foreign policy mechanism was reformed, merging new functions into the Department. Some, including the former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, have said the Department is \"broken\" and needs to be overhauled. State and Defense Departments' roles in some activities, and division of labor between the two, continue to be unclear. According to former USAID Administrator, Andrew Natsios, \"If State doesn't become more operational, it's going to be overwhelmed by the Defense Department.\" Retired Ambassador Prudence Bushnell said: \"To implement transformational diplomacy you need a clear chain of command and accountability. This is lacking. We don't seem to have settled the role of the military and the role of the career diplomat.\"", "Appendix A. Transformational Diplomacy and Global Repositioning", "Appendix B.
