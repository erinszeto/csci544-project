{"id": "RL31695", "title": "Balancing Scientific Publication and National Security Concerns: Issues for Congress", "released_date": "2006-11-13T00:00:00", "summary": ["The federal government has historically supported the open publication of federally funded research results. In cases where such results presented a challenge to national security concerns, several mechanisms have been employed. For fundamental research results, the federal policy has been to use classification to limit dissemination. For advanced technology and technological information, a combination of classification and export and arms trafficking regulation has been used to inhibit its spread. The terrorist attacks of 2001 increased scrutiny of nonconventional weapons, including weapons of mass destruction, and publication of some research results have increased concerns over whether publication of federally funded extramural research results could threaten national security.", "The current federal policy, as described in National Security Decision Directive 189, is that fundamental research should remain unrestricted and that in the rare case where it is necessary to restrict such information, classification is the appropriate mechanism. Other mechanisms restrict international information flow, such as Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) that control export of items and technical information on specific lists. Both EAR and ITAR do not apply to sharing fundamental research results, so long as they are not subject to any governmental prepublication review.", "Historically, the areas where export regulation and classification have predominantly occurred have been in mathematical, engineering, and physical sciences. Other contentious research areas, such as genetic engineering and manipulation, have been overseen through scientists' self-regulation and monitoring. The 1975 Asilomar conference produced a consensus statement on recombinant DNA research that formed the basis for the National Institutes of Health Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. Recent research publications that have raised national security concerns have fallen outside of the areas traditionally regulated through classification and export control, and it is unclear how effective these mechanisms will be. The National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity was established to aid in determining whether proposed federally funded research presents a biosecurity threat.", "Stakeholders do not agree on the best method of balancing scientific publishing and national security. Some believe that the current method of selective classification of research results is the most appropriate. They assert that imposing new restrictions will only hurt scientific progress, and that the usefulness of research results to terrorist groups is limited. Others believe that self-regulation by scientists, using an \"Asilomar-like\" process to develop a consensus statement, is a better approach. They believe that, through inclusion of scientists, policymakers, and security personnel in the development phase, a process acceptable to all will be found. Relying on publishers to scrutinize articles for information which might potentially have security ramifications is third option. Finally, mandatory review by federal funding agencies, either before funding or publication, is seen as a potential federally based alternative. This report will not be updated."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Publication of scientific research results that might be used by terrorist groups has led some policymakers to question whether the method used to control scientific research results, namely classification, should be revisited. The Administration, legislators, and scientific professional societies are reexamining policies relating to scientific information that might threaten national or homeland security. Policymakers may wish to determine what changes, if any, should be made to current government policy regarding publication of federally funded research results, and whether the options currently under consideration adequately balance the concerns and needs of the security and scientific communities.", "This report presents examples of scientific research results whose publication raised concern regarding the threat they potentially pose to national security. Past and current information control mechanisms are discussed, along with current federal policy concerning dissemination of fundamental research results through the open literature. Recent policy actions regarding dissemination of federal information and federally funded research results are outlined, along with the responses these actions have evoked from various professional societies and publishers. The advantages and disadvantages to potential policy actions addressing classification and other controls over open publication of federally funded research results are also described."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historical Overview and Context", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1950s, the United States has developed an established policy of identifying, prior to publication, areas of basic and applied research where information controls may be required. This research, typically related to weapon systems or nuclear technologies, may be designated classified and have strict information controls placed upon it. When fundamental research is not classified, the government generally did not place other information controls on it.", "This policy remained essentially unchanged until the 1970s, when controls were developed on the export of domestically developed, advanced, dual-use technologies and technological information. Under export control regulations, even if a technology is barred from export, the fundamental, basic science underlying the technology is generally exempt from controls and can be published in the open literature.", "In the early 1980s, foreign student and scientist access to technological information that might fall under export control regulations became the focus of a Department of Defense effort to restrict such information presented in classrooms and conferences. In 1985, following a report from the National Academy of Sciences asserting that openness in science leads to stronger long-term security, President Reagan issued National Security Decision Directive 189 (NSDD-189), reiterating that fundamental research results were to be controlled only through classification. NSDD-189 continues to define federal policy on restricting the dissemination of fundamental research results.", "Since then, the conduct of science and the composition of the scientific community have become increasingly international, and concerns about the effectiveness of export control regulations have grown. The international spread and independent development of dual-use technologies has made the United States the sole technology source less often. Concern that export control regulation is negatively impacting domestic business prosperity has led to attempts to lower the trade barriers erected by export control. Additionally, the presence of foreign students and scientists in the United States has increased the availability of education and training in basic skills that may be transferred to other countries upon the return of those individuals to their home countries.", "Since the terrorist events of 2001, concern that open publication of scientific and technological results may provide unwitting assistance to other nations or terrorist groups in developing weapons of mass destruction has resurged. Scientific research is conducted in many disparate areas. Historically, the areas where the balance between scientific openness and national security required consideration have been centered in the mathematical and physical sciences and their applications, such as aerospace engineering, advanced computer technology, and cryptography. Research in biology \u2013 such as the origins of virulence, development of vaccines, and the genetic manipulation of biological agents \u2013 has emerged as an area of concern because of its potential relevance to biological weapons of mass destruction. Whether the current method of using classification to limit the dissemination of fundamental research results is the best or most effective method of maintaining national security is an open question. It is unclear whether classification will be effective when applied to research areas that have not historically been classified, and whether a system of classified research will be embraced by scientists working in these areas.", "In March 2002, executive branch agencies were instructed by then-Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff Andrew Card to determine if government-owned information, especially that regarding weapons of mass destruction, was being inappropriately disclosed. Also in March 2002, the Department of Defense (DOD) promulgated a draft regulation expanding information controls to basic and applied science research and development. Scientific professional societies are engaged in developing self-regulatory mechanisms to address the concerns of the national security community. In 2003, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 32 editors of leading scientific journals issued a policy statement regarding publication of research results that could be misused. Additionally that year, the National Academy of Sciences held a meeting discussing whether current publication policies and practices in the life sciences could lead to the inadvertent disclosure of \"sensitive\" information to those who might misuse it. In 2004, the National Research Council issued a report, Biotechnology Research in an Age of Terrorism , which recommended an oversight structure, based on institutional biosafety committees, for research in select areas of concern. Following some of the recommendations presented in this report, the Department of Health and Human Services established the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to, among other duties, provide advice, guidance, and leadership regarding biosecurity oversight of dual-use research.", "Competing proposals regarding how to control federally funded research results have been proposed, ranging from strict information control on all federally funded research to maintaining the status quo. Some scientific professional societies have suggested that self-regulation, either by scientists themselves or through the editors of scientific journals, would be an appropriate mechanism for limiting the publication of research results that might aid terrorist groups. Others have advocated more formal government oversight of potentially contentious research. The development of a new category of \"sensitive, but unclassified\" information to protect information which does not require classification, but may still have the potential to damage national security, might encompass such research results. The potential impact of these options raises much concern and debate.", "A fundamental trade-off between scientific progress and security concerns is the crux of the policy debate. The scientific enterprise is based upon open and full exchange of information and thrives on the ability of scientists to collaborate and communicate their results. On the other hand, this very openness provides potential enemies with information that may allow them to harm U.S. interests. The technological advances arising from scientific breakthroughs contribute to economic prosperity, but the openness required to continue this process creates risks, which may be perceived as more acute since September 11, 2001. What level of risk caused via publication of scientific advances is acceptable in the eyes of policymakers and the public? How will controlling the publication of federally funded research results increase safety? If policymakers determine that more control of these sorts of research results is warranted, what possible mechanisms could be used to oversee these results?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Research Results of Concern", "paragraphs": ["The publication of several scientific articles reignited concerns that information published in the open literature may aid terrorist groups in developing weapons of mass destruction. Presented below is a selection of some of the more highly publicized examples.", "In 2000, researchers at the Co-operative Research Centre for the Biological Control of Pest Animals (CRC) in Australia genetically modified mousepox virus while conducting rodent fertility research. This modification unintentionally enabled the virus to infect mice that had been previously vaccinated against mousepox. The publication of this result was greeted with criticism due to its weapons potential. This experiment was repeated in 2003 by Dr. Mark Buller at the University of St. Louis using funding supplied by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.", "Another article widely viewed as having bioweapon potential was published in July 2002. Researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook assembled functional poliovirus from chemical sequences ordered from a scientific mail-order firm. Dr. Eckard Wimmer, the lead scientist, described the experiment as graphic proof that bioterror agents can be made without a terrorist ever having access to dangerous microbes.", "Other scientific publications have been viewed as potentially aiding development of biological weapons by terrorist groups or countries. Publication of successes in \"reverse genetics\" has led some to believe that other viruses could be constructed in the laboratory without having access to actual virus ahead of time. In October 2001, the full genome of Yersinia pestis , the bacteria which causes bubonic and pneumonic plague, was published in the journal Nature . Simultaneous with the release of this article was the publication of an accompanying news article in Nature Science Update that highlighted the existence of \"a debate about whether releasing genomic information for virulent diseases, such as plague or smallpox, might aid malicious science.\" The full genome sequence of Coxiella burnetii , the causative agent of Q fever, was published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science of the United States of America (PNAS) in April 2003, and the annotated genome of Bacillus anthracis , the causative agent of anthrax, was published in Nature .", "Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh identified key proteins which provide Variola major , the causative virus of smallpox, with high virulence. Accompanying this article was a commentary explaining how \"the work is far more likely to stimulate advances in vaccinology or viral therapy than it is to become a threat to biosecurity.\" Researchers published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology a potential cause of enhanced virulence for some strains of Bacillus anthracis . The assessment of antibiotic resistance in select Bacillus anthracis isolates was also identified as an article of potential concern.", "Articles such as these have led some to question the wisdom of openly publishing information that could be used to threaten national security. An editorial in New Scientist stated:", "That this mind-boggling quantity of information is going to transform medicine and biology is beyond doubt. But could some of it, in the wrong hands, be a recipe for terror and mayhem?", "Bioethicist Arthur Caplan from the University of Pennsylvania was reported as saying:", "We have to get away from the ethos that knowledge is good, knowledge should be publicly available, that information will liberate us. ... Information will kill us in the techno-terrorist age, and I think it's nuts to put that stuff on Web sites.", "Stewart Simonson, then-Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), when discussing the decision of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America to publish an article on vulnerabilities of the milk supply chain, reportedly stated through a spokesman that he regretted the journal's decision to publish the paper:", "We recognize, of course, that this is an issue about which good and reasonable people disagree.

Prior to U.S. entry into World War II, physicists in the private sector researching nuclear fission voluntarily stopped publishing results in scientific journals, fearing that they would provide crucial information to Germany's nuclear bomb project. A joint National Academy of Sciences\u2013National Research Council Advisory Committee on Scientific Publications was established to restrict publication on nuclear fission. While the United States was involved in World War II, this committee secured the cooperation of scientific journals in restricting the transfer of select scientific information within the United States.", "Nuclear power is another area where information controls have been instituted. Private industry was permitted to explore applications of nuclear power under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Prior to this act, nuclear energy activities were protected by the federal government with security and secrecy programs. The federal government retains authority over results which relate to atomic weapons, production of special nuclear material, and use of special nuclear material in the production of energy. Information developed in those areas, even if developed privately without federal government aid, is regarded as \"born classified.\"", "Genetic engineering and recombinant species were an area of great contention in the 1970s, and there were calls for regulation of the methods for manipulating DNA and of experiments containing genetically engineered species. In response to criticism and public pressure, a voluntary moratorium on such research was set. In 1975, at the Asilomar conference center in Pacific Grove, California, discussion on how scientists could self-regulate such research was held. A consensus statement regarding a voluntary moratorium on some types of recombinant research and an increase in security and containment requirements for other research areas successfully allayed many public concerns, and provided a uniform framework to address such issues.

It is also the policy of this Administration that, where the national security requires control, the mechanism for control of information generated during federally-funded fundamental research in science, technology and engineering at colleges, universities and laboratories is classification. Each federal government agency is responsible for: a) determining whether classification is appropriate prior to the award of a research grant, contract, or cooperative agreement and, if so, controlling the research results through standard classification procedures; b) periodically reviewing all research grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements for potential classification. No restrictions may be placed upon the conduct or reporting of federally-funded fundamental research that has not received national security classification, except as provided in applicable U.S. Statutes.", "Fundamental research is also defined within NSDD-189:", "'Fundamental research' means basic and applied research in science and engineering, the results of which ordinarily are published and shared broadly within the scientific community, as distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary or national security reasons.", "NSDD-189 has not been superceded and continues to be the government policy regarding controls on federally funded research results. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 2001, then-Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs Condoleezza Rice reaffirmed this position in a letter to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, by stating,", "...this Administration will review and update as appropriate the export control policies that affect basic research in the United States. In the interim, the policy on the transfer of scientific, technical, and engineering information set forth in NSDD-189 shall remain in effect...", "Executive branch agencies have followed this general policy by requiring that the results of agency-funded extramural research be published promptly and with wide dissemination. For example, the National Science Foundation research policy states:", "NSF expects significant findings from research and education activities it supports to be promptly submitted for publication, with authorship that accurately reflects the contributions of those involved. It expects investigators to share with other researchers, at no more than incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work.", "Research performed with National Institutes of Health funding is also to be disseminated to the public:", "It is NIH policy to make available to the public the results and accomplishments of the activities that it funds. Therefore, PIs [principal investigators] and grantee organizations are expected to make the results and accomplishments of their activities available to the research community and to the public at large, and to effect their timely transfer to industry for commercialization.", "The Department of Defense also encourages the publication of research it funds. For example, Office of Naval Research policy states:", "Publication of results of the research project in appropriate professional journals is encouraged as an important method of recording and reporting scientific information.", "In general, federal agencies appear to agree that there should be open publication of research results when the research has been funded by taxpayer dollars. The exception is when research is classified.

Classification is not applied to information already published in the open literature, and research results that threaten national security may arise from normally unclassified fields. Thus, advocates of changing the current system assert that classification is insufficient to stop dissemination of information arising from normally unclassified fields, as it may enter into the open literature before it is identified as potentially harmful to national security. These proponents claim that the continued publication of such information will harm national security, and that changes should be made so that such federally funded research results can be classified before they are distributed.", "Some policymakers have also asserted that the current classification system may not be appropriate for all sciences. They emphasize the difficulties in clearly defining what aspects of biological research should be subject to regulation, and that, unlike other classified research areas, much of microbiology is performed outside of the federal government. They suggest that classifying basic biological research might be necessary for homeland security, but also might unduly restrict future applied research. Thus, they claim a different method for handling such results may be necessary.", "Advocates for adjusting the current system also assert that information published in scientific journals may undermine biodefense efforts.

In export control, the concerns of national security are met while simultaneously allowing research to continue.

One might involve review boards within institutions to assess research results. Much research involving human subjects, for example, is governed by local institutional review boards. A board's purview generally extends to all human research at the institution, irrespective of funding source. Although required by the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act for certain human experimentation, the boards at extramural research institutions are not federal entities. These institutional review boards have the ability and authority to approve, require modifications within, or disapprove research projects. Similar review boards established within research facilities could be given the role of screening manuscripts in a formal or informal manner prior to their publication.", "Another possibility would be to convene a new \"Asilomar-like\" conference, where members of the scientific and national intelligence communities, along with public input, come together and craft codes of conduct which will satisfy the varying needs of these disparate groups.

Other complications to self-regulation exist as well. As scientific research has become more international in scope, it would be necessary for such a self-regulatory framework to be adhered to on an international basis for optimal effectiveness. Without the agreement of international scientists to maintain similar codes of conduct, contentious research results generated by international scientists would continue to enter the open literature. Also, scientists within the U.S. might preferentially publish in international journals, should the barrier to publication in a domestic journal be raised significantly higher than found in international publishing.", "The NIH guidelines developed out of the Asilomar conference are generally followed on an international level, but the scientific community is much larger now than in the 1970s, and developing agreement among such a community may be more difficult to achieve. Genetically modified foods and stem cell research are examples of biological research areas around which a community-wide, international consensus has not evolved.", "The National Research Council report Biotechnology Research in an Age of Terrorism provides recommendations for a potential self-regulatory mechanism. It identifies seven areas where \"experiments of concern\" might exist, and recommends that experiments within these areas be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee to determine whether the experiments present some degree of concern. The institutional biosafety committees would thus provide an initial review of proposed experiments. If further review or consultation was needed to determine whether an experiment was of concern, then the experiment could be referred to an expanded Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee or to a higher authority for adjudication.

Even if domestic publishers develop a consensus protocol for handling research results which might threaten national security, it is unclear if this would stop such information from entering the open literature. The competitive, international nature of scientific publishing may lead foreign journals that lack such a protocol to legally acquire and publish material that is prohibited from publication in domestic journals.

Advocates of such a standard point out that such information could be transferred among scientists with fewer controls than classified information.

Other options might include dissemination of such material via professional societies or directly from the federal government.", "Opponents of such an approach cite the logistical difficulties in determining those scientists with a bona fide reason for access to this information; determining how and in what manner application of such a label would be implemented; and determining how such sensitive, but unclassified material would be disseminated to those scientists eligible to receive it. A further complication is that the categorization of what information might be sensitive, but unclassified is still not clear or uniformly codified across all federal scientific funding agencies.

Results are sometimes construed to include actual samples of research materials and all information necessary to reproduce an experiment.

Some universities have explicit policies barring acceptance of federal funding requiring prepublication review. Also, scientists may not be as willing to work in research areas where publication is not allowed as in areas where publication is encouraged. As a consequence, the pool of eligible scientists competing for federal funding might decrease, potentially lowering the quality of research and development performed in these areas.
