In January 2013, there was a backlog of over 29,000 disaster loan applications pending processing. SBA extended office hours, shifted personnel, reallocated work, and hired additional personnel to address the backlog. It also created two expedited loan processes: one for home loans for applicants with relatively high incomes and good credit scores, and another for EIDLs. As a result of these efforts, the backlog was reduced to about 3,000 by April 2013.", "An SBA OIG study found that SBA's expedited process for home disaster loans reduced the application processing time by 2.3 days (18.7 days versus 21 days) compared to the standard processing method and SBA's expedited process for business disaster loans increased the application processing time by 4.4 days (43.3 days versus 38.9 days) compared to the standard processing method. The SBA OIG also found that neither of the expedited methods reduced the overall time from application acceptance to initial loan disbursements.", "Congress may be concerned that SBA disaster loans should be processed more quickly following major disasters, like Hurricane Sandy, in order to provide timely assistance to businesses and households. Congress could conduct oversight on loan processing and explore potential methods that might improve loan processing time. For example, SBA is moving from paper-based to electronic platforms to reduce processing times. On the other hand, some might caution that processing loans too quickly could potentially lead to waste, fraud, and abuse. From this perspective, Congress could examine methods for reducing processing time while guarding against the unintended consequence of an increased potential for loan fraud and abuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008", "paragraphs": ["In response to criticism of SBA's disaster loan processing following the Gulf Coast hurricanes of 2005 and 2008, and in an effort to improve SBA's Disaster Loan Program, Congress passed the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-234 ). The act included a number of measures to improve SBA's Disaster Loan Program. The act is divided into three parts as follows: ", "Part I, Disaster Planning and Response: Part 1 of the act includes a number of measures intended to improve SBA's coordination with other agencies when responding to disasters. For instance, Section 12062(a)(5) requires the SBA administrator to ensure that the agency's disaster assistance programs are coordinated, to the maximum extent practicable, with FEMA's disaster assistance programs. Section 12063(5) requires that the administrator make every effort to communicate, through radio, television, print, and internet-based outlets, all relevant information needed by disaster loan applicants. Section 12069(a) requires that if SBA's primary facility for disaster loan processing becomes unavailable, another disaster loan processing facility must be made available within two days. Part II, Disaster Lending: Part 2 of the act provides additional loan amounts in certain circumstances, reforms some of SBA's loan processes, and grants SBA authority to defer payments of loans made to homeowners and businesses affected by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. For example, Section 12081 grants the SBA administrator authority to provide additional disaster assistance for events that cause significant loss of life or damage, Section 12084 establishes the Immediate Disaster Assistance Program, Section 12085 establishes an Expedited Disaster Assistance Loan Program, and Section 12086 allows the SBA administrator to carry out a program to refinance Gulf Coast disaster loans. Part III, Miscellaneous: Part 3 of the act pertains to reporting requirements for SBA disaster assistance programs. Section 12091 requires, after a major disaster, the SBA administrator to submit to the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, the Senate Committee on Appropriations, the House Committee on Small Business, and the House Committee on Appropriations a report on the operation of the Disaster Loan Program not later than the fifth business day of each month during the applicable period for a major disaster. The reports must include the daily average lending volume (in number of loans and dollars), the percentage by which each category has increased or decreased since the previous report, the amount of funding available for loans, and an estimate of how long the available funding for salaries and expenses will last, based on SBA's spending rate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Immediate and Expedited Disaster Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Among the programs intended to improve SBA's Disaster Loan Program are three guaranteed loan programs established in Part II of the act: the Expedited Disaster Assistance Loan Program (EDALP), the Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (IDAP), and the Private Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP).

", "Section 12084 of the act required the SBA Administrator to establish and implement IDAP. It would provide businesses interim \"bridge loans\" through private sector lenders of up to $25,000 within 36 hours after SBA receives the loan application. Section 12085 of the act required the SBA Administrator to establish and implement EDALP which would provide up to $150,000 in \"bridge\" loans to businesses more quickly than standard SBA disaster loans. EDALP was designed to disburse the loans more quickly than standard SBA disaster loans. Section 12083 required the SBA Administrator to establish and implement PDAP. PDAP would provide up to $2 million in guaranteed loans to both businesses and homeowners.", "A 2014 GAO report found that SBA had not piloted or implemented the three programs.

Collateral includes items such as a lien on the damage or replacement property, a security interest in personal/business property, or both. Loan recipients can assume that all assets financed with borrowed funds will be used as collateral for the loan.

Some business owners who lacked other forms of collateral were reluctant to use their personal residences as collateral because it was the only tangible asset they had left after the storm. The report also indicated that some businesses could not afford disaster loans even with six months grace periods and interest rates of 1%.", "Congress could explore methods that help business owners obtain disaster loans without using their personal residences as collateral, or prohibit SBA from requiring personal residences as collateral for disaster loans. For example, S. 956 , the Small Business Disaster Reform Act of 2015 would prohibit SBA from requiring a small business owner to use their primary residency as collateral if the owner has other assets with a value equal to, or greater than, the loan amount that could be used.", "With respect to the affordability of disaster loans, one potential solution suggested by the Bipartisan Task Force was the use of direct grants\u2014similar to grants provided households by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\u2014to help businesses rebuild and recover from disasters. Some, however, might express concern over the costs associated with providing grants. For example, between 2004 and 2013, FEMA provided renters and homeowners roughly $16 billion in grants through its Individual and Households Program (IHP). Providing grants to businesses could significantly increase federal expenditures for grant assistance.", "Critics of providing grants may also argue that, traditionally, grants have not been provided to businesses by Congress because businesses are responsible for obtaining insurance as part of their business portfolio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interest Rates and Loan Forgiveness", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned earlier in this report, disaster loans have statutorily established ceilings on interest rates. Floors on interest rates, however, are not statutorily set. In general, interest is based on current average market rates as determined by the SBA Administrator (unless market rate exceeds the ceilings). Interest rates may therefore vary from disaster to disaster. For example, the interest rates for business loans in 2011 for businesses affected by flooding in Pennsylvania had an interest rate of 4% while interest rates for businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 had an interest rate of 2.9%. To some, this may be perceived as inequitable. In other cases, some individuals and households cannot repay their loans despite the lower interest rates. ", "Some may argue that Congress should establish a set interest for all disasters. Congress may also consider lowering interest rates for existing disaster loans. For example, H.R. 2857 , introduced in the 113 th Congress, would have restructured qualifying disaster loans at a lower rate. Congress could also consider offering loan forgiveness to those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. As a general rule, SBA does not offer loan forgiveness unless Congress intervenes. One exception was granted after Hurricane Betsy, when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Southeast Hurricane Disaster Relief Act of 1965. Section 3 of the act authorized the SBA administrator to grant disaster loan forgiveness or issue waivers for property lost or damaged in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi as a result of Hurricane Betsy. The act stated that", "... to the extent such loss or damage is not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, (1) shall at the borrower's option on that part of any loan in excess of $500, (A) cancel up to $1,800 of the loan, or (B) waive interest due on the loan in a total amount of not more than $1,800 over a period not to exceed three years; and (2) may lend to a privately owned school, college, or university without regard to whether the required financial assistance is otherwise available from private sources, and may waive interest payments and defer principal payments on such a loan for the first three years of the term of the loan.", "Others may argue that interest rates are sufficiently low and that interest rates are needed to cover the administrative costs associated with disaster loans. Low interest rates and forgiveness could undermine SBA efforts to recoup some of the costs needed to administer the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Supporters of the SBA Disaster Loan Program might contend that the SBA Disaster Loan Program has made improvements since Hurricane Katrina made landfall in 2005. They may argue that loan processing times have been reduced and interagency coordination has improved as evidenced by the response to hurricanes Gustav and Ike. On the other hand, others might argue that the SBA response to Hurricane Sandy indicates loan processing time still needs to be addressed. Some may also be troubled by SBA's perceived slow progress in implementing some of the requirements set forth in the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 such as the implementation of EDALP and IDAP. They may further contend that the agency's response could have been more successful had these programs been in place before Hurricane Sandy. ", "Why Does SBA Issue Disaster Loans Instead of FEMA?", "In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed Executive Order 12127. The order merged many of the disaster-related responsibilities of separate federal agencies into the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). During FEMA's formation, it was determined that SBA would continue to provide disaster loans through the Disaster Loan Program rather than transfer that function to FEMA. At the 1978 hearing before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Government Operations, Chairman Jack Brooks questioned the rationale for keeping the loan program outside of FEMA. According to James T. McIntyre, Director, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the rationale was as follows: ", "[O]ne of the fundamental principles underlying this proposal is that whenever possible emergency responsibilities should be an extension of the regular missions of federal agencies. I believe the Congress also subscribed to this principle in considering disaster legislation in the past. The Disaster Relief Act of 1974 provides for the direction and coordination, in disaster situations, of agencies which have programs which can be applied to meeting disaster needs. It does not provide that the coordinating agency should exercise direct operational control.... [I]f the programs ... were incorporated in the new agency we would be required to create duplicate sets of skills and resources.... [S]ince the Small Business Administration administers loan programs other than those just for disaster victims, both the SBA and the new agency [FEMA] would have to maintain separate staffs of loan officers and portfolio managers if the disaster loan function were transferred to the new Agency.... [O]ne of our basic purposes for reorganization ... would be thwarted if we were to have to maintain a duplicate staff function in two or more agencies.", "McIntyre added, \"We believe we have achieved a balance in this new agency [FEMA] between operational activities and planning and coordination functions.\" He further stated that \"we can provide better service to the disaster victims if oversight of disaster response and recovery operations is vested in an agency which can adopt a much broader prospective than would be possible if this agency [FEMA] had operational responsibilities as well.\"", "Additionally, a clause in the Stafford Act that prohibits recipients of disaster aid from receiving similar types of aid from other federal sources is often cited as a rationale for keeping the entities distinct. Section 312 of the act states:", "The President, in consultation with the head of each Federal agency administering any program providing financial assistance to persons, business concerns, or other entities suffering losses as a result of a major disaster or emergency, shall assure that no such person, business concern, or other entity will receive such assistance with respect to any part of such loss as to which he has received financial assistance under any other program or from insurance or any other source.", "SBA Disaster Loan Approvals for Applicants in Gulf Coast States", "The following figures are provided to help frame discussions concerning SBA Loan Program activity in the Gulf Coast in response to the 2005 and 2008 hurricane seasons.
