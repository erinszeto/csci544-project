U.S. policy toward the region under the Obama Administration focused on four priorities: promoting economic and social opportunity; ensuring citizen security; strengthening effective democratic institutions; and securing a clean energy future. There was substantial continuity in U.S. policy toward the region during the first six years of the Obama Administration, which pursued some of the same basic policy approaches as the Bush Administration. However, the Obama Administration made several significant policy changes, including an emphasis on partnership and shared responsibility. Moreover, President Obama unveiled a new policy approach of engagement with Cuba in 2014.", "U.S. policy toward the region is conducted in the context of an increasingly independent Latin America, which has diversified its economic and diplomatic ties with countries outside the region. Over the past few years, several Latin American regional organizations have been established that do not include the United States. Nevertheless, the United States remains very much engaged in Latin America bilaterally and multilaterally.", "Congressional Action and Oversight", "Congress traditionally has played an active role in policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean in terms of both legislation and oversight. In the first session of the 114th Congress in 2015, the most significant legislative action was enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (P.L. 114-113). The law had numerous provisions on foreign aid to the region, including $750 million for ramped-up funding to address Central America's economic, security, and governance challenges. The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA; P.L. 114-92) also had provisions regarding increased support for Central America and prohibitions against funding for the closure of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Also in 2015, Congress approved an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences through 2017 in the Trade Preferences Extension Act (P.L. 114-27) benefitting some 15 countries in the region. Late in 2015, the House passed H.Res. 536, expressing support for freedom of the press in the region.", "In the second session, Congress enacted legislation in July 2016 extending targeted sanctions for human rights abuses in Venezuela through 2019 (P.L. 114-194), while in September 2016 the House approved H.Res. 851 on the situation in Venezuela. Also in September, Congress enacted a legislative vehicle (P.L. 114-223) that provided FY2016 supplemental funding to control the spread of the Zika virus in the Americas.", "As the 114th Congress neared its end in December 2016, Congress completed action on several measures with provisions related to the region. P.L. 114-291 requires the Secretary of State to submit a multiyear strategy for U.S. engagement with the Caribbean. P.L. 114-323, the Department of State Authorities Act, FY2017, established a commission to review U.S. drug control policy in the hemisphere, including an evaluation of counternarcotics assistance programs. P.L. 114-328, the FY2017 NDAA, extends a unified counterdrug and counterterrorism campaign in Colombia for two years; requires a report on U.S. military units that have been assigned to do policing or other law enforcement duties in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; continues prohibitions on funding for the closure of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and restricts funding for Cuba's participation in certain joint or multilateral exercises or related security conferences. Congress did not complete action on FY2017 foreign aid appropriations, but it enacted a continuing resolution, P.L. 114-254, in December that funded most foreign aid programs at the FY2016 level, minus an across-the-board reduction of almost 0.2%, through April 28, 2017. The 115th Congress will face completing action on FY2017 foreign aid appropriations.", "This report, which will not be updated, provides an overview of U.S. policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean during the 114th Congress in 2015 and 2016. It begins with an overview of the political and economic environment affecting U.S. relations and then examines the Obama Administration's policy toward the region. The report then examines congressional interests in the region and legislative action, looking at selected regional and country issues.

Geographic proximity has ensured strong economic linkages between the United States and the region, with the United States being the major trading partner and largest source of foreign investment for many countries. Free trade agreements (FTAs) have augmented U.S. economic relations with 11 countries in the region. Latin American nations, primarily Mexico and Venezuela, supply the United States with almost one-third of its imported crude oil. The Western Hemisphere is also the largest source of U.S. immigration, both legal and illegal, with geographic proximity and economic and security conditions being major factors driving migration trends. Curbing the flow of illicit drugs from Latin America and the Caribbean has been a key component of U.S. relations with the region and a major interest of Congress for some three decades. In recent years, this has included close security cooperation with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean to combat drug trafficking and related violence. With the exception of Cuba, the region has made enormous strides in terms of democratic political development over the past three decades, but the rise of undemocratic practices in several countries, especially Venezuela, has been a U.S. concern."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Political and Economic Environment in the Region", "paragraphs": ["U.S. policy toward the Latin American and Caribbean region is conducted in the context of significant economic and political changes in the hemisphere as well as the region's increasing independence from the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Changed Region", "paragraphs": ["The Latin American and Caribbean region has made significant advances over the past three decades in terms of both political and economic development. In the early 1980s, 16 countries in the region were governed by authoritarian regimes, both on the left and the right, but today, all governments with the exception of Cuba are, at least formally, elected democracies. The threat to elected governments from their own militaries has dissipated in most countries.", "Free and fair elections have become the norm in most countries in the region, even though some elections have been controversial with allegations of irregularities. In 2015, eight countries successfully completed elections for head of government. Long-ruling parties were voted out of office in St. Kitts and Nevis, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Argentina, and incumbents were reelected in Suriname, Belize, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In Guatemala, just ahead of its 2015 presidential election, the country became embroiled in massive corruption scandals that led to the arrest of the vice president in August and the resignation of President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina in September. The country then held two presidential election rounds in September and October 2015, with former actor Jimmy Morales, who had campaigned on a strong anticorruption platform, winning the second round by a large margin (see \" Guatemala ,\" below).", "2016 Elections. To date in 2016, six countries have held elections for head of government. In a close parliamentary race in Jamaica in February, the opposition Jamaica Labour Party, led by Andrew Holness, defeated the incumbent People's National Party government, led by Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller. In the Dominican Republic , incumbent President Danilo Medina of the center-left Dominican Liberation Party was reelected in a landslide in May. After two presidential rounds in Peru in April and June, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski of the centrist Peruvians for Change defeated Keiko Fujimori from the center-right Popular Force by a slim margin. Most recently in June, St. Lucia held parliamentary elections in which the opposition United Workers Party, led by Allen Chastanet, defeated the St. Lucia Labour party of Prime Minister Kenny Anthony. In Nicaragua , incumbent President Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista party won a third consecutive term in controversial elections held on November 6, 2016, which were criticized by many, including the United States. The State Department characterized the elections as flawed because of the government's sidelining of opposition candidates, limits imposed on domestic observation at the polls, and other actions that denied democratic space in the electoral process (see \" Nicaragua ,\" below). In Haiti , a first presidential round was held in October 2015, but allegations of fraud ultimately led to the election's nullification. After multiple delays, a new presidential election was held on November 20, 2016, in which Jovenel Moise won almost 56% of the vote and is scheduled to be inaugurated in February 2017 (see \" Haiti ,\" below).", "Challenges to Democracy . Despite significant improvements in political rights and civil liberties, several countries in the region still face considerable challenges. In a number of countries, weaknesses remain in the state's ability to deliver public services, ensure accountability and transparency, advance the rule of law, and ensure citizen safety and security. There are also numerous examples of elected presidents over the past 25 years who left office early amid severe social turmoil and economic crises, the presidents' own autocratic actions contributing to their ouster, or high-profile corruption. The September 2015 resignation of Guatemalan President P\u00e9rez is the most recent example. In Brazil, a widespread corruption scandal and a sharp economic downturn were key factors leading to the suspension of President Dilma Rousseff from office in April 2016, followed by an impeachment trial by Brazil's Senate removing her from office in August 2016 (see \" Brazil ,\" below).", "The quality of democracy in several countries in the region has eroded in recent years. One factor is increased organized crime. Mexico and several Central American countries have been especially affected because of the increased use of the region as a drug transit zone and the associated rise in corruption, crime, and violence. A second factor negatively affecting democracy in several countries is the executive's abuse of power. Elected leaders have sought to consolidate power at the expense of minority rights, leading to a setback in liberal democratic practices. Venezuela stands out in this regard. In recent years, there has also been a deterioration of media freedom in several countries precipitated by the increase in organized crime-related violence and by politically driven attempts to curb critical or independent media.", "The human rights group Freedom House compiles an annual evaluation of political rights and civil liberties in which it categorizes countries as free, partly free, and not free. In its 2016 report (covering 2015), the group ranked just one country as not free: Cuba. It ranked 11 countries as partly free\u2014Bolivia, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela\u2014and the remaining 21 countries of the Latin American and Caribbean as free. According to the report, the Dominican Republic was downgraded in part because of decreased space for independent media and the implementation of a law preventing Dominicans of Haitian descent and Haitian migrants from exercising their civil and political rights. Freedom House also noted growing threats to freedom and democracy posed by criminal gangs, political violence, and systemic corruption in the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Freedom House maintains that Venezuela deserves special scrutiny because of the resistance of the current government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to the opposition's victory in December 2015 legislative elections. It notes that the deteriorating political and economic situation in Venezuela is one of the region's most significant challenges (see \" Venezuela ,\" below).", "Some observers see the ebbing of the so-called pink tide of leftist populist governments in the region as a positive trend. The November 2015 election of a center-right government in Argentina ended the leftist populism known as Kirchnerismo and began to change regional dynamics in Latin America. Despite the Venezuelan government's efforts to thwart the opposition's power, some view the opposition's triumph at the ballot box in December 2015 as the beginning of the end of the populist leftist model of government advanced by former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Along these lines, some observers see the February 2016 defeat of a referendum in Bolivia that would have allowed populist President Evo Morales to seek a third consecutive presidential term as another setback to the pink tide. ", "A second factor potentially affecting democratic governance is the recent peace agreement between the Colombian government and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This development has raised hopes that the hemisphere's oldest civil conflict, which dates back to the 1960s, is finally resolved (see \" Colombia ,\" below).", "Economic Challenges. While the 1980s were commonly referred to as the lost decade of development as many countries were bogged down with unsustainable public debt, the 1990s brought about a shift from a strategy of import-substituting industrialization to one focused on export promotion, attraction of foreign capital, and privatization of state enterprises. Latin America experienced an economic downturn in 2002 (brought about in part because of an economic downturn in the United States), but recovered with strong growth rates until 2009, when a global economic crisis again affected the region with an economic contraction of about 1.3%. Some countries experienced deeper recession in 2009, especially those more closely integrated with the U.S. economy, such as Mexico, while other countries with more diversified trade and investment partners experienced lesser downturns. The region rebounded in 2010 and 2011, with growth rates of 6.1% and 4.9%, respectively, but growth began to decline after that and registered just 1% in 2014.", "In its October 2016 economic forecast, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected that economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean would contract 0.6% in 2016 after no growth in 2015 (see Table 1 ). The global decline in commodity prices and China's economic slowdown have affected the region's economies. In 2015, economic contractions in Brazil (-3.8%) and Venezuela (-6.2%) dragged down growth rates for South America and the region as a whole. According to the IMF, business and consumer confidence appears to have bottomed out in Brazil, although the projection for 2016 is for an economic contraction of 3.3% followed by an increase of 0.5% in 2017. The Venezuelan economy remains in deep recession because of the rapid decline in the price of oil and economic mismanagement; the economy is projected to contract 10% in 2016 and 4.5% in 2017. Ecuador has also been significantly affected by the drop in oil prices, with the economy projected to contract 2.3% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017. ", "Since the early 2000s, Latin America has made significant progress in combating poverty and inequality. In 2002, almost 44% of the region's population were considered to be living in poverty, but by 2012 that figure had dropped to 28%, representing 164 million people. Two key factors accounting for this decline were increasing per capita income levels and targeted public expenditures known as conditional cash transfer programs for vulnerable sectors. Brazil and Mexico were pioneers in these targeted programs that have spread to other countries. The poverty rate for the region was relatively unchanged at 28.1% in 2013 and 28.2% in 2014. In 2015, however, with several countries experiencing contracting economies, poverty for the region increased to 29.2%, with an estimated 175 million people in the region living in poverty, up from 169 million in 2014. With projections of economic contraction for the region in 2016, poverty levels for the region likely will increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Latin America's Increasing Independence", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, Latin America's relatively sustained political stability and, until recently, steady economic performance (with some exceptions) increased the region's confidence in solving its own problems, and lessened the region's dependency on the United States. The region's growing ideological diversity has also been a factor in the region's increased independence from the United States, as has Brazil's rising regional and global influence.", "Latin American and Caribbean countries have diversified their economic and diplomatic ties with countries outside the region. China, for example, has become a major trading partner for many countries in the region, ranking as one of the top two export and import markets. Total Chinese trade with the region grew from almost $18 billion in 2002 to almost $262 billion in 2014, before dropping to $235 million in 2015. Nevertheless, the United States remains the single largest trading partner for many countries; total U.S. trade with the region amounted to $867 billion in 2014 and $797 billion in 2015, more than three times that of China's trade with the region.", "Several Latin American regional integration organizations have been established in the past few years, a reflection of the region's increasing independence, growing internal cooperation, and ideological diversity.", "The Venezuelan-led Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas (ALBA, originally established as the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas) was launched by President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2004 with the goals of promoting regional integration and socioeconomic reform and alleviating poverty. In addition to Venezuela, this 11-member group currently includes Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, as well as the Caribbean island nations of Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Despite its established goals, ALBA was most often associated with the anti-American rhetoric of some of its Latin American members. In the aftermath of President Ch\u00e1vez's death in March 2013, some observers questioned the future of the Venezuelan-founded alliance. Moreover, the precipitous decline in the price of oil since 2014 has further challenged the ability of Venezuela to extend its influence in the region.", "Another regional organization is the 12-member Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), established in 2008 (largely because of Brazil's influence) to promote political, economic, and security coordination in South America. It has served as a forum for dispute resolution. For example, the organization played a role in defusing tensions between Colombia and Venezuela in 2008, and helped resolve internal political conflicts in Bolivia in 2008 and Ecuador in 2010. Some analysts, however, have raised questions about UNASUR's overall efficacy, financial support, and ability to develop specialized capabilities and programs. In 2014, in an attempt to quell political unrest in Venezuela, UNASUR foreign ministers were initially successful in establishing a dialogue between the government and the political opposition, but talks ultimately broke down, and were not restarted.", "A regional trade integration arrangement, the Pacific Alliance, first emerged in 2011 with the primary goal of facilitating the flow of goods, services, capital, and people among its members. The Alliance currently includes Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Costa Rica and Panama are candidates for membership. Different from other initiatives described above, the Alliance welcomed the United States as an observer in July 2013.", "A region-wide organization established in 2011, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) consists of 33 hemispheric nations, but excludes the United States and Canada. CELAC's goal is to boost regional integration and cooperation. While some observers have concerns that CELAC could be a forum for countries that have tense or difficult relations with the United States, others point out that strong U.S. partners in the region are also members. Some observers have predicted that CELAC could diminish the role of the Organization of American States (OAS), while others maintain that CELAC does not have a permanent staff or secretariat that could compete with the OAS. In January 2015, China hosted the first China-CELAC Forum in which countries agreed to a five-year cooperation plan. Later in January 2015, CELAC held its third summit in Costa Rica. Ecuador hosted the fourth CELAC summit in January 2016.", "To some extent, CELAC's establishment reflects a Latin American desire to lessen U.S. influence in the region; however, the United States remains very much engaged in the region bilaterally and multilaterally through the OAS and its numerous affiliated organizations. Moreover, U.S. officials have strongly supported the efforts of OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro, elected to a five-year term in May 2015, to push for the protection of democracy and human rights in the region.", "In addition, the Summit of the Americas process, affiliated with the OAS, remains an important mechanism for the United States to engage with Latin American nations at the highest level. While the sixth Summit of the Americas, held in Colombia in April 2012, displayed U.S. divergence from the region in terms of policy toward Cuba and anti-drug strategy, the meeting also included a variety of initiatives to deepen hemispheric integration and address key hemispheric challenges.", "A looming challenge for the United States was how to deal with the seventh Summit of the Americas to be hosted by Panama in April 2015. Cuba had expressed interest in attending the sixth summit, but ultimately was not invited to attend. The United States and Canada had expressed opposition to Cuba's participation. Previous summits had been limited to the hemisphere's democratically elected leaders. Many Latin American countries vowed not to attend the 2015 summit unless Cuba was invited to attend. As a result, Panama announced in August 2014 that it would invite Cuba to the summit, presenting a dilemma for the Obama Administration. In December 2014, however, when President Obama announced a new policy approach toward Cuba, he said that United States was prepared to have Cuba participate in the summit.

The Obama Administration stressed that its policy approach toward the region was one emphasizing partnership and shared responsibility, with policy conducted on the basis of mutual respect through engagement and dialogue. President Obama reemphasized the theme of equal partnership at the sixth Summit of the Americas in April 2012 when he said that \"in the Americas there are no senior or junior partners, we're simply partners.\" In remarks at the June 2012 OAS General Assembly meeting in Bolivia, then-Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson reiterated the commitment of the United States to work with hemispheric nations \"in the spirit of genuine and equal partnership to advance liberty and prosperity for all the citizens of the hemisphere.\"", "In a November 2013 OAS address, Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that \"the era of the Monroe Doctrine is over.\" Secretary Kerry emphasized the importance of the United States working with other hemispheric nations as equal partners to promote and protect democracy, security, and peace; to advance prosperity though development, poverty alleviation, and improved social inclusion; and to address the challenges posed by climate change. Secretary of State Kerry stated, \"the relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states. It's about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share.\"", "Then-Assistant Secretary of State Jacobson reiterated in a December 2013 address in Miami, FL, that \"the administration is committed to sustained, productive engagement in the Americas.\" She emphasized that the various partnership initiatives between the United States and Latin America involved U.S. officials sitting down with regional counterparts to understand their priorities and needs and discussing the ways in which the United States might support them.", "In December 2014, President Obama announced major changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, moving away from the long-standing sanctions-based policy toward a policy emphasizing engagement and moving toward normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. As part of the policy shift, the Administration eased certain sanctions on travel and commerce with Cuba, removed Cuba from the so-called state sponsors of terrorism list, and reestablished diplomatic relations. Latin American and Caribbean leaders as well as regional organizations such as the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), OAS, and UNASUR hailed the change in U.S. policy. President Obama stated at the April 2015 Summit of the Americas in Panama that the shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba \"represents a turning point for our entire region\" and noted that this was \"the first time in more than a half century that all the nations of the Americas are meeting to address our future together.\"", "Vice President Joe Biden contended in a May 2016 speech on the Western Hemisphere that the U.S. policy shift on Cuba from isolation to engagement \"proved that our promise to listen rather than dictate to the region was more than just words.\" He said that many Latin American leaders told him how the change in U.S. policy toward Cuba has enhanced their ability to build partnerships with the United States."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Economic and Social Opportunity", "paragraphs": ["The policy priority of expanding economic opportunity focuses on one of the key problems facing Latin America: lingering poverty and inequality.

Overall U.S. assistance levels to Colombia began to decline as the country began taking over responsibility for programs once funded by the United States.", "On trade matters, implementing bills for FTAs with Colombia and Panama that were negotiated under the Bush Administration ultimately were introduced and enacted into law in October 2011 ( P.L. 112-42 and P.L. 112-43 ) after extensive work by the Obama Administration to resolve outstanding congressional concerns related to both agreements. In 2015, Congress enacted P.L. 114-27 , an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) through 2017, benefitting 15 countries in the region. Another trade initiative begun informally under the Bush Administration and continued by the Obama Administration through formal trade negotiations was the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement with Mexico, Chile, Peru, and eight other Pacific countries. TPP trade ministers concluded the agreement in October 2015, and the President released the text of the agreement and notified Congress in November 2015. The 114 th Congress, however, did not take any action on implementing legislation, and President-elect Trump announced in November 2016 his intention to withdraw from the TPP. The agreement could have had significant implications for U.S. trade and investment ties with the three Latin American countries that are parties to the agreement, as well as with other Latin American countries that could possibly have joined in the future.", "Just as the Bush Administration had, the Obama Administration expressed support for comprehensive immigration reform, an especially important issue in U.S. relations with Mexico and Central America. In the absence of congressional action on comprehensive reform, President Obama took executive action in 2012 providing relief from deportation for certain immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. President Obama took further executive action in 2014 that would have provided relief from deportation and work authorizations for more categories of unauthorized migrants, but court challenges prohibited implementation of the initiatives.", "In other areas, the Obama Administration made policy changes on Latin America that more clearly differentiated it from the Bush Administration. As described above, the Administration early on put more of an emphasis on partnership and shared responsibility in its policy toward the region. It established numerous partnership programs in such areas as security, energy, and economic and social opportunity. It emphasized policy conducted on the basis of mutual respect through engagement and dialogue.", "Perhaps most significantly, as noted above, the Obama Administration announced major changes in Cuba policy in late 2014, moving away from a policy of isolation toward a normalization of relations. The policy shift on Cuba was lauded throughout the region and has changed the dynamics of a long-standing irritant in U.S. relations with Latin America. ", "Beyond Cuba, the Administration pursued several other policy shifts. While it pressed for dialogue in Venezuela, the Administration also imposed sanctions (including visa restrictions and asset blocking) on current or former Venezuelan officials involved in human rights abuses. In Central America, spurred in part by a surge in 2014 of unaccompanied children and other migrants seeking to enter the United States, the Administration developed a broader approach in 2015 known as the Strategy for Engagement in Central America, which goes beyond security concerns to address economic development and governance issues. In the Caribbean, the Administration also moved beyond security concerns to address the energy needs of countries that are heavily dependent on energy imports, launching a Caribbean Energy Security Initiative (CESI) in 2014 with the goal of promoting a cleaner and sustainable energy future.

The FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act ( P.L. 114-92 ), enacted in November 2015, also has provisions regarding increased support for Central America as well as prohibitions against funding for the closure of the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Earlier in the year, Congress approved an extension of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) through 2017 in the Trade Preferences Extension Act ( P.L. 114-27 ), enacted in June, which benefits some 15 countries in the region.

In July, Congress enacted legislation extending the termination date of the requirement to impose targeted sanctions on individuals for human rights abuses in Venezuela ( P.L. 114-194 ). In September, the House approved H.Res. 851 , also related to Venezuela, which among its provisions expressed profound concern about the humanitarian situation, urged the release of political prisoners, and called for the Venezuelan government to hold a presidential recall referendum in 2016.

Others no longer require traditional development assistance but continue to receive low levels of aid, usually targeted toward strengthening security capabilities.", "The Obama Administration's FY2017 foreign aid budget request included $1.74 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean to be provided through the State Department and USAID, which is roughly equal to the amount that Congress appropriated for the region in FY2016. Aid to the region has increased each year since FY2014 but remains below what was provided in FY2012. In recent years, the vast majority of U.S. assistance for the region has been dedicated to implementing a new U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America and ongoing programs in Colombia, Haiti, and Mexico. In addition to State Department and USAID funding, some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean receive assistance through U.S. agencies such as the Department of Defense (DOD), the Inter-American Foundation, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and/or the Peace Corps.", "Key Policy Issues: The Senate and House Appropriations Committees reported out their respective FY2017 State Department, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs appropriations bills, S. 3117 and H.R. 5912 , in June and July 2016; however, those measures never received floor consideration. Instead, Congress opted to fund foreign aid programs through a series of stopgap measures.

Factors that have fueled Latin American migration to the United States have included familial ties, poverty and unemployment, political and economic instability, natural disasters, proximity, and crime and violence.", "Since the mid-1990s, increased border enforcement has made unauthorized entry into the United States more difficult and expensive. This has prompted migrants to rely on alien smugglers ( coyotes ), many of whom collude with Mexican criminal groups, to transit Mexico and cross the U.S.-Mexico border. During the journey, migrants have been vulnerable to kidnapping, human trafficking, and other abuses.", "Latin American governments have supported the enactment of comprehensive immigration reform in the United States that would normalize the status of illegal immigrants and create guest worker programs to facilitate circular migration. The House and the Senate considered immigration measures on a variety of issues in the 114 th Congress, but comprehensive immigration reform was not on the agenda. In the absence of comprehensive reform, governments welcomed President Obama's 2012 executive action that provided relief from removal (deportation) for certain immigrants who arrived to the country as children.

In FY2015, DHS deported 235,413 individuals worldwide, some 94% of whom were returned to Mexico and the \"northern triangle\" countries of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras). Mexico remains concerned about the safety of Mexican deportees arriving into dangerous localities. Caribbean and Central American countries are concerned about the effect of U.S. deportations of those with criminal records on their countries. These countries have asked the U.S. government to provide better information on deportees with criminal records and to provide reintegration assistance to help support returning nationals. DHS has begun to provide criminal history information to certain countries, and USAID has provided reception and reintegration assistance to the northern triangle countries. Mexico and Central American governments are providing increased consular services to their citizens living in the United States, including referrals to legal services for those facing deportation.", "As illegal emigration from Mexico has declined, illegal emigration of both families and unaccompanied children from Central America's northern triangle countries surged in mid-2014 and has remained at elevated levels since then. Migration flows of children and families declined somewhat in 2015 due to Mexico's increased immigration enforcement but resurged in 2016. Analysts maintain that sustainable reductions in those flows, which include asylum-seekers, would require the countries of origin and the international community to take steps to address the poor security and socioeconomic conditions causing Central Americans to migrate.", "Over the past several years, the number of undocumented Cubans entering the United States by land has increased significantly, with a majority entering through the U.S. southwest border. Although this route is not new for Cubans, the Cuban government's 2013 relaxation of its exit rules for citizens and concerns that the United States might change its immigration policy for Cubans have prompted a large increase in the number of Cubans making the overland journey. In the past year, thousands of Cubans became stranded in Central American transit countries due to changes in visa and migration policies of those governments. These developments required Mexico and Central American governments to negotiate ways for the Cubans to pass through the region and on to the U.S. southwestern border.", "The Dominican government has taken steps to address the citizenship status and rights of people of Haitian descent and undocumented individuals living in the Dominican Republic through implementation of a naturalization law and regularization plan.

High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration (see \" Central America \" and \" Mexico \" sections, below). Congress held a hearing on border security challenges in the Western Hemisphere, including the rise in African, Asian, and Haitian migration to the southwestern border that has occurred this year. Congress also conducted oversight of State Department assistance that is being implemented by DHS to bolster country and regional responses to migration challenges, and of the Central American Minors (CAM) in-country refugee/parole processing program established by the Obama Administration in late 2014. Legislation was introduced in both houses, the Secure the Northern Triangle Act ( S. 3106 and H.R. 5850 ), which would have authorized foreign assistance to address migration push factors in Central America, increased efforts against alien smuggling, and provided legal aid to Central American asylum seekers in the United States.", "For additional information, see CRS Report R43702, Unaccompanied Children from Central America: Foreign Policy Considerations , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]; CRS In Focus IF10371, U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America: Background and FY2017 Budget Request , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report R44020, In-Country Refugee Processing: In Brief , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS In Focus IF10215, Mexico's Recent Immigration Enforcement Efforts , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Insight IN10317, The Dominican Republic: Tensions with Haiti over Citizenship and Migration Issues , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RL33200, Trafficking in Persons in Latin America and the Caribbean , by [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R43926, Cuba: Issues and Actions in the 114th Congress , by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade Policy", "paragraphs": ["The Latin American and Caribbean region is one of the fastest-growing regional trading partners for the United States.

Most of this trade is with Mexico, which accounted for 72% of U.S. imports from the region and 61% of U.S. exports to the region in 2015. In 2015, total U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean were valued at $388.3 billion while U.S. imports were valued at $412.3 billion (see Table 3 ).", "The United States has strengthened economic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean over the past two decades through the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements (FTAs). Starting with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which entered into force in January 1994, the United States has entered into six FTAs involving 11 countries, including Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Peru. The United States concluded trade negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, a proposed free trade agreement among 12 countries, which include Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Some of the largest economies in South America, however, such as Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela, have resisted the idea of forming comprehensive free trade agreements with the United States. As a result, there are numerous other bilateral and plurilateral trade agreements throughout the Western Hemisphere that do not include the United States. In addition to FTAs, the United States has extended unilateral trade preferences to some countries in the region through trade preference programs such as the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA) and the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). GSP was renewed in June 2015, under the Trade Preferences Extension Act ( P.L. 114-27 ), which authorizes GSP through December 31, 2017. Most countries in the region also belong to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and are engaged in WTO multilateral trade negotiations.", "As productivity increases in countries that have an FTA with the United States, such as Mexico, numerous analysts have proposed that the United States employ trade policy to further hemispheric cooperation and focus on improving regional supply networks. The next possible step toward trade integration appeared to be the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, which potentially could have significant implications for U.S. trade and investment ties with Mexico, Chile, and Peru, as well as with Canada and seven other countries in the Pacific (other Latin American countries could possibly join in the future). The proposed TPP would have altered some rules governing trade related to NAFTA and provided updated provisions in areas such as intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, investment, services trade, worker rights, and the environment. Central American and other countries in the region were concerned that it could weaken their relative trade competitiveness, especially in the apparel and textiles industries.", "Key Policy Issues: During the 114 th Congress, the proposed TPP was of congressional interest, especially in the areas of worker rights, IPR protection, the environment, services trade, investment, regulatory cooperation, and rules-of-origin provisions. Congress also took an interest in the possible effects of a TPP on Central America. Given that three countries from Latin America are parties to the TPP, some policymakers considered options on whether the United States should broaden trade policy efforts to the region as a whole. Another issue of congressional interest was the Pacific Alliance, a trade liberalization initiative among Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. The United States was granted observer status to the Alliance in July 2013, allowing it to attend negotiating rounds and participate in other Pacific Alliance activities. Energy reform in Mexico and the implications for U.S. oil imports from Mexico and for U.S. business and investment opportunities were also of interest to Congress (also see \" Mexico ,\" below.)", "Looking ahead, President-elect Trump announced in November 2016 his intention to withdraw from the TPP.

Despite significant efforts to combat the drug trade, many governments in Latin America continue to suffer from overtaxed criminal justice systems and overwhelmed law enforcement and border control agencies. Moreover, extensive government corruption, entrenched by deeply influential criminal kingpins, frustrates efforts to interdict drugs, investigate and prosecute traffickers, and recover illicit proceeds.

Many Latin American stakeholders hoped that the April 2016 U.N. General Assembly Special Session on illicit drugs would spur further consideration of alternative drug policy options, including in particular changes in policy approaches to marijuana-related crimes.

In a major reversal that ends a central tenet of U.S.-supported counternarcotics activities in Colombia, the Colombian government announced in May 2015 the end of its campaign of aerial eradication.

All three of these groups have been designated by the U.S. State Department as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). The FARC, however, has been engaged in peace negotiations with the Colombian government since 2012, culminating in a peace accord signed in September 2016. Although the accord was narrowly rejected by a national plebiscite in early October, both sides hammered out a new peace accord in November 2016, which was ratified by Colombia's Congress at the end of that month. Negotiations between the Colombian government and the smaller ELN had several false starts in 2016, although to date formal talks with the government have not started.

Since its foundation in 1948, the OAS has served as a forum through which the United States has sought to foster regional cooperation and advance U.S. priorities in the Western Hemisphere. OAS actions reflected U.S. policy for much of the 20 th century, as other members sought to closely align themselves with the dominant economic and political power in the region. This dynamic has changed to a certain extent over the past 15 years, as Latin American and Caribbean governments have adopted more independent foreign policies. Although the core pillars of the organization's mission\u2014democracy promotion, human rights protection, economic and social development, and regional security cooperation\u2014still generally align with U.S. policy toward the region, the OAS has become less receptive to U.S. initiatives and more prone to inaction. The organization also has struggled to obtain the funding it needs to carry out its mandates.", "As OAS decisions have begun to reflect the increasing independence of the organization's member states, U.S. policymakers occasionally have expressed concerns about the direction of the organization. Some Members of Congress have asserted that the OAS is failing in its mission to support democracy and human rights, and they have argued that the U.S. government should use its influence in the organization, including funding, to compel stronger action on those issues. Others contend that the OAS remains an important forum for advancing U.S. relations with the other nations of the hemisphere and that U.S. policy should seek to strengthen the organization so it can more effectively carry out its mission.", "Key Policy Issues: The 114 th Congress continued to appropriate funding for the OAS and oversee U.S. policy at the organization. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act ( P.L. 114-113 ) provided funding for the U.S. assessed contribution to the OAS, which accounts for nearly 60% of all membership dues paid to the organization. It also provided a $2.3 million voluntary contribution for OAS development assistance programs and a $4.1 million voluntary contribution for the OAS Fund for Strengthening Democracy, which included $2 million for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). Congress passed a continuing resolution ( P.L. 114-254 ) in December 2016 that will fund most foreign operations in FY2017 at the FY2016 level, minus an across-the-board reduction of about 0.2%, until April 28, 2017.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee's FY2017 foreign operations appropriations bill, S. 3117 , would have increased assistance to the OAS, but it never received floor consideration.

The agreement went into force on November 4, 2016, after more than 72 states (representing more than 56% of global CO 2 emissions), deposited their instruments of ratification. The Paris Agreement aims at ambitious goals of greenhouse gas emission reduction and mitigation through voluntary pledges and will depend on country peer pressure to realize those goals.", "How Latin America and the Caribbean nations address climate change in 2017 and beyond may depend on the perceived risks and benefits of low-carbon growth. A single \"regional\" viewpoint is unlikely given the diversity of political perspectives, geographies, and fragmentation of efforts between regional organizations. On the other hand, there is significant consensus in Latin America that climate change is an important policy issue, according to a 2016 Pew Center study of respondents globally. Additionally, the harsh effects of the 2015-2016 stronger-than-usual El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomena has led to floods in some countries and droughts in other parts of the region, such as Central America and Bolivia.

The Administration's Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas (ECPA) was one avenue for achieving this goal. ECPA promoted clean energy technologies, built hemispheric partnerships, and developed new clean energy initiatives among governments, private industry, and civil society. After 40 different initiatives and projects launched under ECPA, new U.S. assistance concluded in FY2014, but existing projects continued through the end of FY2016. In October 2015, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry launched a $10 million clean energy initiative for Central America and the Caribbean. The effort targeted the private sector to increase financial assistance and investment in clean energy projects.

Over the years, the U.S.-Colombian relationship has broadened from counternarcotics to include humanitarian concerns; justice reform and human rights; and economic development, investment, and trade. However, Colombia is and has long been a major source country of cocaine and heroin, and drug trafficking has helped to perpetuate civil conflict by funding both left-wing and right-wing armed groups. Colombia, in close collaboration with the United States, through a broad strategy known as Plan Colombia begun in 2000, made significant progress in reestablishing government control over much of its territory, combatting drug trafficking and terrorist activities, and reducing poverty. Between FY2000 and FY2016, the U.S. Congress appropriated more than $10 billion in assistance to carry out Plan Colombia and its follow-on strategies.

Some of these actors have signaled an interest in taking over former FARC territory and criminal activities in a post-accord environment. However, the ELN has been in preparatory peace talks with the Santos Administration for more than a year, and both parties anticipate they may start formal peace talks in 2017.", "Precise costs of the government-FARC peace accord's implementation remain elusive but may exceed $30 billion over the next decade.

The policy change included talks to restore diplomatic relations (relations were reestablished in July 2015); a review of Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of international terrorism (Cuba's designation was rescinded in May 2015); and an increase in travel, commerce, and the flow of information to Cuba. In order to implement this third step, the Treasury and Commerce Departments eased the embargo regulations five times (most recently in October 2016) in such areas as travel, remittances, trade, telecommunications, and financial services.

As noted above, Congress approved a FY2017 continuing resolution, P.L. 114-254 , in December 2016 that is funding foreign aid to Mexico at the FY2016 level, minus an across-the-board reduction of almost 0.2%, until April 28, 2017.", "For additional information, see CRS Report R42917, Mexico: Background and U.S. Relations , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report R41576, Mexico: Organized Crime and Drug Trafficking Organizations , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report R41349, U.S.-Mexican Security Cooperation: The M\u00e9rida Initiative and Beyond , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]; CRS In Focus IF10400, Heroin Production in Mexico and U.S. Policy , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]; CRS In Focus IF10215, Mexico's Recent Immigration Enforcement Efforts , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RL32934, U.S.-Mexico Economic Relations: Trends, Issues, and Implications , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report RL32934, U.S.-Mexico Economic Relations: Trends, Issues, and Implications , by [author name scrubbed]; CRS Report R43312, U.S.-Mexico Water Sharing: Background and Recent Developments , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed]; and CRS Report R43313, Mexico's Oil and Gas Sector: Background, Reform Efforts, and Implications for the United States , coordinated by [author name scrubbed]."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nicaragua", "paragraphs": ["Nicaragua began to establish a democratic government in the early 1990s after its civil war ended. Its institutions remained weak, however, and since the late 1990s they have become increasingly politicized. Current President Daniel Ortega was a Sandinista ( Frente Sandinista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional , FSLN) leader when the FSLN overthrew the Somoza dictatorship in 1979. He was elected president in 1984. An electorate weary of war between the government and U.S.-backed contras denied him reelection in 1990. After three failed attempts, he won reelection in 2006 and again in 2011. Ortega has slowly consolidated Sandinista\u2014and his own\u2014control over national institutions. He won a third consecutive term in the November 6, 2016 presidential elections. The Sandinista-controlled Supreme Court issued rulings that prevented any major opposition force from running against Ortega and the FSLN. Although the constitution prohibits relatives of a sitting president from running for office, the court also ruled that Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, could run as his vice president. Many observers say that Murillo has been a de facto co-leader of the country and that this election set her up to succeed her husband. Ortega initially banned international election observers but then allowed limited observation by the Organization of American States and other groups. As in previous elections at all levels in recent years, opposition figures and international analysts strongly questioned the legitimacy of this election.", "Until recently, the United States and some other countries have responded in critical but measured terms to Ortega becoming more authoritarian. Perhaps the principal reason is that Ortega has been pragmatic in international relations, balancing his antagonistic stance against the United States and parts of Europe with cooperation on issues of mutual importance and pursuing macroeconomic policies that enable his government to maintain working relationships with multilateral financial institutions. Another reason some countries may not want to press Nicaragua on these issues is that Nicaragua is more stable and less violent than most of its Central American neighbors. In addition, there is no clear alternative to Ortega. The opposition is divided and so far has been unable to present a coherent alternative to Ortega's governance plans and programs. Since his election in 2006, Ortega has instituted many social-welfare programs to help the country's poor population, substantially reducing poverty and contributing to his popularity. For many Nicaraguans, populist measures that have improved their standard of living have appeared to outweigh Ortega's authoritarian tendencies. Controversy and conflict have been growing, however, over Ortega's decision to grant a 100-year concession for an inter-oceanic canal through Nicaragua to a private Chinese company. A broad array of Nicaraguan civil society has protested against the canal with concerns over corruption and potential damage to indigenous communities and the environment.", "In August 2016, the State Department expressed grave concern over the actions of the Nicaraguan government and Supreme Court to limit democratic space in advance of the presidential and legislative elections and called on the government to take steps to ensure fair and transparent elections and allow opposition parties to operate independently. On November 7, 2016, the State Department said that Nicaragua's \"flawed presidential and legislative electoral process ... precluded the possibility of a free and fair election on November 6.\"", "Key Policy Issues: The United States and Nicaragua cooperate on issues such as free trade and counternarcotic efforts. Currently, Nicaragua benefits from being part of the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America. Tensions rose in June 2016 when Nicaragua expelled three U.S. officials. Other U.S. concerns include violations of human rights, including restriction on citizens' rights to vote, government harassment of civil society groups, arbitrary arrests and killings by security forces, and corruption. The Administration and some Members of Congress have expressed concern about Nicaragua's relationship with Russia, especially recent military purchases. In September 2016, the House approved the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA) of 2016, H.R. 5708 , to oppose certain loans at international financial institutions for the government of Nicaragua unless it was taking effective steps to hold free, fair, and transparent elections.", "For additional information, see CRS Report R44560, Nicaragua: In Brief , by [author name scrubbed].

After Ch\u00e1vez's death, Venezuela held presidential elections in April 2013 in which acting President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who had been Ch\u00e1vez's vice president, narrowly defeated Henrique Capriles of the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), with the opposition alleging significant irregularities. In 2014, the Maduro government violently suppressed protests, with at least 43 people killed on both sides of the conflict, and imprisoned a major opposition figure, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, along with two opposition mayors.", "In December 2015, the MUD initially won a two-thirds supermajority in elections for the National Assembly, a major defeat for Chavismo and the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). The Maduro government subsequently thwarted the opposition-controlled legislature's power by preventing three MUD representatives from taking office (denying the opposition a supermajority) and using the Supreme Court to block bills approved by the legislature, including an amnesty law that would have freed political prisoners.", "For much of 2016, opposition efforts were focused on recalling President Maduro through a national referendum, but the government slowed down the referendum process and suspended it indefinitely in October. In late October, after an appeal by Pope Francis, the government and most of the opposition (with the exception of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez's Popular Will party) agreed to talks mediated by the Vatican, along with the former presidents of the Dominican Republic, Spain, and Panama and the head of the Union of South American Nations. Some opposition activists strongly criticized the dialogue as a way for the government to avoid taking any real actions, such as releasing all political prisoners. A round of talks planned for early December was suspended until January 2017, and many observers are pessimistic about the future of the dialogue. ", "Since mid-2014, the rapid decline in the price of oil has hit Venezuela hard, with a contracting economy (projected -8.0% in 2016), high inflation (projected 2016 year-end inflation of 720%), declining international reserves, and increasing poverty\u2014all exacerbated by the Maduro government's economic mismanagement. The economic situation has increased poverty, with increasing shortages of food and medicines and high rates of violent crime. ", "U.S. policymakers and Members of Congress have had concerns for more than a decade about the deterioration of human rights and democratic conditions in Venezuela and the government's lack of cooperation on antidrug and counterterrorism efforts. After a 2014 government-opposition dialogue failed, the Administration imposed visa restrictions and asset-blocking sanctions on Venezuelan officials involved in human rights abuses. ", "The Obama Administration continued to speak out about the democratic setback and poor human rights situation, called repeatedly for the release of political prisoners, expressed deep concern about the humanitarian situation, and strongly supported dialogue. The Administration also supported the efforts Organization of American States Secretary General Luis Almagro to focus attention on Venezuela's democratic setback.", "Key Policy Issues: Over the past several years, developments in Venezuela and U.S. relations with the country have largely been oversight issues for Congress, but the 113 th Congress enacted legislation\u2014the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act of 2014 ( P.L. 113-278 ) in December 2014\u2014to impose targeted sanctions on those responsible for certain human rights abuses. In July 2016, the 114 th Congress enacted legislation ( P.L. 114-194 ) to extend the Venezuela sanctions through December 2019. In September 2016, the House approved H.Res. 851 , which expressed profound concern about the humanitarian situation, urged the release of political prisoners, and called for the Venezuelan government to hold the recall referendum this year. In the Senate, a similar but not identical resolution, S.Res. 537 , was reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December 2016.

The FY2017 request was for $5.5 million. The report to the House version of the foreign aid appropriations bill, H.R. 5912 ( H.Rept. 114-693 ), would have provided $8 million in democracy funding for Venezuela, whereas the report to the Senate version of the bill, S. 3117 ( S.Rept. 114-290 ), would fully fund the Administration's request for $5.5 million, but noted that additional funds would be made available if further programmatic opportunities in Venezuela arose. As previously noted, the 114 th Congress did not complete action on FY2017 appropriations but approved a continuing resolution ( P.L. 114-254 ) in December 2016 providing funding through April 28, 2017, at the FY2016 level, minus an across-the-board reduction of almost 0.2%. Several congressional hearings in the 114 th Congress also focused on the situation in Venezuela (see Appendix ).

However, some changes are possible in relations with Mexico (focusing more on border security), policy toward Cuba (potentially reversing some of the Obama Administration's executive actions), and trade policy toward the region, given that the President-elect announced his intention to withdraw from the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and to examine the ramifications of withdrawing from NAFTA."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
