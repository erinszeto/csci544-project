Whether to establish, amend, or abolish national monuments is of current interest. Congress has broad authority to take these actions, and has created national monuments on federal lands and has increased and decreased monument sizes on numerous occasions. In establishing and amending national monuments, questions for Congress include the optimal size of the areas to be protected and the extent to which various land uses and activities will be allowed, barred, or restricted. In the past, Congress, but not the President, has abolished some monuments and converted others to different protective designations, such as national parks. Whether the President has authority to abolish national monuments is debated and has not been tested in courts. Congress also oversees presidential exercise of authority to proclaim monuments and has considered measures to alter this authority. ", "Controversy over presidential monument designations is one component of a broader debate over federal land ownership and management. Discontent over federal land management has sometimes led to conflict, as in the 2016 takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. A central issue in this debate is the extent to which the federal government should dispose of, retain, or acquire lands. Some stakeholders seek disposal to foster state and local ownership and control over federal lands and resources, especially in the West, where federal lands are concentrated. Advocates of federal land retention and acquisition point to benefits of federal ownership, including protection of resources and public access for recreation. Another focus is the condition of federal lands and infrastructure. Debates also encompass the extent to which federal lands should be developed and/or open to recreation and whether they should be managed primarily to produce local or national benefits.

According to the Secretary, the monument size was not the \"smallest area compatible\" with care of the objects requiring protection. The Secretary further asserted that some areas within the monument have other congressional or administrative designations, making \"unnecessary\" their protection under the Antiquities Act; some monument lands would be better managed as other types of designations, such as national recreation areas; some management provisions are too restrictive; and tribes do not have an \"adequate role\" in managing the monument.

Rather, the final report provided that \"[r]ecommendations for specific monument modifications reflecting the above considerations will be submitted separately from this Final Report should you concur with my recommendations.\"", "The number of recommendations per monument ranged from one recommendation for each of three marine monuments (Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, Pacific Remote Islands, and Rose Atoll), to six recommendations for each of two monuments (Bears Ears and Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks). The most common recommendation was to amend the proclamations for specified purposes. For 8 of the 10 monuments, the Secretary recommended amending the proclamations, whereas for the other 2 monuments\u2014Pacific Remote Islands Marine and Rose Atoll Marine\u2014the Secretary recommended either amending the proclamations or making boundary revisions.

For these six monuments, as well as Katahdin Woods and Waters, the Secretary recommended similar changes to agency management plans or development of plans with these emphases. The other four proclamations would be amended for a primary purpose, either regarding commercial fishing for certain marine monuments (Northeast Canyons and Seamounts, Pacific Remote Islands, and Rose Atoll) or active timber management for Katahdin Woods and Waters. ", "Boundary changes were proposed for four national monuments: Bears Ears, Cascade-Siskiyou, Gold Butte, and Grand Staircase-Escalante. As mentioned, for two additional monuments\u2014Pacific Remote Islands Marine and Rose Atoll Marine\u2014the Secretary recommended either amending the proclamations or making boundary revisions. For all but Grand Staircase-Escalante, the Secretary specified the purposes of the boundary changes, and these purposes differed among the monuments. In the case of Bears Ears, the boundaries would be revised \"to protect objects and ensure the size is conducive to [their] effective protection.\" The Gold Butte boundary change would \"protect historic water rights.\" The Cascade-Siskiyou revision pertained to allowing sustained timber yield and reducing impacts on private lands, whereas the Pacific Remote Islands Marine and Rose Atoll Marine boundary adjustments related to allowing commercial fishing.

The final report identified these areas as Camp Nelson in Kentucky, the Medgar Evers Home in Mississippi, and the Badger-Two Medicine area in Montana. The Secretary recommended that these three areas be evaluated for national monument designation.", "The Secretary recommended that the President ask Congress to take certain actions. They included clarifying the limits of executive authority under the Antiquities Act and the intent of Congress regarding land use in monument areas containing other protective designations. ", "According to the Secretary, DOI has sometimes been too restrictive in implementing monument management plans for protection of monument objects, so as \"to impede allowable uses\" on monument lands.

Such modifications have included enlargement or diminishment of monument boundaries and other changes, as shown in Table 3 . ", "Secretary Zinke's final report does not specifically recommend monument enlargements, and has been generally interpreted as likely recommending reductions instead. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in the past, Presidents have expanded existing monuments on 76 occasions, as shown in Table 3 . These enlargements were made over the past century, with the first in 1909 and the last in 2017. They were of widely varying acreages and percentages of the sizes of the original monuments. The biggest acreage expansion occurred in 2016, when President Obama enlarged the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument by 283.4 million acres, more than quadrupling the size of the monument to approximately 373 million acres. The largest expansion of a terrestrial monument occurred in 1931, when President Hoover expanded the Katmai National Monument by 1,609,600 acres, a 148% increase over the 1,088,000 acreage at establishment. By contrast, in 1958, President Eisenhower proclaimed the smallest acreage expansion, by adding 0.15 acres to the Tumac\u00e1cori National Monument. Some monuments have been expanded multiple times. For instance, four different Presidents enlarged the Muir Woods National Monument following its establishment in 1908.", "Past Presidents also have diminished national monuments, although less frequently than they have expanded them. Specifically, Presidents reduced monuments on 12 occasions, with the first such action occurring in 1911 and the most recent in 1960. The diminishments varied widely in terms of acreages and percentages of the original monument sizes. Acreage reductions ranged from 52 acres, in 1941 for the Wupatki National Monument, to 313,280 acres, in 1915 for the Mount Olympus National Monument, as shown in Table 4 . Percentage reductions varied from 0.03%, in 1912 for the Mount Olympus National Monument, to 89%, in 1912 for the Navajo National Monument. Some monuments have been reduced multiple times. Three different Presidents diminished Mount Olympus National Monument following its establishment in 1909, for example. ", "The final report does not make clear whether the Secretary proposed boundary changes that would both remove areas from one part of a monument while adding acreage to another area of the monument. Since enactment of the Antiquities Act, six presidential proclamations have both enlarged and diminished national monuments, as shown in Table 5 . These proclamations all were issued between 1956 and 1963. They typically added acreage to one area of a monument and removed acreage from another portion of the monument. Of the six proclamations, four removed more land than was added, thus reducing the size overall; one added more land than was removed, for a net gain in land; and one added and removed the same number of acres, resulting in no change in size. The six proclamations reflected varying percentages of change to the original monument sizes, ranging from -20% to +179%. ", "Presidential changes to monument sizes have sometimes occurred after congressional enactment of revisions to monument boundaries/sizes, and have included both enlargement and diminishment of monuments. The Craters of the Moon National Monument, established by presidential proclamation in 1924, offers two examples. In the first example, following congressional removal of areas from the monument in 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt further diminished the monument (1941), and then President Kennedy enlarged it (1962). In the second example, following congressional revision in 1996 in the form of enlargement of some areas of the monument and diminishment of others, President Clinton enlarged the monument in 2000. The Pinnacles National Monument provides a third example. In 1976, Congress added areas to the monument; in 2000, President Clinton further enlarged the monument.", "The final report did not recommend the abolition of any national monuments. The Antiquities Act does not expressly authorize a President to abolish a national monument established by an earlier presidential proclamation, and no President has done so. There have been no court cases deciding the issue of the authority of the President to abolish a national monument.", "The final report recommends amending monument proclamations regarding resource management. On eight occasions, between 1911 and 2007, Presidents have issued proclamations whose primary purpose was other than to enlarge or diminish monument size, as shown in Table 6 . Two of the eight proclamations appear to pertain to resource management. In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt modified the Katmai National Monument to make the reservations in the earlier proclamations subject to valid existing rights, since maintained. In 2007, President George W. Bush amended the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument regarding conditions for issuing permits for Native Hawaiian practices, as well as to change the name (from Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument). Another two of the eight proclamations, for Great Sand Dunes and Buck Island Reef, revised the descriptions of the areas included in the monuments. The Great Sand Dunes revision followed a resurvey, and the Buck Island revision sought to correct an error. The remaining four proclamations essentially affirmed the monument boundaries.", "The final report recommended that three areas be evaluated for national monument designation. Since the enactment of the Antiquities Act in 1906, Presidents have established 157 national monuments. ", "Congress, too, has created national monuments on federal lands on numerous occasions under its constitutional authority to enact legislation regarding federal lands. This authority is not defined or limited by the provisions of the Antiquities Act. For instance, Congress could enact legislation providing more land uses than are typical for national monuments created by the President, such as allowing new commercial development, or could choose to provide additional protections. ", "Congress also has modified monuments (including those created by the President)\u2014for instance, by changing their boundaries. Congress has abolished some monuments outright and converted others into different protective designations, such as national parks. Approximately half of the current national parks were first designated as national monuments, for instance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appendix.
