The heads of executive agencies would be required to establish policies under which employees (with some exceptions) could be eligible to participate in telework. Employee participation in telework must not diminish either employee performance or agency operations (Senate-passed H.R. 1722) or agency operations and performance (House-passed H.R. 1722).

The Senate-passed version of the bill would require an employee to enter into a written agreement with the agency before participating in telework. The Senate- and House-passed H.R. 1722 would require each executive agency to appoint a Telework Managing Officer, who would be responsible for implementing the telework policies; provide training to managers, supervisors, and employees participating in telework; provide for telework to be incorporated into Continuity of Operations (COOP) plans; require the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to submit annual reports on telework to Congress, and require the Comptroller General (CG) to review the OPM report and then annually report to Congress on the progress of executive agencies in implementing telework; and require the CG to annually submit a report to Congress on telework at the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The Senate-passed H.R. 1722 would require the agency Chief Human Capital Officers (CHCOs) to annually report to the chair and vice-chair of the CHCO Council on telework in their organizations.
