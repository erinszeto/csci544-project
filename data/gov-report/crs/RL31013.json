General Hospital. ", "Reform in the city's delivery of health care to the poor was sought by Congress because of the well-documented problems of the PBC and its mismanagement ofD.C. General Hospital. Since 1997, the PBC amassed $109 million in unbudgetedloans from the city, using its power to borrow from the city's general fund inanticipation of Medicaid reimbursements. These unbudgeted loans were used by thePBC to cover deficit spending and defer mounting debt. However, the hospital dida poor job in seeking reimbursement for treatment. In addition to its poor financialmanagement, the PBC had been the subject of newspaper stories detailingquestionable hiring practices, including the hiring of friends and relatives of citycouncil members and former associates of the Executive Director of the PBC. ThePBC was also the subject of a critical report by health care consultants CambioHealth Solutions. Hired by the PBC in 2000, the consultants criticized the PBC for:(1) a lack of oversight by the PBC's board of directors, (2) poor patient care, (3)undocumented or poorly documented overtime, and (4) the lack of health careexperience among some members of the PBC's management team.

On March 6, 2001, the city council unanimously passeda resolution rejecting the Authority's recommendation for the awarding of a contractfor health care services for the uninsured to Greater Southeast Community Hospital.Several city council members expressed concern that the privatization proposalwould erect new barriers to care for the city's 65,000 uninsured residents. Themajority of the city council preferred keeping D.C. General as a full-service hospital.Their plan involved providing the hospital with $21 million in assistance that wouldhave been used to keep it open until the end of the fiscal year, which was also the endof the control period and the Authority's powers. During this time, the city couldfind a more permanent solution short of downsizing or closing the hospital. After2001, the city council would be in a strong position to override the mayor's vetowithout the threat of the control board negating their veto override.", "On April 30, 2001, the Authority used its veto power to negate a city council 's override of a mayoral veto of the $21 million city council proposal that would havekept D.C. General Hospital open until September 30, 2001, the end of the 2001 fiscalyear. In addition, the Authority voted to dissolve the PBC and transferred itsresponsibilities to the city's Department of Health. The Authority signed anagreement with Greater Southeast Community Hospital Corporation and theHealthcare Alliance to provide health care services to the city's uninsured residents. The Authority's actions were controversial and represented a departure from its morerecent efforts to allow the city's elected officials--the mayor and the city council--towork out their policy differences. The action was taken after the city council rejectedthe mayor's proposal for revamping the city's health care service delivery system andvoted on April 27, 2001, to override a mayoral veto and provide $21 million inFY2001 supplemental assistance to the PBC.", "The control board's constitutional authority to exercise such power was challenged in court by two members of the city council and several unionsrepresenting hospital employees. On April 30, 2001, city council members KevinChavous and David Cantania filed suit in the United States District Court for theDistrict of Columbia challenging the Authority's powers to award the contract forhealth care services and to dissolve the PBC. The council members' suit argues thatthe control board acted without statutory authority and over the objection of the citycouncil, which on March 6, 2001, unanimously passed a resolution rejecting theAuthority's recommendation for the awarding of a contract for health care servicesfor the uninsured to Greater Southeast Community Hospital. The court, which issuedits opinion on August 6, 2001, found that only the council members had standing tobring suit against the Authority.

Nearly 10,000 students--one inevery 10 students--are enrolled in one of the approximately 34 public charter schoolsin the District. At least 17 of these schools were chartered by the Board ofEducation, with the remainder receiving charters from the Public Charter SchoolBoard, which was created by Congress when its passed charter school legislation in1996. The lack of consistency between the two governing bodies charged with granting and overseeing charter schools, and the increased costs of regulating charterschools are two of the concerns about the existence of two chartering authorities.

", "On September 6, 2001, city and school officials announced an $80 million budget deficit for FY2001. The overspending, mostly cost overruns in specialeducation and the failure to document properly special education expenses submittedfor Medicaid reimbursement, will be offset by hiring freezes, fund transfers, andunanticipated growth in tax revenue. Though the deficit does not jeopardize thecity's return to home rule, the unanticipated overspending was a source ofembarrassment for school officials, the CFO, and the city's elected leaders. In orderto deal with the deficit, school board officials announced that they were consideringshortening the school year by 7 days.
