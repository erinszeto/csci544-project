Most research has found a positive relationship between monetary policy independence and economic outcomes. (Research is more divided on whether there is a positive relationship between Fed discretion and economic outcomes.)

The basic governance structure is largely unchanged in recent decades. The Fed is composed of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks overseen by a Board of Governors in Washington, DC. The board comprises seven governors nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The President selects (and the Senate confirms) a chair and two vice chairs for the Board from among the governors. The governors serve nonrenewable 14-year terms, but the chair and vice chairs serve renewable 4-year terms. Board members are chosen without regard to political affiliation. ", "In general, the board formulates policy and the regional banks carry it out. Monetary policy decisions, however, are made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed of the seven governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and four other regional bank presidents. The chair of the Board is also the chair of the FOMC. Representation for these 4 seats rotates among the other 11 regional banks. Thus, the governors have more votes on the FOMC than the regional bank presidents when all board positions are filled; however, the board has experienced frequent vacancies in recent years. The FOMC meets at least every six weeks to set monetary policy. ", "Aside from its permanent seat on the FOMC, the New York Fed has no special role in the Federal Reserve Act compared with other Fed regional banks. Nevertheless, it has taken on certain prominent roles within the system. It carries out the open market operations that implement the FOMC's monetary policy decisions. During the financial crisis, the New York Fed ran many of the Fed's emergency programs (discussed in the \" Emergency Lending \" section below). It supervises many of the largest banks because they are headquartered in the New York Fed's district. The New York Fed is responsible for conducting foreign exchange transactions on behalf of the government and storing the gold of foreign central banks and international agencies. In all of these instances, it is executing, not formulating, policy. By tradition, the FOMC elects the New York Fed president to be vice chair of the FOMC, a position with no formal powers.", "The Fed's capital comprises paid-in capital issued to member banks and retained earnings deposited in its surplus account. P.L. 114-94 included a provision that capped the Fed's surplus at $10 billion. Private banks regulated by the Fed buy stock in the Fed to become member banks. Membership is mandatory for national banks, but optional for state banks. To finance the creation of the Fed, the Federal Reserve Act required member banks to purchase Fed-issued stock. Member banks are required to purchase (\"pay in\") stock equal to 3% of their capital, and the Fed has the option to call in an additional 3%. The stock can be thought of as a risk-free investment; it pays fixed dividends of 6% for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. Ownership of stock in the Fed confers more limited rights than common stock in a private corporation. For example, stockholders have no control over Fed policy.", "Stockholders choose two-thirds of the board of directors at the regional Fed banks, however. Each regional Fed bank has a board that is composed of three Class A directors, required to be representatives of the banking industry chosen by member banks; three Class B directors, representatives of the public chosen by member banks; and three Class C directors, representatives of the public chosen by the Board of Governors. A chairman and deputy chairman of the board are selected from among the Class C directors. The other main difference between the classes of directors is their role in choosing the regional bank presidents. Regional bank presidents are chosen by the Class B and C directors of their boards\u2014not by the President\u2014and must be approved by the Board of Governors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Two debates about the Fed's governance structure have to do with the relative power of various actors within the Federal Reserve System. The first is about the relative voting weight of regional bank presidents vis-\u00e0-vis the Board of Governors on the FOMC. The second is about the role of the private member banks.", "FOMC Composition. The Board of Governors is responsible for setting policy in most areas, but a key exception is monetary policy, which is set by the FOMC. Currently, responsibility for monetary policy is shared on the FOMC between the Board and the regional bank presidents, with the former receiving seven votes and the latter receiving five votes. Further, because the Fed presidents rotate on the FOMC, certain regional banks have no FOMC representation one of every two or two of every three years, with the exception of the New York Fed.", "Some view regional bank presidents as more \"hawkish\" on inflation than governors, implying that increasing their voting power on the FOMC would lead to a more hawkish monetary policy. This view should be caveated by a number of considerations. First, the FOMC is statutorily mandated to pursue low inflation and has unanimously adopted a 2% inflation target. Second, most FOMC decisions are unanimous or have at most one or two dissents. Dissents, since the 1990s, are much more likely to be lodged by presidents than governors, but a dissent can be made on dovish or hawkish grounds. Third, governors are nominated by the President, and to the extent that governors reflect the President's view, it would be expected that more hawkish Presidents select more hawkish governors, and vice versa. Thus, the relative hawkishness of regional bank presidents compared with governors would not be static over time. Fourth, regional Fed presidents do not vote as a block; instead, each president's voting pattern is highly individual. Recently, all dissents have been lodged by the same few regional bank presidents (some as hawks and some as doves), and many regional bank presidents never dissent. Thus, an effort to tilt monetary policy to a more (or less) hawkish stance would succeed only if the inflationary views of regional bank presidents could be accurately identified before they were selected. Finally, the fact that the Fed chair has not lost an FOMC vote since the 1930s\u2014or come close to losing since 1983 \u2014suggests that the chair either dominates decisions or successfully forges a consensus among FOMC members. Neither scenario supports the view that a change in the FOMC's composition would change monetary policy more than marginally. (It might reduce the chair's influence, since governors have dissented less frequently than presidents in recent decades.)", "For these reasons, changing the voting balance on the FOMC may have greater governance implications than economic implications\u2014particularly because inflation has been below 4% for the year in each year since 1991. Namely, a change would affect how centralized monetary policymaking would be, with some researchers finding that regional banks presidents base their votes more on local than national economic conditions. It would also affect\u2014for better or worse \u2014how democratically accountable the FOMC would be, in the sense that the governors are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, whereas the regional bank presidents are selected by regional bank board members (subject to approval by the Board of Governors). Thus, some observers have questioned whether the bank presidents are less partisan or more aligned with banking industry views in their voting patterns, for reasons discussed in the next section. ", "Role of Private Banks. Private banks that are members of the Federal Reserve system are regulated by the Fed and are required to own shares in the Fed. This raises the question of what rights that ownership stake should confer given the inherent conflict of interest posed by a regulator being owned by the entities it regulates. In addition, policies that limit the banking industry's relationship with the Fed limit the Fed's ability to take advantage of the industry's expertise on the Fed's various other responsibilities.", "Ownership of stock in the Fed confers more limited rights than common stock in a private corporation. For example, owners have no control over Fed policy. But member banks choose six of the nine directors on each regional Fed's board, three of whom are required to be from the banking industry (i.e., Class A directors). Membership also gives banks opportunities to advise the Fed through fora such as the Fed's Federal Advisory Council. Other policies are in place to minimize the conflict of interest. For example, Class A directors do not participate in budget or personnel decisions.", "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ) stripped Class A directors of their vote to select their Fed regional bank's president and first vice president. This further limited the conflict of interest posed by private bank ownership of the Fed, but reduced the member banks' rights as owners.

CBO estimated that this provision will increase revenues by $1.75 billion on net over 10 years. CBO assumed that the Fed will finance the transfer by selling Treasury securities, which otherwise would have earned $0.7 billion in income that would have been remitted to the Treasury in the next 10 years. Thus, the provision can be thought of as shifting Fed remittances from the future to the present, as opposed to representing new economic resources available to the federal government.

At these hearings, which take place in February and July, the Fed chairman presents the Fed's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress , testifies, and responds to questions from committee members. In addition, these committees periodically hold more focused hearings on Fed topics.

In addition, private-sector auditors audit the Fed's financial statements and the Fed has an Office of Inspector General. The Dodd-Frank Act ( P.L. 111-203 ) required an audit of the Fed's emergency activities during the financial crisis, released in July 2011, and an audit of Fed governance, released in October 2011. The effective result of the audit restrictions remaining in law is that GAO can audit the Fed's monetary policy decisions or operations, transactions with foreign central banks and governments, discount window operations, or policies related to bank reserves or securities credit for waste, fraud, and abuse, but cannot evaluate the economic merits of these actions.", "The Fed's budget is not subject to congressional appropriations, limiting congressional oversight compared with appropriated agencies. Although Congress still sometimes attaches Fed \"policy riders\" to appropriations acts, in the absence of agency appropriations, Congress cannot prescribe the size or uses of the Fed's budget. The Fed is self-funded by fees and the income generated by securities it owns. Its income exceeds its expenses, and it remits most of its net income to the Treasury, where it is used to reduce the federal debt. The Fed uses a small portion of its net income to pay dividends to member banks and to add to its surplus when necessary.", "For Fed disclosure, the Fed has publicly released extensive information on its operations, mostly on a voluntary basis. It is statutorily required to release an annual report and a weekly summary of its balance sheet. The expanded scope of the Fed's lending activities during the financial crisis eventually led it to release a monthly report that offered more detailed information. In December 2010, the Fed released individual lending records for emergency facilities, revealing borrowers' identities and loans' terms, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Going forward, individual records for discount window and open market operation transactions have been released with a two-year lag.

In its rulemaking, the Fed follows the standard notice and public comment process and must consider the burdens and benefits for depository institutions, but is not required to conduct formal or quantitative cost-benefit analysis. The Fed has an ombudsman and an appeals process for its supervisory decisions, such as exam results.

Most economists believe that the Fed's political independence leads to better policy outcomes and makes policy more effective by enhancing the Fed's credibility in the eyes of market participants. The Fed has opposed legislation removing remaining GAO audit restrictions on those grounds. Disclosure helps Congress and the public better understand the Fed's actions. Up to a point, this makes monetary and regulatory policies more effective, but too much disclosure could make both less effective because they rely on market-sensitive and confidential information. The challenge for Congress is to strike the right balance between a desire for the Fed to be responsive to Congress and for the Fed's decisions to be immune from political calculations and pressure.", "A different standard of oversight and independence for monetary policy and the Fed's regulatory role might be conceptually desirable, but difficult to disentangle in reality.

Thus, it can be used in an economic model (which offers a simplified version of the actual economy) to represent the Fed's decisions under normal economic conditions.", "A limitation of the Taylor rule is that it was designed only to be used with the federal funds rate, which was the Fed's primary monetary policy instrument from roughly the early 1990s to late 2008. From December 2008 to October 2014, the Fed did not use the federal funds rate as its primary policy tool because the rate was at the \"zero lower bound\"\u2014it was set near zero, and thus could not be lowered further. Instead, the Fed created new policy tools such as \"quantitative easing\" (QE) to stimulate the economy. The Taylor rule cannot make policy prescriptions at the zero lower bound\u2014different combinations of deflation (falling prices) and output gaps would prescribe a negative federal funds rate under the Taylor rule, but that prescription would not be actionable because the federal funds rate is a market rate. The Taylor rule was devised at a time when interest rates had never fallen to the zero bound before, and it arguably seemed reasonable at the time to assume that the rule would not need to cover this contingency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["Economists and policy analysts have debated whether basing monetary policy decisions on a Taylor rule would lead to better economic outcomes than the status quo. The Fed already uses the\u00a0Taylor rule as a reference tool to help inform its policy decisions. Proponents would like the Taylor rule to have a more formal role in policymaking, either requiring policy to be set by a Taylor rule or requiring the Fed to explain its decisions relative to a Taylor rule following each FOMC meeting. (The Fed already presents a comparison of its current monetary policy to various Taylor rules in its semiannual Monetary Policy Report to Congress.) Under current law, if the Fed desired, it could arguably adopt these proposals voluntarily (e.g., the FOMC could agree to base their vote on a Taylor rule's prescription). Legislative changes would be needed to require the Fed to adopt these proposals, however. ", "The desirability of basing policy on a Taylor rule (whether it takes the form presented above or an alternative form) can be viewed through the prism of the economic debate about the superiority of rules versus discretion in policymaking. Economists who favor the use of rules argue that policy is more effective if it is predictable and transparent. They argue that unpredictable policy results in financial and economic instability. For example, there can be large movements in financial prices when the Fed makes a policy change that \"surprises\" financial markets. In addition, a formal role for a Taylor rule could potentially help Congress in its oversight capacity by providing a clear benchmark against which the Fed's decisions could be evaluated.", "Economists favoring discretion argue that policymakers need flexibility to manage an inherently complex economy that is regularly hit by unexpected shocks. For example, rules might have hindered the Fed's ability to respond to the housing bubble and the financial crisis in the late 2000s. In principle, a Taylor rule need not be limited to inflation and the output gap, but making it more complex would reduce the perceived benefits of transparency and predictability. Likewise, periodically modifying the form that the Taylor rule takes in response to unforeseen events would reduce predictability and increase discretion. Further, how could a Taylor rule incorporate amorphous concerns about, say, financial stability or asset bubbles when there is no consensus on how to quantify them? A Taylor rule requires data points that are easy to measure and accurately embody a larger economic phenomenon of concern. Using forecasts would probably be preferable to using actual data in the Taylor rule because monetary policy affects the economy with lags, but would potentially reintroduce policy discretion (because the Fed would produce the forecast). Furthermore, if perceived policy errors were mainly caused by forecasting errors (e.g., the failure to identify the housing bubble), then using a Taylor rule based on forecasts would probably not have prevented them. Any of these issues could be addressed by modifying the Taylor rule, but this would arguably reduce the perceived benefits of a rules-based regime.", "Other practical challenges with formalizing the use of the traditional Taylor rule in policymaking include (1) the requisite data are released with lags and later revised; (2) the neutral rate of interest and potential output growth cannot be directly observed and may vary over time, making them difficult to estimate accurately in real time; (3) a FFR based only on inflation and the output gap would make it more volatile; (4) public comprehension; and (5) how to address the zero bound issue. ", "Originally, rules were favored by economists who believed that Fed discretion was responsible for high inflation, but inflation has been low since the 1990s and below 2% by the Fed's preferred measure since 2013. Recently, Taylor rules have been used to support criticism that the Fed has engaged in too much stimulus. Policy rules in general do not inherently have a pro- or anti-stimulus bias, however, as their parameters can be adjusted to meet policymakers' goals. Policymakers who emphasize price stability could put a relatively high weight on the inflation parameter. Alternatively, policymakers who want the Fed to be responsive to (high or low) growth could put a relatively high weight on the output gap parameter. Because the form that a Taylor rule takes involves, in part, value judgments about the goals of monetary policy and the best way to achieve those goals, choosing its form involves political trade-offs and economic modeling.", "As mentioned above, as long as the Fed prefers discretionary policy, it can only be forced to adopt rules-based policy through legislation. It would arguably be difficult, however, for Congress to determine what would be the best form of Taylor rule for the Fed to follow or when the Fed should be allowed to deviate from the rule's prescription. It needs the Fed's cooperation to devise and implement a rules-based policy, but the Fed has little incentive to \"tie its own hands.\" If Congress wanted the Fed to adhere to both the spirit and letter of any law that reduced the Fed's discretion, it may need to find legal carrots or sticks to succeed. But exposing the Fed to negative consequences when it does not follow the monetary policy that Congress prefers would be antithetical to the Fed's independence from Congress. It would provide Congress a new avenue to potentially apply political pressure on the Fed's monetary policymaking, even if that is not the proponents' intent. Thus, the challenge for proponents of rules-based policy is how to ensure less discretion without compromising the Fed's independence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Proposals", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 10 would require the Fed to formulate a mathematical rule (called the \"Directive Policy Rule\") that would instruct it how to set monetary policy (e.g., prescribe the current level of the federal funds rate) that would achieve its mandate of stable prices and maximum employment based on macroeconomic variables.
