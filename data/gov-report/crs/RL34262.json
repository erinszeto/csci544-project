Vietnam was the third largest source of clothing imports for the United States in 2006, behind (in order) China and Mexico.", "Much of that growth was the result of the gradual liberalization of U.S. trade policy towards Vietnam. Although the United States terminated its trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994, trade initially remained low because Vietnam did not have \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status. The signing of a bilateral trade agreement in July 2000 allowed President Clinton to grant Vietnam temporary NTR status (effective December 2001), leading to a sharp increase in U.S. imports from Vietnam, including clothing. The rise in Vietnamese clothing imports led to the United States to push Vietnam into a bilateral textile agreement in 2003 that set quantity quotas on the import of selected clothing items. The bilateral textile agreement remained in effect until the United States granted Vietnam permanent NTR status on December 20, 2006, as part of its accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO).", "The liberalization of U.S. trade policy towards Vietnam raised concerns about possible dumping by Vietnamese clothing exporters. Some Members of Congress and U.S. clothing and textile companies argued that a surge in Vietnamese imports may harm the U.S. clothing and textile industry. In part to secure Senate passage of permanent NTR status for Vietnam, the Bush Administration agreed to establish a \"monitoring program\" for selected clothing imports from Vietnam. From its inception, there have been questions about the legality and effectiveness of the monitoring program.", "On October 26, 2007, the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced the completion of its first six-month review of the monitoring data, finding that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the self-initiation of an antidumping investigation. On May 6, 2008, the DOC announced its second six-month review of the monitoring data had come to the same conclusion.", "There are a range of actions that Congress might take with regard to U.S. trade policy towards Vietnam. Congress could take no action. Alternatively, Congress could revisit the question of the DOC's legal authority to establish the monitoring program, as well as examine the issue of the compatibility of the monitoring program with existing WTO agreements and commitments. Congress could investigate Vietnam's compliance with its promise to terminate all WTO-prohibited subsidies. Congress could also enact legislation designed to counteract perceived unfair Vietnamese trade practices. Congress could examine the design and conduct of the monitoring program to ascertain if it provides a reasonable basis for determining the need for an antidumping investigation and/or examine claims that the monitoring program has adversely affected trade with and investments in Vietnam. This report will be updated as circumstances warrant."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In the relatively short period of time since the United States resumed \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) with Vietnam in 2001, there have been several controversies regarding the importation of clothing from Vietnam into the United States. The controversies surrounding U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam include allegations of dumping, illegal transshipments, violations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, and a controversial import monitoring program. In addition, U.S. trade policy governing the import of Vietnamese clothing has changed course several times, leading to claims of significant market disruption and regulatory uncertainty. These claims are bolstered by the volatility of U.S. import data for Vietnamese clothing over the last seven years.", "There have been several shifts in U.S. trade policy with Vietnam since it was first granted NTR status in 2001 that have possibly affected U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam. A bilateral trade agreement concluded on July 13, 2000, significantly lowered tariff rates on clothing imported from Vietnam. A bilateral textile agreement that ran from May 1, 2003, until January 11, 2007, imposed quantity quotas on the import of certain categories of clothing imported from Vietnam. Also, as part of its accession into the WTO, Vietnam entered into an agreement with the United States that, among other provisions, requires that Vietnam terminate various non-WTO compliant subsidy programs for its clothing and textiles industries. Finally, on December 8, 2006, Congress passed legislation granting Vietnam permanent NTR status as of December 29, 2006.", "Much of the recent contention about Vietnamese clothing exports to the United States has focused on the U.S. Department of Commerce's (DOC) implementation of an \"import monitoring program\" for selected categories of Vietnamese clothing on the day Vietnam joined the WTO\u2014January 11, 2007. The announced import monitoring program began on the same day Vietnam joined the WTO and is to expire with the end of the Bush Administration (taken to be January 19, 2008, by the DOC). Under the program, the DOC will collect monthly data on the quantity and unit values of five categories of clothing imported from Vietnam\u2014shirts, sweaters, swimwear, trousers, and underwear\u2014to determine if there is sufficient evidence to warrant the self-initiation of an anti-dumping investigation.", "While acknowledging that the program would have \"an impact on a broad array of parties,\" the DOC maintained that the monitoring of some Vietnamese clothing imports \"is not meant to inhibit legitimate trade.\" Supporters of the program\u2014principally U.S. textile manufacturers\u2014maintain that the monitoring is necessary because the Vietnamese government is \"illegally\" subsidizing its clothing industry and that Vietnamese exporters are dumping their products in the United States. According to the program's backers, the data being collected by the monitoring program will provide the necessary evidence to initiate an anti-dumping action against Vietnamese clothing exports. Opponents of the program\u2014a mixture of clothing manufacturers, retailers and importers\u2014assert that the collection of the data violates various provisions of the WTO agreement, runs counter to past anti-dumping practices, and has already had a negative effect on Vietnam's exports to the United States.", "Interest in the monitoring program was heightened by expectations of the DOC's first formal review of the Vietnamese clothing imports being monitored. According to the Federal Register announcement of the program, the DOC \"intends to conduct its formal evaluations of the information gathered under the monitoring program on a biannual basis.\" The DOC has also indicated that the categories of products covered by the monitoring program (shirts, sweaters, swimwear, trousers, and underwear) are not \"static,\" and may be changed \"in response to input received from interested parties, changes in the trade, or as the Department [of Commerce] broadens its understanding of the composition and structure of the domestic textile and apparel industry.\"", "Trade statistics for the first six months of 2007 provided some support to both supporters and opponents of the monitoring program (see Table 1 ). U.S. imports of sweaters made in Vietnam from January to June 2007 increased by over 85% when compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, the volume of shirts and trousers imported from Vietnam\u2014the two largest imported categories being monitored in the DOC program\u2014during the first six months of 2007 rose by 28.1% and 25.8% respectively, when compared to the first half of 2006. However, the amount of swimwear imported by the United States from Vietnam from January to June 2007 was virtually unchanged from a year ago, and the amount of underwear imported declined by over 20% when compared to last year.", "However, evaluating the growth in clothing imports from Vietnam using year-on-year data may be potentially misleading for various reasons. First, under the terms of the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral textile agreement, the United States was permitted to set quotas on the volume of clothing imported from Vietnam in the years 2003 to 2006. As a result, the import figures for the last four years may have been kept artificially low, and the ensuing growth in 2007 artificially enhanced. Second, the international trade in clothing is comparatively seasonal, so comparisons based on data from only part of a year may be biased. Third, because there is an approximately six month lead time in the contracting of clothing, the trade volumes for January to June 2007 supposedly reflect arrangements made prior to the announcement of the monitoring program, and therefore will not reflect the alleged negative impact the monitoring program has had on Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States.", "On October 26, 2007, the DOC issued a press release stating that it had concluded its first review of Vietnamese clothing imports and determined that, \"There is insufficient evidence to warrant self-initiating an anti-dumping investigation.\" According to the press release, there were no imports from Vietnam for 317 of the 486 clothing items being monitored, and unit prices had increased for many of the items where there had been imports from Vietnam. Comparisons of imports from Vietnam to imports from other nations also failed to provide sufficient evidence to warrant self-initiating an anti-dumping investigation. Assistant Secretary for Import Administration David Spooner said that, despite the lack of evidence of dumping, \"The Department will continue to monitor apparel imports from Vietnam until the end of the Administration and work with all stakeholders to ensure an open and transparent monitoring process.\"", "On May 6, 2008, the DOC completed its second six-month review of the monitoring data, and once again decided that \"there is insufficient evidence to warrant self-initiating an antidumping investigation.\" According to the DOC, there were no clothing imports from Vietnam for 208 of the \"nearly 500 ten-digit Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) lines\" covered by the monitoring program. As was done in the first review, the DOC compared trends in unit values and import levels to other nations supplying these products to the United States, and concluded that the data did not support an antidumping investigation. The DOC also announced that a third six-month review was to be done in September 2008.", "While there was no requirement that the DOC take any action following the evaluations of the trade data, the program's continuation arguably will keep the monitoring program an issue of concern for the U.S. clothing manufacturers, the U.S. textile industry, major clothing importers, and large retail outlets in the United States. Among the possible Administration actions that could have been taken were the self-initiation of an anti-dumping investigation on select clothing imports from Vietnam, the opening of negotiations for a new bilateral textile agreement, and/or the termination of the monitoring program. For the next six months, it appears that the Administration has decided to take none of these options, but it is to continue to monitor clothing imports from Vietnam."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of U.S.-Vietnamese Clothing Trade", "paragraphs": ["The recent conduct of clothing trade between the United States and Vietnam has been relatively short in duration, but varied in practice. After President Clinton terminated a U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam on February 3, 1994, trade between the United States and Vietnam grew rather slowly, in part because of the nonpreferential treatment Vietnam received under U.S. trade laws. Vietnam was not a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) so it was not eligible for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status via that mechanism. Also, under U.S. law, Vietnam could only be granted permanent NTR status by the passage of legislation, or granted temporary NTR status by the conclusion of a bilateral trade agreement and compliance with the \"freedom of emigration\" requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment.", "Lacking NTR status, Vietnam's exports to the United States were subject to higher tariff rates than products from almost all other nations. For clothing imports, products from Vietnam faced tariff rates two to nine times higher than goods imported from countries with NTR status. As a result, while U.S. imports from Vietnam steadily increased from virtually nothing in 1993 to just over $1 billion in 2001, U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam rose from zero to $48 million over the same period (see Figure 1 )."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement", "paragraphs": ["After nearly five years of negotiations, the United States and Vietnam concluded a bilateral trade agreement on July 13, 2000\u2014the first of two steps for Vietnam to receive temporary NTR status. President Clinton exercised the authority granted to him under the Trade Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-618 ) to waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Enabling legislation in the U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly were subsequently passed, formally extending temporary \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status to Vietnam as of December 10, 2001.", "Having secured temporary NTR status, Vietnam's exports to the United States accelerated, rising from just over $1 billion in 2001 to $4.6 billion in 2003 (see Figure 1 ). One of the main beneficiaries of Vietnam's temporary NTR status was its clothing industry, which saw its exports to the United States jump from $48 million in 2001 to $876 million in 2002 and $2.3 billion in 2003. By 2003, clothing was 51.3% of Vietnam's total exports to the United States.", "Although the temporary NTR status stimulated imports from Vietnam, its impact was mitigated by its impermanent nature. Under U.S. law, the President had to reconfirm the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment every year, and Congress had the authority to override the President's reconfirmation via a joint resolution passed by both the House and the Senate. From 1998 to 2002, such a joint resolution failed in the House. No resolutions were introduced between 2003 and 2005.", "For the international clothing market, the theoretical risk of Vietnam losing temporary NTR status created two potential barriers to trade. First, major retailers and importers supposedly shied away from purchasing clothing manufactured in Vietnam as the date for the waiver renewal neared or when a joint resolution for disapproval was introduced in Congress. Second, given the long-term uncertainty of Vietnam's NTR status, both domestic and foreign investors in Vietnam's clothing and textiles industry allegedly curtailed or postponed potential investment projects, restricting the nation's clothing and textile production capacity.", "During the congressional debate over the bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, many Members of Congress urged President Bush to negotiate a separate bilateral textile agreement with Vietnam. Because Vietnam was not a WTO member at the time, its clothing exports were not covered by the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) and therefore there were no quotas on Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States. Several Members of Congress, and in particular Members with significant clothing and textile manufacturing in their districts or states, voiced concern that a \"surge\" in Vietnamese clothing exports to the United States could cause damage to U.S. clothing and textile companies and workers. In their opinion, it was important that the United States conclude a bilateral textile agreement with Vietnam that ensured fair competition and/or restricted the growth of Vietnamese clothing exports to the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Vietnam-U.S. Textile Agreement: 2003-2006", "paragraphs": ["Negotiations of a separate bilateral textile agreement began soon after the bilateral trade agreement went into effect. On April 25, 2003, the two nations agreed to the terms of a bilateral textile agreement that placed quantity quotas on 38 categories of clothing imports from Vietnam starting on May 1, 2003, until December 31, 2004. The quotas would automatically roll over in subsequent years\u2014with the inclusion of annual quantity increases of 2% for wool products and 7% for all other products\u2014unless the two nations terminated or renegotiated the agreement by December 1. In addition, both nations pledged to \"investigate and punish\" circumvention of U.S. import quotas, a provision added to the agreement in part due to a U.S. Custom Service allegation that some Chinese clothing products had illegally entered the United States by being mislabeled as products of Vietnam. The agreement also lowered Vietnam's tariffs on U.S. clothing and textiles exports to 7% for yarn, 12% for fabric, and 20% for clothing.", "Following the implementation of the bilateral textile agreement, Vietnam's total exports to the United States continued their rapid climb, but the growth in clothing exports slowed dramatically (see Figure 1 ). Total U.S. imports from Vietnam rose from $4.6 billion in 2003 to $5.3 billion in 2004, $6.6 billion in 2005, and $8.6 billion in 2006. Meanwhile, U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam crept up from $2.3 billion in 2003 to $2.5 billion in 2004, $2.7 billion in 2005, and $3.2 billion in 2006. The share of clothing in Vietnam's total exports to the United States declined from 51.3% in 2003 to 36.9% in 2006.", "The imposition of import quotas on Vietnamese clothing also altered the composition of Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States. In 2003, 78.1% of Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States were in categories subject to quotas. However, over the next three years, the value of Vietnam's clothing exports subject to quotas increased by 17.8% while clothing exports not subject to exports grew by 104.5%. As a result, Vietnamese clothing exports subject to quotas contributed 67.2% of the total bilateral clothing exports to the United States.", "Only part of the sharp decrease in the growth of Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States can be attributed to the actual cap on imports created by the quantity quotas. Table 2 reveals that the quantity quotas were potentially binding on about a dozen of the 38 categories subject to import restrictions. For another dozen categories, Vietnam used between half and three-quarters of the available quota. For six categories, an average of less than half of the quota was used over the four years the import restrictions were in place. On three occasions, and only in 2003, did U.S. imports fully use the available quota for a category of Vietnamese clothing imports.", "The less than full utilization of import quotas does not necessarily mean that the import constraints had no impact on trade. According to industry sources, major retailers and importers may shift where they source products in response to the implementation of quotas. According to these market experts, importers do not want to risk exceeding the import cap and be unable to import the products they desire, and therefore turn to an alternative location to obtain the products. As a result, the creation of an import quota on Vietnamese clothing may have diverted trade to other nations even in cases where there was still available import capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vietnam's WTO Accession and Permanent NTR Status", "paragraphs": ["Congressional interest in U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam reemerged during the negotiations over the terms of Vietnam's WTO accession. U.S. textiles and clothing manufacturers sought to extend the import quotas on Vietnamese clothing products as part of Vietnam's accession agreement, or to include in the agreement safeguard measures similar to those included in China's WTO accession agreement. However, neither provision was included in Vietnam's WTO accession agreement.", "What was included in the agreement were requirements that Vietnam terminate various non-WTO compliant subsidy programs supporting its domestic clothing and textile industry and allegedly benefitting its exports of clothing. The agreement includes an enforcement mechanism during the first 12 months after Vietnam's accession that would permit the United States\u2014or any other WTO member\u2014to impose import quotas if, after consultation and third-party arbitration, it was determined that Vietnam had not terminated its non-WTO compliant subsidies.", "Although Congress had no direct role in Vietnam's accession to the WTO, congressional approval was necessary to extend to Vietnam permanent NTR status. As a member of the WTO, the United States was required to extend permanent NTR status to Vietnam once it became a member.", "Opposition to extending permanent NTR status to Vietnam focused on a number of different issues, including alleged human rights abuses, claims of discrimination against foreign-owned companies operating in Vietnam, and charges of inadequate intellectual property rights protection. In addition, Senator Elizabeth Dole and Senator Lindsey Graham objected to the lack of safeguard measures in the WTO accession agreement to protect the U.S. clothing and textile industry from a potential surge in imports from Vietnam. They reportedly decided to place a \"hold\" on the bill before the Senate to grant Vietnam permanent NTR status.", "In a joint letter to U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Susan Schwab, Senators Dole and Graham explained their \"concerns regarding Vietnam's WTO accession terms and the recently concluded U.S.-Vietnam bilateral agreement.\" The two Senators wrote, \"We believe that unless the government takes specific steps to ensure that the U.S. textile industry can be defended against a communist country that heavily subsidizes its textile and apparel sector, this agreement is likely to cause large-scale job losses in both of our states.\" In the letter, Senators Dole and Graham specifically express concern about Vietnam's ability \"to artificially lower prices through its state sponsored system,\" and state that it would be \"unreasonable to ask U.S. workers to compete with products manufactured under a state-run economy without at least providing an adequate mechanism for the industry to defend itself.\"", "On September 28, 2006, USTR Schwab and U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez sent a letter to Senator Dole and Senator Graham pledging to initiate a monitoring program for Vietnamese selected clothing imports immediately upon Vietnam's WTO accession. In addition, USTR Schwab and Secretary Gutierrez stated in the letter, \"If this monitoring process indicates that dumping exists and the domestic industry fully cooperates in supplying data available to the domestic industry indicating the existence of material injury caused by such imports, the Department [of Commerce] will self-initiate anti-dumping investigations with respect to the relevant products.\" Based on this commitment, media sources report, Senator Dole and Senator Graham removed their hold on the permanent NTR for Vietnam legislation.", "Although the pledged monitoring program removed one barrier to Vietnam's permanent NTR status, other issues delayed final passage of pending legislation. On December 8, 2006, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6406 , a larger bill containing provisions granting Vietnam permanent NTR status by a vote of 212-184. H.R. 6406 was then coupled with H.R. 6111 (a tax extension bill) and sent to the Senate, where it passed by a vote of 79-9. On December 20, 2006, President Bush signed the bill into law ( P.L. 109-432 ) and, as provided under the law, the United States formally extended permanent NTR status to Vietnam on December 29, 2006\u2014less than two weeks before Vietnam officially became the 150 th member of the WTO."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Program: 2007-2009", "paragraphs": ["With the passage of P.L. 109-432 and Vietnam's membership in the WTO, U.S. trade relations with Vietnam entered into a new phase of formally agreed free trade.

Also, clothing imports from Vietnam were now permanently eligible for the lower NTR tariff rates, ending the annual temporary NTR renewal process. For its part, Vietnam had pledged to cease any non-WTO compliant subsidies to its clothing and textile industries or face the possible reimposition of import quotas by the United States or any other WTO member.", "The only nonmarket action by the United States available to influence the import of clothing from Vietnam was the promised monitoring program mentioned in the letter by USTR Schwab and Secretary Gutierrez. On December 4, 2006, the Import Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration (ITA) published a request for public comment in the Federal Register which laid out the basic outline of the proposed monitoring program.", "According to the Federal Register announcement, the monitoring program would begin upon Vietnam's accession to the WTO and will expire at the end of the current administration (taken by DOC to be January 19, 2009).

In addition to the concerns raised by Members of Congress about the statutory authority for the monitoring program, its consistency with existing international obligations, and the lack of a period of public commentary for a proposed rulemaking, another major criticism of the program was the apparent lack of a U.S. clothing manufacturing industry that might be materially injured by the Vietnamese imports.", "In its written comments to the Import Administration, the U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel (USA-ITA) urged the Department of Commerce drop the monitoring program because no U.S. apparel manufacturers supported it. In his testimony at the public hearing about the monitoring program, Chairman of the International Textile Group, Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. questioned whom the monitoring program was meant to protect: \"To the best of my knowledge, there are no American apparel producers whose output is truly characterized as competitive to Vietnam's exports to this country.\" The lack of competitive U.S. clothing manufacturers was reiterated by Stephanie Lester, Vice President for International Trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA). According to Ms. Lester, \"most of the products that RILA members purchase from Vietnam could not be supplied by domestic [U.S.] production.\"", "The monitoring program was also challenged on its potential negative effects on U.S. companies considering sourcing clothing from Vietnam. In his oral testimony at the public hearing on April\u00a024, 2007, Gary Ross of the USA-ITA said:", "The monitoring program has very real consequences. By targeting broad categories of products made in Vietnam, it forces USA-ITA member companies to reconsider Vietnam as a sourcing option. At the very least, importers and retailers are looking at the calendar and mapping out worst-case scenarios, deciding what the earliest possible point in time is when Vietnamese products brought into the U.S. market could be subject to an additional bonding requirement or dumping duty.", "In its written comments on the proposed program, the National Retail Federation (NRF), stated:", "In response to the greater unpredictability and risk to their sourcing operations created as a result of the commitment [to implement the monitoring program], a number of NRF members have decided to limit their exposure to Vietnam, either by substantially cutting their orders in the second half of 2007, or to terminate them entirely.", "The NRF goes on to state that its members have indicated that the cancelled orders will \"move to other Asian countries, not the United States or other Western Hemisphere countries.\"", "Several of the commentators pointed to the biannual review mechanism as heightening the market uncertainty created by the program. In the words of the American Apparel and Footwear Association (AAFA), \"A decision every six months about potential anti-dumping cases can be very unsettling and will no doubt have a chilling effect on trade.\"", "A third common comment from U.S. businesses critical of the proposed monitoring program was the potential burden it would place on U.S. companies importing clothing from Vietnam. In its written comments, the AAFA stated, \"We are concerned that the program could result in significant new paperwork or import entry requirements, which would create an unfair burden on U.S. apparel importers.\"", "A fourth general category of criticism focused on the seemingly vague and fluid methodology being used in the monitoring program. Several commentators indicated that it was unclear how the data being collected could be used to evaluate the alleged presence of dumping. Some argued that the three-digit categories of imports being monitored were too broad for use in anti-dumping investigations. Others pointed out that U.S. manufacturing data was apparently not available using the same categories as the import data being monitoring, making impact assessment difficult. Virtually all of these commentators maintained that the Import Administration needed to clarify their methodology prior to implementing the program and to make the methodology more transparent.", "In addition to critical comments from U.S. businesses, the Import Administration also received joint submissions from two Korean trade associations\u2014the Korea International Trade Association (KITA) and the Korean Apparel Industry Association (KAIA). The criticism contained in the two submissions made by KITA and KAIA were consistent with the categories described above, with one additional concern.

For most of the supporters of the monitoring program, the perceived risk inherent in these four issues was sufficiently grave that it was vital for the monitoring program to begin as soon as possible.", "In the words of the National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO), \"The concerns of the U.S. textile industry about surges of imports from Vietnam are based on recent experience, not mere speculations.\" According to the NCTO, imports from Vietnam rose by 220% between 2002 and 2006.

AMTAC states in its January 31, 2007 comments, \"Aside from China, Vietnam is the only other country with a large, state-owned textile and apparel sector. Vinatex, fully owned by the Vietnamese government, is the 10 th largest garment producer in the world.\"", "The alleged dominance of state-owned factories in Vietnam's clothing industry becomes important when examining the third issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program. The supporters claim that state-owned factories receive significant indirect and direct subsidies from the Vietnamese government, thereby allowing them to export clothing at prices below \"fair market value.\" In the words of the NCTO, \"Vietnam is one of two countries (the other being China) which has a large state-owned, state-subsidized textile and apparel sector. Governments in both countries have poured billions of dollars in subsidies into their respective sectors with the apparent goal being dominance of global apparel supply chains.\" According to AMTAC, the subsidies\u2014which were revealed by Vietnam during its WTO negotiations\u2014take the form of preferential interest rates, wage controls, rent holidays, export subsidies, preferential tax rates, and direct investments by the Vietnamese government.", "The fourth issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program has to do with the production conditions of Vietnam's clothing industry. According to some of the commentators, Vietnam's clothing manufacturing is relatively labor-intensive production using semi-skilled workers. As a result, these commentators maintain it is relatively easy for factories to shift production from one clothing product to another, and so it is vital that the monitoring program covers a wide range of apparel. In the words of the NCTO:", "Apparel manufacturing is, in important ways, a simple process. A sewing machine operator can produce dozens of different types of garments from a single machine. To a significant extent, the operator does not become skilled in producing a specific type of garment.... Thus, a typical sewing plant can, and does, have the ability to assemble a woman's dress, a man's cotton pant, a child's sweatshirt and so on and so forth....

In addition, VITAS pointed out that within its WTO accession agreement, there already exists a formal mechanism to resolve claims that Vietnam provides prohibited subsidies to its clothing and textile industry.

In October 2005, Vietnam's National Assembly passed a new Enterprise Law that clarifies the distinction between different types of ownership, as well as specifies which types of enterprises are open to foreign equity participation. In addition, the Vietnamese government has also begun the process of divesting itself of full-ownership of clothing manufacturers.

In general, the major retailers control both the design and the marketing of the final clothing items. The wholesalers and exporters typically contract with the major retailers to source the clothing items from a network of manufacturers, who in turn subcontract the textile companies to provide the materials needed to produce the clothes. The textile companies similarly purchase the raw materials they need from suppliers of either natural or synthetic fibers. In general, this production chain is initiated by the decision of the retailers to procure clothing.

The clothing manufacturers produce the clothing items and then ship the products directly to the retailers. Once the clothing shipments are received and pass inspection, the retailer pays the sourcing company, who then pays the manufacturers.", "Within the confines of triangle manufacturing, there is also a pattern of progression for the clothing manufacturers. At first, the manufacturers tend to operate under a \"cut-make-trim\" (CMT) arrangement with the sourcing company, where the manufacturer is provided all the materials for the production of the clothing item and only assembles the final product. Later on, the manufacturer may advance into an \"original equipment manufacturing\" (OEM) arrangement in which the sourcing company or the major retailer provides the manufacturer with the product design and it is up to the manufacturer to purchase the necessary materials to make the clothing items. In some cases, clothing manufacturers have been able to expand their activities further out in the commodity chain and undertake \"original brand-name manufacturing\" in which they may design the clothes to be sold either under their own brand name or under the brand name of a major retailer.", "Because the sourcing company usually has a significant number of manufacturers able to supply the clothing items, competition for the subcontracts tends to be keen, and the manufacturers are often pushed to lower their prices and speed up their production in order to win the contract. In Vietnam, the state-owned companies and the foreign-invested companies are generally considered better able to compete for \"triangle manufacturing\" contracts than the smaller, private Vietnamese enterprises because they are larger in size and have easier access to operating capital.", "To improve the overall profitability of Vietnam's clothing industry and reduce its dependency on the major retailers and marketers, the Vietnamese government is attempting to follow in the footsteps of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. The \"four Asian dragons\" were able to transform their manufacturing sectors in response to highly competitive global market conditions in various ways. In the clothing industry, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan not only diversified their manufacturing throughout Asia (including China), but also have moved up and down the clothing commodity chain into clothing design (up chain) and brand name development (down chain). Under the Decision 55, the Vietnamese government apparently had decided to focus its efforts on up chain development by increasing investments into its domestic textile industry and its production of raw materials used in the clothing industry.

First, the decline in U.S. production predates the end of the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam, indicating that other factors may be involved.

In addition, there is sufficient ambiguity in the language of the press releases to allow the DOC to amend or alter the categories of Vietnamese clothing imports it monitors, if it chooses to do so.", "One possible response for Congress is to take no action. Given that the DOC is monitoring trade flows, and has so far determined that there is insufficient evidence to initiate an anti-dumping investigation, it would appear that clothing imports from Vietnam are generally in compliance with current U.S. laws and regulations.", "If Congress were to consider taken some action on this issue, there are several aspects of the current status of U.S.-Vietnamese trade relations for clothing that might be examined. First, the Department of Commerce has not publicly responded to requests from some Members of Congress, the Vietnamese government, and some major U.S. clothing importers for the legal basis for establishing the monitoring program. The Federal Register announcement of the creation of the monitoring program did not include the usual federal law citation establishing the authority to create the program.

As such, Congress might act to review the monitoring program to decide whether or not it violates existing WTO agreements, exposing the United States to the risk of a formal complaint from Vietnam.", "Third, Congress could investigate Vietnam's compliance with its promise to terminate all WTO-prohibited subsidies to its clothing and textile industry. As indicated by their submitted comments on the monitoring program, some U.S. textile manufacturers are concerned that Vietnam is not living up to its promise, and continues to use direct and indirect subsidies to support its clothing exports. Such an investigation might also include research into Vietnam's labor market to ascertain if the Vietnamese government is suppressing the wages of clothing and textile workers below fair market values.", "Fourth, possibly based in part of the results the investigation mentioned above, Congress could choose to pass legislation designed to counteract perceived unfair trade practices by Vietnam in its export of clothing to the United States. The proposed legislation might incorporate provisions that would make it easier to initiate anti-dumping or countervailing duty investigations in cases involving nonmarket economies, such as Vietnam.", "Fifth, Congress may decide to consider the claims of major clothing retailers and importers that the monitoring program has stunted trade with and investments in Vietnam, thereby possibly causing them economic harm. The DOC review was designed to examine trade data to determine whether or not there was sufficient evidence to self-initiate an antidumping investigation against Vietnam. It did not analyze the trade data to determine if the program had distorted trade during its first six months of operation.", "Sixth, Congress could also investigate the administration and operation of the monitoring program to determine if it is correctly identifying the types of clothing in which there might be possible dumping by Vietnam. Among the criteria typically considered as being necessary conditions for proof of possible dumping are below market prices and significant market share. In its review of clothing imports from Vietnam, the DOC reported rising unit prices and implied that prices were comparable to other clothing suppliers. As for market share, some experts assert that unless a supplier provides more than 4% of the overall supply of a product, it cannot cause sufficient harm to substantiate dumping claims. At present, there are very few categories of clothing for which Vietnam achieves the market threshold level.", "Finally, Congress might decide to authorize its own study of the monitoring program data to see if there is any evidence of dumping and/or sufficient evidence to warrant the continuation of the program. One criticism previously raised with the DOC's biannual review process was the problem of the seasonal nature of the global clothing market. By assessing the monitoring program for a full year, Congress could take into account the seasonal characteristics of the clothing market in evaluating the trade data."], "subsections": []}]}}
