", "The House version includes language requiring the establishment of a policy that uniformly defines and prescribes what constitutes \"an inappropriate and prohibited relationship, communication, conduct, or contact, including when such an action is consensual, between a member of the Armed Forces ... and prospective member or [new] member of the Armed Forces.... \" Further, the House language requires a servicemember who violates the policy be subject to prosecution under the UCMJ, as well as processed for administrative separation. Additionally, the House requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, within one year of the date of enactment, a proposed amendment to the UCMJ creating a punitive article related to violations of the new policy. In contrast to the House version, the Senate addresses the trainer/trainee issue by requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit to the respective committees, within 120 days of enactment, recommendations for legislative action to modify the UCMJ to prohibit sexual acts and contacts between military instructors and their trainees. ", "Secretary of Defense Hagel directed the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to ensure that current policies prohibiting inappropriate relations between trainers and trainees and recruiters and recruits are consistent across the Services. The findings of the survey are to be reported to Secretary Hagel no later than November 1, 2013. The Department of Defense action with respect to this issue does not address potential changes to the punitive articles of the UCMJ, as contemplated by the House and Senate versions of the FY2012 NDAA. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Different Approach", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the various provisions discussed above, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) introduced a bill with a different approach to sex-related offenses. S. 967 addresses sex-related offenses under the UCMJ by modifying the authority to proceed to trial by court-martial, modifying the Manual for Courts-Martial to eliminate the factor relating to character and military service of the accused on initial disposition, modifying the authority to convene general and special courts-martial, creating a deadline for a military judge to call general and special courts-martial into session, modifying clemency authority of the convening authority, and requiring command action on reports of sexual offenses. It remains unclear if the bill will be introduced in whole or part as amendments during the Senate debate on the FY2014 NDAA. However, as an example of a different approach to an issue receiving significant congressional interest, the various sections are discussed below. ", "Section 2 modifies the authority to determine to proceed to trial by courts-martial. The language, if enacted, would create a bifurcated military justice system. Offenses for which the maximum confinement adjudged may be greater than one year fall under a separate military justice system with respect to disposition and convening authority. However, certain offenses are excluded\u2014for example, Article 106 (spies) and Article 112a (wrongful use, possession of controlled substance)\u2014and would remain under the military justice system as it is established today, with the commanding officer retaining disposition authority. Disposition authority under the new system is held by an officer in the grade of O-6 (i.e., colonel or Navy captain) or higher who is available as a trial counsel (JAG officer), has significant experience in trials by general and special courts-martial, and is outside of the chain of command of the accused. The officer with the disposition authority determines whether to try the charges by a special or general court-martial. The determination on how to proceed is binding on any applicable convening authority, and shall be free from any unlawful or unauthorized influence or coercion.", "Section 3, which modifies the MCM to eliminate the factor relating to the character and military service of the accused in the initial disposition of charges, uses essentially the same language contained in the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA discussed above. The language suffers from the same ambiguity as the House and Senate language, in that Rule 306 is cited as Rule 306 of the MCM and not specifically cited as Rule 306 of the RCM.", "The Section 4 provision that changes the officers authorized to convene general and special courts-martial is a concept that is not reflected in the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA. If enacted, certain officers currently authorized to convene courts-martial would lose that authority. Additionally, officers granted disposition authority under Section 2 of S. 967 (discussed above) would also be granted convening authority, except in instances when the accused and/or victim are in the officer's chain of command. Finally, new offices are created within each military service called the \"Chief of Staff on Courts-Martial,\" with the responsibility to convene general and special courts-martial and detail military judges to convened courts-martial, as well as detail members to convened courts-martial.", "Section 5, creating a deadline for military judge to call general and special courts-martial into session, is a concept that is not included in the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA. If enacted, the section would require a military judge to call the court into session not later than 90 days after the authority determines to try such charges by court-martial. The language cites UCMJ Article 39 with respect to sessions of the court-martial when creating the 90 day deadline. However, the language does not address UCMJ Article 40, which authorizes a military judge, for reasonable cause, to grant a continuance to any party for such time, and as often, as may appear to be just. Absent further clarification, conflict exists between statutory provisions requiring a deadline to proceed and the ability to grant continuances.", "Section 6, addressing the convening authority and clemency, is largely reflected by the House and Senate versions of the FY2014 NDAA (discussed above). The biggest difference being that Section 6 prohibits the CA from dismissing any charge or specification by setting aside a finding of guilty or changing a finding of guilty to a charge to a finding of a guilty of a lesser included offense, while the House and Senate versions restrict the CA's authority to specific offenses.", "Section 7, if enacted, would require that a commanding officer, immediately upon receiving a report of a sexual-related offense involving a member of the Armed Forces in his or her chain of command, refer the report to the responsible criminal investigation office. The proposed language does not define what constitutes a sexual-related offense, which could result, in theory, in some offenses falling through the reporting requirements."], "subsections": []}]}}
