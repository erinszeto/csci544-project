The combined Social Security tax on earnings is 12.40%, which is split equally between workers and employers (6.20% each). Of that amount, 2.37% is allocated to the DI trust fund and 10.03% is allocated to the OASI trust fund. Each trust fund is a legally distinct account in the U.S. Treasury, and under current law, the two trust funds may not borrow from one another.", "Over the past few years, Congress has grown increasingly concerned with the financial outlook of the DI trust fund.

Upon depletion of its asset reserves, the DI trust fund was projected to have enough ongoing revenues to pay only about 80% of scheduled benefits. The trustees projected that the OASI trust fund would be depleted in 2035.", "The Social Security Act provides no guidance on the payment of benefits once a trust fund's asset reserves have been depleted and current tax revenues are insufficient to meet current cost. Although individuals who meet Social Security's eligibility requirements are legally entitled to disability benefits, a provision in the Antideficiency Act prohibits a federal agency from spending in excess of available funds. Because the Social Security Act stipulates that SSDI benefit payments shall be made only from the DI trust fund, without a change in the law, monthly cash payments to beneficiaries could be delayed or reduced if the DI trust fund were depleted.", "The decreasing solvency of the DI trust fund is the result of an increasing imbalance between the fund's income and cost. Over the past 20 years, tax revenues to the DI trust fund have remained relatively flat as a percentage of taxable payroll, whereas cost as a share of taxable payroll has grown markedly. The increase in cost stems largely from the growth in the number of beneficiaries in the program. Between 1995 and 2014, the number of disabled workers and their dependents in receipt of SSDI grew 85%, from 5.9 million to 10.9 million. Because benefit payments account for nearly all program spending, the growth in the SSDI rolls has contributed heavily to the financial difficulties of the DI trust fund.", "On November 2, 2015, President Barack Obama signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (H.R. 1314; P.L. 114-74).

In 2016, the SGA earnings limit is $1,130 per month for most workers and $1,820 per month for statutorily blind workers. Disability determinations are based on a five-step sequential evaluation process that takes into account a worker's medical records, age, education, and work experience.

Monthly benefits payable to the worker and family members are subject to a maximum family benefit amount. Benefits may be offset if the disabled worker also receives workers' compensation or certain other public disability benefits. In November 2015, the average monthly benefit was $1,166 for disabled workers, $318 for spouses of disabled workers, and $350 for children of disabled workers.

A trust fund is an accounting mechanism that \"records the revenues, offsetting receipts, or offsetting collections earmarked for the purpose of the fund, as well as budget authority and outlays of the fund that are financed by those revenues or receipts.\" The Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund finances the benefits of disabled workers and their dependents, and the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund pays for the benefits of retired workers and their dependents as well as survivors of deceased workers. Administrative costs are also drawn from the trust funds. Each trust fund is a separate account in the U.S. Treasury, and under current law, the two trust funds may not borrow from one another.

FICA taxes are split evenly between employees and employers, whereas SECA taxes are borne fully by self-employed individuals. As shown in Table 1 , the Social Security FICA tax rate for employees and employers, each is 6.200%, with 1.185% allocated to the DI trust fund and 5.015% to the OASI trust fund. On a combined basis , the FICA tax rate is 12.400%, with 2.370% allocated to the DI trust fund and 10.030% to the OASI trust fund. The Social Security SECA tax rate is the same as the combined FICA tax rate. Social Security taxes are levied on covered earnings up to a maximum annual amount, which is $118,500 in 2016. ", "The FICA rates for employees and employers are prescribed in Sections 3101 and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), respectively; the SECA rate is specified in Section 1401 of the IRC. The allocation of the tax rates between the OASI and DI trust funds, however, is set in Section 201(b) of the Social Security Act. Section 201(b) specifies the combined share of the Social Security tax rate allocated to the DI trust fund for both wages (FICA) and self-employment income (SECA), which, as noted above, is 2.370% (1.185% for employees and employers, each). Section 201(a) states that the combined allocation to the OASI trust fund for both wages and self-employment income is the combined Social Security payroll tax rate set in the IRC less the combined share prescribed in Section 201(b). Therefore, the combined allocation to the OASI trust fund is 12.400% minus 2.370%, which equals 10.030% (5.015% for employees and employers, each).", "In addition to payroll taxes, the OASI and DI trust funds are credited with income from the taxation of some Social Security benefits. The share of Social Security benefits that is taxable depends on whether the individual's provisional income exceeds certain thresholds. Provisional income equals adjusted gross income plus otherwise tax-exempt interest income (i.e., interest from tax-exempt bonds), plus 50% of Social Security benefits. Income derived from the taxation of up to the first 50% of Social Security benefits is credited to the OASI and DI trust funds based on the source of the benefits taxed. In other words, up to a certain rate, taxes paid on OASI benefits are deposited in the OASI trust fund and taxes paid on SSDI benefits are deposited in the DI trust fund. ", "Occasionally, the two trust funds receive reimbursements from the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury for various costs imposed on the Social Security program. For example, the OASI and DI trust funds received reimbursements from the General Fund to compensate for the loss of revenues from a temporary payroll tax reduction in 2011 and 2012. ", "The final source of income to the trust funds is from the interest earned on investments held by the trust funds. When income exceeds cost in a given year, the surplus is credited to the trust funds in the form of special-issue (non-marketable) securities, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. These securities earn interest, which the Department of the Treasury credits to the trust funds semiannually in the form of additional government securities.

The ratio of non-interest income to taxable payroll for the year is known as the annual income rate ; the ratio of cost to taxable payroll for the year is known as the annual cost rate . Over the past 20 years, the annual DI income rate has remained relatively flat at about 1.81% of taxable payroll, which is roughly the combined share of the tax rate allocated to the DI trust fund for that period plus a small amount of other income. At the same time, the annual DI cost rate has grown markedly, from 1.44% in 1995 to 2.36% in 2014.", "The increase in the annual DI cost rate stems largely from the growth in the number of beneficiaries on SSDI. Between 1995 and 2014, the total number of disabled workers and their dependents in receipt of SSDI increased 85%, from 5.9 million to 10.9 million. Because benefit payments account for nearly all spending, the increase in the number of SSDI beneficiaries drove the annual DI cost rate upward.", "The rise in disability rolls can be attributed to a number of factors. First, the overall growth in the working-age population increased the number of workers insured for disability. Between 1995 and 2014, the insured-worker population increased 19%, from 127 million to 151 million. ", "Second, demographic changes in the composition of the insured-worker population contributed to the increase in the number of beneficiaries on SSDI. Most importantly, the aging of the baby-boomer generation increased the number of older workers, who are more likely to become disabled than are younger workers. In addition, growth in the labor force participation rate of women in the latter half of the 20 th century led to more women being insured for disability. As the size of the female insured-worker population increased, the enrollment rate of women into the SSDI program grew to near parity with men.", "Third, changes in opportunities for work and compensation induced more individuals to apply for SSDI. For example, according to SSA's chief actuary, economic downturns are associated with a temporary increase in the enrollment rate of insured workers into the program. During the last recession, the number of SSDI awards per 1,000 insured workers increased 25%, from 5.6 in 2007 to 7.0 in 2010. In addition, the value of benefits has made applying for SSDI more desirable than work for some low-wage workers, because such individuals have experienced slower real earnings growth over the past three decades compared with medium- and high-wage workers.", "Fourth, various amendments to the Social Security program played a role in increasing the number of people on SSDI. For example, the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ) raised the full retirement age (FRA) for Social Security retirement benefits, thereby increasing both the number of insured workers in their older and more disability-prone years and the duration of benefit receipt for older SSDI beneficiaries close to the FRA. The increase in the FRA also raised the value of disability benefits relative to early retirement benefits, which likely impelled more individuals between the ages of 62 and FRA to apply for SSDI. ", "Furthermore, the Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 ( P.L. 98-460 ), which changed the evaluative criteria used in making disability determinations, contributed to the growth in the number of SSDI beneficiaries with mental and musculoskeletal disorders. Because such disorders are less likely to result in death compared with other qualifying impairments, the growth in the share of beneficiaries with mental and musculoskeletal disorders likely increased the average duration of benefit receipt and thus SSDI caseloads.", "Although most researchers agree that changes in the demographic characteristics of the working-age population account for a large share of the growth in the number of beneficiaries on SSDI, there is considerable disagreement among researchers over how more \"difficult to quantify factors\"\u2014such as changes in opportunities for work and compensation or changes to federal policy\u2014have contributed to the growth in the program.

However, because the budget agreement also contained several provisions that are projected to improve the long-term actuarial balance of the theoretical combined OASDI trust funds by 0.04% of taxable payroll, the point of order under Section 3(q) of H.Res. 5 was not applicable during House consideration of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.

The last major congressional effort to address the financial condition of one of the Social Security trust funds occurred in the early 1980s with the passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 ( P.L. 98-21 ). Under the 1983 amendments, Congress used a combination of revenue increases and cost reductions to stabilize and eventually improve the solvency of the OASI trust fund. Congress could enact similar legislation to improve the long-term solvency of either the DI trust fund only or both trust funds.

Since the late 1930s, policymakers had discussed proposals to amend the Social Security Act to provide covered workers with disability insurance. However, persistent disagreements among policymakers over how to implement a disability insurance program or whether such a program should be enacted at all derailed most proposals early in the deliberative process. Nevertheless, by the 1950s, there was enough support for the creation of a federal disability insurance program for Congress to consider the matter. ", "On July 11, 1955, Representative Jere Cooper (D-TN), the chair of the House Committee on Ways and Means, introduced a bill to amend Title II of the Social Security Act to provide monthly benefits to insured workers aged 50 to 64 with qualifying impairments, among other provisions (H.R. 7225). Under the bill, disability benefits would have been paid from the OASI trust fund and payroll tax rates would have been increased to cover the associated costs. The House report accompanying H.R. 7225 did not discuss the creation of a separate trust fund for the proposed disability insurance program. The House passed H.R. 7225, with amendments, by a vote of 372 (169-R, 203-D) to 31 (23-R, 8-D) on July 18, 1955 (R = Republican, D = Democrat). ", "Although H.R. 7225 passed overwhelmingly in the House, the bill faced marked opposition in the Senate. One of the main concerns among Members who opposed the bill was the uncertainty over its potential cost. Some lawmakers worried that economic downturns would impel unemployed workers to apply to the disability insurance program, affecting the solvency of the OASI trust fund. Given these concerns, the Senate Committee on Finance removed the disability insurance provisions from H.R. 7225. The Senate report accompanying the 1956 amendments stated,", "Difficulties in determining eligibility, and other factors, lead to uncertainty as to the future costs of a cash disability program. Cost estimates in the field of disability benefits, as pointed out by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration, are subject to a wider range of variation than are estimates for other types of benefits. The basic cost estimates which have been presented to the committee were based on high employment conditions; under low employment conditions, the cost would be significantly higher. The old-age and survivors insurance system is on a sound financial basis; your committee strongly believes that it must be kept so and should not be altered by adding a benefit feature that could involve substantially higher costs than can be estimated.", "During Senate floor debate on H.R. 7225, Senator Walter F. George (D-GA) offered an amendment reinstating the disability insurance program along with the tax increase to finance it. To address concerns that a disability insurance program would pose a risk to the solvency of the OASI trust fund, the George amendment provided for a separate trust fund from which disability benefits would be paid. Supporters of the George amendment argued that a separate DI trust fund would isolate the OASI trust fund from any cost increases stemming from the new disability insurance program. For instance, during floor debate, Senator Thomas C. Hennings, Jr. (D-MO) remarked,", "The pending proposal, which the senior Senator from Georgia has submitted for himself ... proposes to set aside a separate trust fund for disability, and consequently does not go so far as to include it within the social-security framework. I believe this to be an extremely workable compromise\u2014one which will eliminate any fear that the old-age and survivors insurance fund will be endangered, although I for one never shared this concern. ", "Opponents of the George amendment argued that the creation of a separate DI trust fund would not sufficiently address their concerns about the potential cost of the program. Senator Wallace F. Bennett (R-UT) noted,", "The supporters of this amendment tell us that by setting up a separate trust fund they are not going to jeopardize the actuarial balance of the program of social security. I think it is rather obvious that once this amendment is enacted, there is small chance that the program would be discontinued because of lack of funds. The pressure to provide the necessary funds, either through direct Government grant or through increased taxes on the social security taxpayers, would demand the employment of one of those alternatives.", "The Senate narrowly passed the George amendment by a vote of 47 (6-R, 41-D) to 45 (38-R, 7-D). The Senate went on to pass its version of H.R. 7225 by a vote of 90 (45-R, 45-D) to 0 on July 17, 1956. ", "In conference, the House adopted the Senate provision establishing a separate DI trust fund. The conference report on H.R. 7225 was cleared, without amendments, by voice votes in the House on July 26, 1956, and in the Senate on July 27, 1956. Following consideration of the conference report, Senator George stated in support of his amendment:", "Another feature of our proposal is that the funds for disability payments are earmarked in a wholly separate fund. These moneys will not be commingled in any way with the funds for old age insurance or for widows and orphans. The contribution income and the disbursements for disability payments will be kept completely distinct and separate. In this way the cost of disability benefits always will be definitely known and the costs always will be shown separately. ", "The disability program is limited to a total of one-quarter of 1 percent of payroll from employers, one-quarter of 1 percent from employees' and three-eighths of 1 percent from the self-employed and disbursements cannot exceed the amount available for this purpose. Thus, the argument that has been made against the original proposal as considered by the Finance Committee, namely, that the cost of the proposal cannot be determined, is met by our amendment. Moreover, another argument that was made against the original proposal that the program eventually may cost more than originally estimated and may thus divert some of the funds from old-age or survivors insurance is also met by our proposal. Senators who have had any doubts about the financial aspects of the proposal can vote for the amendment with complete assurance as to its financial soundness.

Eisenhower signed into law the Social Security Amendments of 1956 (P.L. 84-880).", "Key Dates Projected for the Social Security Trust Funds"], "subsections": []}]}}
