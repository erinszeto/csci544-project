Regional balancing authorities seek to ensure electricity supply is in balance with the demand for power. The normal frequency of the U.S. grid is 60 Hertz (i.e., cycles per second), and operational issues can arise with even with a small fluctuation of as little as 1% above or below this parameter.

Given that this variation in use can lead to some of the larger, less flexible generation resources being underutilized (especially during the night or even seasonally), some observers argue that the electric grid is overbuilt. Additionally, some have suggested that energy storage may be able to help reduce the need for large power generation projects in the future, and provide support for less costly renewable energy systems.

However, upgrading the technologies used by electric power customers to utilize equipment and appliances that are more efficient may be required to achieve end-use efficiency goals. End-user demand reduction (or demand response) is a process by which customers respond to a price signal from a utility or other power provider in return for incentive payments. While most demand response programs are focused on large industrial users with the flexibility to reduce or move consumption to other times of lower demand, commercial, apartment and other residential customers may be signed to aggregation agreements to gain the scale needed for participation in such programs.

", "Flow Battery Systems", "Flow batteries are large battery systems that store an electrical charge in tanks of a liquid electrolyte (e.g., a liquid solution with dissolved chemicals that stores energy). Electric charge is drawn from the electrolyte as it is pumped through electrodes to extract the electrons, and the spent liquid returns to the storage tank. Flow battery technology is scalable. The active chemicals are stored separately until power is needed, thus reducing fire safety concerns. Most flow batteries require the electrolyte to be separated by a membrane, as shown in Figure A-2 . Some newer flow battery technologies use a single flow loop design with no membrane, where \"energy is stored in a plated metal on the surface of titanium electrodes.\" ", "Vanadium and zinc bromine are currently the most-used liquid electrolytes. Vanadium has become a popular electrolyte component because the metal charges and discharges reliably for thousands of cycles. However, one article cited vanadium's increasing price and its toxicity as leading researchers to look at other cheaper and less toxic chemistries (e.g., such as iron or organic compounds) for flow batteries. New electrolyte chemistries are being investigated that are able to maintain a high number of charge cycles, and retain a low viscosity to ease pumping between tanks. ", "Any source of power can be used to charge flow batteries, including renewable electricity from wind and solar sources. Since flow batteries are scalable in size and able to undergo a large number of charging and discharging cycles, they are considered as a potential option to store off-peak electricity generation from renewable sources. ", "Redox Flow Batteries", "Redox batteries are a specific type of flow battery. The name \"redox\" refers to the chemical reduction and oxidation reactions employed in the redox flow battery to store energy in liquid electrolyte solutions which flow through a battery of electrochemical cells during charge and discharge. Redox batteries can be further classified as either aqueous or nonaqueous systems, with aqueous systems using water as the electrolyte solvent. While aqueous flow batteries are generally safer, they do not currently store as much energy per unit of volume as nonaqueous chemistries. Redox flow batteries are said to offer an economical, low vulnerability means of storing electrical energy at scale, with greater flexibility to design a system based on power and energy rating for a given application. Redox flow batteries are suitable for energy storage applications with power ratings ranging from kiloWatts (kW) to the tens of MW over periods from two to 10 hours, and are capable of 10,000 or more charging cycles.", "The redox flow battery concept shown in Figure A-2 produces power by pumping liquid from external tanks into the battery's stack, a central area where the liquids are mixed. When the battery is fully discharged, both tanks hold the same electrolyte solution (which is a mixture of the positively charged ions and negatively charged ions. When power is needed, the two liquids are pumped into the central stack. Inside the stack, positive ions pass through a selective membrane and change into a solid on the stack's negative side thus generating electricity. ", "According to EPRI, vanadium redox flow batteries have an important advantage among flow batteries as the two electrolytes are identical when fully discharged, which simplifies electrolyte management during operation.", "Modular Battery Technologies", "Modular batteries are used in many aspects of everyday life. They generally store electrical energy in chemical form, and consist of standardized individual cells. The individual cells have relatively small power and voltage capacities that can be aggregated to serve larger power loads. Battery energy storage can also provide ancillary services for the electric grid such as frequency regulation, voltage support and spinning reserves. This section of the report focuses on some of the major rechargeable modular battery technologies that currently serve applications from cell phones to electric or hybrid vehicles, and can provide some backup power or services to the electric grid. ", "Modular battery systems may be suited to arbitrage opportunities. Such opportunities may be economically available to storage systems ranging from one to 500 MW, with a discharge duration range of one hour or greater. Some storage projects may be able to cycle their charging and discharging to meet such opportunities perhaps 250 or more times in a year.", "Lithium Ion Batteries", "Lithium ion (Li Ion) represents a family of battery chemistries, each with its own strengths and weaknesses regarding different applications and uses. Li Ion batteries store and release energy through a process called \"intercalation,\" which involves lithium ions entering and exiting microscopic spaces in between the atoms of a battery's two electrodes. The most commonly used type of Li Ion cell has a positive electrode (i.e., the cathode) of made of lithium-cobalt oxide (LiCoO 2 ), and a negative electrode made of carbon. Batteries are charged as ions of lithium move through the electrolyte (typically a lithium salt solution) from the positive to the negative electrode (i.e., the anode), and attach to the carbon. When discharged, lithium ions move back to the positive electrode. ", "Li Ion batteries are used in many applications because lithium is highly reactive and has a high specific energy, which means it can store approximately 150 Wh of electricity in a one kilogram battery. Li Ion batteries hold their charge well over time, losing only about 5% per month, and generally have no memory effect. Li Ion battery packs have electronic circuitry built in to regulate charging and discharging of the batteries to prevent overcharging and excess heating of the batteries, which can potentially result in explosions or fires. However, the components of fuel, oxygen, and an ignition source exist in the battery system providing the prerequisites for combustion.", "Unlike other rechargeable batteries, Li Ion does not require a deep-discharge cycle to maintain the battery's ability to recharge to full capacity. Over time however, that ability to fully recharge weakens. Nevertheless, the Li Ion battery packs used for EV systems may still have as much as 50% to 70% of their original energy storage capacity at the end of their EV service life. This would allow EV Li Ion battery packs to have a second life in a variety of electricity storage uses from residential storage to renewable generation and other back-up power applications. ", "However, Li Ion battery packs can catch fire (due to a flammable liquid electrolyte) if, for example, an electric vehicle car crash punctures the battery pack. The development of a solid-state battery (i.e., a battery with a solid instead of a liquid electrolyte) may make Li Ion batteries safer. It may also remove the issue with dendrite formation, the crystal-like buildup of lithium metal in the electrolyte that can puncture the cathode-anode separator, causing a short circuit that will destroy the battery and can cause a fire.", "The potential uses of Li Ion batteries at end-of-life highlights issues with the materials used in the construction of the battery cells. Cobalt is used in the construction of the cathode of the battery. While cobalt is not on a list of \"conflict materials\" that the federal government regulates from conflict zones, cobalt is mostly mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a recognized conflict zone from which about 70% of the world's cobalt originates. ", "Until recently, as much as 20% of Congolese cobalt was estimated to be produced in unregulated artisanal mines (i.e., informal mines, often small-scale operations in local communities) that reportedly use child laborers in unhealthy conditions. The DRC regulates the large mines responsible for most of the cobalt supply, but unrest and economic conditions has driven people to artisanal mining. Even after a recent collapse of cobalt prices, child labor in Congolese artisanal mines reportedly continues to be a problem. However, a recovery of cobalt use from projected growth in EV adoption could exacerbate the issue. ", "Due largely to concerns about child labor in artisanal mines, companies have been under pressure to document their cobalt supply chain to show where their cobalt is sourced. While some companies are now buying cobalt directly from the regulated mines in the DRC, the mixing of cobalt supplies in the refining process (which was reported as taking place mostly in China) complicates tracking efforts. Other companies are reducing their use of cobalt to \"minimize\" exposure to the issue.", "Since Li Ion battery manufacture utilizes a number of potentially toxic elements if improperly disposed of (i.e., in landfills where groundwater contamination could occur), and have rare earth and other valuable components with potential value, some countries have passed laws to ensure recycling of the batteries. China, where about half the world's EVs are sold, was reportedly implementing rules to make carmakers responsible for expired batteries. The European Union also has regulations for EV battery disposal.", "Recycling of Li Ion batteries may also help to reduce the need for new supplies from mining of cobalt. But the reuse of EV Li Ion batteries was reported to be more attractive than recycling at this time. Projected demand growth for EVs may overtake the immediate benefits of recycling on supply needs.", "Lithium Iron Phosphate", "Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) is another Li Ion chemistry for rechargeable battery cathodes. LFP can be used in similar high power applications as lithium-cobalt oxide cells, but LFP's chemistry has a lower specific energy at about 120 Wh/kg (compared to the LiCoO 2 chemistry with a specific energy of about 150 Wh/kg). However, LFP has a longer cycle life than lithium-cobalt oxide, and is reportedly a safer battery chemistry as it is less flammable.", "Nickel Cadmium and Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries", "Nickel cadmium (NiCad) has been in use as a rechargeable battery since about 1910, and was the mostly widely used chemistry for rechargeable batteries until the commercialization of NiMH. NiCad and nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) were the mainstay of rechargeable battery applications before the widespread adoption of Li Ion batteries just over a decade ago. ", "NiMH began to replace NiCad in applications requiring a higher power density in smaller package applications or where performance was more important, and can store about 70 watt-hours per kilogram. NiMH also does not suffer from a memory effect, thus will not require a full discharge cycle to maintain the ability to fully charge. But NiCad retains a charge longer and performs better than NiMH in cold weather applications, or in off-grid renewable energy storage or telecom operations (e.g., situations where near maintenance-free operation is needed with respect to the electrolyte).", "Lead-Acid Batteries", "One of the oldest and most widely used forms of energy storage is the lead-acid battery. These batteries are a mainstay of gasoline-powered vehicles, providing energy storage for the spark ignition system of internal combustion engines (ICEs). Lead-acid batteries used in passenger cars commonly have six cells, each with an electromotive force of about 2 volts (V). They can be discharged at a high rate but can require more than 14 hours to recharge. The battery cells are constructed in a grid made of a lead alloy that holds an electrolyte solution of water and sulfuric acid. Figure A-3 shows a wet-cell (also called a \"flooded\" battery due to the liquid electrolyte) lead-acid battery design with several cells with the electrodes connected to each cell.", "Wet-cell lead-acid batteries are usually made with vents and removable caps to allow for gases to escape while charging, and refilling with water when too much of the electrolyte has been converted to gas. A lead-acid battery can store perhaps 25 watt-hours of electric power per kilogram. Passenger car batteries are often called \"starter\" batteries as they provide a surge of power during the ignition stage to start the engine, and store power generated by the electrical system to prevent damage to system components. Lead-acid batteries can also be designed as \"deep cycle\" batteries to provide a low, steady level of power for a longer duration than a starting battery. Some applications require \"dual purpose\" batteries with characteristics designed to have a high starting power for cranking engines, but are able to withstand the cycle service demands from multiple accessory loads. Lead-acid batteries can be aggregated for \"back-up\" power applications to supply electrical power to critical systems in the event of a power outage. Batteries used for back-up power can also function as voltage stabilizers that smooth out fluctuations in electrical generation systems. However, a lead-acid battery would require six kilograms to store the same amount of energy that a one kilogram lithium-ion battery could store.", "Batteries designed for industrial uses provide a low, steady power for a longer duration than a typical deep cycle battery. This makes a higher amount of total energy available for a longer period of time. ", "Industrial batteries have the ability to last for years and can be used in stationary applications that provide critical back-up power to systems that need constant power supply. Industrial batteries are often not called upon to deliver power, but when they are, it is required that they deliver an abundance of power that will last long enough for reserve generators to take over. Often times, industrial batteries are configured as systems to accommodate large power demands.", "Lead-acid battery components are often recycled at the end of the battery's useful service life. Even the spent sulfuric acid can be \"neutralized\" or converted to sodium sulfate and reused.", "Advanced Lead-Acid Batteries", "A key problem with lead-acid batteries is the growth of lead sulfate crystals in the electrolyte that eventually limits lead battery performance and is a key cause of battery failure. Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory announced that they are working with industry to better understand the underlying chemistry of lead-acid batteries to find a solution to sulfation, and resulting dissolution issues (i.e., as the electrolyte loses much of its dissolved sulfuric acid and becomes primarily water). A main goal of the research effort is to unlock \"a significant portion of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6unused potential [in lead-acid batteries that] would result in even better low-cost, recyclable batteries for mobile and stationary market applications.\"", "Since lead-acid batteries do not have as high a fire risk as Li Ion batteries, some researchers are investigating new technologies that may allow for a greater use of lead-acid batteries in electric grid and transportation applications.", "Lead-acid carbon technologies use a fundamentally different approach to lead-acid batteries through the inclusion of carbon, in one form or another, both to improve the power characteristics of the battery and to mitigate the effects of partial states of charge. Certain advanced lead-acid batteries are conventional valve-regulated lead-acid batteries with technologies that address the shortcomings of previous lead-acid products through incremental changes in the technology. Other advanced lead-acid battery systems incorporate solid electrolyte-electrode configurations, while others incorporate capacitor technology as part of anode electrode design.", "Sodium Sulfur Batteries", "Sodium sulfur (NaS) batteries are a liquid metal technology that operates at high temperatures to keep sulfur molten at both the positive and negative electrodes. A solid ceramic separates the electrodes and serves as the electrolyte, allowing only positively charged sodium-ions to pass through during the charging cycle. As the battery is discharged, electrons are stripped from the sodium metal producing free sodium-ions that move to the cathode compartment. One battery set currently available has a one MW capacity providing up to 6 MWh of energy from 20 modules each capable of supplying 50 kW.", "Sodium Nickel Chloride Batteries", "Sodium nickel chloride batteries are another high-temperature battery. When charging a Sodium-nickel-chloride battery at normal operating temperatures, salt (NaCl) and nickel (Ni) are transformed into nickel-chloride (NiCl2) and molten sodium (Na), with the chemical reactions reversed during discharge. The electrodes are separated by a ceramic electrolyte that is conductive for sodium ions but an isolator for electrons. Therefore, the cell reaction can only occur if an external circuit allows electron flow equal to the sodium ion current. Cells are hermetically sealed and packaged into modules of about 20 kWh each. The DOE/EPRI report says that utility systems were beginning to be deployed systems in the size range of 50 kW to 1 MW.", "New Modular Battery Technologies", "According to one observer of the modular battery industry, a new technology for grid scale storage \"will be needed to hit the cost levels for continuous deployment,\" if battery storage deployment is to be sustained beyond 2020. In that timeframe, a potential consolidation of the Li Ion industry was suggested by the observer, which would lead suppliers to potentially focus on new liquid metal technologies to achieve a \"necessary cost-competitive, 20-year life performance.\"", "Research into permeable membranes may result in replacements for brittle ceramic separators in today's NaS batteries. A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) described how novel mesh membranes could lead to new grid-scale batteries with electrodes made of sodium and nickel chloride. The MIT team projected that the membranes could result in new types of liquid metal batteries, enabling \"inexpensive battery technology\" to make intermittent power sources such as wind and solar capable of delivering reliable baseload electricity.", "Appendix B. Ancillary Services for the Grid ", "Ancillary services are used by grid operators to ensure the reliability and stability of the power system, by helping to match power generation and demand. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) defines ancillary services as:", "Those services necessary to support the transmission of electric power from seller to purchaser, given the obligations of control areas and transmitting utilities within those control areas, to maintain reliable operations of the interconnected transmission system. Ancillary services supplied with generation include load following, reactive power-voltage regulation, system protective services, loss compensation service, system control, load dispatch services, and energy imbalance services.", "According to one source, ancillary services can be put into three main categories. These include:", "Flexibility-related services, which balance supply and demand, are provided by operating reserves, Frequency-related services, which maintain a constant rate of 60 Hertz, and are provided by regulating reserves, and, Voltage-related services, which control stability across the system.", "Flexibility-related ancillary services include:", "Ramping or load following relate to the vital task of bringing online, or taking offline, power plants typically over the course of a few seconds or minutes to several hours to meet changing load or supply conditions. Such activity has long been a part of daily grid operations, particularly to meet expected changes in demand throughout the day. Demand for power commonly fluctuates sub-hourly, hourly, daily and seasonally. Natural gas-fired power plants, for example, have the flexibility to quickly ramp up or down their energy output as system conditions change throughout a given day. Operating reserves are ancillary services that explicitly provide the ability to quickly fill in new energy supply when needed because of unexpected changes in the supply/demand balance, as well as supporting voltage and frequency. Most systems rely on two types of operating reserves: (1) contingency spinning (or synchronous) reserves that usually can respond very quickly, within ten to fifteen minutes, and (2) non-spinning (or supplemental) reserves that typically have response times on the order of ten to 30 minutes or more. A reserve margin is the \"percentage of installed capacity exceeding the expected peak demand during a specified period,\" and varies according to regional regulatory requirements. For instance, a reserve margin of 15% means that an electric system has excess capacity in the amount of 15% of expected peak demand. Spinning reserves are provided by generation units that are actively generating (and whose turbines are \"spinning\") and thus can quickly increase or decrease their output when called upon within the required time. Non-spinning or non-synchronized reserves are provided by generation resources that are not actively generating, but are ready and able to start up quickly and begin providing energy to the grid within a specified timeframe. In some regions, these non-spinning reserves are referred to as fast-start resources.", "Frequency-related services include:", "Regulating reserves are actions that can respond in seconds to grid fluctuations or emergencies to stabilize frequency and to rebalance supply with demand.

Real power is what most would refer to as electricity, measured in kiloWatts (kW). Reactive power must be available locally to transfer active power across the network. In other words, to get and maintain the desired voltage at a given location, a precise amount of reactive power must be present.", "Normally, designated power plants are used to generate reactive power to offset reactance in the grid. Many smaller coal-fired power plants that were transitioned to provide reactive power as they aged, are now being retired.
