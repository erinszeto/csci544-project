Concerns that EPA lacked sufficient authority to take such actions, among other concerns, led to the enactment of the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (P.L. 114-182), which amended TSCA, in 2016. Still, Congress requires that implementation of the amended TSCA balance two objectives\u2014the protection of public health and the environment from unreasonable risks and the regulation of chemicals in a manner that does not \"impede unduly or create unnecessary economic barriers to technological innovation.\"", "TSCA as amended requires EPA to gather existing information (e.g., production volumes, health and safety studies) regarding potential chemical risks from chemical manufacturers, processors, and distributors. Manufacturers of new chemicals must notify EPA prior to the chemical being commercialized. Similar notification requirements apply to chemicals proposed for uses determined by EPA to be significant new uses.", "If EPA has inadequate information on a chemical to determine whether it presents unreasonable risks, TSCA authorizes the agency to require the development of new information necessary for the evaluation of risks. For information submitted under TSCA, the act establishes a framework to protect from disclosure information that warrants confidential treatment and to ensure that certain types of information are disclosed.", "To identify which chemicals may warrant regulation, TSCA requires EPA to systematically prioritize chemicals for risk evaluation and to regulate those chemicals that present unreasonable risks to ensure they no longer do so. If EPA finds that a chemical presents unreasonable risk, TSCA requires the agency to undertake rulemaking to regulate the chemical.", "EPA must take regulatory action on specific chemicals that exhibit characteristics known to present greater risks in an expedited manner. For instance, EPA may promulgate requirements to address risks presented by certain persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals without conducting a risk evaluation. Additionally, TSCA authorizes EPA to commence a civil action against imminently hazardous chemicals and expedite review of chemicals that present significant risk of serious or widespread harm.", "For new chemicals and chemicals proposed for a significant new use determined to warrant evaluation by EPA, the agency must make a determination regarding unreasonable risk within 90 days of the required notification unless extended for good cause.", "Under TSCA, requirements that apply to chemical manufacture apply in the same way to chemical importation. TSCA establishes procedures for handling imports of chemicals that do not comply with requirements under the act. Chemicals marked for export only are subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements unless EPA has previously taken regulatory action to require the development of new information or establish a requirement to protect against unreasonable risk.", "TSCA includes provisions to allow citizens to challenge EPA implementation of the act. Additionally, TSCA includes provisions for enforcement, including inspection and administrative subpoena authority, establishment of civil and criminal penalties for violations, and citizen suits to allow any person to enforce the act.", "TSCA provides a federal role for the evaluation and restriction of chemicals, but, unlike most other federal environmental statutes, does not provide for delegation to, or implementation by, states. However, states may evaluate and regulate chemicals under their own authorities. TSCA provides limited explicit preemption of state requirements, although long-standing state requirements are generally preserved. If a state requirement does not meet one of the exceptions from preemption, waivers from preemption may be available under certain circumstances.", "Although authorization of appropriations to carry out TSCA expired in 1983, Congress has continued to fund TSCA activities through annual discretionary appropriations. TSCA authorizes EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers and processors to partially defray costs that the agency may incur from evaluating information submissions, conducting risk evaluations and developing regulations.", "The original 1976 act, which was amended by P.L. 114-182, is referred to as Title I. Since 1976, Congress has added five other titles to TSCA to address specific chemical concerns. The five additional titles of TSCA are not discussed in this report."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["In 1976, President Ford signed into law the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to identify and regulate chemicals in U.S. commerce that present an \"unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment\" or an imminent hazard. In proposing the legislative framework for TSCA, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) of President Nixon's Administration highlighted concerns with risks from metals (e.g., lead, cadmium, mercury, and vanadium), metal compounds, and synthetic organic chemicals (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, nitrilotriacetic acid, orthonitrochlorobenzene). CEQ noted that pollution control and consumer or occupational safety statutes in effect at the time limited the federal government to controlling pollution at the end of the chemical lifecycle or restricting chemicals that have specific uses (e.g., pesticides, food). ", "Since 1976, Congress has added five other titles to TSCA to address specific chemical concerns. The original 1976 act is referred to as Title I, which is the focus of this report. None of the additional titles made amendments to the core chemical evaluation and regulatory program under Title I and therefore are not discussed in this report. ", "To determine which chemicals warrant regulation under TSCA, EPA has required chemical manufacturers and processors to report information on chemicals being manufactured or processed in the United States to the agency. For certain chemicals that EPA determined not to have adequate information to evaluate risks, the agency has required chemical manufacturers and processors to develop new information necessary to evaluate risks.", "Based on the evaluation of information available to the agency, EPA has restricted few chemicals reported to have been in commerce prior to 1976. For chemicals introduced into commerce after 1976, EPA established a program to identify which of those chemicals warranted regulation and has taken regulatory action on a subset of such chemicals. However, over time as EPA administered TSCA, environmental and public health organizations questioned whether the agency had sufficient information to evaluate risks from chemicals and whether the agency could demonstrate that the risks of a chemical met the threshold for regulating a chemical. To address these issues and others, multiple proposals to amend TSCA were introduced beginning in the 109 th Congress through the 114 th Congress.", "On June 22, 2016, President Obama signed into law the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21 st Century Act ( P.L. 114-182 ), which amended TSCA. P.L. 114-182 broadly amended the information gathering, chemical evaluation, and regulation authorities of TSCA and also provided additional procedures and standards for confidential treatment or disclosure of information submitted to EPA under TSCA. To supplement funding provided for TSCA implementation, P.L. 114-182 expanded EPA authority to collect fees from chemical manufacturers and processors to partially defray the costs of conducting risk evaluations. With these amendments to TSCA, EPA implementation of the statute is ongoing, and, to date, no additional chemicals reported to have been in commerce before 1976 have been regulated, though the agency continues to gather information on, and evaluate risks for, a wide variety of chemicals.", "As Congress debated whether to expand EPA authority to regulate chemicals under TSCA leading up to the enactment of P.L. 114-182 , federal preemption of state requirements became a key issue. As enacted in 1976, TSCA preempted state and local requirements for specific chemicals for which EPA has required the development of new information or taken regulatory action under the act. In the years between the original enactment of TSCA in 1976 and the enactment of P.L. 114-182 in 2016, some states and localities enacted their own laws or promulgated regulations pertaining to chemicals. States and localities took regulatory action in response to concerns regarding the risks of commercial chemicals and the absence of federal regulatory action. The chemical industry and associated entities (e.g., retailers) expressed concern over regulatory requirements that differed from one state to another. P.L. 114-182 established additional conditions in which TSCA requirements would or would not preempt state chemical regulatory requirements.", "The following sections of the report summarize the major authorities of TSCA and cover the following topics: ", "1. the overall scope and applicability of authorities under TSCA; 2. the information gathering authorities; 3. the confidentiality and disclosure of information submitted to EPA under the act; 4. the framework for prioritizing chemicals for evaluation, evaluating risks, and regulating those chemicals that present unreasonable or imminent risks; 5. the applicability of the act to chemical imports; 6. the requirements for chemical export notification; 7. the process in filing citizen petitions and bringing citizen suits; 8. the enforcement of the act; 9. the federal and state roles under the act; and 10. the resources to administer the act.

Congress excluded groups from the reach of TSCA through the statutory definition of \"chemical substance,\" which broadly includes substances that have a particular molecular identity but excludes", "pesticides; tobacco and tobacco products; certain radioactive materials; firearms (including pistols and revolvers), shells, cartridges, and their components; food (including poultry, meat, and eggs), food additives (including food contact substances), drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices; and mixtures.", "Although the definition of a chemical substance excludes mixtures, multiple TSCA provisions apply to mixtures, which the act generally defines as combinations of chemical substances not resulting from a chemical reaction. References hereinafter to \"chemicals\" in the report collectively refer to chemical substances and mixtures. Provisions that apply specifically to chemical substances or mixtures are noted accordingly. Generally, mixtures are subject to requirements under TSCA if requirements that pertain to the constituent chemical substances of a mixture are not adequate in evaluating or controlling risks.

In effect, the exclusions and limitations in TSCA may restrict the applicability or scope of the regulatory authorities under the act.", "For example, in multiple provisions under TSCA, an \"unreasonable risk\" finding or determination is a prerequisite for EPA to take action to require information on, or regulate, a chemical. TSCA does not explicitly define what constitutes unreasonable risk, which, in effect, gives discretion to EPA on the interpretation of the statutory term. In 1991, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the \"unreasonable risk\" standard as originally set forth in TSCA meant that \"[i]n evaluating what is 'unreasonable,' the EPA is required to consider the costs of any proposed actions and to 'carry out this chapter in a reasonable and prudent manner [after considering] the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.'\" This interpretation led the court to vacate parts of an EPA rule that regulated various asbestos uses.", "Though P.L. 114-182 did not amend TSCA to explicitly define unreasonable risk , it prohibited EPA from considering cost or nonrisk factors when evaluating risks, although those factors must be considered in rulemaking to restrict a chemical identified for regulatory control. Additionally, P.L. 114-182 codified existing agency practice to consider risks for \"potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations\" when evaluating the risks of a chemical.", "Even if EPA were to determine unreasonable risk, TSCA provides that authorities under other federal law supersede TSCA authorities to address unreasonable risks. If EPA were to determine that a risk associated with a chemical may be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by actions taken under the authorities of other federal law the agency administers, Section 9(b) requires the agency to use those authorities to protect against the risk unless the agency determines that it is in the public interest to take action under TSCA. If EPA were to determine that a chemical presents an unreasonable risk that may be prevented or reduced sufficiently by action taken under a federal law administered by another federal agency, Section 9(a) directs EPA to submit to that other agency a report describing the risk and a request for response. The federal agency receiving a report from EPA must respond within 90 days (or a shorter period if specified by EPA). If that federal agency issues an order disagreeing that the chemical presents unreasonable risk identified by EPA or initiates action to protect against such risk, then EPA may not regulate the chemical under TSCA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Role of Scientific and Technical Information", "paragraphs": ["Under TSCA, scientific and technical information about a chemical serves as the starting point to a risk evaluation that may lead to regulatory action. The chemical industry and environmental and public health organizations have contested on occasion the quality of scientific and technical information that EPA relies upon to make regulatory decisions under TSCA. P.L. 114-182 added various provisions to TSCA to specify how EPA is to use scientific and technical information to carry out the act. In determining whether to require development of new information or to regulate a chemical that presents unreasonable risks, EPA must consider, as applicable, the \"best available science\" and factors generally used to assess the quality of scientific information. EPA must also consider \"reasonably available information\" that relates to the conditions of use of chemicals and make decisions based on the \"weight of the scientific evidence.\" By June 2018, EPA must develop policies, procedures, and \"guidance\" necessary to carry out the amendments to TSCA made by P.L. 114-182 . EPA must periodically review these policies, procedures, and guidance for their adequacy in carrying out the law and revise them if necessary to reflect new scientific developments or understandings.

EPA refers to this list as the TSCA Inventory. The list includes approximately 60,000 chemical substances that were reported to the agency soon after the original enactment of TSCA. EPA refers to these substances as \"existing\" substances. New chemical substances are to be included on the inventory upon their manufacture in the United States. Since the original enactment of TSCA, more than 24,000 chemical substances have been added to the TSCA Inventory as new chemical substances.
