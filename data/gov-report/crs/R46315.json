The CARES Act provides over $2 trillion in relief to individuals; businesses; state, local, and federal agencies; and industry sectors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government-led effort to limit its public health impact. Given the scope of the relief provided, the variety of new and existing programs that are to provide this aid, and the number of individuals and entities receiving aid, the administration of the CARES Act is likely to be a complicated and significant undertaking by executive branch agencies and non-federal partners. These complexities may be made even greater by both pressure to provide relief as swiftly as possible and unique logistical challenges posed by the ongoing public health emergency.", "All of those factors make Congress's oversight role during the COVID-19 pandemic especially important and may make it more difficult for Congress to conduct timely oversight. Congress included a variety of oversight mechanisms in the CARES Act. In addition to requiring executive branch officers to submit reports on a variety of topics, provide notice before taking specified actions, and testify before certain committees, the CARES Act provides additional resources to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and to Offices of Inspectors General (OIGs) that may have additional audit and investigative activity due to the CARES Act. In addition, the CARES Act creates three new oversight entities: a Congressional Oversight Commission, a Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR), and the Pandemic Recovery Accountability Committee (PRAC, a group of inspectors general). Each of those entities is empowered to provide oversight of significant aspects of the CARES Act.
