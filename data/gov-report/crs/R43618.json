Nicknamed the Hercules, this venerable aircraft has been the workhorse of U.S. tactical airlift for the past 57 years. The majority of C-130s in the U.S. government are assigned to the U.S. Air Force, but the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard also operate sizeable C-130 fleets. The potential concerns for Congress include oversight of and appropriations for an aging C-130 fleet.", "As the C-130 fleet ages, management issues arise with reduced reliability, obsolescence and reduced parts availability, and changing aviation rules that impact the C-130's ability to operate worldwide. The C-130 program recently passed a major milestone; the FY2013 NDAA authorized the Secretary of the Air Force to enter into one or more multi-year contracts for the procurement of C-130J aircraft for the Department of the Air Force and the Department of the Navy. This was a significant step toward recapitalizing a portion of the fleet. As Congress decides the future of the tactical airlift fleet, a significant decision is whether or not to continue recapitalizing the fleet with new aircraft. This issue is fueled by several factors, including aircraft life cycles, cost, basing strategy, strategic guidance, the industrial base, and the desired capabilities mix. With these factors in mind, the services have committed to recapitalize a large portion of the C-130 fleet. However, at current production rates, there will still be aircraft in the fleet much older than the crews that fly them well into the future.", "A common strategy to extend the life of an aircraft fleet is to modernize the current airframes with new components. This strategy attempts to combat issues that plague an aging fleet such as diminishing reliability, antiquated avionics, and capabilities that no longer meet current requirements. The cost of modernization is commonly the driving factor behind these efforts. Analyzing the return on investment of modernizing components on aging aircraft versus recapitalizing the fleet to gain new capabilities will inform these decisions. Congress is currently faced with deciding the future of several modernization efforts being considered for the C-130 fleet.", "Circumstances that arise due to the changing nature of the global environment may drive decisions by Congress to reduce the size of the fleet by divesting some aircraft. With the current drawdown of U.S. military forces, perhaps the desired future capability can be met with fewer aircraft. Divesting aircraft from a fleet involves a detailed analysis of the capabilities that remain in the desired end-state fleet. Ideally, the required capabilities to meet strategic guidance still reside within the system as a whole when aircraft are retired. The mix of Active and Reserve forces that remain after drawing down a fleet may also be a significant concern. This mix of Active, Guard, and Reserve forces may also lead to decisions regarding force structure. Adjustments to force structure within the Guard and Reserve have been a contentious issue in the past and will require congressional oversight and approval."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The national defense strategy of the United States is evolving in response to changing global environments. As Congress responds to these changes, an important aspect is the responsibility for oversight and appropriations for an aging tactical airlift fleet. The C-130 has been the cornerstone of the U.S. tactical airlift fleet since the late 1950s. Military planners believe that C-130 aircraft provide the United States an edge in achieving national goals. They provide a capability to rapidly deliver forces making conventional deterrence more effective and expanding the ability to provide humanitarian assistance. However, the fleet has aged with some current models being flown by aircrew younger than the aircraft they are flying. As the fleet ages, management issues arise with reduced reliability, obsolescence and reduced parts availability, and changing aviation rules that impact availability of airspace due to obsolete avionics capabilities.", "Over the past 57 years, several models of the C-130 were built and delivered to the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, with the C-130J model being the most recent. These aircraft are referred to as tactical airlifters because they can deliver passengers and cargo directly into remote or austere areas. In contrast, strategic airlift delivers capability on a global scale and more routinely operate from large airports. ", "The FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act provided guidance on recapitalizing a portion of the C-130 fleet, but a significant number of aircraft may still need to be replaced, modernized or retired to maintain the desired capabilities. Recapitalizing refers to replacing older model aircraft with new production aircraft. As Congress shapes the tactical airlift fleet of the future, there may also be decisions regarding force structure or infrastructure that may impact C-130 basing. ", "While these aircraft may be supporting the individual service's mission on a day to day basis, they are also routinely assigned to joint commands in support of ongoing operations. Warfighting and theater engagement is conducted by geographic combatant commands. These combatant commands are often operationally assigned C-130s to accomplish their mission. Based on this command relationship, there may be an Air Force C-130 assigned to a base in Arkansas temporarily stationed within one of the combatant command's area of responsibility (AOR) executing operations in support of the defense strategy. For example, when called upon during crisis such as the super typhoon Haiyan that struck the Philippines in November 2013, tactical airlift played a critical role in delivering aid within the region. ", "As stated in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, the U.S. military must be prepared to", "protect the homeland, to deter and defeat attacks on the United States and to support civil authorities in mitigating the effects of potential attacks and natural disasters; build security globally, in order to preserve regional stability, deter adversaries, support allies and partners, and cooperate with others to address common security challenges; and project power and win decisively, to defeat aggression, disrupt and destroy terrorist networks, and provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.", "To accomplish these goals, the U.S. military needs the ability to deploy rapidly and sustain capabilities to all regions of the world. Maintaining the correct mix of intra- and inter-theater airlift provides this capability.", "In his most recent overarching guidance to the Department of Defense, President Obama outlined several guiding principles of force and program development to ensure mission success:", "maintain a broad portfolio of military capabilities that, in the aggregate, offer versatility across the range of missions; differentiate between those investments that should be made today and those that can be deferred; maintain a ready and capable force, even as we reduce our overall capacity; reduce the \"cost of doing business;\" examine the mix of Active Component (AC) and Reserve Component (RC) elements best suited to the strategy; and make every effort in adjusting U.S. strategy and attendant force size to maintain both an adequate industrial base and investment in science and technology.", "In regards to maintaining a broad portfolio of capabilities, tactical airlift is often considered a critical element in offering versatility. Versatility in this context is how quickly and easily the military can transition between missions. For example, a C-130 could provide humanitarian support to a natural disaster area in the morning and swing to transporting military forces into a combat operation later that day. How this resource is managed may shape how versatile future U.S. capabilities will be. This report will examine some factors in deciding which C-130 investments may be made today or deferred and in doing so which capabilities are at risk. This report will also review, in light of current investments, the C-130 acquisition strategy and review how this strategy may reduce overall procurement cost and its impact on the industrial base.", "C-130 procurement is accomplished under a total force construct with the U.S. Air Force as the lead command for all C-130 procurement. This construct attempts to streamline the overall process and induce cost savings. Additionally, the C-130 fleet is particularly well suited to encourage analysis of the Active Duty/Reserve Component mix due to the large number of aircraft in the Guard and Reserve forces.", "In concert with these guiding principles, this report will review the following congressional issues associated with managing an aging C-130 fleet:", "How many C-130s are needed to execute the defense strategy?

The current FY2014-FY2018 multi-year procurement lists the cost for 79 C-130J aircraft at $5.8B. While this is a significant investment, new aircraft may produce cost savings over time. The C-130J can carry more cargo, fly greater distances, and incur fewer maintenance costs than the older C-130H models which may create savings in the future. ", "In choosing modernization over recapitalization there are several issues to address. Most importantly, what components should be modernized? The current fleet has significant structural issues and older C-130Hs will need to modify the center wing box structure to extend their service life at some point. This modification costs approximately $7 million per aircraft. There are also potential problems with the current avionics capability in the C-130H. Within the next several years there are anticipated changes to the international and domestic flight rules with which current C-130Hs cannot comply due to outdated avionics. If no upgrades are performed to the avionics and the rules do change there may be areas of the world, including airspace around busy U.S. airports, that may be inaccessible to C-130H aircraft. The upgrades to the avionics also come with a menu of options that start with minimal capability upgrades to significant overhauls of the current system. The costs will likely rise as more significant upgrades are accomplished. ", "The overall decisions regarding the C-130 fleet are complex with several variables. One approach might be to forecast what the fleet of 2025 might look like and how this supports expected future requirements. If current production rates are maintained, the fleet will have several older model aircraft in the inventory well into the future.

Defined as the loss of commercial sources of items or material, DMS surfaces when a source announces the actual or impending discontinuation of a product, or when procurements fail because of product unavailability. DMS is a significant issue for the C-130H fleet, primarily because the C-130H has old and outdated avionics; 22% of the avionics are already obsolete according to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. This was magnified by the decision to cancel the C-130 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP), which was originally planned to address DMS issues within the fleet. Since the older parts would be replaced with new parts as part of the AMP, the DMS issue faded during the life of that program. When the Air Force attempted to cancel the program in 2012 and airplanes were no longer being modified, the DMS issues again became a rising concern. According to the recent Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) study addressing C-130 avionics modernization, 75% of the avionic pieces-parts will be considered to be obsolete by FY2023.

If the decision was made to continue to replace the USN/USMC H models at a rate of 10 per year, the new regulatory guidance may not be an issue, as there is expected to be some relief from these regulations for aircraft that are retiring.

A major modification currently being accomplished on the C-130 fleet to extend the service life is the replacement of the center wing box, a critical fatigue component of the C-130 fleet due to the stresses of flying missions over such a long period of time. The center wing box is attached to the fuselage and forms the center section of the wing. Two outer wing sections connect to the left and right ends of the center wing. ", "There have been problems historically with fatigue cracking of the center wing on Special Operations Forces (SOF) aircraft in the early 1990s and on the combat delivery fleet in 2000-2005. The fatigue cracking detected on combat delivery aircraft ultimately led to the implementation of strict service life limits that were implemented in 2005. The implementation of these limits led to the numerous aircraft being grounded or restricted in 2005. The center wing replacement modification replaces C-130H center wings with either Extended Service Life (ESL) center wings or standard center wings. ", "The ESL wing has been the production wing on C-130Js since 2009. To date, 128 center wings have been replaced on USAF aircraft. Fifty center wings were replaced with ESL center wings on special mission aircraft from 1993-2000, and 77 center wings have been modified on special mission and combat delivery aircraft since 2007 with 37 aircraft receiving ESL center wings and 40 aircraft receiving standard center wings. The FY2015 USAF budget requested funding from Congress to continue the center wing replacement program. ", "The Coast Guard has identified six aircraft to undergo center wing box replacement. The first was completed in August 2012, in partnership with the Air Force. The second is scheduled for November 14, but once again the transfer of the 14 C-27s may impact these modifications as the fleet numbers are changing.

The operational demand would be how many passengers and cargo the user must deliver and the force mix refers to the number of Active versus Reserve forces. The report suggested that in an environment in which capacity exceeds demand, the more cost effective force mix favors the Reserve Component (RC) conversely if demand exceeds capacity a larger Active Component (AC) force would be more favorable. The study goes on to say that, generally speaking, for the purposes of meeting strategic surge demand, RC units provide mission-ready aircraft with competent aircrew and maintenance workforces at a lower cost than AC units. However the complementary depth and capacity provided by the RC units is offset by the agility and responsiveness relied upon in the AC. The report suggested that from a cost perspective, the nation is well served by a sustained Active Component/Reserve Component mix. The illustration below is a graphical representation of the Active and Reserve force mix; how far up or down the diagonal line one sets the force posture determines the operational mix of force. The challenge for Congress is determining this tradeoff between the agility of the Active force and the depth/cost of the Reserve Components.

This alternative increases the capability of a fleet during periods of long-term steady state operations without altering the fully mobilized capability. ", "Returning to the graphic above, if the force is continually tasked (move left on the diagonal line), even below surge levels, the availability of the RC on short notice could become an issue, making a case for more AC forces. The reverse is also true. If the assumption is made that future steady state operations will be less demanding, the case for more RC forces is strengthened. The statement regarding mobilized capability refers to the assumption that RC forces are not activated during the long-term steady state operation. If the RC forces were activated, then dwell-rates may increase costs. ", "2. Create More Associate Units: If greater access to C-130 aircraft is needed to meet daily operational demands over sustained periods, the creation of more associate units in which AC flight crews are assigned to fly RC aircraft is a reasonable option.

While not directly addressing C-130 units, the commission did make a number of recommendations favoring an increased utilization of the Air Reserve Component. The commission also recommended integration of units currently structured under classic or active associations in order to reduce redundant organizational overhead. If this recommendation were to be adopted, the current C-130 active associations would integrate Active and Reserve component members under one organization.

In terms of the Air Force C-130 combat delivery fleet, the USAF currently far exceeds this recommendation with close to 70% of the aircraft assigned to the Reserve Component. The commission also recommended that the Air Force consider, and Congress allow, the closing or warm basing of some installations. A few of the recommendations that pertain to the AC/RC mix follow: In the FY2015 National Defense Authorization Act and Defense Appropriations Act, Congress should allow DOD increased flexibility in applying budget cuts across budget categories, including installations; The Air Force should consider, and Congress should allow, the closing or warm basing of some installations; To ensure the Air Force leverages full capacity of all components of the force, in its FY2016 Program Objective Memorandum, the Air Force should plan, program, and budget for increased reliance on the Reserve Components. The commission recommends: (1) the Air Force should include in all future budget submissions a specific funding line for \"operational support by the Air Reserve Component\" to clearly identify those funds programmed for routine periodic employment of the ARC either as volunteers or under the authority of 10 U.S.C. \u00a712304b; (2) in its future budget submissions the Air Force should program for approximately 15,000 man years of operational support annually by the Air Reserve Component; (3) in succeeding years, the Air Force should monitor the execution of this program element to ensure it is utilizing the Air Reserve Component to its fullest extent; The Chief of Staff of the Air Force should direct the integration of Air Force Reserve associations of flights, squadrons, groups, and wings into corresponding Active Component organizations in order to eliminate the current redundant organizational overhead found in classic associations; and The Chief of Staff of the Air Force should direct the integration of Air Force flights, squadrons, groups, and wings into corresponding Air National Guard organizations in order to eliminate the current redundant organizational overhead found in active associations.
