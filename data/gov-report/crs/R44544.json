Because of semiconductors new industries have emerged and existing ones, such as aerospace and automotive, have been transformed. Semiconductors have contributed in powerful and unique ways to nearly all fields of science and engineering, and semiconductors' economic and military importance has made the industry's health a focus of congressional interest for nearly 70 years. In July 2015, Congress formed the Semiconductor Caucus, a group that seeks to advance policies that support the U.S. semiconductor industry.", "The federal government played a central role in the creation of the U.S. semiconductor industry. World War II funding for electronics and materials research and development (R&D) provided essential support for the invention and refinement of semiconductors. Federal investments in computing advances also created an important application for semiconductors and federal acquisitions for defense, space, and civilian applications made up the lion's share of the early semiconductor market. In the face of formidable competition from Japanese companies in the 1980s, Congress co-funded SEMATECH, an industry research consortium devoted to developing the technologies needed by U.S. firms to remain competitive. Today, Congress continues to provide funding for R&D and development of scientific and engineering talent in support of the industry. In 2015, Congress acted to make the R&D tax credit permanent, a policy priority of the industry.", "An ongoing issue of congressional interest is the retention of high-value semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. In 2015, semiconductor manufacturers directly employed 181,000 workers, who earned an average wage of $138,100, more than twice the average wage for all U.S. manufacturing workers. Increasingly, however, U.S. firms are building semiconductor fabrication plans (fabs) abroad, primarily in Asia. In addition, some semiconductor firms are going \"fab-less,\" focusing corporate resources on chip design and relying on contract fabs abroad to manufacture their products. At year-end 2015, there were 94 advanced fabs in operation worldwide, of which 17 were in the United States, 71 in Asia (including 9 in China), and 6 in Europe. The Chinese government regards the development of a domestic, globally competitive semiconductor industry as a strategic priority with a stated goal of becoming self-sufficient in all areas of the semiconductor supply chain by 2030. China faces significant barriers to entry in this mature, capital-intensive, R&D-intensive industry.", "Because the primary market for U.S.-based semiconductor firms is located outside the United States (83% in 2015), passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement and successful conclusion of the ongoing Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations with Europe are top industry priorities. In 2015, exports of U.S. semiconductors and related devices totaled $41.8 billion, making it the nation's fourth-largest overall exporting industry. The 2015 expansion of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a plurilateral tariff-cutting agreement focused on trade in information technology goods, is considered a major success for the U.S. semiconductor industry.", "Semiconductor manufacturing also raises national security concerns, including secure access to trusted suppliers of advanced semiconductors and other critical technology components that are important for certain defense and national security applications.

Early computers relied on thousands of vacuum tubes, crystal diodes, relays, resistors, and capacitors to perform simple calculations. The federal government, academia, and U.S. industry undertook efforts to reduce and simplify the number of these devices. The invention of the transistor, a simple semiconductor device capable of regulating the flow of electricity, was followed by the development of the integrated circuit (IC), in 1958. ICs allowed thousands of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transistors to be \"printed\" and connected on a single piece of semiconductor material, so that they functioned as a single integrated device. In addition to funding academic and industrial research that contributed to the early development of semiconductor technology, the federal government played a central role in the commercialization of the technology through purchases of semiconductors for a variety of military, space, and civilian applications. ", "The semiconductor industry has a rapid internal product development cycle, first described by the former CEO and co-founder of Intel Corporation, Gordon Moore. Moore's Law, which is actually an observation about the pace of development and cost reduction in chip speeds, has held true for decades. It states that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit will double about every 18 months to two years, making semiconductors smaller, faster, and cheaper. The effects of Moore's law are evident in short product life-cycles, requiring semiconductor manufacturers to maintain high levels of research and investment spending. A main challenge for the industry is that semiconductor inventory and technology can become obsolete quickly, leaving producers with serious financial problems if they have unsalable inventories as improved designs displace existing products.", "A major question facing semiconductor manufacturers is whether fundamental physical limits may soon make it difficult to pack more transistors onto a silicon device in an economical way . If this proves to be the case\u2014the continuing validity of Moore's law is hotly debated\u2014then manufacturers would need to find other methods of improving semiconductors. Research is underway into new approaches to computing (such as quantum computing, optical computing, and neuromorphic (brain-like) computing) that could, theoretically, vastly surpass the storage, processing, and transmission capabilities of semiconductor technology.

Analog device products account for about 13% of semiconductor industry sales. ", "Many manufacturers specialize in certain types of semiconductors. For example, South Korean manufacturers Samsung and SK Hynix and U.S.-based Micron together account for 90% of global DRAM sales. Heavy dependence on the DRAM market has been a challenge for these companies, as weak demand or excess capacity have at times led to dramatic reductions in prices. U.S.-based Intel Corporation, the largest semiconductor manufacturer by sales, is highly dependent on supplying microprocessors to the personal computer industry. Microprocessors are harder to manufacture, more technologically advanced, and more expensive than other semiconductor products, providing Intel some shelter from competition, but the company is nonetheless affected by weakening global demand for personal computers. ", "Multicomponent semiconductors (MCOs) represent a fast-growing segment of the semiconductor industry. These devices combine two semiconductors into a single unit, which takes up less room within the finished product and use less power. MCOs are commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and automotive braking, steering, and air bag systems. Although SIA does not track sales figures for this market, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) estimates that MCOs account for between 1.5% and 3.0% of global semiconductor industry sales. Demand growth is expected to be high in coming years as end-use producers use MCOs to make smaller, lighter, and faster devices that consume less power. U.S.-headquartered companies such as Intel, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, and Broadcom are among the leaders in this market segment.

According to a 2013 communication by the European Commission, Europe made up about 50% of worldwide automotive electronics production and around 35% of global industrial electronics production. The Commission also stated that Europe is strong in manufacturing electronics for energy applications, accounting for about 40% of global production in that market, and in designing electronics for mobile telecommunications. Of the $335 billion in global semiconductor sales, European-headquartered semiconductor firms accounted for about $34 billion in sales in 2015, according to figures from WSTS. ", "In May 2013, the Commission announced an initiative to support the European semiconductor industry. The initiative, set to run from 2014 to 2020, aims to increase Europe's share of global semiconductor manufacturing to at least 20% by the end of the decade by providing $11 billion (\u20ac10 billion) in public and private funding for R&D activities that it hopes will trigger about $113 billion (\u20ac100 billion) in industry investment in manufacturing. The initiative calls for a multipronged approach that includes easier access to capital financing by qualified companies; pooling EU, national, and regional subsidies to enable larger-scale projects; and, improving worker training.

That role, however, has changed considerably over time. In the early years, federal support for the nascent industry included research funding; support for the development of increasingly powerful computers; and, serving as an early adopter of semiconductor-enabled technologies, creating a market through defense and space-related acquisitions. From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, the federal role centered on reversing a perceived loss of U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors through the initiation and funding of an industry research consortium. More recently, the federal role has focused on support for research to extend the life of current semiconductor technologies and to develop the scientific and technological underpinnings for revolutionary successor technologies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Early Efforts in Computing", "paragraphs": ["Two developments in the late 1940s, computers and transistors, laid the foundation for development of the semiconductor and computing industries. The first was the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), the first general-purpose electronic digital computer, which was announced in 1946. The Army Ballistic Research Laboratory funded development of the ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania to calculate artillery firing tables. With semiconductor devices still in the future, the ENIAC used thousands of vacuum tubes, crystal diodes, relays, resistors, and capacitors, making it large enough to fill a 30-by-50-foot room. The second major development came in 1947 when Bell Telephone Laboratories (known broadly as Bell Labs), building on federal World War II research investments, invented the transistor, a semiconductor device capable of regulating the flow of electricity.", "For the next decade, engineers sought to increase computer performance by overcoming the \"tyranny of numbers,\" a term referring to the need to connect all of a computer's components to each other, a task requiring the hand-soldering of each connection. As the number of components grew to increase computing power, so did the number of connections required, adding to complexity, cost, and reliability issues. The Army Signal Corps attempted to address these challenges by funding a program which sought to make all components the same size and shape, with the wiring built in, so they could be snapped together to form a circuit without the need for soldering. A different solution was developed in 1958 by Texas Instruments with the invention of the integrated circuit (IC), which incorporated resistors, capacitors, and transistors on a single sliver of the semiconducting element germanium. Shortly thereafter, Fairchild Semiconductor developed a silicon-based IC that included a final layer of metal, parts of which could be removed to create the necessary connections, making it more suitable for mass production. While the invention of the IC was accomplished without direct federal funding, government purchases of ICs for military, space, and other uses supplied the initial demand that allowed manufacturers to reduce costs.

Rodgers. In a 1998 paper, Rodgers asserted that SEMATECH's federal funding was a subsidy to large, wealthy companies; that hundreds of smaller semiconductor firms were excluded from participating in SEMATECH due to its minimum $1 million annual dues; and that SEMATECH engaged in \"hold back\" contracts that denied non-SEMATECH firms access to technology that emerged from SEMATECH research. Summing up, Rodgers stated that SEMATECH \"used the combined resources of its members and the government to create a competitive advantage, and it kept its secrets from its competitors.\"", "In July 1994, the SEMATECH Board of Directors voted to not accept any additional federal funding after FY1996.
