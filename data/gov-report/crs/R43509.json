The BOP currently operates 119 correctional facilities across the country. The BOP also contracts with Residential Re-entry Centers (RRCs) (i.e., halfway houses) to provide assistance to inmates nearing release.

The S&E account (i.e., the operating budget) provides for the custody and care of federal inmates and for the daily maintenance and operations of correctional facilities, regional offices, and BOP's central office in Washington, DC. It also provides funding for the incarceration of federal inmates in state, local, and private facilities. The B&F account (i.e., the capital budget) provides funding for the construction of new facilities and the modernization, repair, and expansion of existing facilities. In addition to appropriations for the S&E and B&F accounts, Congress usually places a cap on the amount of revenue generated by the Federal Prison Industries (FPI) that can be used for administrative expenses in the annual CJS appropriations bill.

For FY2015, the Administration requested $6.897 billion, a proposed increase of 0.5%. All of the proposed increase in the BOP's funding was the result of the Administration requesting more for the BOP's S&E account ($6.804 billion). The Administration was requesting a $193.0 million base adjustment for the S&E account, of which $158.0 million would have been offset by \"proposed miscellaneous program and administrative reductions.\" The proposed increase in the S&E account was to pay for the increased costs associated with managing a growing federal prison population (e.g., increased pay and benefits for the current BOP workforce, higher rents, and increasing costs associated with providing for the care and management of inmates).

During that same time period, prison crowding grew from 32% over rated capacity to 36% over rated capacity, even though the BOP's capacity increased by approximately 35,000 beds. The BOP estimates that by FY2019 the federal prison system will be operating at 41% over rated capacity. However, despite the problem the BOP has with overcrowding, the Administration did not request funding under the B&F account to start work on any new prison construction. In addition, the BOP did not request any additional funding to expand the amount of contract bedspace.

The BOP reports that the staff-to-inmate ratio has increased from 3.6 to 1 in FY1997 to 4.8 to 1 in FY2013. The growing federal prison population has also required the BOP to dedicate more resources to caring (e.g., providing health care, food, and clothing) and providing programming (e.g., substance abuse treatment, educational programming, and work/vocational opportunities) for inmates. The BOP is statutorily required (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621) to provide residential drug abuse treatment to all inmates who volunteer and are eligible for the program. Prisoners who are convicted of nonviolent crimes and who successfully complete a residential substance abuse treatment program are eligible to have their sentence reduced by not more than one year; as such, the BOP notes, inmates are strongly motivated to participate. The BOP reported that due to limited capacity, inmates receive, on average, only a 10 month reduction. The BOP's budget request preserved funding Congress provided for FY2014 to expand the residential drug treatment program. The BOP reported that the expanded residential substance abuse treatment program will allow the BOP to treat all eligible inmates and extend sentence reductions for those who qualify from the current 10 months average to the full 12 months allowed by statute.

According to NASA, however, \"because SOFIA development has taken much longer than originally envisioned ... the observatory will no longer provide the kind of scientific impact and synergies with other missions as once planned.\" NASA proposed to place the SOFIA aircraft in storage unless international partners could support the U.S. share of its operating costs. The House report rejected NASA's proposal to terminate SOFIA, recommended $70.0 million for the project, and directed NASA to \"continue seeking third-party partners whose additional funding support would restore SOFIA's budget to its full operational level.\" The Senate report also disagreed with the proposal to terminate SOFIA; it recommended $87 million. Congress ultimately appropriated $70 million for FY2015 for SOFIA to maintain core operations.

NASA proposed reorganizing its aeronautics research to align with a new strategic vision announced in August 2013. Following this realignment, most individual projects were to continue, but funding for rotorcraft research was to decrease by $7.9 million. The OGSI proposal included an additional $43.9 million for Aeronautics and would have restored the proposed reduction in rotorcraft funding. The House-passed bill would have provided $666.0 million. The House report accepted the proposed restructuring and directed NASA to allocate the recommended funding increase proportionally across the new programs. It did not mention rotorcraft. The Senate bill would have provided $551.0 million. Like the House report, the Senate report supported the proposed reorganization, but it expressed disappointment with the requested reduction for rotorcraft research.

The OGSI proposal included an additional $100.0 million for Space Technology. The House-passed bill would have provided $627.0 million. Noting several specific examples, the House report encouraged the Space Technology Mission Directorate to prioritize technologies that have \"the broadest applicability across [its] customer base.\" Separately, the report found it unclear whether Congress will commit to the Asteroid Redirect Mission and directed NASA to spend funds on that mission only in areas that \"are also applicable to other current NASA programs, clearly extensible to other potential future exploration missions ... or have broad applicability to other future non-exploration activities.\" The Senate bill would have provided $580 million. The Senate report directed NASA to prioritize ongoing activities, recommended continued funding for the development of satellite servicing technology, and directed NASA to increase its focus on Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards to companies with fewer than 50 employees.

This account funds development of the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) and the Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift rocket, which were mandated by the 2010 authorization act for human exploration beyond Earth orbit. The account also funds development of a commercial crew transportation capability for future U.S. astronaut access to the International Space Station. The request of $2.784 billion for Orion, the SLS, and related ground systems (known collectively as Exploration Systems Development) was a decrease of 10.6%, while the request of $848.0 million for commercial crew was an increase of 21.8%. The OGSI proposal included an additional $100.0 million for SLS and Orion and an additional $250.0 million for commercial crew. As in past years, many in Congress saw the budget request as evidence of a difference in human spaceflight priorities between Congress and the Administration, and this perceived difference was controversial. The House-passed bill would have provided $4.167 billion for Exploration, including $3.055 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $785.0 million for commercial crew. The House report expressed frustration with the \"arbitrarily reduced funding levels for SLS\" and the increased request for commercial crew. It stated that the recommended funding for commercial crew was intended to support only one provider (in September 2014, NASA awarded commercial crew contracts to two providers). The Senate bill would have provided $4.368 billion for Exploration, including $3.251 billion for Exploration Systems Development and $805 million for commercial crew. The Senate report stated that the request for Orion and the SLS had \"again fallen below what is necessary\" and \"far short of requirements.\" For commercial crew, the Senate report would have required certified cost and pricing data for commercial crew contracts. Advocates of this language described it as promoting transparency. Others, noting that it was drawn from federal cost-plus contracting, argued that it was not suitable for the fixed-price commercial approach that NASA is using for the commercial crew program.

For example, during consideration of the FY2013 CJS Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-6 ), legislators debated funding for NSF's Political Science program and ultimately restricted it to projects that met certain national interests. In FY2015, the House report recommended that any R&RA appropriations above the request \"shall be applied to math and physical sciences [MPS], computer and information science and engineering [CISE], engineering [ENG], and biological sciences [BIO].\" This language appears to be designed to prevent R&RA accounts in the geosciences (GEO) and international and integrative activities (IIA), as well as SBE and the U.S. Arctic Research Commission (USARC), from receiving increases over requested levels. The House report further notes both the \"intrinsic value in SBE sciences,\" while recognizing \"longstanding Congressional concerns\" about SBE-funded activities. A House floor amendment to H.R. 4660 sought to effectively hold funding for SBE at the FY2014 level ($256.9 million).
