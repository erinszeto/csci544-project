H.Amdt. 339 would restrict funding to enforce Amendment 40 of the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper Fishery Management Plan. Red snapper are highly valued by recreational and commercial fishermen. Allocation generally involves the distribution of red snapper among fishing sectors (commercial and recreational) and among groups within a given sector (private and charter recreational fishermen). Historically, the recreational sector including charter and private fishermen landed fish under the same quota. Amendment 40 divides the recreational quota between the federal for-hire component (charter) (42.3%) and the private angling component (57.7%). Some private recreational fishermen claim that the charter component will gain a disproportionate share of the recreational quota under this arrangement.

On July 19, 2010, President Obama signed Executive Order 13547, which established a national policy for stewardship of the ocean, coasts, and Great Lakes. The President established the National Ocean Council (NOC) to coordinate and implement the national ocean policy. On April 16, 2013, the NOC released the National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan , which describes specific federal actions needed for enacting the policy. The Administration has presented the National Ocean Policy as a planning framework that operates within existing authorities. Some have questioned whether the Administration's proposal to implement such a policy is a new regulatory program and whether the Administration has the statutory authority to take these actions. Some also have asserted that marine spatial planning and ecosystem-based management may exclude some activities from ocean areas, such as recreational fishing and oil and gas development.", "H.Amdt. 354 would prohibit the use of funds for NOAA to implement recovery plans for salmon and steelhead populations listed under the ESA if the recovery plans do not address predation by non-native species. Some introduced fish species, such as striped bass and largemouth bass prey on native species such as juvenile salmon. This amendment attempts to encourage managers to address the management of introduced species and their predation on salmon as a factor related to salmon recovery.

In FY2016, NOAA is proposing to further restructure budget line items by combining program, project, and activity (PPA) lines. The largest changes would be to the NMFS budget. According to NOAA, restructuring would better align the NMFS budget to its programmatic and organizational needs and provide increased transparency and accountability. For example, seven PPAs under the Protected Species Research and Management program areas would be combined into two PPAs\u2013Marine Mammals, Sea Turtles, and Other Species; and ESA Salmon. Also in NMFS, the Fisheries Research and Management subprogram, which currently has 15 PPAs, would be changed to Fisheries Science and Management, which would have 6 PPAs. Consolidating PPAs could make the reprograming of funds among related programs easier for the agency. However, the level of detail and allocation of funds among different activities that currently have distinct PPAs might become more difficult to discern in the NOAA budget justification. For example, Pacific and Atlantic salmon would be combined in one PPA; currently they have separate budget lines. The Senate Committee on Appropriations report to accompany H.R. 2578 ( S.Rept. 114-66 ) would adopt all of the budget structure revisions proposed in the NOAA budget request except for the proposal to consolidate Atlantic and Pacific salmon into a single PPA."], "subsections": []}]}]}}
