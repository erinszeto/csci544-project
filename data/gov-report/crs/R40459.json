DOD may consume upwards of 1% of the petroleum products refined in the United States annually. Petroleum products purchased and consumed overseas may double DOD's consumption. The majority of DOD's bulk fuel purchases are for jet fuel, which has ranged as high as 101 million barrels annually in the past decade. The U.S. refining industry has been supplying 50% of the jet fuel demand. DOD has consumed as much as 145 million barrels in overall petroleum products annually.", "In FY2000, fuel costs represented 1.2% of the total DOD spending, but by FY2008 fuel costs had risen to 3.0%. Over the same time, total defense spending had more than doubled, but fuel costs increased nearly 500%. Prices paid for military specification JP-8 and JP-5 jet fuel have exceeded the price of commercial equivalent fuel.

DOD's top four fuel suppliers operate a combined 31 refineries in the United States, which represents nearly 6 million barrels per day of crude oil distillation capacity. A typical U.S. refinery yields a limited supply of jet and diesel fuel depending on the type of crude oil processed. Gulf Coast (Texas and Louisiana) refineries yield up to 8% jet fuel. Generally, refineries are set up to run specific grades of crude oil, for example light sweet crude or heavy sour crude. Light sweet crude is particularly desirable as a feedstock for gasoline refining because its lighter-weight hydrocarbons make it easier to refine. Heavier crude oils require more complex processing than light crudes, and sour crudes require desulfurization. Changing crude oil supplies have consequently forced refineries to upgrade their processes (thus increase refinery complexity) to handle heavier sour crude oils. At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken action to require lower sulfur content of diesel fuel, and has proposed a final rule that will require refineries to report their greenhouse gas emissions as a prelude to expected legislation that will limits emissions.", "The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), which falls under the Defense Logistics Agency, has the mission of purchasing fuel for all of DOD's services and agencies.

These adjustments provide for upward and downward revision of the stated contract price upon the occurrence of specified contingencies.

Its mission transferred to the War Department in 1945 and its designation changed to the Joint Army-Navy Purchasing Agency. In 1962, the agency became a part of the former Defense Supply Agency, now known as the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Designated the Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) in 1964, it served as a single entity to purchase and manage the DOD's petroleum products and coal. In 1998, it was re-designated the Defense Energy Support Center with an expanded new mission to manage a comprehensive portfolio of energy products.

The report concludes by discussing recent legislation and policies that affect fuel procurement.", "In the past, when crude oil and refined petroleum prices were high, Congress has looked at DOD's fuel demand as a means of stimulating private sector interest in producing alternative fuels. Recent legislation directs DOD to consider using alternative fuels to meet its needs, and to stimulate commercial interest in supplying the needs. Recent high fuel prices did stimulate DOD and private interest in producing alternative fuels from coal and oil shale, though no project has yet reached commercial operation. Legislation ensuring that federal agencies do not spend taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that will exacerbate global warming now counters earlier policy objectives.

The EPA regulations require measuring the sulfur content at the retail outlet, not the refinery.

During crude oil price spikes, additional Interior Department oil could apply lease revenues to offset increasing DOD fuel costs. The Group concluded that DOD could request that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) seek legislative authority to transfer funds from Interior to Defense, or vice versa; depending on which Department benefits from unanticipated price changes. However, Interior derives the bulk of its revenues from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases, and Congress has already statutorily allocated those revenues among various government accounts, including coastal states. Furthermore, OCS lessees pay royalties-in-kind, in the form of oil delivered to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).", "Congress created the SPR as a response to the 1970s Arab oil embargo to prevent a reoccurrence of supply disruptions. When filled to its 727 million barrel capacity, the SPR represents roughly 70 days of imported supply. A drawdown of the SPR under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA \u2013 P.L. 94-163 ) can take the form of a sale to the highest bidder (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6241), or an exchange (the company receiving the oil must later replace it with a comparably valued volume). During the opening days of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush's drawdown authorization precipitated a rapid crude oil price decline. ", "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that in 2006, 40% of the crude oil refined in U.S. refineries was heavier than that stored in the SPR. Refineries that process heavy oil cannot operate at normal capacity if they run lighter oils. The types of oil currently stored in the SPR would not be fully compatible with 36 of the 74 refineries considered vulnerable to supply disruptions. GAO cited a DOE estimate that U.S. refining throughput would decrease by 735,000 barrels per day (or 5%) if the 36 refineries had to use SPR oil\u2014a substantial reduction in the SPR's effectiveness during an oil disruption, especially if the disruption involved heavy oil. ", "The SPR does not have a defined role in mitigating a DOD fuel supply disruption. Presumably, a refinery under contract to supply DOD would have the option of bidding on a drawdown sale. A typical refinery yields only 8% jet fuel on average. That is, for every gallon of jet fuel a refinery yields, it also produces roughly 11.5 gallons of other petroleum products (gasoline, diesel). This operational limitation on producing jet fuel limits the SPR's role during a supply disruption, if the only objective is supporting DOD's requirement. ", "As a final recourse, DOD may look to an alternative or replacement for crude oil, as provided in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. However, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-140 ) prohibits federal agencies from procuring alternative or synthetic fuels, unless contract provisions stipulate that life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions do not exceed equivalent conventional fuel emissions produced from conventional petroleum sources. The provision was included to ensure that federal agencies are not spending taxpayer dollars on new fuel sources that will exacerbate global warming\u2014a response to proposals under Air Force consideration to develop coal-to-liquid (CTL) fuels. The Air Force has since abandoned plans to attract private investment in a CTL fuel plant to supply Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana, but DESC is interested in pursuing a pilot program for synthetic fuels to support DOD JP-8 fuel requirements in Alaska.", "Although crude oil prices have precipitously declined, as of late, the reoccurrence of crude oil supply shortages and price spikes may be inevitable. Both policy and economics keep fossil-based alternatives out-of-reach for now. Confronted with the same realities facing all energy consumers, DOD is shifting its thinking toward efficiency. DOD might better inform Congress by reporting on the fully burdened cost of fuel for military operations and contingencies. ", "Another potential concern for Congress may be the refining sector's lack of responsiveness to DOD's procurement announcements when periods of high petroleum prices make the demands of commercial-sector more profitable. In response to proposed greenhouse gas emission caps, refinery operators may question whether the value of emission credits outweighs the continued operation of marginally profitable refineries. In the long term, Congress may be concerned whether some operators may shut down their refineries and if such actions might reduce the number of defense fuel suppliers.
