Regardless of the reason, slamming has a negative impact on both consumers and suppliers of telecommunications services. Despite existing regulations to prevent such practices and the overall condemnation of such activities, slamming continues to be a consumer concern. According to data released by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2005, 1,932 slamming complaints were filed. In 2004 the FCC Consumer Affairs Bureau resolved about 3,500 consumer complaints involving over 300 telephone carriers. The issue of slamming is expected to continue as competition in the provision of intrastate long distance and local telecommunications services becomes more widespread.", "A significant level of consumer complaints, coupled with the potential for further abuses in an increasingly competitive marketplace, have prompted action to examine and strengthen deterrents to this practice. The FCC has been actively enforcing existing rules and continues to address outstanding slamming issues. The FCC, in a series of rulemakings, adopted rules that strengthen deterrents to slamming in compliance with provisions contained in the 1996 Telecommunications Act (P.L. 104-104). All of these rules are now in effect. Under these revised rules, states are given the option of processing slamming complaints, and numerous states have chosen to do so. The telecommunications industry has condemned intentional slamming and is also taking steps to eliminate the practice.", "Following enactment of P.L. 104-104 and during the FCC's promulgation of rules concerning slamming, Congress considered further legislative action. Both the House and Senate passed bills in the 105th Congress, but did not complete action. Further legislation was introduced in the 106th Congress. Since then, as FCC and state enforcement against slamming has continued, Congress has followed the issue, but not seen the introduction of new legislative initiatives.", "Although no one supports the practice of intentional slamming, some concerns have been expressed over the approaches being taken to curb this practice. One concern has focused on the necessity for, or specific provisions contained in, legislative measures, with the implementation of primary interexchange (long distance) carrier (PIC) freeze program among the most contentious. The FCC, on March 14, 2002, adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking to examine the charges imposed by local exchange carriers for PIC changes and in a February 10, 2005 action, modified the rate structure that was set in 1984. Another concern relevant to the slamming debate, that is the methodology used by the FCC to develop slamming statistics, also generated controversy.

However, a number of consumers have that choice taken away from them when their designated telephone service provider is changed without their knowledge or consent. This unauthorized change can occur for several reasons, ranging from computer or human error to unscrupulous or illegal marketing practices. Regardless of the reason, this unauthorized switching, known as \"slamming,\" has a negative impact on both the consumers and suppliers of telecommunications services. Consumers not only lose the right to subscribe to their carrier of choice; they may also be subject to lower quality of service, higher rates, or lose special features or premiums offered by their designated carrier. Consumers often do not realize they have been slammed until they find unfamiliar names or charges on their telephone bills. For some who do not examine their bills, such changes can go undetected for months or even longer. Telecommunications carriers are also harmed by slamming, as this practice distorts the marketplace by increasing the customer base and revenues of the carrier that has illegally switched the consumer at the expense of the legitimately chosen carrier.", "Despite existing regulations to prevent such practices and the overall condemnation of such activities, slamming continues to occur with significant frequency. According to data released by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), slamming continues to be a major consumer concern, with 36,220 inquiries and 1,932 complaints filed in 2005. The FCC's slamming team, which is part of the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, in 2004 resolved approximately 3,500 slamming complaints involving over 300 telephone carriers, resulting in consumer refunds totaling $800,000. Since many consumers who are the victims of slamming may not file complaints, and over 50 million carrier selection changes are recorded each year, it is assumed that filed complaints represent a subset of the actual problem. The potential for slamming is expected to increase as competition in the provision of intrastate long distance and local telecommunications services becomes more widespread.", "A significant level of consumer complaints, coupled with the potential for further abuses in an increasingly competitive marketplace, has prompted action to examine and strengthen deterrents to this practice. How to prevent slamming is being addressed on several fronts. The FCC has revised its rules with an eye to strengthening its regulations and increasing penalties for violators. The 105 th Congress while actively examining this issue, adjourned without passage of legislation. Similarly two measures ( S. 58 , S. 1084 ) introduced in the 106 th Congress were not enacted. No legislation addressing slamming was introduced in the 107 th or 108 th Congresses and none has been introduced in the 109 th Congress, to date. The industry is attempting to self-regulate and has put forth proposals to stop this activity. (State regulatory bodies and legislatures, and law enforcement officials, are also taking actions to stop this practice. However, a review of state-level activities regarding slamming is beyond the scope of this report.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Communications Commission Policies", "paragraphs": ["The FCC currently has policies and rules to protect consumers from the unauthorized switching of their long distance carriers, and it enforces them through the investigation of individual complaints. The FCC adopted its rules in response to the numerous complaints it received from state regulatory bodies, telecommunications carriers, and individual consumers. FCC rules currently require a long distance company to obtain a subscriber's authorization before a switch can occur. Authorization can be obtained in writing or can be confirmed orally. Specific requirements relating to what must be contained in written and oral authorizations are enumerated in the regulations. Furthermore, FCC rules protect consumers from paying potentially exorbitant rates. If a subscriber has been a victim of an unauthorized change, he/she is absolved of payment for up to 30 days; refunds of charges are set at 150 percent, split between the authorized carrier (100%) and the subscriber (50%). Carriers proven to be in violation of FCC rules are subject to fines and penalties.", "From April 1994 to the end of 1999, the FCC imposed final forfeitures against 8 companies for $10.3 million, entered into consent decrees with 12 carriers with combined payments of $2.7 million and proposed $7.6 million in proposed notices of apparent liability against 5 companies. The FCC continues to take enforcement actions against violators. According to the FCC in the past decade its Enforcement Bureau has taken slamming enforcement actions totaling nearly $30 million. FCC action in 2004 by the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, on behalf of individual consumers, resolved about 3500 slamming complaints involving more than 300 carriers resulting in $800,000 in consumer refunds. In its first joint federal/state effort, the FCC, working with 14 state agencies, filed on June 20, 2002, a $1.2 million fine against WebNet Communications Inc. of McLean, Va., for 20 alleged violations. In an April 21, 1998 action, the FCC levied its most severe penalty for slamming to date. For the first time, it revoked the operating authority of a telecommunications provider for slamming violations and levied a multi-million dollar fine. This action was taken against the Fletcher Companies, a group of long distance telephone companies, for engaging in slamming and numerous other violations of the Communications Act and FCC rules. These companies, and their principals, are barred from providing interstate telecommunications services without the prior consent of the FCC. Furthermore, the FCC assessed forfeitures totaling $5.7 million but has never been able to collect. According to the FCC, it received more than 1,400 complaints against the Fletcher Companies, the majority of them filed from mid-1996 through 1997. Although these companies stopped providing services in 1997, during the FCC's investigation, this action was taken, according to the FCC, to ensure that none of these companies can resume operation and \"engage in slamming or other conduct ... harmful to consumers.\"", "Provisions contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (see discussion below) expand the scope of the FCC's authority to address the problem of unauthorized switches.

The section expanded the FCC's authority over such activity to include local as well as long distance service. State utility commissions are also permitted to enforce the procedures with respect to services within their state boundaries.", "Section 258(b) created a new penalty, in addition to already existing penalties contained in law, for those who violate FCC verification procedures. Any telecommunications carrier that violates those procedures and collects charges for such service is required to pay the subscriber's properly designated carrier all the charges collected from that subscriber since the change occurred. The requirement prevents violators from receiving financial rewards for the illegal switch. The FCC, in a December 17, 1998 action (CC Docket No. 94-129), adopted new regulations in compliance with the 1996 Act. These rules, with the exception of the liability provisions, went into effect in April 1999. The liability provisions were stayed by the D.C. Court of Appeals. On May 3, 2000 the FCC issued revised slamming liability rules which met court approval and the stay was lifted on June 27, 2000.

These verification methods are applied to both inbound calls (that is, calls initiated by consumers) as well as telemarketing calls initiated by carriers. Verification rules are also applied to changes in local as well as long distance carriers, but wireless carriers are exempt. The FCC has also applied verification procedures to the practice of implementing carrier freeze requests. In addition, the FCC rules require that solicitations for such freezes be clear and that the consumer be informed as to how such a freeze may be lifted.", "The FCC also noted that these verification procedures do not preempt state law; these verification methods are to be used as a state minimum, but additional verification procedures may be adopted for intrastate carrier changes.", "In an April 8, 2003 action ( AT&T v.

While not remanding the FCC's rules the court did vacate fines totaling $80,000 imposed on AT&T. The FCC had imposed a fine on AT&T for slamming when, despite compliance with the FCC's procedures, an unauthorized person, without the knowledge of the line subscriber, authorized the switch. The court found that the FCC's requirement that the telecommunications carrier verify that the actual subscriber, and not just the person answering the line and claiming to have authority to authorize a carrier switch, authorize the switch exceeded the FCC's statutory authority. The court stated that the statue does not require actual authorization but only requires that the carrier get verification.

CompTel urged carriers to agree to investigate all slamming allegations, repay consumers who have been the victims of slamming, and terminate any employees or agents who \"knowingly and willfully engaged in such practices.\" The statement also advocated uniformity in state and federal slamming requirements, to lessen consumer confusion, and called for the levying of fines, but solely in cases where it has be proven that the carrier \"has engaged in willful and intentional slamming....\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues", "paragraphs": ["Although virtually no one supports the practice of intentional slamming, some concerns have been expressed over the approaches being taken to curb this practice. One concern has focused on the necessity for, or concern over specific provisions contained in, legislative proposals.

They point to recent industry initiatives, such as the ones discussed above, to support that position. Others support vigorous enforcement of current FCC regulations and continued consumer education to combat the increase in slamming complaints. The enactment of additional legislative measures prescribing new regulations is seen, by some, as an action that is unnecessary and that should be taken only as a last resort if the slamming problem continues.", "Others support the enactment of legislation. They cite the trend of the rise in slamming complaints despite existing FCC regulations, as proof that additional legislative action is needed. The extent and growth of the existing problem, coupled with the potential for further abuse, make it necessary, supporters claim, to enact legislation to curb slamming. The release of a GAO report critical of current FCC efforts to reduce the occurrence of slamming gave supporters of legislation additional impetus in the 105 th and 106 th Congresses. (See \" Government Accountability Office Reports ,\" above.) It is up to the Congress, they state, to establish through law stronger measures and increased penalties to protect both consumers and suppliers of telecommunications services from slamming. Those in favor of enactment of legislation also state that FCC regulations directly supported by statute, versus FCC developed policies, are less susceptible to change and will better withstand scrutiny if challenged in the courts. The May 18, 1999 U.S. Appeals Court stay of the liability provisions of the FCC's slamming rules is cited as further proof in support of the need for enactment of legislation.", "Those supporting legislative action, however, are not necessarily united in the approach such legislation should take. Some have expressed concern over the breadth of the proposed regulations contained in the measures that were considered in the 105 th and 106 th Congresses and/or individual provisions contained within them. Concern has been voiced by some that the consumer protections that were proposed were too extensive and may be overly burdensome and costly for smaller carriers attempting to compete with the major long distance carriers. Mandatory third party verification is cited as an example of a proposal that would be costly for small carriers to implement. Proposals to require switchless resellers to post a \"surety bond\" with the FCC to pay for possible fines or penalties also came under criticism. The Telecommunications Resellers Association claims that such a provision not only discriminates against switchless resellers, who are small businesses, but would also cause an \"anticompetitive effect\" in the marketplace by decreasing consumer choice. Additional concern has also been expressed over the content of other provisions contained in other measures. Provisions, such as ones that give full reimbursement to consumers if they are slammed, instead of solely reimbursement of the overcharge, have generated concerns that it might possibly lead to consumers fraudulently claiming they have been slammed, to avoid paying any charges for long distance calls. Proposals to require slammers to pay fines to consumers they harm could result in the creation of the \"wrong incentive structure...\" according to AT&T, by rewarding people who have been slammed instead of trying to discipline those who do the slamming. Furthermore, some have expressed concerns that fines and punishments not be levied against the long distance carrier in all cases, since in some instances unwanted switches can be attributed to the local exchange carrier responsible for executing the switch. On the other hand, local exchange carriers have expressed some concerns that they should not be held liable for solely executing a change since short of confirming each switch, they cannot insure that each change is authorized by the consumer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PIC Freeze Programs and Charges", "paragraphs": ["One practice currently used to prevent slamming is the freezing of a customer's primary interexchange (long distance) carrier, or PIC. The PIC freeze is implemented by the local exchange carrier at the request of the customer, and prohibits the switch of the customer's designated long distance carrier without his/her express approval. In that way slamming is prevented, since the customer's long distance carrier cannot be changed without express permission. While most see the PIC freeze as a viable option to prevent slamming in the long distance market, some concerns have been expressed over the potential for misuse of this option. Some see the potential for the PIC freeze to inhibit competition, if the means required to lift the freeze are perceived by the consumer as too burdensome or the charges to implement the change are excessive.", "The FCC, in a March 14, 2002 action, initiated a notice of proposed rulemaking (CC Docket No. 02-53) to address a petition, filed by the Competitive Telecommunications Association, regarding charges levied by ILECs for changing PICs for end users. The Competitive Telecommunications Association felt that the $5 PIC change charge safe harbor, that was established in 1984, exceeded the actual cost and hampers competition. Upon its initiation of the inquiry, the FCC concluded that \"significant industry and market changes have occurred since the implementation of the $5.00 safe harbor in 1984\" and sought comment on FCC policies for regulating PIC change charges. In May 2004 the FCC initiated a further notice of proposed rulemaking in conjunction with this docket to refresh the record regarding PIC change policies and examine cost support information. Subsequently, in a February 10, 2005 action, the FCC adopted a new fee structure that local exchange carriers may charge for interstate PIC changes. Under the new rules PIC change charges, which are borne by the customer, but are commonly picked up by the newly designated interexchange carrier, will be based on the method used to process the request and will be subject to a new safe harbor. The FCC established safe harbors of $1.25 for electronically-processed PIC changes and $5.50 for manually processed PIC changes. Local exchange carriers can charge more if they can document higher costs and less than the safe harbor rate if they choose. The FCC has no authority over charges set for intrastate carrier changes which fall under state jurisdiction; however, if a consumer switches intrastate long distance providers and interstate providers at the same time, the PIC charge for changing the interstate carrier is decreased by half, to 63 cents, for electronically processed changes. In an October 14, 2005 action the FCC extended, for a second time, the effective date for the filing of revised PIC charge tariffs to be effective no later than January 1, 2006.", "The possible misuse of the PIC freeze through the implementation of an illegal or unauthorized PIC freeze by the customer's local exchange carrier, absent the customer's authorization, has also been raised. The extension of the PIC freeze option, beyond the designation of the long distance carrier, to cover the designation of local exchange and intrastate long distance (toll call) carriers, has also raised significant concerns. Some see the expanded use of the PIC freeze option as unnecessary and feel that the PIC freeze is being misused to protect the local exchange carriers market share in the face of growing competition. As incumbent local exchange carriers face increasing competition in the local exchange market and seek to offer long distance service within their service territories, some feel that the potential for abuse of the PIC freeze will become greater. Some support the elimination of local exchange carrier control over the processing of all carrier changes and freezes, and favor the establishment of an independent third party to administer and execute such changes.", "Local exchange carriers defend the use of the PIC freeze, arguing that it is an appropriate method to protect consumers against the growing problem of slamming. They assert that there have been no widespread complaints about the manner in which the PIC freeze is implemented and note that the FCC has encouraged carriers to take steps to help prevent slamming. They also state that the manner in which the program is implemented varies from carrier to carrier and that many of the potential and perceived abuses, such as high charges or difficultly in switching, do not apply to most programs. Furthermore, many local exchange carriers claim that they do not actively market the PIC freeze option but only offer it in response to customers who complain about slamming or who specifically inquire about it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Slamming Statistics", "paragraphs": ["The methodology used by the FCC to develop slamming statistics has also been brought under question. The GAO criticized the methodology used by the FCC to determine the list of top slamming offenders, a list that was published annually by the FCC in its Common Carrier Scorecard . The FCC compares slamming offenders by citing the ratio of the number of complaints per million dollars of company revenue. That methodology, according to the GAO, is flawed because it can lead to a severe understatement of the revenue-to-complaint ratio for the smaller companies, or resellers. This occurs, according the GAO, because resellers are not required to, and generally do not, report their revenue to the FCC unless the revenue exceeds $109 million. To enable the FCC to make comparisons, to list the top slamming offenders, the FCC assumes that those resellers that have not provided revenue data, had revenues of $109 million. This assumption, the GAO states, may result in a significant overstatement of the reseller's revenue, resulting in a much lower revenue-to-complaint ratio for that offender.", "LCI International Inc., a long distance carrier in the United States, has also expressed concern over the manner in which the FCC calculates yearly slamming rates to determine top offenders. Unlike the GAO, LCI claims that the FCC's current practice of dividing the number of slamming complaints by a company's annual telecommunications revenue favors larger carriers. This occurs, LCI states, because the larger a company's revenue the more consumers it can slam without appearing to be a major offender. LCI recommends that the FCC calculate its slamming rate ratio by dividing the number of slamming complaints by the number of new long distance customers, a methodology that LCI feels is more reflective of company behavior."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislation in the 105th Congress", "paragraphs": ["H.R. 2112 (Franks)", "A measure to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to increase the forfeiture penalty for telephone service slamming and to require providers of such service to report slamming incidents, and for other purposes.
