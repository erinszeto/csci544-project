These hurdles for law enforcement include strong, end-to-end (or what law enforcement has sometimes called \"warrant-proof\") encryption; provider limits on data retention; bounds on companies' technological capabilities to provide specific data points to law enforcement; tools facilitating anonymity online; and a landscape of mixed wireless, cellular, and other networks through which individuals and information are constantly passing.

Rather, law enforcement may exist at the intersection of the two, and this may blur the policy debate. Policymakers have long been faced with the challenge of balancing technological change, law enforcement tools and authorities, information security, and individual privacy. This balance has come under renewed scrutiny over the past several years as technology companies have implemented automatic end-to-end encryption on certain devices and communications systems. For instance, companies such as Apple and Google who employ such strong encryption stress that they do not hold encryption keys. This means they may not be readily able to unlock, or decrypt, the devices or communications\u2014not even for law enforcement presenting an authorized search warrant or wiretap order.

Among other things, CALEA requires that telecommunications carriers assist law enforcement in intercepting electronic communications for which it has a valid legal order to carry out. ", "There are several noteworthy caveats to the requirements under CALEA:", "Law enforcement and officials are not authorized to require a provider of wire or electronic communications service (as well as manufacturers of equipment and providers of support services) to implement \"specific design of equipment, facilities, services, features, or system configurations.\" Similarly, officials may not prohibit \"the adoption of any equipment, facility, service, or feature\" by these entities. Telecommunications carriers are not responsible for \"decrypting, or ensuring the government's ability to decrypt, any communication encrypted by a subscriber or customer, unless the encryption was provided by the carrier and the carrier possesses the information necessary to decrypt the communication.\" CALEA applies to telecommunications carriers but specifically does not apply to \"information services.\"", "These caveats play principal roles in the going dark debate. For one, officials and policymakers have questioned whether to require additional entities to build their products and services such that law enforcement could more easily access communications and data when presenting a lawful wiretap order or warrant. They have also debated the utility of requiring these entities to ensure that devices and communications could be unlocked and decrypted. These issues are discussed in more detail below. ", "A decade after the passage of CALEA, changing technology continued to concern law enforcement officials. Not all telecommunications providers had implemented CALEA-compliant intercept capabilities. The FCC administratively expanded CALEA's requirements to apply to certain broadband and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) providers. Since this administrative expansion, there have been reports of officials considering various legislative proposals to further expand it. However, they have not been officially introduced. One way of looking at these proposed expansions is in two broad categories: ", "1. Expansions that would broaden the range of communications or information service providers covered under the CALEA umbrella. Some have been interested in making CALEA more technology neutral such that it could, given the rapidly changing technology landscape, apply to a wider range of communications or information service providers. 2. Expansions that would broaden the requirements\u2014such as maintaining the ability to decrypt communications\u2014placed on entities covered by CALEA. ", "A perennial concern of these proposals is that requiring access points for third parties such as law enforcement has often been thought of as building in a form of \"master key\" or \"back door\"\u2014a door that, while maybe useful to law enforcement officials executing authorized surveillance and searches, could also be vulnerable to exploitation by hackers, criminals, and other malicious actors. This is also an issue for policymakers who may debate legislation in this area (see the section of this report on \" Exceptional Access \")."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crypto Wars", "paragraphs": ["Around the time that policymakers were passing CALEA, a larger discussion on encryption was taking place.

This tension was highlighted by proposals to build in back doors to certain encrypted communications devices as well as to block the export of strong encryption code.", "Clipper Chip. During the Clinton Administration, encryption technology, known as the Clipper Chip, was introduced. This technology used a concept referred to as \"key escrow.\" The idea was that the Clipper Chip would be inserted into a communications device, and at the start of each encrypted communication session, the chip would copy the encryption key and send it to the government to be held in escrow, essentially establishing a back door for access. With authorization\u2014such as a court authorized wiretap\u2014government agencies would then have the ability to access the key to the encrypted communication. Vulnerabilities in the system design were later discovered, showing that the system could be breached and the escrow capabilities disabled. As such, this system was not adopted.", "Encryption Export. The federal government opened an investigation into Philip Zimmermann, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software, a widely used email encryption platform. When PGP was released, it \"was a milestone in the development of public cryptography. For the first time, military-grade cryptography was available to the public, a level of security so high that even the ultra-secret code-breaking computers at the National Security Agency could not decipher the encrypted messages.\" PGP proliferated when someone released a copy of it on the Internet, sparking a federal investigation into whether Zimmerman was illegally exporting cryptographic software (then considered a form of \"munitions\" under the U.S. export regulations) without a specific munitions export license. Ultimately the case was resolved without an indictment. Courts have since been presented with the question of how far the First Amendment right to free speech protects written software code\u2014which includes encryption code."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Renewed Crypto Wars?", "paragraphs": ["There were several decades of discussions around amending CALEA, though no legislation moved.

In 2015, judges authorized 4,148 wiretaps, of which about 34% (1,403 orders) were under federal jurisdiction. ", "As technology has evolved, some companies have implemented automatic end-to-end encryption on certain communications. It has been employed on some messaging systems and telephone calls. For instance, Apple has this type of encryption on its iMessage systems and on FaceTime calls. The real-time content of these messages and calls reportedly cannot be accessed while in transit between devices (though users may elect to store iMessage content in the cloud). Apple notes the result of this is that the company cannot comply with wiretap orders for iMessage and FaceTime communications. In addition, WhatsApp\u2014an online messaging service facilitating text and phone communications\u2014has implemented default \"end-to-end encryption to every form of communication on its service.\" This applies to phone calls, messages, photos, videos, and files shared, and it impacts communications on about 1 billion devices. Law enforcement has reported instances of having trouble accessing certain real-time communications (including at least one communication transmitted through WhatsApp). ", "The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts collects data on whether law enforcement encountered encryption in the course of carrying out wiretaps and whether officials were able to overcome the encryption and decipher the \"plain text\" of the encrypted information. Of the total 4,148 wiretap orders in 2015, there were 13 reported instances in which encrypted communications were encountered, and 11 of these 13 instances involved encryption foiling law enforcement officials. Notably, these data do not capture instances in which law enforcement officials know they will encounter \"warrant-proof\" encryption, and thus they elect not to attempt intercepting and breaking the encryption on the communication. ", "Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Comey has used one particular case as evidence of active law enforcement investigations being stymied by encryption. In May 2015, two Islamic State-inspired gunmen opened fire outside an event featuring cartoons of Mohammed in Garland, TX. Director Comey has noted that one gunman had \"exchanged 109 messages with an overseas terrorist\" the morning that the shooting occurred and that law enforcement has \"no idea what he said because those messages were encrypted.\" However, despite not being able to retrieve the exact content of these communications, encryption did not prevent law enforcement from accessing metadata connected to the attack (e.g., who the gunmen were communicating with, when, and how frequently) and learning that one of the gunmen was communicating with a known terrorist and was interested in the Garland event. The morning of the shooting, the FBI sent a bulletin to the Garland Police Department indicating that one of the gunmen may show up at the event. The November and December 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, France, and San Bernardino, CA, sustained the going dark debate. Questions arose as to whether the attackers used encryption and, more importantly, whether this encryption had prevented law enforcement and intelligence officials from concentrating on the attackers and potentially thwarting the attacks. While some have highlighted the possibility that encrypted communications in these attacks might have shielded certain communications from law enforcement, others have denied that there is any direct evidence that encryption hindered law enforcement efforts leading up to the incidents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Call Detail Records", "paragraphs": ["Law enforcement may request, with a subpoena or valid court order, certain call detail records from telecommunications providers. These records can include information such as the sending and receiving telephone numbers, whether or not the call was completed, call duration, and which cell towers were used in making or receiving the call (of note, call detail records do not contain the content of telephone calls). Law enforcement can obtain these records retrospectively. Notably, companies vary in the length of time they maintain call detail records. They also vary in the length of time they hold on to other types of data such as GPS location information.", "With a valid court order, call detail information may also be available in real time. Through a \"pen register\" and \"trap and trace,\" as they are called, law enforcement can obtain information about outgoing and incoming calls, respectively. The same information that is available in a retrospective call detail record request can be obtained directly at the time of a call; similarly, a pen register or trap and trace cannot provide call content information. ", "One of the tools that law enforcement has used to determine the locations of particular cell phones is a cell site simulator, commonly referred to by one of the brand names, \"stingray.\" They are mobile devices that emit a strong signal (stronger than nearby cell towers) and thus attract mobile devices to connect to the stingray rather than a cell tower. These \"controversial devices are also capable of recording numbers for a mobile phone's incoming and outgoing calls, as well as intercepting the content of voice and text communications.\" DOJ guidance instructs investigators to obtain a pen register and trap and trace order before employing this technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stored Data", "paragraphs": ["In addition to call detail records, location information, and real time communications, law enforcement may also be interested in data stored in the cloud or on electronic devices.

", "In a cloud-based system of storing data, individuals using the cloud \"can use that storage capacity on demand, from anywhere in the world, as they wish, without the intervention of the service provider.\" Ease of law enforcement access to cloud-based data may depend on a number of factors. These include the location of the cloud server and the service provider, as well as the length of time information has been stored in the cloud. If the server is located overseas, for instance, law enforcement can employ the Mutual Legal Assistance process to try to obtain the data from a partner nation. It is not clear whether federal law enforcement can require U.S.-based companies to turn over data stored on their servers that happen to be located abroad. ", "One case between the United States and Microsoft Corporation highlights this issue. In December 2013, federal prosecutors produced a warrant requesting Microsoft to turn over emails associated with a specified account. These emails were stored on a Microsoft server located in Dublin, Ireland. Microsoft denied the request, arguing that the warrant did not apply to servers located outside the United States. However, the U.S. Court rejected this argument and ordered Microsoft to comply. Microsoft appealed the case to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled in favor of the United States. Microsoft appealed the case to the Second Circuit, which ruled against the government, \"stating that the government cannot compel Microsoft, or other companies, to turn over customer emails stored on servers outside the United States.\" The Second Circuit has denied rehearing the case. The result suggests that U.S. \"warrant authority only extends to stored communications content that is located [emphasis original] in the United States. This is so even if the United States is investigating a U.S. citizen in connection with a local crime; so long as the sought-after data is held abroad, it is inaccessible by a US [sic] warrant.\"", "Just as there are potential limits to the breadth of data/information/evidence located in any environment, there are factors that may limit the scope of data stored in the cloud (and subsequently available to law enforcement). For instance, not all individuals store data in or back up their devices to the cloud. In addition, the full range of the data on a device may not be backed up to the cloud because of features including device backup schedules and cloud storage space available to a given user.", "On electronic devices, data may be stored in various formats, and law enforcement may present warrants to search these devices. The content on or access to the devices themselves, however, may be locked and encrypted. This has reportedly slowed and/or obstructed law enforcement access.", "In the aftermath of the December 2, 2015, San Bernardino, CA, terrorist attack, investigators recovered an Apple iPhone belonging to one of the shooters. Law enforcement hoped that the device would contain valuable information on who the shooters may have been communicating with to plan the attacks, where the shooters may have traveled prior to the attack, and the potential involvement of others in the attack. However, FBI Director Comey testified before Congress two months later and indicated that the FBI was unable to access information on the device. Through the courts, the FBI requested that Apple assist investigators in accessing these data. Apple refused to comply. After a back and forth legal battle, the FBI ultimately found assistance from a third party entity, was able to access the contents of the phone, and dropped the case with Apple. In April 2015, Brittany Mills was killed in her home in Baton Rouge, LA. Police have been unable to access the contents of her iPhone. While they were able to obtain call detail records and data stored in the cloud, her phone was last backed up to the cloud two months prior to her death, and thus the cloud is missing two months of data. Further, while police have no idea what might be stored on the phone, they believe it could have valuable information relating to Ms. Mills's death.", "There are a number of similar cases pitting law enforcement against technology companies such as Apple. These cases highlight a central policy question. This question is not whether technology companies like Apple can assist law enforcement in gaining access to certain mobile devices, but whether these companies should .

This decision followed the National Security Council reportedly drafting a paper outlining strategic options for confronting issues arising from encryption on communications devices. The three options offered in this paper, while differing in strength and timeline, all had the same immediate implication: the Obama Administration did not push a legislative framework requiring technology companies to make changes to their encryption systems .

Additionally, some experts have suggested that the government should continue to support strengthening encryption and simultaneously give law enforcement resources to bolster their capabilities to conduct investigations in an environment of strong encryption. This could involve increasing both the number of agents with technology expertise and the depth of their knowledge. It could also include supporting partnerships\u2014such as those with hackers or security researchers\u2014such that law enforcement could source needed tools. For instance, the FBI paid hackers to find a software flaw that the bureau was then able to leverage to ultimately crack into the iPhone in the San Bernardino case.

The FBI has indicated that encryption is not only an issue in terrorism investigations, but in cases against kidnappers, murderers, drug traffickers, and others. Would Apple, Google, and others need to help the FBI develop operating systems to circumvent security features in every case where the FBI or another law enforcement entity requests assistance? Indeed, some law enforcement officials have noted they would rely upon Apple to assist law enforcement in other cases. Further, would companies such as Apple need to assist foreign law enforcement entities with similar requests? These are the kind of questions that Congress may choose to address through legislation or allow to be decided by the courts.", "Policymakers may also question the example that the United States seeks to set for other countries, particularly authoritarian regimes, regarding access to individuals' communications and data. In support of maintaining strong encryption, one expert noted that \"United States support for human rights is a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy. It includes strong support for private and secure communications, for such capabilities are a necessity for human rights workers in repressive nations.\" Similar conversations have been held around other tools facilitating secure communications, such as anonymizing browsers like Tor. Individuals may rely upon such secure communications to access content that might be blocked in certain parts of the world or to express political dissent in areas where such communication could threaten individual safety. If restrictions are placed on encrypted data and communications in the United States, what message might that send to other nations where human rights have been viewed by some as a concern?"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congressional Working Group on Encryption", "paragraphs": ["It appears as though officials are still deciding how best to simultaneously protect the privacy of encrypted communications and support legitimate law enforcement access. As such, the discussion will likely continue both in the courts and on the policy stage. In the 114 th Congress, for instance, members of the House Judiciary Committee and Energy and Commerce Committee established an Encryption Working Group to \"identify potential solutions that preserve the benefits of strong encryption\u2014including the protection of Americans' privacy and information security\u2014while also ensuring law enforcement has the tools needed to keep us safe and prevent crime.\" The working group released a year-end report in December 2016 with four key observations:", "Any measure that weakens encryption would work against the nation's interest. Encryption technology is widely used and increasingly available worldwide. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the encryption and going dark challenge. Congress should promote cooperation between the law enforcement and technology communities.", "The working group presented these observations as a basis for policy discussions in the 115 th Congress.
