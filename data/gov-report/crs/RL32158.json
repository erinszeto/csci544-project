Of particular concern are provisions thatallow the President to block challenge inspections, and that prohibit the OPCW inspectors fromsending chemical samples outside the United States for analysis. These provisions are intended toprotect U.S. national security interests and proprietary commercial information. CWC supporters,however, believe that blocking a challenge inspection violates a basic premise of the convention, andthat forcing inspectors' analysis to be conducted within the United States undermines confidence inthe verification regime.

The CWC's verification provisions are extensive, but they havenot stilled the debate over whether they are effective enough to deter violations.

This decision was based on the assessment that the U.S. arsenal was adequate for both limited ormassive retaliation without the use of chemical weapons.

Devising an acceptable verification regime was the most difficult task for CWC negotiators and is the most challenging forthose implementing the Convention. The CWC provides for the most intrusive and extensiveverification regime of any arms control agreement to date. The regime, for the first time in armscontrol, provides for routine monitoring and inspection not only of military facilities but also ofcertain civilian chemical facilities. In addition, challenge inspection provisions expand complianceverification to suspect facilities of any sort. The Organization for the Prohibition of ChemicalWeapons http://www.opcw.org/ oversees the Convention's compliance verification. ", "The most serious question is whether the OPCW will be able to detect all clandestine production or stockpiling of chemical weapons. Ironically, the CWC's supporters and detractorsgenerally agree: the answer is no. Acknowledging that the verification regime will not be absolutecarries differing significance for the Convention's critics and advocates. Those who question theConvention's value believe that if compliance verification cannot be guaranteed, and undetected CWpossession may be possible, the Convention is not worth the cost and effort. Worse, perhaps, they are concerned that the Convention would engender a false sense of security. They point out that incertain circumstances, the selective use of relatively small amounts of chemical weapons could besignificant militarily, particularly against unprotected personnel. Consequently, would-be violatorsneed not produce or stockpile vast amounts. ", "Advocates argue that, though CWC may be imperfect, it can provide the most intrusive and extensive verification regime in the history of disarmament and represents a notable improvementover current CW non-proliferation regimes. For signatories, this fact could change the cost/benefitanalysis of CW production or stockpiling enough to deter violations. Provision for challengeinspections creates the likelihood that violations would become public breaches of the internationalnorm, something not possible without the CWC.", "The most difficult challenge is to detect existing chemical weapons that a nation does not declare and continues to store clandestinely. Detecting illicit transfers of controlled chemicals is alsoa challenging task. Covert production of chemical warfare agents and the subsequent manufactureof chemical munitions are higher-profile activities and consequently more vulnerable to detection. This assessment assumes that the OPCW and signatories' national intelligence resources will seekto uncover Convention violators. Consequently, the extent of intelligence sharing has a significantimpact on the CWC's effectiveness. It is not clear, however, to what extent the States Parties aresharing relevant intelligence information with the OPCW. It is possible that concerns over possibleleaks or compromising intelligence sources have weighed more heavily than the desire to assist theOPCW in its mission.", "Another factor that affects the OPCW's verification capabilities is the amount and reliability of its funding by the Convention's signatories. Without adequate funding to maintain thetechnological and personnel resources necessary to monitor the international chemical industry andgovernment activities, the rigor of the verification regime suffers. Budgetary difficulties haveplagued the OPCW for the last several years. The United States has not supported requested budgetincreases in the past two years sought by the OPCW Administration to maintain inspectionschedules, but rather directed the OPCW instead to establish \" more efficient, appropriate,cost-effective approaches\". (2) However, with a new Director General overseeing the OPCW, theUnited States has now approved an overall OPCW budget increase of 6.7% for 2004, raising the totalbudget to $86.5 million. In 2002, the United States negotiated a reduction of its OPCW dues to 22%of the operating budget, which amounts to $19.03 million for 2004. Delinquent dues and inspectionreimbursements still remain a significant problem for the OPCW, amounting in total to about $4.2million as of July 2003.", "The Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 USC 2551) requires an annual report from the State Department titled Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control and NonproliferationAgreements and Commitments.

Though SecretaryRademaker said that the OPCW \"must not shrink from the task of confronting those States Partiesthat are violating the Convention\", the United States did not request formal OPCW action regardingthese allegations. (4) Responding to those whoquestioned why the U.S. did not avail itself of theCWC's challenge inspection provisions to address its suspicions, the U.S. delegation maintained thatchallenge inspections would be ineffective in finding illicit weapons, and could falsely exoneratenations. (5) No specific reference was made to concernsover Russia or China in SecretaryRademaker's presentation to the OPCW Review Conference. ", "With regard to Russia, the concerns over verification are primarily focused on Russia's failure to acknowledge research and development on binary chemical weapons (binary chemical weaponsuse two non-lethal chemicals that combine to form a lethal agent after launching). The United Statesworked on developing binary weapons sporadically from the 1950s, ending the effort in 1992, whenthe signing of the CWC became imminent. U.S. intelligence has long believed that Russia wasundertaking a similar program. In 1992, a Russian scientist, Vil Mirzayanov, publicly claimed thatRussia had developed a binary agent significantly more effective than current nerve agents. He alsoasserted that the Russian military leadership continued the program after President Gorbachevdeclared Russia's chemical weapons development at an end. Concern over this Russian programrekindled in 1997 with the leaking of a classified DOD report to the press. Written at the U.S.Ground Intelligence Center, the report supposedly maintains that the new agent can be manufacturedin significant amounts in modified pesticide plants from chemicals not covered by the CWC.( Washington Times , February 4, 1997, p.1) CWC opponents believe this information highlights thedifficulties of verification and the lack of Russian trustworthiness. CWC supporters have respondedthat without the CWC such a program is legal, but with the CWC and accession to it, it would beillegal and suspect facilities would be subject to inspection.", "The United States, having specifically requested an accounting of the Russian binary program and received inadequate responses, is continuing discussions to resolve these discrepancies. Although the current data exchange is independent of the CWC, Russian recalcitrance on this issuecould adversely affect support for the Convention. If Russia is unwilling to be forthright in what isgenerally judged to be an \"open secret,\" it raises the question of how seriously it considers theprohibitions of the CWC, and consequently places greater emphasis on effective verification. TheBush Administration has highlighted this point by its decision not to provide the certification ofRussia's commitment to arms control, upon which Nunn-Lugar Threat Reduction aid is contingent,unless Russia provides further information on these programs (See below, Chemical WeaponsStockpiles and Facilities Destruction)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact on U.S. Industry", "paragraphs": ["Many U.S. enterprises do not meet the CWC threshold requirements for reporting, and others may have minimal obligations (e.g. one-page reports) because of the nature of the chemicals theyhandle. For the most part, the heaviest burden (annual reports on production/consumption/transferand at least one initial inspection) falls upon enterprises that deal with substantial amounts ofchemicals that could be very useful in the production of CW warfare agents.", "Implementing legislation for the CWC addressed some issues that are novel for arms control agreements. The Convention grants the OPCW inspection rights (routine, random, and challenge)over purely civilian, privately owned facilities. These inspection rights are harmonized with U.S.constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure through procedures for obtainingadministrative or criminal search warrants if necessary. (22 USC 6725)", "Loss of Proprietary Information (Trade Secrets). Potential loss of trade secrets is of great concern to private industry. And, the question ariseswhether forced or incidental disclosure of such information during a CWC inspection wouldconstitute a \"seizure\" under the Fourth Amendment. Implementing legislation addressed this issueby restricting information collection, providing non-disclosure protection, and penalties forunauthorized disclosure of Convention-related information. To date, there have been noprosecutions for unlawful disclosures. Chemical industries emphasize that it is essential to protectproprietary information (or trade secrets) to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And, the CWC, through its enforcement and verification procedures, will require a greater level ofopenness regarding production processes and rates, product composition, and market distribution. However, the U.S. chemical industry -- represented through the Chemical Manufacturer'sAssociation (now the American Chemistry Council) and the Pharmaceutical ManufacturersAssociation -- strongly endorsed the Convention's confidentiality measures and supported theCWC's ratification. ", "Export Controls. The CWC requires restrictions on the export or transfer of controlled chemicals to non-States Parties. These restrictions vary inseverity depending upon the chemicals involved. Also, as an incentive for nations to sign the CWC,the restrictions tighten in the years following the Convention coming into force. As noted earlier,there is a total ban on the export of chemicals on Schedules 1 & 2; there are on-going discussionson whether to apply this ban to Schedule 3 chemicals in the near future. (See above, Provisions ofthe Chemical Weapons Convention) The United States already had a variety of export controls onCW-related chemicals, equipment, and technology. (6) These stem from both unilateral action, andsteps the United States has taken as a member of the Australia Group (AG). (7) The CWC exportcontrol provisions have consequently not engendered significant controversy domestically. Theexport control regime of the Australia Group remains an issue of contention with developingcountries, who maintain that it inhibits legitimate technology transfer, and should not be applied tonations that are CWC States Parties. The Australia Group members have not found this argumentpersuasive, and remain convinced that the AG regime remains a useful complement to the CWC,particularly given that its control lists are more extensive than those negotiated for the Convention.

The consultative nature of the Convention's provisions and the lack of specificity regarding sanctions to be levied againstconvention violators reflect the difficulty of those negotiations.

CWC critics believethat its enforcement sanctions are too vague to be an effective deterrent. They question theeffectiveness of economic and arms embargoes, maintaining that 1) embargoes are almost impossibleto enforce internationally; 2) they historically have seldom achieved their foreign policy objectives;and 3) if they are effective at all, it is only over the long term. CWC supporters argue that the lackof specificity regarding possible sanctions heightens a potential violator's uncertainty about breakingthe Convention. They believe that this uncertainty and the international approbation that would begenerated by the enforcement procedure will sufficiently affect the \"cost/benefit\" analysis ofchemical weapons production to deter a potential violator. They also do not accept the assertion thatinternational sanctions are without effect, maintaining that at a minimum they significantly degradea nation's ability to maintain a CW program.

The Convention alsospecifies the order in which different types of weapons shall be destroyed, and interim deadlines. A clause permitting an extension of up to five years, upon approval of the Conference of StateParties, was included specifically in anticipation of Russia's not being able to meet the destructiondeadline, given its political and economic instability in the 1990's. However, now both Russia andthe United States have had to request extensions of both interim and final destruction deadlines.", "U. S Chemical Weapons Destruction Program. In October, the United States acknowledged that it would not be able to destroy 45% of its CWstockpile by the interim deadline of April 29, 2004 . Of particular interest, is that the United Statesrequested an extension of the 45% interim deadline to December 2007 -- full eight months afterthe Convention's deadline for the destruction of the entire stockpile. This request, and itsimplication that the United States will not be able to meet the final destruction deadline of April2007, reflects the many difficulties the destruction program has encountered over the last 18 years. Accepting that the United States is undertaking a good faith effort to destroy its stockpile, onOctober 24, the Eighth OPCW Conference of States Parties approved the extension of the 45%deadline to December 2007, and the extension of the final deadline in principle, with no datespecified.", "These deadline extensions notwithstanding, The United States is by far the country most advanced in its CW destruction program. In the early 1980s, DOD declared approximately 90% ofthe U.S. chemical stockpile (28,000 agent tons) obsolete. This decision, coupled with a 1985congressional directive to destroy these munitions, led DOD to begin planning a destruction programalmost two decades ago. Nevertheless, it is now entirely clear that the United States will be not ableto meet the 2007 CWC deadline. Until very recently, DOD estimates have called for completingdestruction on time, but critics of the program have maintained for some time that these expectationswere unrealistic. Indeed, in October 1998, an independent analysis commissioned by DOD andconducted by the Arthur Anderson firm estimated that none of the CW destruction facilities had evena 5% chance of meeting their destruction deadlines. DOD rebutted the audit, maintaining that it wasbased on old data, and did not reflect increased efficiencies. (8)", "In 2001, the controversy arose again when the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense obtained an internal Army report -- Operations Schedule Task Force 2000-Final Report , -- thatfirst indicated that it was doubtful that even an extended final deadline of 2012 could be met. Thereport detailed the actual munition destruction rates at the Johnston Atoll depot, showing them tobe much lower than previous official estimates, and indicated that substantially the same destructionrates should be expected at other incineration facilities. If so, the CW stockpile destruction programwould extend beyond 2014. DOD initially contended that the report was a \"worst case scenario,\" but then the DOD Selected Acquisition Report, released in April, 2002, revealed an 80% increasein the destruction program's costs owing specifically to \"revised destruction rates\" and \"scheduleextensions.\" ", "The Task Force 2000-Final Report reflects the challenges at depots where incineration is the destruction method (Anniston Army Depot, AL; Pine BluffArsenal, AR; Tooele Army Depot, UT;and Umatilla Depot Activity, OR). At the Lexington-Bluegrass Army Depot, KY and Pueblo DepotActivity, CO, neutralization methods developed at congressional direction ( P.L. 104-28 ) throughthe Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment Program [ http://www.pmacwa.army.mil ] have justentered the pilot-plant phase. The remaining two storage depots, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MDand Newport Army Ammunition Plant, IN, house only agent in bulk tanks, which will also bedestroyed through chemical neutralization. However, the neutralization process still produces achemical residue which must be treated as a hazardous material, and its safe disposal has becomean issue of public concern. (9)", "Among the factors DOD has identified as contributing to the delays are: revised destruction rates, new environmental regulations, worse-than-expected stockpile condition, and unanticipatedemergency preparedness requirements. In addition to these factors, which are mostly out of DOD'scontrol, there has been fairly consistent criticism of the destruction program's management almostsince its inception. The General Accounting Office has issued several program assessments, withthe most recent continuing to emphasize significant administrative problems:", "\"The Chemical Demilitarization Program remains in turmoil because a number of long-standing leadership, organizational, and strategic planning issuesremain unresolved. The program lacks stable leadership at the upper management levels. Forexample, the program has had frequent turnover in the leadership providing oversight. Further, recentreorganizations have done little to reduce the complex and fragmented organization of the program.As a result, roles and responsibilities are often unclear and program actions are not alwayscoordinated. Finally, the absence of a comprehensive strategy leaves the program without a clearroad map and methods to monitor program performance. Without these key elements, DOD and theArmy have no assurance of meeting their goal to destroy the chemical stockpile in a safe and timelymanner, and within cost estimates.\" (10)", "GAO issued several recommendations to improve program management, e.g.: establish long-term objectives, define roles and responsibilities of DOD and Army offices, and developshort-term performance measures. DOD has concurred with those recommendations, and has begunimplementation. However, given that the U.S. request to the OPCW for destruction deadlineextensions left the date for final completion unspecified, it would seem that uncertainty about thepace of the destruction program remains high.", "Difficulties that the United States has encountered with the chemical weapons destruction program have been reflected in the significant cost estimate growth since its inception. In 1985, forexample, DOD estimated the total program cost would be between $1.2 to $2.0 billion. These costestimates routinely increased, reaching $13.2 billion in 2001. Then, in April 2002, acknowledgingthe program delays noted above, the Department of Defense Selected Acquisition Report announceda new 80% increase in the total cost estimate, raising it to $23.7 billion. For FY2004, the DefenseDepartment requested a total of $1.65 billion for the chemical demilitarization program: R&D --$251 million, Procurement -- $79 million, Operations & Maintenance -- $1.2 billion, and MilitaryConstruction -- $119million. Congress appropriated these funds as requested.", "Russian CW Destruction Program. Russia possesses the world's largest chemical weapons stockpile, estimated to be 40,000 to 50,000 tons. Russian officials have made it clear that both technological and financial assistance is needed todestroy its chemical weapons. As part of the comprehensive threat reduction assistance programs(often called \"Nunn-Lugar\" programs), the United States has appropriated approximately $437million Between FY1992-FY2003 to assist in the design and construction of a nerve agentdestruction facility in Shchuch'ye. In addition, the United States has agreed to share destructiontechnology and participate in the exchange of technical experts. To facilitate these efforts, theUnited States has opened a Chemical Weapons Destruction Support Office (CWDSO) in Moscow. (11)", "During consideration of the FY2000 DOD budget request, both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees expressed strong reservations about Russia's ability to fund operation of theShchuch'ye facility if constructed, and noted the relative paucity of assistance from other nations forthis program. Consequently, the FY2000 DOD Authorization Act ( P.L. 106-65 , Sec. 1305) forbadefurther funding for a chemical weapons facility in Russia. DOD's efforts in the FY2001 budgetconsiderations to have this provision repealed and $35 million appropriated for a Shchuch'ye facilitymet continued congressional skepticism. House and Senate Armed Services Committee confereesaccepted a Senate amendment in the DOD FY2001 Authorization Act ( H.R. 4205 )which amended the existing statutory prohibition to permit Shchuch'ye funding only after DODcertification that:", "Russia has agreed to provide $25 million annually for construction and operation.", "Russia has agreed to use the facility to destroy its four other nerve agentstockpiles.", "The United States has obtained multi-year commitments from the internationalcommunity to assist infrastructure improvement around Shchuch'ye.", "Russia has agreed to destroy its CW production facilities at Volgograd andNovocheboksark.", "These conditions were coupled with a DOD reporting requirement on Russian and international financial contributions towards the safeguarding and destruction of Russia's nerve agent stockpiles. For FY2002 and FY2003, Congress, satisfied that sufficient progress has been made in meeting theseconditions, approved appropriation of $35 million and $55 million for the Shchuch'ye facility,though these amounts were substantially below DOD's budget request. For FY2004, the Congressagreed to appropriate the Administration's full budget request of $200 million.", "Even with foreign assistance, Russia will not be able to meet CWC destruction deadlines. It has requested an extension until 2012, but few believe that extension will be sufficient. Consequently, the CWC Conference of States Parties has approved an extension of Russia's interimdeadline to destroy 20% of its stockpile to April 2007, and also agreed to an extension of subsequentdeadlines in principle, with no date specified. The General Accounting Office has estimated thatwithout additional destruction facilities, it could take at least 40 years for Russian to completedestruction of its nerve agent stockpile.
