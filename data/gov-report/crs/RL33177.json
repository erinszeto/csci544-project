Following the attacks,both primary insurers and reinsurers pulled back from offering terrorism coverage, citing particularlyan inability to calculate the probability and loss data critical for insurance pricing. Some argued thatterrorism risk would never be insurable by the private market due to the uncertainty and potentiallymassive losses involved. Because insurance is required for a variety of economic transactions, it wasfeared that a lack of insurance against terrorism loss would have wider economic impact.", "Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism RiskInsurance Act of 2002 (TRIA). TRIA created a temporary program, expiring at the end of 2005, tocalm the insurance markets through a government backstop for terrorism losses and to give theprivate industry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for privateinsurance to cover terrorism risk. From 2002 to 2005, terrorism insurance became widely availableand largely affordable, and the insurance industry greatly expanded its financial capacity. There was,however, little apparent success on a longer term private solution and fears persisted about widereconomic consequences if insurance were not available. To a large degree, the same concerns andarguments that accompanied the initial passage of TRIA were before Congress as it considered TRIAextension legislation.", "Congress responded to the impending expiration of TRIA with the passage of two differentbills. The Senate bill, S. 467 , was approved by the Senate on November 18, 2005. Thelarge majority of the language from the House bill, H.R. 4314 , was inserted into S.467 and passed by the House on December 7, 2005. S. 467 was titled theTerrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act, whereas H.R. 4314 was titled the Terrorism RiskInsurance Revision Act. These titles did reflect essential differences between the two bills. S.467 extended the current program by two years and further increased the private sector'sexposure to terrorism risk, as did the original act. (During the three years covered by the initial act,insurance industry deductibles and aggregate retention rose each year.) S. 467 continuedto increase these and also reduced the types of insurance covered by the program and increased thesize of terrorist event necessary to trigger the program. H.R. 4314 extended the programfor two or possibly three years and substantially revised many aspects of it. Among the notablechanges, it excluded some lines of coverage and included others that were not covered before. Itsegmented lines of insurance, introducing different deductibles for different lines. It included theconcept of resetting the deductibles and the trigger amount to lower amounts if a terrorist attackoccurs in the future. The final version signed into law closely tracked the Senate legislation.", "This report briefly outlines the issues involved with terrorism insurance and includes aside-by-side of the initial TRIA, TRIA-extension legislation as considered in the House and Senate,and the final bill as signed by the President.

Essentiallymost policyholders received this coverage for free. The attacks, and the more than $30 billion ininsured losses that resulted from them, caused a rethinking of the possibilities of future terroristattacks. In response to the new appreciation of the threat and the perceived inability to calculate theprobability and loss data critical for pricing insurance, both primary insurers and reinsurers pulledback from offering terrorism coverage. Many argued that terrorism risk is essentially uninsurableby the private market due to the uncertainty and potentially massive losses involved. Becauseinsurance is required for a variety of economic transactions, many feared that a lack of insuranceagainst terrorism loss would have wider economic impact, particularly on large-scale developmentsin urban areas that would be tempting targets for terrorism.", "Congress responded to the disruption in the insurance market by passing the Terrorism RiskInsurance Act of 2002 (1) (TRIA), which was signed by the President in November 2002. TRIA created the Terrorism RiskInsurance Program, which was enacted as a temporary program, expiring at the end of 2005, to calmthe insurance markets through a government backstop for terrorism losses and give the privateindustry time to gather the data and create the structures and capacity necessary for private insuranceto cover terrorism risk. ", "Terrorism insurance has become widely available under TRIA and the insurance industry hasgreatly expanded its financial capacity in the past three years. It appears, however, that less progresshas been made on creating terrorism models that are sufficiently robust for insurers to return tooffering widespread terrorism coverage without a government backstop, and that practically noprogress has been made on a private pooling mechanism to cover terrorism risk. Some see the pastthree years as proof of the argument that the private market will never be able to offer insurance tocover terrorism risk and continue to see the possibility of wider economic consequences if terrorisminsurance again is unavailable. Others, notably the U.S. Treasury Department, respond that TRIAitself is retarding the growth of this private market and should be allowed to expire, or at least bereduced from its current form."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Action", "paragraphs": ["Congress responded to the impending expiration of TRIA with two different bills thatinitially passed the respective houses.

S.467, as introduced, would have explicitly extended TRIA for two years, until the end of2007, and would have added a \"soft landing\" year by changing the definition of an insured loss sothat policies written in the second year and extending into a third year would be covered. Theindividual insurer deductible was to remain at 15% of earned premiums during the extension, whilethe insurance industry aggregate loss retention amount was to increase from the current $15 billionin 2005 to $17.5 billion for 2006 and finally $20 billion for 2007.

(2) Chairman Oxley's amendment made a number of changes,including adjusting the exact deductibles for various insurance lines, reducing the program triggeramount in program years after the second year and striking language that would have preemptedsome state laws relating to rate and form filing. Representative Frank's amendment increased thesize needed by a company or municipality to be considered an \"exempt commercial purchaser\" ofinsurance.

It would haveraised the event trigger to $50 million in 2006 and added an additional $50 million to this for everyfuture year the program is in effect. It also would have changed the insurer deductible but wouldhave done so differently for different lines of insurance, raising it to as high as 25% for casualtyinsurance but lowering it to 7.5% for NCBR events. H.R. 4314 would have lowered thefederal share of insured losses to 80% for events under $10 billion but raised it gradually to 95% forevents over $40 billion. In the case of a terrorist act, the deductibles and event triggers would havereset to lower levels, with deductibles possibly as low as 5% in the event of a large attack. It wouldhave removed the cap on the mandatory recoupment provision so that all money expended underTRIA would be recouped by the federal government through a surcharge on insurers in the yearsafter the attack.
