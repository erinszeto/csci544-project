Opponents argue that since agency operations are supported by payments for services, the total amountof these collections should be available toprovide for those services in the year the expenses are incurred. Proponents of the current approach maintain thatthe fees are necessary to balance the budget andthat the level of fees appropriated back to the USPTO are sufficient to cover operating expenses.

(30) The Judiciary had called for a payadjustment for judges in its FY2002 budget submission to Congress. Judiciary compensation, it was argued, lagged far behind both inflation and the increasingsalaries of private attorneys, with judges' purchasing power having declined by over 13% over the past eight years. (31)", "The CJS conference agreement on a pay adjustment for federal judges and justices was reached against the backdrop of an imminent 2002 calendar yearcost-of-living pay increase for Members of Congress and executive branch officials.

By January 1, 2002, no legislation had been enacted to withhold the pay adjustment. (32) In contrast to automatic cost-of-living pay adjustments for Members ofCongress and executive branch officials, an annual pay increase for judges must be specifically authorized byCongress, and the legislative vehicle for thatauthorization in recent years has been the CJS-Judiciary appropriations bill At no time since judicial payadjustments have required statutory authorization havejudges received lower pay adjustments than Members of Congress and executive branch officials. Hence, in keepingwith that custom, the conferees' action onthe FY2002 CJS appropriations bill as enacted allowed cost-of-living pay increases for justices and judges to keepapace with those for Members of Congress andexecutive branch officials. (33)", "Also, without requesting FY2002 funding for this purpose, the Judiciary called for the creation of 54 \"Article III\" judgeships--judgeships created under Article IIIof the Constitution and having lifetime, as opposed to fixed-term, appointments. (34) The Judiciary noted that since Congress last enacted a major judgeship billin1990, (35) increases in federal jurisdiction and lawenforcement resources had contributed to a more than 25% increase in the workload of the federal courts.

LSC is a private, non-profit, federally-funded corporation that provides grants tolocal offices that, in turn, provide legal assistance to low-income people in civil (non-criminal) cases. The LSC hasbeen controversial since its inception in theearly 1970s, and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980. There have been ongoing debatesover the adequacy of funding for the agency,and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys toundertake. In annual appropriations laws, Congresstraditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of LSC-funded grantees, such as prohibitingrepresentation in certain types of cases orconducting any lobbying activities.", "P.L. 106-553 included $330 million for LSC for FY2001.

The LSC appropriation includes $310 million for basic fieldprograms and independent audits, $10.8million for management and administration, $2.2 million for the inspector general, and $7 million for clientself-help and information technology. It should benoted that P.L. 106-554 mandated a 0.22 percent government-wide rescission of discretionary budget authority forFY2001 for almost all government agencies.

The House Committee reportindicated concern about the LSC overruling,without appeal, certain configurations implemented by grantees via the state planning process. The HouseCommittee report directed the LSC to review the stateplanning process and the concerns raised and report back to the Committee by September 4, 2001, with a proposal(that includes input from the stakeholders) thatoutlines the reconfiguration standards and the process for states to appeal LSC's decisions.
