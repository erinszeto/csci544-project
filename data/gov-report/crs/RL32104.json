Except for child care costs, it gave scant attention to other living expenses of low-income parents. The issues of housing cost and affordability were essentially absent from the debate, although rent is the largest expense for many low-income families.", "The important role housing plays in families' lives has been recognized through a system of programs, administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), that subsidize the housing costs of low-income families. The three major direct housing assistance programs are the low-rent public housing program, the Housing Choice Voucher program (also known as Section 8 vouchers) and project-based rental assistance.", "Both housing programs and TANF are designed to serve the needs of low-income households. As a result, many low-income families who receive TANF cash assistance or services, or have in the past, also qualify for housing assistance. It is estimated by CRS that possibly half a million households were receiving both cash welfare assistance and housing assistance in 2001. Although the two programs, in many cases, serve the same populations, the structures and rules of the two programs are often in conflict. This inconsistency in program rules can lead to inefficiencies for dual program participants. Some changes have been made to enhance the compatibility of housing and welfare programs. Further changes to one or both of the programs to enhance coordination have been considered as a part of the debate surrounding both welfare reauthorization and proposed housing reform measures.", "This paper will introduce the reader to federal housing assistance and welfare programs, the people they serve, how the programs interact and current issues.

Some argue that income supplements that allow families to participate in the consumer market are the most effective and efficient means for the government to ensure that the basic needs of the poor are met. Others argue that poor people cannot effectively participate in the free market for a variety of reasons beyond income, and, as a result, society has a responsibility to provide them with the goods and services they need to survive. The social welfare programs run by the federal government have shifted from time to time in their relative emphasis on providing cash welfare versus subsidizing the costs of goods and services. Looking at the changes in welfare and housing programs over time helps to illustrate this tension.", "During and after the Great Depression, the government created a number of programs that provided both cash welfare and subsidized goods and services to the poor. The Social Security Act of 1935 offered grants to states to help fund cash aid for three groups of needy persons: children (Aid to Dependent Children), aged persons (Old-Age Assistance), and blind persons (Aid to the Blind). The Housing Act of 1937 created a federal construction program both to create jobs and to stimulate the economy, as well as to build low-cost housing for the poor. By the late 1930s and early 1940s, the federal government was providing surplus food to the poor in select cities. In 1964, the Food Stamp program was enacted both to eliminate surplus food as well as supplement the food needs of the poor. In 1965, the Medicaid program, which provided access to health care for the poor was created.", "By the late 1960s, the children's cash welfare program (renamed Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)) had become the target of widespread criticism. Some argued that cash welfare programs for single mothers promoted out-of-wedlock childbirth and dependency while discouraging work. At the same time, critics attacked federal housing programs, citing rising crime in publicly constructed housing developments and chronic fraud and abuse in their management. In 1969, President Nixon proposed a radical change to the federal social welfare system, a guaranteed minimum income in the form of a negative income tax. Nixon's plan was not adopted, but some reforms were made to the cash welfare program. By 1973, Nixon declared a moratorium on all federal housing construction programs. In their place, a number of programs were developed, the largest being a system of rental subsidies which families could use in the private market.", "Since the 1970s, federal social welfare policies have not resolved the debate between cash and services. Instead, a hybrid of both has developed and been maintained. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was created in the late 1970s and provides income supplements to working families. Market-based housing vouchers have grown to the point where more people are now served by vouchers than live in public housing. AFDC was abolished in 1996 and replaced by a state block grant called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). This last change, from AFDC to TANF, has been one of the most dramatic. Whereas AFDC provided ongoing cash payments for poor families, TANF was designed to provide families with a temporary cash benefit while they transitioned into work. Under TANF, states have new flexibility, which, paired with a large reduction in the welfare caseload in the mid-1990s, has made it possible for them to use their TANF funds to provide a wide range of services including child care and job-search assistance. Spending on services now accounts for a larger portion of TANF spending than does spending on cash benefit payments.", "Given the array of federal support for both cash aid and goods and services, questions can be raised as to whether the existing programs are well-coordinated for the purposes of effectiveness and efficiency.

States have used that flexibility to fund, for example, child care, transportation, job search assistance, and, in some cases, even housing assistance. States have implemented their TANF programs very differently and some states provide a wider array of services than others. In addition to greater flexibility in using funds, the conversion to TANF has brought a combination of policies to promote work, including stronger sanctions for nonparticipation in work, \"Work First\" policies and financial work rewards.", "Since TANF was enacted, the goal of moving families off of cash assistance and into employment has been largely met, as caseloads now are one-half their historic peak size. However, it is less clear whether the incomes of the families who have left the caseloads (or not entered them) provide \"self-sufficiency.\" Studies indicate that most families who have left cash assistance still require some form of public assistance. According to studies funded by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), about two-thirds of families who leave welfare receive food stamps within the first year and three out of five adults leaving welfare and 60-90% of their children are enrolled in Medicaid.", "Funding for the TANF block grant was originally set to expire on September 30, 2002, but it has been renewed through a series of short-term legislative actions. Several bills were introduced in the 108 th Congress to reauthorize TANF through FY2008.

Many low-income families pay much more than 30% of their incomes towards housing costs. According to the 2003 State of the Nation's Housing, released by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, there were over 14 million households who were severely rent-burdened, meaning that they paid more than half of their income towards rent. Almost 75% of these 14 million severely rent-burdened households were in the bottom income quintile.

In FY2003, there were 1.2 million public housing units under management.", "Originally referred to as the Section 8 voucher program, the Housing Choice Voucher program provides federally funded subsidies, administered by local PHAs, to low-income families and individuals to lease housing from private landlords. Families who receive vouchers pay between 30% and 40% of their incomes towards rent and the federal government subsidizes the remainder. In FY2003, there were approximately 2.2 million authorized vouchers.", "Project-based rental assistance programs include privately-owned buildings for which the tenant rents, and in some cases construction costs, are subsidized by HUD. Although these programs are not generating new contracts, they were initially authorized under multi-year contracts, many of which have not yet expired. Tenants who live in these buildings pay approximately 30% of their incomes towards rent and the federal government pays the remainder to the landlord.

Of the non-elderly, non-disabled portion of the housing assistance caseload, more than half reported some income from work; less than 10% reported combining welfare and work. About one-fifth of these households were receiving income from welfare but not from work. Given that the caseload is approximately 5 million households, that around half of those households are non-elderly, non-disabled (2.5 million), and that about one fourth of those households are receiving welfare, we can very roughly estimate that around half a million households are receiving both TANF assistance and housing assistance.

If families' incomes rise, they require less housing assistance and the housing assistance programs could cut their costs or serve more families. If under TANF, many families are sanctioned from cash assistance or reach their time limit, it is possible that families' incomes will drop. If families' incomes drop, they require more housing assistance, and PHAs could either request additional federal funds or cut the number of people they serve.", "Preliminary research findings have shown that TANF, while promoting work, has not significantly increased or decreased the incomes of current or former recipients. Housing research that sought to monitor the influence of TANF on housing assistance recipients has similarly found few changes in income. As a result, welfare reform has not had a major impact on the housing budget. However, to the extent that TANF, or changes made to TANF, raise or lower the income of families in the future, the housing budget could be impacted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Housing Rules", "paragraphs": ["While one of the major goals of the TANF program is to promote work, the benefit structure of the HUD housing assistance programs may undermine TANF work policies. The amount of housing assistance a family receives fluctuates with the family's income. If a family's income falls, the family's housing assistance will typically rise to make up for that fall in income. As a result, the family may be cushioned from the full impact of sanctions and time limits and, therefore, might have fewer incentives to meet work requirements. In the other direction, if a family's income rises as a result of work, then the amount of housing assistance a family receives is typically reduced. The family may not feel the full impact of an increase in earnings, and as a result, might have fewer incentives to increase earnings under TANF.

The Quality Housing and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1998 (QHWRA) ( P.L. 105-276 ) required PHAs to adopt several policies designed to encourage families living in public housing to work. QHWRA required PHAs to adopt flat rents as a policy to promote work. Flat rents are market equivalent rents that a family can opt to pay in lieu of an income-based rent. Under a flat rent structure, if a family's income rises to a point where 30% of its income is higher than the flat rent, it can switch to the flat rent and further income increases will not be offset by increases in rent.", "Second, QHWRA directed PHAs to adopt an earned income disregard. Under the earned income disregard for public housing, certain amounts of a qualifying adult's verified earned income are not counted toward rent. Specifically, income due to earnings are completely disregarded in calculating rent for 12 months, after which half of any increased earnings are excluded for an additional 12 months. A PHA can also choose to set up Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) in addition to earned income disregards. When a PHA has set up an ISA program, a family can opt to pay increased rent rather than take the disregard, but the increased amount is deposited into a savings account on the family's behalf.", "Another rent policy dictated by QHWRA attempts to prevent rent changes from undermining TANF sanctions. For voucher-holders and residents of public housing, decreases in income resulting from non-compliance with TANF rules (or fraud) cannot be offset by rent reductions or increases in housing subsidies. Therefore, families are not cushioned from rent increases if their incomes fall as a result of non-compliance. However, reductions in TANF assistance resulting from time limits or failure to find a job do not count as non-compliance for this purpose. Therefore, if a family hits a time limit or loses TANF because they cannot find a job, their housing benefits will increase to reflect the family's loss of income.", "In addition to changes in rent determination policies, QHWRA introduced a community and self-sufficiency requirement to public housing. Under these rules, non-elderly, non-disabled adults who live in public housing are required to work or participate in community service at least 8 hours per month. This provision was suspended in FY2002, but upon passage of the FY2003 appropriations law ( P.L. 108-7 ), the community service and self-sufficiency provision was reinstated.", "The Family Self Sufficiency and the Resident Opportunities for Self Sufficiency Program . Under the Housing Choice Voucher program, some families are able to participate in a work incentive program entitled the Family Self Sufficiency Program (FSS). PHAs employ FSS program coordinators who link housing assistance recipients to the supportive services they need to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Families who wish to participate in the FSS program must sign an FSS contract. The contract requires that the family comply with the lease, that all family members become independent of welfare, and that the head of the family seek and maintain suitable employment within five years. An interest-bearing FSS escrow account, similar to an ISA, is established by the PHA for each family that participates in the FSS program. Any increases in rent resulting from increases in earned income are credited to the account during the term of the FSS contract. The PHA may make a portion of this escrow account available to the family during the term of the contract to enable the family to complete an interim goal such as education. If the family completes the contract and no member of the family is receiving welfare, the amount of the FSS account is paid to the family. If the PHA terminates the FSS contract, or if the family fails to complete the contract before its expiration, the family's FSS escrow funds are forfeited.", "The Resident Opportunities for Self Sufficiency Program (ROSS) is designed to link public housing residents with supportive services, resident empowerment activities, and assistance in becoming economically self-sufficient. ROSS grants may be made to PHAs, resident associations or non-profits operating programs that benefit public housing residents. The grant money can be used to fund a range of activities including resident self-sufficiency initiatives, resident small business development, other job training and support and service coordinators.", "Welfare to Work Vouchers . To address a perceived lack of housing available to families attempting to transition from welfare to self-sufficiency, in 1999 Congress authorized HUD to award approximately 50,000 additional housing choice vouchers to housing authorities throughout the country through its Welfare to Work (WtW) Voucher Program. WtW vouchers target families who have a critical need for housing in order to obtain or retain viable employment. In order to be eligible for a WtW voucher, a family must be both eligible for housing assistance and for TANF cash assistance. In order to be eligible to administer WtW vouchers, PHAs must develop plans in partnership with welfare and workforce development agencies to ensure that the housing assistance is combined with job training, child care, and other services families need to make the successful transition from welfare to economic independence. No new WtW vouchers have been authorized by Congress since 1999, although the existing WtW vouchers have been renewed.", "TANF Funding and Housing . States have wide flexibility under TANF to fund programs designed to better coordinate and fulfill the service needs of families transitioning from welfare to work. As of 2002, 12 states were using their TANF block grant funds to provide some form of housing assistance to families, ranging from home buyer support to rental assistance. While TANF funds can currently be used for one-time or ongoing housing-related assistance, housing aid lasting beyond four months counts as \"assistance,\" which triggers time limits, work requirements and child support reporting requirements for recipients. Some advocates have proposed that the welfare law be changed to allow housing benefits to count as \"non-assistance,\" thus not triggering time limits, work requirements or child support reporting requirements.

Similar findings resulted from a study of Minnesota's welfare reform initiative (MFIP); the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation (MDRC) found that residents of public and subsidized housing benefitted more from MFIP than similar families without housing assistance. Despite these positive findings on the relationship between housing assistance and income and earnings, other studies have demonstrated a lack of clear relation between housing assistance and employment and/or earnings. The Department of Housing and Urban Development conducted a study of housing assistance recipients who received welfare in two states. While no statistically significant differences were found in earnings and employment outcomes between welfare recipients with and without housing assistance, the non-experimental component of this analysis indicated a possible positive interactive effect between welfare reform and housing vouchers.", "Although studies have been ambiguous regarding the impact of housing assistance on employment and earnings, the relationship between neighborhood poverty rates and employment and earnings is well documented. A number of studies have found that neighborhoods with high poverty rates negatively impact families' employment, earnings and earnings growth and increase welfare recidivism and the length of a family's stay on welfare. While public housing is often located in areas of high concentrations of poverty, the portable voucher program allows families the flexibility to move to housing virtually any place in the U.S. While voucher families typically live in areas with lower concentrations of poverty than do families in public housing, families with vouchers still often live in neighborhoods with high poverty. An experiment undertaken by HUD, the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) Fair Housing Demonstration, was designed to test the impact on families of requiring them to move from areas of high concentrations of poverty to areas with low concentrations of poverty. Preliminary findings indicate that families who used vouchers to move to low poverty areas had improved health outcomes, improved educational test scores, and lower rates of juvenile crime. These preliminary findings have not yet shown any wage or employment effects.", "The research seems to indicate that, at the least, housing assistance does not appear to hurt the employment and earnings efforts of families leaving welfare; instead, housing assistance may actually improve their outcomes.

WELPAN asserts that a superwaiver would allow administrators to extend follow up and supportive service assistance to meet the needs of individual families beyond the current six-month cap. Those who oppose the expanded waiver authority express concern that states would have too much authority to undermine the goals of programs for the poor, as established by Congress.
