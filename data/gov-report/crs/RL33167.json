However, nearly all such communications are eventually censored and offending texts are deletedby PRC authorities.

(12) Compared to similarefforts in other countries, the Chinese government effectively filters content by employing multiplemethods of regulation and technical controls. The PRC-sponsored news agency, Xinhua, stated thatcensorship targets \"superstitious, pornographic, violence-related, gambling and other harmfulinformation.\" (13) However, many observers are concerned about the pervasive filtering of any content that theCommunist Party of China views as politically objectionable. Informational websites, including thatof the BBC, Voice of America, Radio Free Asia, and the public encyclopedia, Wikipedia, have beenregularly blocked in China, while other news sources, such as the New York Times , the WashingtonPost , the South China Morning Post (Hong Kong) , and CNN have been intermittently blocked.

The People's Daily , a state-sponsored newspaper, has an online bulletin board calledthe \"Strong Nation Forum,\" intended for discussion on how to make China a stronger nation. Theforum hosted angry anti-Japanese postings in April 2005, during a political fallout between Chinaand Japan concerning Japan's alleged re-writing of wartime atrocities in its history textbooks.

Zhao had been stripped of his government position in 1989 largely for sympathizingwith Tiananmen student protesters, and was placed under house arrest. His death in 2005 receivedonly muted attention in the national media, reflecting the government's fear of renewing public callsfor a reversal of the official verdict on the Tiananmen demonstrations and the rehabilitation of thosecondemned during the crackdown.

Because these regulations often overlap, are regularlyupdated, and are created and carried out by multiple government agencies, the legal infrastructureregarding Internet usage in China is extraordinarily complex. At least 12 different governmentagencies are involved in Internet regulation, which are directed at Internet service and contentproviders, cyber-caf\u00c3\u00a9 operators, and Internet users themselves. (17) ", "Internet service providers (ISPs) must obtain an operating license from the Ministry ofInformation Industry (MII) and record each customer's account number, phone number, IP address,sites visited, and time spent online. Internet content providers (ICPs) that publish information,operate electronic bulletin boards, or engage in journalism must record all content made availableand the date it was issued. For both service and content providers, these records must be maintainedfor 60 days and surrendered to relevant government agencies upon request. (18) After obtaining permissionto open an Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9, caf\u00c3\u00a9 operators are required to install software that blocks pornographic and\"subversive\" content, keep detailed logs linking users to the pages they visited and record visits toany blocked pages, and report these to the Public Security Bureau. (19) As with ISPs and ICPs,cafes must retain this information for 60 days. PRC authorities reportedly closed 47,000 unlicensedInternet cafes in 2004 while installing monitoring software in others. (20) ", "In addition to regulations directed at Internet service and content providers, this complex legal infrastructure is also extended to Internet users themselves. The Ministry of Public Securitytook initial steps to control Internet use in 1997 when it issued comprehensive regulations governinginternet use. Selected portions of three key sections, Articles 4-6, are presented here: ", "Individuals are prohibited from using the Internet to: harm national security; disclose state secrets; or injure the interests of the state or society [4]. Usersare prohibited from using the Internet to create, replicate, retrieve, or transmit information thatincites resistance to the PRC Constitution, laws, or administrative regulations; promotes theoverthrow of the government or socialist system; undermines national unification; distorts the truth,spreads rumors, or destroys social order; or provides sexually suggestive material or encouragesgambling, violence, or murder [ 5]. Users are prohibited from engaging in activities that harm thesecurity of computer information networks and from using networks or changing network resourceswithout prior approval [6]. (21)", "September 25, 2005 Regulations. On July 1,2005, Chinese authorities shut down thousands of websites that had not registered with thegovernment. Following this stringent measure, in September 2005, the PRC State Council and theMII announced new rules regarding the administration of the Internet. These new rules formalizedinterim provisions enacted in 2000, which established general Internet content regulations and amandatory system of licensing and registration for those engaged in \"Internet informationservices.\" (22) ", "In addition to combining and clarifying earlier provisions, the new rules both tighten controlover online news services and define them more broadly. They stipulate that private individuals orgroups must register as \"news organizations\" before they can operate websites or e-mail distributionlists that spread news or commentary. Because a news organization is required to employexperienced staff, have registered premises, capital, and a transparent system of operation wherebywritings can be attributed, approval will likely be difficult for many individuals and privategroups. (23) Websites andpopular Internet portals such as Sina.com or Sohu.com must publish only news items, withoutcommentary, even though commentary is often a staple of Web-logs, or \"blogs.\" (24) According to the PRCnews agency, Xinhua, electronic bulletin board systems (BBS) and cell-phone text messages thatcontain news content are also subject to these regulations. (25) In addition, two new stipulations indicate increased Communistgovernment concerns about civil unrest. The first bans Internet news services from inciting illegalassemblies, marches and demonstrations; the other prohibits activity on behalf of illegal civilgroups. (26) ", "The complex legal infrastructure governing Internet usage in China also includes punitivemeasures for those who violate the regulations. Under the September 2005 rules, websites thatdistribute news without government authorization are under the threat of closure and fines of up to30,000 yuan (US$3,700). (27) Similar penalties and fees exist for website operators who failto register with the government, and, in serious cases, their network access would be terminated. However, some Internet portals or websites reportedly often drag their feet when complying withofficial censorship directives in order to attract or maintain market share. (28) "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Methods of Content Filtering", "paragraphs": ["China censors the Internet through website blocking and key word filtering, primarily at therouter level. Routers are devices through which packets of data are directed until they reach theirfinal destination. In China, routers are programmed to channel Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)through proxy servers, which look for politically sensitive words such as \"falun\" (as in\"www.faluninfo.net\" of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement), and send back an error message(e.g., \"file not found\") to the Internet user who requested the page. Internet search results aresimilarly blocked. For example, although the phrase \"Taiwan independence,\" may not be part of awebsite URL, entering this phrase into a search engine would result in a URL followed by thosewords (i.e., http://www.google.com/search?Taiwan+Independence), which would trigger the routerto filter and block the search results. (29) The OpenNet Initiative found that China tolerates occasionalover-blocking as the price of preventing access to prohibited sites.

(31) This cyber-police force,established in 2000, operates as a division within the police departments of 700 cities and provincesin China. Along with investigating online crimes, such as spreading viruses, pornography, orattempting financial fraud, the cyber-police monitor websites and e-mail content and removeobjectionable or subversive material. (32) ", "In addition to an established Internet police force, the Chinese government solicits help fromcitizens themselves to monitor Internet content. In July 2004, the MPS established a network ofonline reporting centers accompanied by a rewards component that encourages citizens to report\"illegal\" or \"harmful\" information. (33) Xinhua News Agency disclosed that by October 2004, 50citizens were rewarded 500-2,000 yuan ($62-$247) for reporting pornography and 18 citizens wererewarded 3,000 to 10,000 yuan ($370-$1,235) for reporting illegal online gambling. AlthoughXinhua did not disclose statistics for citizens who reported \"subversive\" political content, theguidelines on the cyber-police website state that citizen vigilance should not be limited to reportingpornography, but should extend to online political activities as well. (34) ", "China reportedly holds between 15 and 54 \"cyber dissidents\" in prison for posting messagesor articles on the Internet that were considered subversive. (35) Amnesty Internationalstated that some cyber dissidents were charged with revealing state secrets or endangering statesecurity and received prison sentences of two to twelve years. (36) Although the governmentgenerally does not prosecute citizens who receive dissident e-mail publications, forwarding suchmessages sometimes results in detention. The detainment of Internet political writers reflects Chineserepression of free media in general; according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2005, 32journalists were imprisoned in the PRC. (37) Since prohibited topics such as \"state secrets\" have not beenclearly defined by PRC authorities, many reporters, writers, and Internet users exerciseself-censorship to avoid the risk of losing their jobs or facing criminal liability.

For China'slatest network upgrade, \"CN2,\" which began in mid-2004, two U.S. companies, Cisco Systems andJuniper Networks, were granted four out of six contracts. Cisco Systems, a U.S. telecommunicationsequipment company, has previously faced allegations that it assisted China in developing censorshipcapabilities. (39) In itsrecent router contract for CN2, Cisco will provide China with its 12000 Series routers, which areequipped with filtering capability typically used to prevent Internet attacks (i.e., worms and viruses). This technology can also be used by PRC authorities to block politically sensitive content. (40) Derek Bambauer, aresearcher at the OpenNet Initiative, believes that without this upgrade, routers in China are notsearching deeply within packets of data for banned keywords, because it would put an enormous loadon the routers. Some contend that Cisco routers and the CN2 network upgrade may enable Chineseauthorities to employ more sophisticated keyword filtering. (41) Cisco denies allegationsthat it has altered its products to suit the objectives of PRC cyber-policing. Cisco has declared thatit does not tailor its products to the China market, and the products it sells in China are the same asthose in other countries.

(43) In 2002, Yahoo was condemned by human rights groups forvoluntarily signing a pledge of \"self-discipline,\" promising to follow China's censorship laws. InJune 2005, Microsoft's blog-hosting service, MSN Spaces, began removing words like \"democracy\"and \"human rights\" from use in Chinese blog titles and postings. (44) In December 2005, humanrights activists criticized Microsoft after the company, at the PRC government's behest, removed theMSN Spaces Web log of a well-known Chinese journalist, Zhao Jing. Zhao, who worked for theBeijing Bureau of the New York Times , occasionally broached sensitive political topics on his blog,such as a recent strike at a city newspaper. In January 2006, Microsoft announced a new policy forforeign countries whereby the company would close personal Web logs only if presented with alegally-binding order, inform its users of the reason for the removal, and continue to make such blogsaccessible in other countries.

Google will not offere-mail or blog services in China in order to avoid the possibility of having to divulge private Internetuser information to the PRC government. Google reportedly will comply with PRC laws regardingcensorship of information deemed inappropriate or illegal, but plans to disclose when suchinformation was removed for censorship purposes.
