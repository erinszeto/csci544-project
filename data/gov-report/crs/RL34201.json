Public water systems must meet extensive regulations, and water utility management has become a much more complex and professional endeavor. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has regulated some 91 drinking water contaminants, and more regulations are pending. In 2007, the number of community water systems reporting no violations of drinking water standards was 89.5%. Despite nationwide progress in providing safe drinking water, an array of issues and challenges remain.", "Recent issues have involved infrastructure funding needs, regulatory compliance, and concerns caused by detections of unregulated contaminants in drinking water, such as perchlorate, and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Another issue involves the adequacy of existing regulations (such as the lead rule) and EPA's pace in reviewing and potentially revising older standards (such as the chromium standard).", "Congress last reauthorized SDWA in 1996. Although funding authority for most SDWA programs expired in FY2003, Congress continues to appropriate funds annually for these ongoing programs, while EPA, states, and water systems continue efforts to meet current statutory requirements. The 111th Congress made one amendment to SDWA, P.L. 111-380, which reduces the amount of lead allowed in water pipes and plumbing fittings and fixtures.", "An overarching SDWA issue concerns the cumulative cost and complexity of drinking water standards and the ability of water systems, especially small systems, to comply with standards. The issue of the affordability of drinking water regulations has merged with the larger debate over what is the appropriate federal role in assisting communities with financing drinking water projects needed for SDWA compliance, and for water infrastructure improvements generally.", "Water infrastructure financing legislation has been offered repeatedly in recent Congresses to authorize higher funding levels for the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) program, and/or to provide grants and other compliance assistance to small communities. In the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5) included $2 billion for the DWSRF program, and the EPA appropriations act for FY2011 (P.L. 111-88) included another $1.387 billion. Two bills to revise and reauthorize the DWSRF received action: House-passed H.R. 5320 and Senate-reported S. 1005. Taking an alternative financing approach, H.R. 3202 proposed to create a water infrastructure trust fund supported by fees and taxes.", "The SDWA also mandates regulation of underground injection activities to protect drinking water sources. An issue in this area concerns the underground injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) for long-term storage as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140) specified that sequestration activities shall be subject to SDWA underground injection control provisions. In 2010, EPA issued a SDWA rule to provide a national permitting framework for managing the underground injection of CO2 for commercial-scale sequestration projects. Another underground injection issue concerns the growing reliance on hydraulic fracturing to produce natural gas and oil from unconventional geologic formations. Two bills (H.R. 2766 and S. 1215, the FRAC Act) were introduced to authorize EPA regulation of this practice under the SDWA underground injection control program; in contrast, H.R. 2300 expressed opposition to federal regulation of gas and oil production wells under SDWA."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) is the primary federal law for protecting public water supplies from harmful contaminants. First enacted in 1974, and broadly amended in 1986 and 1996, the SDWA is administered through programs that regulate contaminants in public water supplies, provide funding for infrastructure projects, protect underground sources of drinking water, and promote the capacity of water systems to comply with SDWA regulations.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency responsible for administering SDWA; however, the 1974 law established a federal-state structure in which EPA may delegate primary enforcement and implementation authority (primacy) for drinking water programs to states and tribes. The state-administered Public Water Supply Supervision (PWSS) program remains the basic program for regulating public water systems, and EPA has delegated primacy for this program to all states, except Wyoming and the District of Columbia (which SDWA defines as a state). EPA has responsibility for implementing the PWSS program in these two jurisdictions and throughout most Indian lands. A second key portion of the act requires EPA to regulate the underground injection of wastes and other fluids to protect underground sources of drinking water from contamination. Primary enforcement authority for the underground injection control (UIC) program also may be delegated to the states. Thirty-three states have assumed primacy for the program, EPA has lead implementation and enforcement authority in 10 states, and program authority for different classes of injection wells is split in the remainder of the states.", "Since the law was first enacted, much progress has been made in assuring the quality of public water supplies. EPA has regulated some 91 drinking water contaminants, and more regulations are pending. Despite this progress, drinking water safety concerns and challenges remain. According to EPA's 2006 National Public Water Systems Compliance Report, the number of public water systems reporting no violations of the health-based standards for 2006 was 93%, and 73% of the U.S. population was served by public water systems that had no reported significant violations. However, EPA estimated that states had submitted to the EPA database only 62% of violations of health-based standards and 29% of violations of monitoring and reporting requirements, thus increasing uncertainty as to the quality of water provided by many systems. EPA and the states have resolved some data quality and reporting problems, and efforts to address this issue continue. EPA and state compliance data indicate that water systems still incur tens of thousands of violations of SDWA requirements each year. Although these violations primarily involve monitoring and reporting requirements, they also include thousands of violations of standards and treatment techniques. Moreover, monitoring and reporting violations create uncertainty as to whether systems actually met the applicable health-based standards.", "Also at issue is the rate at which EPA has been reviewing and updating existing contaminant regulations to respond to newer scientific information (e.g., chromium and trichloroethylene (TCE)) or to address implementation and compliance problems (e.g., the Lead and Copper Rule). Concern also exists over the potential health effects of drinking water contaminants for which standards have not been set, such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). The act requires EPA to continually evaluate contaminants that may be candidates for regulation and to periodically review existing standards; however, EPA's perceived lack of action on specific contaminants of concern has generated criticism in Congress and elsewhere.

These changes resulted from a multi-year effort to amend a statute that was widely criticized as having too little flexibility, too many unfunded mandates, and an arduous but unfocused regulatory schedule. Among the key provisions, the 1996 amendments authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program to help public water systems finance projects needed to comply with SDWA regulations. The amendments also established a process for selecting contaminants for regulation based on health risk and occurrence, gave EPA some added flexibility to consider costs and benefits in setting most new standards, and established schedules for regulating certain contaminants (e.g., arsenic, radon, and disinfection byproducts).", "The 1996 law added several provisions aimed at building the capacity of water systems (especially small systems) to comply with SDWA regulations, and imposed many new requirements on the states. Among other provisions, the amendments required states to develop programs for source water assessment, operator certification and training, and compliance capacity development. The law also required community water systems to provide customers with annual \"consumer confidence reports\" that contain information on regulated contaminants found in the local drinking water. Appropriations for most SDWA programs were authorized through FY2003, and although most of the act's funding authorities have expired, broad reauthorization bills have not been proposed, as EPA, states, and public water systems remain focused on meeting the requirements of the 1996 amendments.", "In 2002, Congress added drinking water security provisions to the SDWA through the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-188 , Title IV). New SDWA section 1433 required community water systems serving more than 3,300 people to conduct vulnerability assessments and prepare emergency response plans. The law also required EPA to conduct research on preventing and responding to terrorist or other attacks. In the 111 th Congress, the House passed H.R. 2868 , the Chemical and Water Security Act of 2009, to direct the EPA Administrator to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance standards for covered water and wastewater utilities. The bill would have required covered systems to update vulnerability assessments, develop site security and emergency response plans, and possibly implement methods to reduce the consequences of a chemical release.

Another 18,395 systems are non-transient, non-community water systems (NTNCWSs), such as schools or factories, that have their own water supply and serve the same people for more than six months but not year-round. Most drinking water requirements apply to these systems. Additionally, 83,484 systems are transient non-community water systems (TNCWSs) (e.g., campgrounds and gas stations) that provide their own water to transitory customers. TNCWSs generally are required to comply only with regulations for contaminants that pose immediate health risks (such as microbial contaminants), with the proviso that systems that use surface water sources must also comply with filtration and disinfection regulations.", "Of the nearly 52,000 community water systems, roughly 83% serve 3,300 or fewer people. While large in number, these systems provide water to just 9% of the population served by all community systems. In contrast, 8% of community water systems serve more than 10,000 people, and they provide water to 82% of the population served. Fully 85% (15,619) of non-transient, non-community water systems and 97% (80,703) of transient noncommunity water systems serve 500 or fewer people.

This legislation revised the act's definition of lead free (Section 1417(d)) to reduce the amount of lead allowed in water pipes, plumbing fittings, and fixtures to 0.25%. Previously, pipes and pipe fittings have been allowed to contain 8% lead, while fixtures were required to meet a lead leaching performance standard, rather than a lead content standard. This law is intended to further reduce exposure to lead from tap water. ", "Several SDWA funding bills also were enacted in the 111 th Congress.

The FY2010 funding act and ARRA require states to make available at least 20% of their DWSRF grants for projects to address green infrastructure, water or energy efficiency improvements, or other environmentally innovative activities. Additionally, ARRA included $50 million for site characterization activities in geologic formations related to carbon sequestration, and $20 million for geologic sequestration training and research activities.

In early 2008, EPA published for public comment a draft CCL 3 that contained 93 chemicals or chemical groups and 11 microbiological contaminants (73 Fed. Reg. 9627). The draft list included commercial and agricultural chemicals, biological toxins, disinfection byproducts, and pathogens; 16 chemicals, including perchlorate, were carried over from CCL 2. EPA screened some 7,500 chemicals and microbes and selected 104 candidates for the draft CCL 3. As discussed below, the list did not include any pharmaceuticals.

All of the determinations were decisions not to regulate. In making these determinations, EPA noted that the data indicated that the contaminants either did not appear to occur in public water systems, or appeared infrequently at levels of health concern, and that regulating the contaminants did not present a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction. For those contaminants with low occurrence frequencies, EPA is updating and broadening the health advisories to reflect new information on the contaminants or to include information on a contaminant's degradation byproducts.", "The agency did not make determinations for two chemicals that have been detected in numerous water supplies and have received considerable congressional attention: perchlorate and MTBE. EPA noted a decision was not made for MTBE because the health risk assessment for MTBE is being revised. In early January 2009, EPA stated its intent to request the NRC to review anew the available scientific data prior to EPA making a final regulatory determination. In August 2009, the Obama Administration announced its decision not to ask the NRC to conduct further review of perchlorate, having concluded that additional NRC review would unnecessarily delay regulatory decision making. Instead, on August 19, 2009, EPA published a Supplemental Request for Comments notice in the Federal Register , seeking public comment on additional ways to analyze the health effects and occurrence data for perchlorate. Specifically, EPA is re-evaluating potential perchlorate exposure for infants and young children, in addition to pregnant women and fetuses, as sensitive subpopulations. The agency intends to consider public comments before making a final regulatory determination. H.R. 3206 , in the 111 th Congress, would have required EPA to promulgate a drinking water standard for perchlorate.

This monitoring program enables EPA to collect data for contaminants that are not regulated but are suspected to be present in drinking water. Every five years, EPA is required to identify as many as 30 contaminants to be monitored. This list is largely based on the contaminant candidate lists. All systems serving more than 10,000 people and a sample of smaller systems must monitor for the contaminants. The resulting data are added to the National Contaminant Occurrence Database (NCOD). EPA published the first unregulated contaminant monitoring rule (UCMR 1) in 1999 requiring monitoring for 26 chemicals. In January 2007, EPA issued the second rule (UCMR 2), requiring systems to monitor for 25 chemicals over a 12-month period between 2008 through 2010. EPA had included perchlorate on the draft UCMR 2 list, but deleted it from the final list.

Where it is not economically or technically feasible to measure a contaminant at very low concentrations, EPA may establish a treatment technique in lieu of a standard, as it has done for lead and copper.", "Developing a drinking water regulation is a complex process, and EPA must address technical, scientific, and economic issues. The agency must (1) estimate the extent of occurrence of a contaminant in sources of drinking water nationwide; (2) evaluate the potential human exposure and risks of adverse health effects to the general population and to sensitive subpopulations; (3) ensure that analytical methods are available for water systems to use in monitoring for a contaminant; (4) evaluate the availability and costs of treatment techniques that can be used to remove a contaminant; and (5) assess the impacts of a regulation on public water systems, the economy, and public health. Regulation development typically is a multi-year process. EPA may expedite procedures and issue interim standards to respond to urgent threats to public health.", "After reviewing health effects studies, EPA sets a nonenforceable maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) at a level at which no known or anticipated adverse health effects occur and that allows an adequate margin of safety. EPA also considers the risk to sensitive subpopulations, such as infants and children. For carcinogens and microbes, EPA generally sets the MCLG at zero. Because MCLGs are based only on health effects and not on analytical detection limits or the availability or cost of treatment technologies, they may be set at levels that are not technically feasible for water systems to meet.", "Once the MCLG is established, EPA then sets an enforceable standard, the maximum contaminant level (MCL). The MCL generally must be set as close to the MCLG as is \"feasible\" using the best technology or other means available, taking costs into consideration (SDWA \u00a71412(b)). The act does not discuss how EPA should consider cost in determining feasibility; consequently, EPA has relied on legislative history for guidance. Congress last addressed this issue in the Senate report accompanying the 1996 amendments, which stated that \"feasible\" means the level that can be reached by large, regional drinking water systems applying best available treatment technology. The Senate committee report explained that this approach is used because 80% of the population receives its drinking water from large community water systems, and thus, safe water can be provided to most of the population at very affordable costs.", "However, because standards are based on cost considerations for large systems, Congress expected that standards could be less affordable for smaller systems. In 1996, Congress expanded the act's variance and exemption provisions to give small systems some added compliance flexibility. (See the discussion below on \" Small Systems Issues .\") Congress further revised the act to require EPA, when proposing a standard, to publish a determination as to whether or not the benefits of a proposed standard justify the costs. If EPA determines that the benefits do not justify the costs, EPA, in certain cases, may promulgate a standard that is less stringent than the feasible level and that \"maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost that is justified by the benefits.\" EPA used this authority to establish new standards for arsenic and radium."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent and Pending Rules", "paragraphs": ["EPA's latest rulemaking activities include a January 2006 rule package that expanded existing requirements to control pathogens (especially Cryptosporidium ) and disinfectants (e.g., chlorine) and their byproducts (e.g., chloroform).

EPA promulgated a related Ground Water Rule to establish disinfection requirements for systems relying on ground water. In the past several years, EPA also issued standards for several radionuclides, including uranium and revised standards for radium and arsenic. These rules are expected to reduce an array of health risks for consumers, but they have potentially significant costs for the communities that must expand treatment facilities to comply with the standards.", "In 2007, EPA completed revisions to the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR). The revisions were made to address weaknesses identified during a nationwide review of the rule, following the discovery of high lead levels in Washington, DC, tap water in 2004. The changes involved regulatory requirements for monitoring, treatment, customer notification, and lead service line replacement. Some of the regulatory revisions clarify the intent of the original LCR for provisions that may not have been sufficiently clear, while others revise LCR requirements. These changes are intended to strengthen implementation of the LCR in the short term; EPA is considering making more comprehensive revisions to the LCR and/or issuing additional guidance for public water systems.", "Among ongoing rulemakings, EPA is revising the 1989 Total Coliform Rule, which controls the presence of bacteria in drinking water. EPA also has been working to finalize a radon rule (proposed in 1999), and has been evaluating numerous new contaminants, including perchlorate and MTBE, for possible regulation. As noted, in 2009, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register seeking additional comment on the analysis of data for purposes of making a regulatory determination for perchlorate. Specifically, EPA is re-evaluating potential perchlorate exposure for infants and young children, in addition to pregnant women and fetuses.

Issued in 1991, the current drinking water standard for chromium is set at 100 parts per billion (ppb) and addresses all forms of chromium, including chromium-3, which is considered an essential nutrient. The total chromium standard was based on health effects data for hexavalent chromium (chromium-6), specifically to protect against allergic dermatitis. Although it was known that chromium-6 could cause cancer when inhaled, EPA concluded that the evidence was insufficient to determine whether chromium-6 could cause cancer in humans when ingested (in food or water). When issuing the standard, the agency noted that the only feasible approach at that time was to base drinking water exposure limits for total chromium on non-cancer health effects.", "Substantial evidence now indicates that chromium-6 can cause cancer if ingested. In 2008, EPA began reviewing the chromium standard to determine whether it needed revision. In September 2010, EPA released for peer review and public comment a draft human health assessment specifically for chromium-6. The agency expects that the assessment will be completed later this year. EPA will use the health assessment and other available information to determine whether to develop a drinking water standard for chromium-6.

These chemicals are released to the environment in various ways, including elimination of human and animal waste, disposal of unused medicines down the toilet, veterinary drug usage, hospital waste disposal, and industrial discharges.", "Although significant research is being conducted, much is unknown about the occurrence and movement of PPCPs in the environment, their occurrence in drinking water supplies, or about the potential health risks from exposure to PPCPs at extremely low levels through drinking water. Nonetheless, the detection of pharmaceuticals and related products in public water supplies generates concern, because many of these products are specifically designed to have a biological effect in humans, animals, and/or plants. Pharmaceuticals often contain chemical compounds that can affect the endocrine system by altering, mimicking, or impeding the function of hormones. Such endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have the potential to affect growth, development, reproduction, and metabolism. Over the past decade, scientists and regulators have become increasingly concerned about the effects that exposures to low levels of PPCPs may be having on aquatic organisms, and also potentially on human health.", "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and EPA have identified a wide array of research needs and gaps that, if addressed, would help delineate the scope of environmental and human health issues that might result from the presence of PPCPs in the environment. The USGS has conducted research on the occurrence of hormones, pharmaceuticals, and other wastes in residential, industrial, and agricultural wastewater, and has found that a broad range of these chemicals occur commonly downstream from large urban areas and concentrated animal production areas. In June 2010, the USGS reported that pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities can be a significant source of pharmaceuticals in the environment.", "EPA has been conducting and supporting numerous PPCP research projects in several areas, including the relative importance of different sources of PPCPs in the environment (e.g., veterinary vs. human medicine), how PPCPs move through the environment, human exposure pathways, ecological exposure pathways, monitoring and detection tools, assessment of potential human health effects, and assessment of potential ecological effects. Research is also being conducted to evaluate the ability of drinking water treatment technologies to remove various PPCPs.", "The agency is also conducting a study to determine the amount of PPCPs that are discharged to wastewater treatment plants from various sources. As part of this study, EPA is evaluating how hospitals and other institutions dispose of unused medications. Other research projects address the development of analytical methods to determine the source and fate of PPCPs in the environment.

Nonetheless, a key research issue concerns the possible health risks from exposure to very low doses of the myriad chemicals found in PPCPs. Because PPCPs occur in the environment at low concentrations typically, their effects may be subtle. Among other research gaps, EPA has identified a need to develop tests that can detect more subtle health effects.", "As noted above, EPA proposed its third list of unregulated contaminants being considered for regulation in February 2008. The draft Contaminant Candidate List 3 (CCL 3) contained 104 contaminants, none of which are pharmaceuticals. Following recent reports of the detection of pharmaceuticals and commonly used over-the-counter drugs in the drinking water supplies of 24 large community water systems, EPA has asked its Science Advisory Board (SAB) and stakeholders to evaluate and comment on the contaminant candidate screening and selection process to determine whether the process required revision. Based on recommendations, and review of comments and newly available data, the agency made a number of changes from the draft to the final CCL 3. Among the changes, EPA added 10 pharmaceuticals; one antibiotic (erythromycin), and nine hormones.

Recognizing that people and animals will continue to take and use pharmaceutical products, water suppliers and other stakeholders consider changes at wastewater treatment plants to be a key part of the solution.", "The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA), which represents the largest publicly owned water systems, has made several recommendations to address this emerging drinking water issue. Among these recommendations, the AMWA strongly encouraged EPA to make research on treatment technologies a high priority, and urged water utilities to inform consumers of efforts to monitor and remove pharmaceuticals from water sources. AMWA also called for EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to determine whether the presence of trace amounts of pharmaceuticals results in short-term or long-term effects on health and the environment, recommended that the federal government take the lead in developing a national program for disposing of unused prescriptions, and called for animal feeding operations to reduce their contributions of antibiotics and steroids into water supplies.", "In the 111 th Congress, several bills addressed this issue, including two that passed the House: H.R. 1145 ( H.Rept. 111-76 ), a water research bill, called for research on prevention and removal of contaminants of emerging concern, including PPCPs, in water resources; and H.R. 1262 ( H.Rept. 111-26 ), a water infrastructure funding bill, would have amended the Clean Water Act to require EPA to conduct a study on the presence of PPCPs in the nation's waters. Additionally, the House Appropriations Committee report for EPA's FY2010 appropriations ( P.L. 111-88 , H.Rept. 111-180 ) encouraged EPA to develop a plan to synthesize available research on contaminants of emerging concern, including endocrine disrupting compounds and additives to personal care products, and to apply a systematic approach to addressing the problem of such contaminants in water supplies. The House report further directed EPA to publish a list of at least 100 chemicals for screening in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program that includes drinking water contaminants such as PPCPs. Action was not completed on the Interior-Environment appropriations, and EPA is operating under a continuing resolution through March 4, 2011.

As with EPA's FY2010 appropriations act, this bill would have revised the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program and would have required EPA to list at least 100 substances for screening; it also would have set testing schedules and priorities. H.R. 5320 further would have directed EPA to conduct a study on PPCPs in sources of drinking water and to identity the sources of these products and their environmental and human health effects. Taking another approach, H.R. 276 proposed to require the EPA Administrator to convene a task force to develop recommendations for the proper disposal of unused pharmaceuticals to protect water sources.

In the 1996 amendments, Congress responded to growing complaints about the act's unfunded mandates and authorized a drinking water state revolving loan fund (DWSRF) program to help water systems finance infrastructure projects needed to meet drinking water standards and address the most serious health risks. ", "The program authorizes EPA to award annual capitalization grants to states. States then use their grants (plus a 20% state match) to provide loans and other assistance to public water systems. Communities repay loans into the fund, thus replenishing the fund and making resources available for projects in other communities. Eligible projects include installation and replacement of treatment facilities, distribution systems, and some storage facilities. Projects to replace aging infrastructure are eligible if they are needed to maintain compliance or to further public health protection goals.", "The SDWA authorized appropriations for the DWSRF program totaling $9.6 billion, including $1 billion for each of FY1995 through FY2003. Congress provided $829.0 million for each of FY2008 and FY2009. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5 ), Congress provided an additional $2 billion for the DWSRF program. For FY2010, the President requested $1.5 billion for the program. Congress approved $1.387 billion in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010 ( P.L. 111-88 ). Since FY1997, Congress has appropriated more than $14.5 billion for this program. For FY2011, the President requested $1.29 billion. EPA programs are being funded through a continuing resolution through March 4, 2011. Table 3 lists funding levels for the DWSRF program since its inception.", "Through June 2009, EPA had awarded $10.6 billion in capitalization grants, which, when combined with the 20% state match, bond proceeds, loan principal repayments, and other funds, amounted to $18.7 billion in DWSRF funds available for loans and other assistance. Through June 2009, 6,905 projects had received assistance, 4,567 of which had been completed, and total assistance provided by the program reached $16.2 billion.", "The DWSRF program is well-regarded, but many state and local officials and interest groups have argued that greater investment in water infrastructure is needed. EPA's latest needs survey estimates that public water systems need to invest $334.8 billion on infrastructure improvements over 20 years (2007 through 2026) to achieve regulatory compliance and ensure the provision of safe water. Although all of the infrastructure projects in the needs assessment promote the health objectives of the act, EPA reports that just 16% ($52.0 billion) is attributable to SDWA regulations, while $282.8 billion (84%) represents nonregulatory costs. Most needs typically involve installing, upgrading, or replacing transmission and distribution infrastructure to allow a system to continue to deliver safe drinking water. Although aging, deteriorated infrastructure often poses a threat to drinking water safety, these needs occur independently of federal mandates.", "EPA also has prepared a broader municipal wastewater and drinking water infrastructure funding gap analysis, which identified potential funding gaps between projected needs and spending from 2000 through 2019. This analysis estimated the potential 20-year funding gap for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure capital and operations and maintenance (O&M), based on two scenarios: a \"no revenue growth\" scenario and a \"revenue growth\" scenario that assumed infrastructure spending would increase 3% per year. Under the \"no revenue growth\" scenario, EPA projected a funding gap for drinking water capital investment of $102 billion ($5 billion per year) and an O&M funding gap of $161 billion ($8 billion per year). Using revenue growth assumptions, EPA estimated a 20-year capital funding gap of $45 billion ($2 billion per year), and no gap for O&M.", "Other assessments also have found a funding gap. In 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network (WIN) (a coalition of state and local officials, water providers, environmental groups and others) reported that over the next 20 years, water and wastewater systems need to invest $23 billion annually more than current investments to meet SDWA and Clean Water Act health and environmental priorities and to replace aging infrastructure. WIN and other groups have proposed multibillion dollar investment programs for water infrastructure. Others, however, have called for more financial self-reliance within the water sector.", "In the 111 th Congress, this issue found early focus in the economic stimulus debate. As noted, ARRA included $2 billion, while the FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations acts provided $829 million and $1.387 billion, respectively, for a total of more than $4.2 billion for drinking water infrastructure. After several short-term continuing resolutions for FY2011, Congress extended EPA funding at FY2010 levels through March 4, 2011, under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 ( P.L. 111-322 ).", "Beyond stimulus and appropriations actions, drinking water and other water infrastructure issues received attention. In July 2009, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee reported a broad drinking water and wastewater infrastructure financing bill, S. 1005 ( S.Rept. 111-47 ), the Water Infrastructure Financing Act, which was similar to the committee bill from the 110 th Congress. It would have authorized more funding for drinking water and wastewater SRF programs (authorizing $15 billion over five years for the DWSRF), and created a grant program at EPA for small or economically disadvantaged communities for critical drinking water and water quality projects. S. 1005 included a Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provision, requiring that prevailing wage requirements would apply to all projects financed in whole or part through an SRF. This would be a new requirement for the states under the DWSRF program, and the provision has been problematic for similar legislation in recent Congresses. However, Congress did apply prevailing wage requirements to projects that are funded through ARRA or P.L. 111-88 . On July 1, 2010, the House Energy and Commerce Committee reported H.R. 5320 , the Assistance, Quality, and Affordability Act of 2010. As approved by the full committee, H.R. 5320 would have reauthorized the DWSRF for three years (for a total of $ 4.8 billion), applied Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provisions to projects financed in any way by a DWSRF, specified certain eligible uses of the fund (such as rehabilitation of aging infrastructure and projects that improve energy or water efficiency), and made other changes to this program. ", "The Water Protection and Reinvestment Act ( H.R. 3202 ) was offered to establish a dedicated water infrastructure trust fund. The trust fund would have been supported by taxes on various products, including PPCPs, water-based beverages, and a tax on some corporate profits. H.R. 537 , the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Investment Act of 2009, would have amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that the volume cap for private activity bonds would not apply to bonds for water supply or wastewater facilities. The purposes of this bill included providing alternative financing for water infrastructure investments and promoting the federal partnership with state and local governments.", "In the face of uncertainty over increased federal assistance for water infrastructure, EPA, states, communities, and utilities have been examining alternative management and financing strategies to address SDWA compliance costs and broader infrastructure maintenance and repair costs. Such strategies include establishing public-private partnerships (privatization options range from contracting for services to selling system assets), improving asset management, and adopting full-cost pricing for water services.

Many small systems face challenges in complying with SDWA rules and, more fundamentally, in ensuring the quality of water supplies. Major problems include deteriorated infrastructure, lack of access to capital, limited customer and rate base, inadequate rates, diseconomies of scale, and limited managerial and technical capabilities. Because of these same characteristics, the DWSRF program has not been as successful for small systems, compared to larger systems. Although these systems serve just 9% of the population served by community water systems, the sheer number of small systems has created challenges for policymakers and regulators.", "In the earliest SDWA debates, Congress recognized that setting standards based on technologies affordable for large cities could pose problems for small systems. During the reauthorization debate leading up to the 1996 amendments, policymakers gave considerable attention to the question of how to help small systems improve their capacity to comply with SDWA mandates. The 1996 amendments added provisions aimed at achieving this goal, including a requirement that states establish strategies to help systems develop and maintain the technical, financial, and managerial capacity to meet SDWA regulations. Congress also revised provisions on standard-setting (\u00a71412(b)), variances (\u00a71415(e)), and exemptions (\u00a71416) to increase consideration of small system concerns."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["The act's exemption provisions are intended to provide compliance flexibility in certain cases. States or EPA may grant temporary exemptions from a standard if, due to certain compelling factors (including cost), a system cannot comply on time. For example, all systems are required to comply with the new arsenic standard five years after its promulgation date. An exemption would allow three more years for qualified systems. Small systems (serving 3,300 persons or fewer) may be eligible for up to three additional two-year extensions, for a total exemption duration of nine years (and for a total of up to 14 years to achieve compliance). In the preamble to the arsenic rule published in January 2001, EPA noted that exemptions will be an important tool to help states address the number of systems needing financial assistance to comply with this rule and other SDWA rules (66 Federal Register 6988).", "However, to grant an exemption, the law requires a state to hold a public hearing and make a finding that the extension will not result in an \"unreasonable risk to health.\" Because of the administrative burden to the states and uncertainty as to what constitutes an \"unreasonable risk to health,\" the act's exemption authority has seldom been used. Approximately 13 states had indicated that they would likely use the exemption process for the arsenic rule, but it appears that many states have not exercised this option."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small System Variances and Affordability", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to exemptions, variances offer a more permanent form of compliance flexibility for small systems. Since 1996, SDWA has required EPA, when issuing a regulation, to identify technologies that meet the standard and that are affordable for systems that serve populations of 10,000 or fewer. If EPA does not identify affordable \"compliance\" technologies, then the agency must identify small system \"variance\" technologies. A variance technology need not meet the standard, but must protect public health. States may grant variances to systems serving 3,300 persons or fewer if a system cannot afford to comply with a rule (through treatment, an alternative source of water, or other restructuring) and if the system installs a variance technology. With EPA approval, states also may grant variances to systems serving between 3,300 and 10,000 people. (Regulations addressing microbial contaminants are not eligible for variances under the statute.)", "In 1998, EPA published affordability criteria to establish guidelines for determining whether a regulation is deemed affordable for small systems, and whether small system variances would be available. Under the criteria, EPA evaluates the affordability of a regulation by determining whether the compliance cost would raise the total water cost above 2.5% of annual median household income (MHI) in the three categories of small systems. Using this approach, EPA has determined that affordable compliance technologies are available for every drinking water regulation. Consequently, the agency has not identified any small system variance technologies, and thus, no small system variances are available.", "Several recent regulations (such as the revised arsenic and radium standards and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule) have heightened concern, particularly among rural communities, that EPA has not used the tools Congress provided to help small systems comply with SDWA regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Affordability Criteria Review", "paragraphs": ["Prompted by debate over the revised arsenic standard and its potential cost to small communities, the conference report for EPA's FY2002 appropriations ( H.Rept. 107-272 ) directed EPA to review its affordability criteria and how small system variance programs should be implemented for the arsenic rule. EPA began the review and sought the advice of the EPA's National Drinking Water Advisory Council (NDWAC) and Science Advisory Board (SAB).", "The NDWAC considered recommendations from its affordability work group and reported to EPA in 2003. The council acknowledged the statutory basis for small system variances and recommended changes, but cautioned that \"significant practical, logistical, and ethical issues mitigate against the use of variances.\" The National Rural Water Association, a member of the NDWAC work group, dissented and issued a separate report urging EPA to adopt a safe and affordable variance approach that would make variances available to small communities, as authorized by Congress. The Science Advisory Board concluded that EPA's basic approach was justified on the basis of equity, efficiency and administrative practicality, but recommended ways to improve the criteria. The SAB suggested that EPA consider lowering its affordability threshold, noting that \"the national affordability threshold has never been exceeded, but some small water systems appear to have genuinely struggled with costs, suggesting that the 2.5% rule is too high.\" The SAB also encouraged EPA to develop clear guidelines about when variances should be granted, and recommended that EPA consider measures other than median income to better capture impacts on disadvantaged households.", "In 2006, EPA proposed three options for revising its affordability criteria for determining whether a compliance technology is unaffordable for small systems (71 Federal Register 10671). EPA currently assumes that treatment technology costs are affordable to the average household if they do not cause median annual water bills to exceed about $1,000 (this threshold is calculated by taking 2.5% of median household income among small systems). Based on this approach, EPA has determined that affordable technologies are available for all standards. The three options EPA has proposed to replace this affordability threshold are well below that level: 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75%. EPA also requested comment on whether the agency should evaluate affordability strictly on a national level, or use a two-step process that would include evaluations of affordability first at the national level and then at the county level. A county level analysis would be performed only when a standard was found to be affordable at the national level. The revised criteria are further intended to address the issue of how to ensure that a variance technology would be protective of public health\u2014an issue that has historically hampered the use of variances.", "EPA has evaluated comments on the proposed revisions, and noted its intention to apply the revised criteria only to future rules. States could use the criteria to grant small-system variances, on a case-by-case basis, when systems cannot afford to comply with a standard. However, if these variances do become available, it is not clear how often they might be used. A key issue is that variances allow systems to provide lower-quality water in lower-income communities, and this could raise issues for states, communities, and consumers.", "In its 2010 budget, the agency committed to work with state and local governments to provide \"equitable consideration of small system customers.\" To accomplish this, EPA is reviewing various drinking water policies, including the use of small system variances, the existing variance determination methodology, the small water system capacity development strategy, and the DWSRF program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small System Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Repeatedly over the past decade and again in the 111 th Congress, bills were offered to help small water systems comply with federal drinking water regulations.

These formations include the Marcellus shale, which underlies large parts of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. The U.S. Geological Survey recently noted that, while the extraction technology for this gas resource has advanced in recent years, \"the knowledge of how this extraction might affect water resources has not kept pace.\"", "The gas industry, and many states, argue that state regulations are adequate and more appropriate than federal regulation.
