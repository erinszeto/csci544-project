The question with each extender, then, is whether there is a market failure or socially desirable goal that makes the incentive's intervention in the market desirable.

They concern policymakers because of their corrosive effect on tax equity and popular perceptions about the tax system's fairness. In popular usage, the term \"tax shelter\" denotes the use of tax deductions or credits produced by one activity to reduce taxes on another: the first activity \"shelters\" the second from tax. In economic terms, a tax shelter can be defined as a transaction (for example, an investment or sale) that reduces taxes without resulting in a reduced return or increased risk for the participant. But the term is so vague and general in most usages that it is sometimes defined simply as a tax-saving activity that is viewed as undesirable by the observer using the term.

Taxes can, however, alter the extent to which firms engage in overseas operations rather than domestic investment. Under current law, a tax benefit known as \"deferral\" poses an incentive for U.S. firms to invest overseas in countries with relatively low tax rates. Deferral provides its benefit by permitting U.S. firms to postpone their U.S. tax on foreign income as long as that income is reinvested abroad in foreign subsidiaries. The benefit is generally available for active business operations abroad, but the tax code's Subpart F provisions restrict deferral in the case of income from passive investment. If made, proposals to restrict deferral may consist of expansion of the range of income subject to Subpart F.", "In recent years, however, the thrust of legislation has been more in the direction of expanding deferral and cutting taxes for overseas operations. For example, the AJCA cut taxes on overseas operations in several ways, while in 2006, TIPRA restricted Subpart F in the case of banking and related businesses receiving \"active financing\" income and in the case of the \"look through\" treatment overseas operations receive from subsidiary firms. Further, several analysts have argued that attempts to tax overseas operations are either counterproductive or outmoded in the modern integrated world economy.
