About four million tons (as many as 400 truckloads a day) have been shipped annually since 2004, according to receiving states. Nearly three-quarters of this waste has gone to two large landfills near Detroit.", "The influx of waste has been highly controversial, in part because the ability of state and local governments to restrict it is limited. Under court rulings concerning the U.S. Constitution's Commerce Clause, only Congress can authorize restrictions that discriminate against foreign waste. Thus, for several years, the state of Michigan and the Michigan congressional delegation have pressed Congress for action. Legislation to provide limited authority to restrict waste imports, H.R. 518, was introduced early in the 110th Congress by Representative Dingell, with the co-sponsorship of the entire Michigan delegation. The bill was reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee March 29, and passed the House, by voice vote, April 24, 2007.", "Congress began to focus on this issue in the summer of 2006. In July of that year, in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill (H.R. 5441), the Senate approved the establishment of an inspection program for waste imports that might have added more than $400 in fees to the cost of importing a truckload of waste. In early September, the House passed legislation similar to H.R. 518 (H.R. 2491 in the 109th Congress), which would have given states limited authority to restrict waste imports. In between these actions, an agreement was reached between Michigan's two Senators and the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, under which Ontario will eliminate shipments of municipally managed waste to Michigan by the end of 2010.", "The steps taken by Congress in beginning to move legislation, as well as separate legislation enacted by the state of Michigan, clearly played a role in bringing about the voluntary agreement between Michigan's two Senators and Ontario. But large issues remain. The agreement is not a treaty or an international agreement, so it does not formally bind the United States or Canada or the parties shipping and receiving the waste. Assuming that its provisions are adhered to by Ontario's waste managers, it still would not address two-thirds of the waste being shipped to Michigan (i.e., the waste being managed by private waste management firms), and it would not affect waste shipments to states other than Michigan.", "This report provides background information on the history of Canadian waste imports, reviews congressional developments, and discusses issues raised by the voluntary agreement and legislation."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Canada and the United States have open borders for waste shipments, and waste has flowed across the border in both directions for years. The federal government does not report data regarding such shipments, but information is available from Environment Canada, the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, and from some U.S. states. According to these sources, the United States appears to be a net exporter to Canada of hazardous waste; but, because of plentiful landfill capacity, low-cost disposal options, and existing contractual arrangements, the United States is a much larger net importer from Canada of non -hazardous solid waste. The latter category can include municipal solid waste (MSW), construction and demolition (C&D) waste, medical waste, and non-hazardous industrial waste."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "U.S. Canada Bilateral Agreement", "paragraphs": ["Under a 1986 agreement between the United States and Canada, shipments of hazardous waste require notification to the importing country and that country's consent before waste may be shipped.

The receiving country is given 30 days from the date it receives notice to indicate its consent (conditional or not) or its objection to the shipment. If no response is received within the 30-day period, the importing country is considered to have no objection. Consent is not irrevocable: whether express, tacit, or conditional, the importing country's consent may be withdrawn or modified for good cause.", "The bilateral hazardous waste agreement was amended in 1992 to establish similar requirements for municipal solid waste, but, for lack of legislative authority, the amendment was never implemented. It is these unregulated shipments of non-hazardous waste, principally municipal solid waste, that have proven controversial.", "Lacking notification or consent requirements for MSW, many state governments do require the operators of solid waste management facilities to report the origin of waste they have received for disposal after the fact, on a quarterly or an annual basis.

Using these sources, CRS has from time to time compiled the existing state data, in an attempt to provide comprehensive and comparable estimates. Our latest survey, published in June 2007, indicated that Michigan received 3,781,171 tons of municipal solid waste from Ontario in FY2005 (October 2004-September 2005). New York, the second largest recipient, received 195,228 tons from Ontario in calendar year 2005. The only other recipient we identified was the state of Washington, which received 101,834 tons from the Canadian province of British Columbia in 2005. The proportions are consistent with amounts reported in earlier years. Thus, it appears that more than 90% of the solid waste that Canada ships to the United States has gone to Michigan. The remainder has generally gone to the states of New York and Washington.", "While somewhat controversial throughout the 1990s, Canadian waste imports have received much greater attention since late 2002, when the city of Toronto\u2014Canada's largest city\u2014announced that it would close its last landfill and begin shipping all of its waste to Michigan. Canada's shipments of waste to Michigan increased 83% between then and fiscal year 2006. In FY2006, Michigan reported that it received 12,084,907 cubic yards (an estimated 4.03 million tons) of non-hazardous waste from Canada. Canada accounted for 19.5% of all the waste disposed in Michigan landfills in that year.

Accompanying materials from the Ministry of the Environment, however, note that in 2005, \"4 million tonnes of waste were exported to the U.S., with 90% of this waste being sent to Michigan landfills.\" Thus, Ontario's commitment appears to cover only one-third of the waste shipped from the province to the United States, or 37% of the waste it shipped to Michigan.", "The reason for excluding the majority of the waste is that it is not \"municipally managed\"\u2014it is waste collected by private haulers and shipped to Michigan landfills under private contracts. These wastes are shipped to Michigan either because it provides lower cost disposal options or because the landfills in Michigan are controlled by the same company that collects the waste in Canada. The provincial government and the local governments within the province have no authority to prevent these private waste shipments from leaving Ontario. Thus, the province has committed to eliminate what it can, i.e., that portion of the waste that is municipally managed.", "Second, the exchange of letters addresses the shipment of these wastes to Michigan, but not to other U.S. states.

It is not a treaty or an international agreement and does not provide the enforcement provisions or penalties that legislation might offer.", "To summarize, those who continue to be concerned about Canadian waste shipments are likely to note that the exchange of letters does not address two-thirds of the waste being shipped, does not protect states other than Michigan, and contains no enforcement provisions.

It is not clear how these obligations and the bill's grant of authority to the states to restrict waste imports would ultimately be reconciled.
