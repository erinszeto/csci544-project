Domestic and national security information is provided through agency reportsand direct communications from department heads, but lawmakers also receive information directlyfrom employees within the agencies. They take the initiative in notifying Congress, its committees,and Members of Congress about alleged agency illegalities, corruption, and waste within the agency. This type of information comes from a group known as whistleblowers.", "Through such techniques as \"gag orders\" and nondisclosure agreements, Presidents haveattempted to block agency employees from coming directly to Congress. In response, Congress hasenacted legislation in an effort to assure the uninterrupted flow of domestic and national securityinformation to lawmakers and their staffs. Members of Congress have made it clear they do not wantto depend solely on information provided by agency heads. Overall, the issue has been how toprotect employees who are willing to alert Congress about agency wrongdoing.", "The first procedures enacted to protect agency whistleblowers appeared in the Civil ServiceReform of 1978. It also contained language that excluded protections to whistleblowers who workin federal agencies involved in intelligence and counterintelligence. In 1989, Congress passed theWhistleblower Protection Act in an effort to strengthen statutory protections for federal employeeswho assist in the elimination of fraud, waste, abuse, illegality, and corruption. That statute continuedthe exemption for national security information. It did not authorize the disclosure of anyinformation by an agency or any person that is (1) specifically prohibited from disclosure by anyother provision of law, or (2) \"specifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in theinterest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.\"", "Several statutes apply expressly to national security information. Congress has passed aseries of laws known collectively as the Military Whistleblowers Protection Act, under whichmembers of the military may give information to Members of Congress. It also passed theIntelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 to encourage the reporting toCongress of wrongdoing within the intelligence agencies. In crafting this legislation, Congress hassought to balance its need for information with national security requirements, giving intelligencecommunity whistleblowers access to Congress only through the intelligence committees.

(2) On the other hand, exposingcorruption can result in their being fired, transferred, reprimanded, denied promotion, or harassed. In 1978, a Senate panel found that the fear of reprisal \"renders intra-agency communications a sham,and compromises not only the employee, management, and the Code of Ethics, but also theConstitutional function of congressional oversight itself.\" (3) ", "Enacting statutory rights for whistleblowers and establishing new executive agencies toprotect those rights has not produced the protections that some expected.

National security whistleblowers wereexempted from the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. Some protections are available in statutes passed in recent years, including the IntelligenceCommunity Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998. Individual Members and congressionalcommittees have attempted to provide long-term protections to whistleblowers, enabling them toprovide the kinds of agency information that Congress wants without costs and injuries to theirgovernment careers.", "The purpose of this report is to explore the statutory and political protections available tonational security whistleblowers. First, an examination of the Civil Service Reform Act and theWhistleblower Protection Act will explain why national security whistleblowers were excluded fromthe protections provided in those statutes. Second, to the extent that those statutes are consideredmodels to protect national security whistleblowers, the experience of the Office of Special Counsel,the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Federal Circuit is relevant in evaluating protections fornational security whistleblowers. ", "Whistleblower activity is often viewed as a struggle between the executive and legislativebranches. Presidents may decide to centralize control of agency information by requiring the agencyhead to approve the release of any information. Members of Congress regularly express a need toobtain information from employees within the agency, without seeking the approval of the agencyhead. This conflict between the branches is seen in the issuance of executive orders by PresidentsTheodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft in 1902 and 1909 and the resulting legislation -- theLloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912 -- adopted by Congress to maintain access to agency information.
