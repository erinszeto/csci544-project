The McKinney-Vento definition largely considers someone to be homeless if they are living in a shelter, are sleeping in a place not meant to be used as a sleeping accommodation (such as on the street or in an abandoned building), or will imminently lose their housing. Definitions for several other programs, such as the Department of Education (ED), are broader, and may consider someone living in a precarious or temporary housing situation to be homeless.", "Programs that serve people experiencing homelessness include the Education for Homeless Children and Youths program administered by ED and the Emergency Food and Shelter program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) program run by DHS.

The Department of Justice administers a transitional housing program for victims of domestic violence.", "HUD administers the Homeless Assistance Grants, made up of grant programs that provide housing and services for homeless individuals ranging from emergency shelter to permanent housing. The VA operates numerous programs that serve homeless veterans. These include Health Care for Homeless Veterans, Supportive Services for Veteran Families, and the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program, as well as a collaborative program with HUD called HUD-VASH, through which homeless veterans receive Section 8 vouchers from HUD and supportive services through the VA. The Department of Labor also operates a program for homeless veterans, the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program.", "The federal government, through the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, has established a goal of ending homelessness among various populations, including families, youth, chronically homeless individuals, and veterans (the VA also has its own goal of ending veteran homelessness). Point-in-time counts of those experiencing homelessness in 2017 show overall reductions among homeless people, as well as reductions among chronically homeless individuals, people in families, and veterans compared to recent years.

The EFS program was and continues to be administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide emergency food and shelter to needy individuals.", "In 1987, Congress enacted the Stewart B.

Throughout the early and middle part of the 20 th century, homelessness was typified by \"skid rows\": areas with hotels and single-room occupancy dwellings where transient single men lived. Skid rows were usually removed from the more populated areas of cities, and it was uncommon for individuals to actually live on the streets. Beginning in the 1970s, however, the homeless population began to grow and become more visible to the general public. According to studies from the time, homeless persons were no longer almost exclusively single men, but included women with children; their median age was younger; they were more racially diverse (in previous decades, the observed homeless population was largely white); they were less likely to be employed (and therefore had lower incomes); they were mentally ill in higher proportions than previously; and individuals who were abusing or had abused drugs began to become more prevalent in the population.", "A number of reasons have been offered for the growth in the number of homeless persons and their increasing visibility. Many cities demolished skid rows to make way for urban development, leaving some residents without affordable housing options. Other possible factors contributing to homelessness include the decreased availability of affordable housing generally, the reduced need for seasonal unskilled labor, the reduced likelihood that relatives will accommodate homeless family members, the decreased value of public benefits, and changed admissions standards at mental hospitals. The increased visibility of homeless people was due, in part, to the decriminalization of actions such as public drunkenness, loitering, and vagrancy.", "In the 1980s, Congress first responded to the growing prevalence of homelessness with several separate grant programs designed to address the food and shelter needs of homeless individuals. These programs included the Emergency Food and Shelter Program ( P.L. 98-8 ), the Emergency Shelter Grants Program ( P.L. 99-591 ), and the Transitional Housing Demonstration Program ( P.L. 99-591 ). In 1983, a Federal Interagency Task Force on Food and Shelter for the Homeless was created to coordinate the federal response to homelessness. Among its activities was making vacant federal properties available as shelters. ", "Congress began to consider comprehensive legislation to address homelessness in 1986. On June 26, 1986, H.R. 5140 and S. 2608 were introduced as the Homeless Persons' Survival Act to provide an aid package for homeless persons. No further action was taken on either measure, however. Later that same year, legislation containing Title I of the Homeless Persons' Survival Act\u2014emergency relief provisions for shelter, food, mobile health care, and transitional housing\u2014was introduced as the Urgent Relief for the Homeless Act ( H.R. 5710 ). The legislation passed both houses of Congress in 1987 with large bipartisan majorities. The act was renamed the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act after the death of its chief sponsor, Stewart B. McKinney of Connecticut; it was renamed again on October 30, 2000, as the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act after the death of another prominent sponsor, Bruce F. Vento of Minnesota. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed the act into law ( P.L. 100-77 ).", "The original version of the McKinney-Vento Act consisted of 15 programs either created or reauthorized by the act, providing an array of services for homeless persons and administered by various federal agencies. The act also established the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, which is designed to provide guidance on the federal response to homelessness through the coordination of the efforts of multiple federal agencies covered under the McKinney-Vento Act. Since the enactment of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, there have been some legislative changes to programs and services provided under the act and new programs that target homeless individuals have been created.

The HEARTH Act broadened the McKinney-Vento Section 103 definition and moved the definition away from the requirement for literal homelessness. On December 5, 2011, HUD released regulations that clarify some of the changes. The changes are as follows:", "Amendments to Original McKinney-Vento Act Language: The HEARTH Act made minor changes to the existing language in the McKinney-Vento Act. The law continues to provide that a person is homeless if they lack \"a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence,\" and if their nighttime residence is a place not meant for human habitation, if they live in a shelter, or if they are a person leaving an institution who had been homeless prior to being institutionalized. The HEARTH Act added that those living in hotels or motels paid for by a government entity or charitable organization are considered homeless, and it included all those persons living in transitional housing, not just those residing in transitional housing for the mentally ill as in prior law. The amended law also added circumstances that are not considered suitable places for people to sleep, including cars, parks, abandoned buildings, bus or train stations, airports, and campgrounds. When HUD issued its final regulation in 2011, it clarified that a person exiting an institution cannot have been residing there for more than 90 days and be considered homeless. In addition, where the law states that a person \"who resided in a shelter or place not meant for human habitation\" prior to institutionalization, the \"shelter\" means emergency shelter and does not include transitional housing. Imminent Loss of Housing: P.L. 111-22 added to the Section 103 definition those individuals and families who meet all of the following criteria: They will \"imminently lose their housing,\" whether it be their own housing, housing they are sharing with others, or a hotel or motel not paid for by a government or charitable entity. Imminent loss of housing is evidenced by an eviction requiring an individual or family to leave their housing within 14 days; a lack of resources that would allow an individual or family to remain in a hotel or motel for more than 14 days; or credible evidence that an individual or family would not be able to stay with another homeowner or renter for more than 14 days. They have no subsequent residence identified. They lack the resources or support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing. HUD practice prior to passage of the HEARTH Act was to consider those individuals and families who would imminently lose housing within seven days to be homeless. Other Federal Definitions: P.L. 111-22 added to the definition of \"homeless individual\" unaccompanied youth and homeless families with children who are defined as homeless under other federal statutes. The law did not define the term youth, so in its final regulations HUD defined a youth as someone under the age of 25. In addition, the HEARTH Act did not specify which other federal statutes would be included in defining homeless families with children and unaccompanied youth. So in its regulations, HUD listed seven federal programs as those under which youth or families with children can be defined as homeless: the Runaway and Homeless Youth program; Head Start; the Violence Against Women Act; the Health Care for the Homeless program; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program; and the McKinney-Vento Education for Children and Youths program. Five of these seven programs (all but Runaway and Homeless Youth and Health Care for the Homeless programs) either share the Education for Homeless Children and Youths definition, or use a similar definition. Youth and families who are defined as homeless under another federal program must meet each of the following criteria: They have experienced a long-term period without living independently in permanent housing. In its final regulation, HUD defined \"long-term period\" to mean at least 60 days. They have experienced instability as evidenced by frequent moves during this long-term period, defined by HUD to mean at least two moves during the 60 days prior to applying for assistance. The youth or families with children can be expected to continue in unstable housing due to factors such as chronic disabilities, chronic physical health or mental health conditions, substance addiction, histories of domestic violence or childhood abuse, the presence of a child or youth with a disability, or multiple barriers to employment. Under the final regulation, barriers to employment may include the lack of a high school degree, illiteracy, lack of English proficiency, a history of incarceration, or a history of unstable employment. Communities are limited to using not more than 10% of Continuum of Care (CoC) program funds to serve families with children and youth defined as homeless under other federal statutes. The 10% limitation does not apply if the community has a rate of homelessness less than one-tenth of 1% of the total population. Domestic Violence: Another change to the definition of homeless individual is that the HEARTH Act amendment considers homeless anyone who is fleeing a situation of \"domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions in the individual's or family's current housing situation, including where the health and safety of children are jeopardized.\" The law also provides that an individual must lack the resources or support network to find another housing situation.

The plan included four recommendations: developing local, data-driven plans to address homelessness; using mainstream programs (such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Section 8, and Supplemental Security Income) to prevent homelessness; employing a housing first strategy to assist most people who find themselves homeless; and developing a national infrastructure of housing, income, and service supports for low-income families and individuals. ", "While the idea of ending homelessness for all people was embraced by many groups, the George W. Bush Administration and federal government focused on ending homelessness among chronically homeless individuals specifically. Initially, the term \"chronically homeless\" only included single, unaccompanied individuals. The term was defined as \"an unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition who has been continually homeless for a year or more, or has had at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years.\" The HEARTH Act updated the definition to include families with a head of household who has a disability.", "In the year following the release of the NAEH report, then-HUD Secretary Martinez announced HUD's commitment to ending chronic homelessness at the NAEH annual conference. In 2002, as a part of his FY2003 budget, President Bush made \"ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective.\" The bipartisan, congressionally mandated Millennial Housing Commission, in its Report to Congress in 2002, included ending chronic homelessness in 10 years among its principal recommendations. And, by 2003, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) had been re-engaged after six years of inactivity and was charged with pursuing the President's 10-year plan. For the balance of the decade, multiple federal initiatives focused funding and efforts on this goal.", "However, the initiative to end chronic homelessness raised some concerns among advocates for homeless people that allocating resources largely to chronically homeless individuals is done at the expense of families with children who are homeless, homeless youth, and other vulnerable populations. When it was enacted in 2009, the HEARTH Act mandated that the USICH draft a Federal Strategic Plan to End Homelessness among all groups (families with children, unaccompanied youth, veterans, and chronically homeless individuals) within a year of the law's enactment, and to update the plan annually.

(For more information about research surrounding chronic homelessness and permanent supportive housing, see CRS Report R44302, Chronic Homelessness: Background, Research, and Outcomes .)", "Permanent supportive housing is generally seen as a solution to ending chronic homelessness. It consists of housing, paired with social services, available to low-income and/or homeless households. Services can include case management, substance abuse counseling, mental health services, income management and support, and life skills services. A model of permanent supportive housing called \"housing first\" offers homeless individuals with addictions and mental health issues immediate access to housing even if they have not participated in treatment. Instead, the housing first model offers counseling and treatment services to clients on a voluntary basis rather than requiring sobriety or adherence to psychiatric medication treatment. It also stresses the importance of resident choice about where to live and the type and intensity of services, with services structured to fit individual resident needs. In the late 1990s, research began to show that finding housing for homeless individuals with severe mental illnesses meant that they were less likely to be housed temporarily in public accommodations, such as hospitals, jails, or prisons. Based on the research, service providers and HUD began to devote resources to housing first initiatives.", "The Administration undertook several projects to reach its goal of ending chronic homelessness within 10 years, each of which took place during the mid-2000s. These included (1) a collaboration among HUD, HHS, and VA (the Collaborative Initiative to Help End Chronic Homelessness ) that funded housing and treatment for chronically homeless individuals; (2) a HUD and DOL project called Ending Chronic Homelessness through Employment and Housing , through which HUD funded permanent supportive housing and DOL offered employment assistance; and (3) a HUD pilot program called Housing for People Who Are Homeless and Addicted to Alcohol that provided supportive housing for chronically homeless persons.", "In addition, since FY2005, HUD has encouraged the development of housing for chronically homeless individuals in the way that it distributes the Homeless Assistance Grants to applicants through its annual grant competition. For example, HUD has set aside additional funding for projects that serve those experiencing chronic homelessness. In addition, HUD's Continuum of Care program requires that at least 30% of funds (not including those for permanent housing renewal contracts) are to be used to provide permanent supportive housing to individuals with disabilities or families with an adult head of household (or youth in the absence of an adult) who has a disability. While homeless people with disabilities need not have been homeless for the duration required for chronic homelessness, there is overlap in the populations. The requirement for permanent supportive housing is to be reduced proportionately as communities increase permanent housing units for those individuals and families, and it will end when HUD determines that a total of 150,000 permanent housing units have been provided for homeless persons with disabilities since 2001.
