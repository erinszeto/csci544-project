Of these funds, about $43.164 billion were appropriated for existing education programs, including Title I-A, Education for the Disadvantaged, authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part B Grants to States. Most of the funds for existing elementary education programs have been appropriated for programs that provide formula grants directly to states or local educational agencies (LEAs), while most funds at the postsecondary level were appropriated for Pell Grants, which go directly to students. For some programs, these appropriations provide a substantial increase over the amount of funding provided through the regular appropriations process in recent years.

At the postsecondary level, the ARRA provides $15.640 billion for Pell Grants, while the program received $14.215 billion in FY2008 and $17.288 billion in FY2009.

For FY2008, the program received an annual appropriation of $13.9 billion. Portions of each annual appropriation for Title I-A are allocated under four different formulas\u2014Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIG)\u2014although funds allocated under all of these formulas are combined and used for the same purposes by recipient LEAs. Although the allocation formulas have several distinctive elements, the primary factors used in all four formulas are estimated numbers of children aged 5-17 in poor families plus a state expenditure factor based on average expenditures per pupil for public K-12 education. Other factors included in one or more formulas include weighting schemes designed to increase aid to LEAs with the highest concentrations of poverty, and a factor to increase grants to states with high levels of expenditure equity among their LEAs.", "Under three of the formulas\u2014Basic, Concentration, and Targeted Grants\u2014funds are calculated initially at the LEA level, and state total grants are the total of allocations for LEAs in the state, adjusted to apply state minimum grant provisions. Under the fourth formula, Education Finance Incentive Grants, grants are first calculated for each state overall, with state totals subsequently suballocated by LEA using a different formula. A primary rationale for using four different formulas to allocate shares of the funds for a single program is that the formulas have distinct allocation patterns, providing varying shares of allocated funds to different types of LEAs or states (e.g., LEAs with high poverty rates or states with comparatively equal levels of spending per pupil among their LEAs).", "The House and Senate bills would have provided $11 billion in supplemental appropriations for Title I-A Grants to LEAs.

Second, the Secretary must reserve $5 billion to provide State Incentive Grants and establish an Innovation Fund. ", "Assuming that each of these reservations are made at the maximum level, $48.318 billion will be available for grants to states. These funds will be allocated to states using two population measures: 61% of each state's grant will be based on the state's relative population of individuals ages 5 to 24, and 39% of each state's grant will be based on the state's relative total population. ", "Once funds are received at the state level, the state's governor must use 81.8% of the state's allocation to support elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education, and, as applicable, early childhood education programs and services. The governor must use these funds to provide the amount of funds, through the state's principal elementary and secondary education funding formula, needed to restore state funding for elementary and secondary education in FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011 through the formula to the greater of the FY2008 or FY2009 level, and, if applicable, to allow state formula increases to support elementary and secondary education for FY2010 and FY2011 to be implemented and to fund the phasing in of state equity and adequacy adjustments if these increases were enacted in state law prior to October 1, 2008. According to guidance published by ED on April 7, 2009, in providing funds through the state's funding formula, funds must be provided directly to LEAs. The governor is also required to use these funds to provide the amount of funds needed to restore state support for public IHEs (excluding tuition and fees paid by students) to the greater of FY2008 or FY2009 level for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011.", "If the amount of funds provided through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund is insufficient to restore state support for elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education to the greater of the FY2008 or FY2009 level, plus support formula increases and equity/adequacy adjustments, if applicable, for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011, the governor is required to allocate funds between elementary and secondary education and postsecondary education in proportion to the relative shortfall in state support at each level of education. If, however, funds remained after restoring state support for education, the governor is required to use the remainder of the 81.8% of the state allocation to provide grants to LEAs based on their share of Title I-A funding for the most recent year for which data are available.", "The governor is required to use the remaining 18.2% of the state allocation for \"public safety and other government services,\" which may include assistance for elementary and secondary education and public IHEs, and for modernization, renovation, and repair of public school facilities and IHEs' facilities. Funds used for the latter purposes may be, but are not required to be, consistent with a recognized green building rating system. If the governor chooses to use these funds for IHEs, the governor shall not consider type or mission of an IHE and shall consider any IHE in the state for facility modernization, renovation, or repair funding if the IHE meets the Higher Education Act (HEA), Section 101 definition of an IHE and is eligible to participate in the federal student aid programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA.", "The ARRA includes specific provisions related to the use of funds by LEAs and IHEs. Funds for elementary and secondary education can be used for any activity authorized under the ESEA, IDEA, the Adult and Family Literacy Act, or the Carl. D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins Act), or for the modernization, renovation, and repair of school facilities, including modernization, renovation, and repairs that are consistent with a recognized green building system. LEAs are prohibited from engaging in any school modernization, renovation, or repair that is inconsistent with state law. This language implicitly allows LEAs to use funds under the SFSF for an exceptionally wide array of activities and purposes. In particular, the ESEA includes the Impact Aid programs (Title VIII), under which funds can be used for any purpose or activity authorized under state and local law for LEAs. Through the Impact Aid program, funds are provided to LEAs to compensate them for the activities of the federal government, such as the education of children living on a military base.\u00a0 The federal government provides payments to LEAs to make up for this lost tax revenue. According to ED policy guidance: ", "School districts use Impact Aid for a wide variety of expenses, including the salaries of teachers and teacher aides; purchasing textbooks, computers, and other equipment; after school programs and remedial tutoring; advanced placement classes; and special enrichment programs. Most Impact Aid funds are considered general aid to the recipient school districts and may be used in whatever manner they choose, in accordance with state and local requirements. Although most school districts use Impact Aid for current expenditures, funds may also be used for capital expenditures.", "In guidance released April 1, 2009, ED explicitly states that LEAs may use funds provided through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for any purpose or activity authorized under the ESEA, including those authorized by the Impact Aid program. An LEA does not have to receive Impact Aid funds through the regular appropriations process to be able to use funds provided under the State Fiscal Stabilization Funds for these purposes. Thus, LEAs will be able to \u00a0use funds provided through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund for any purpose or activity authorized under state and local law , including new construction , except purposes specifically prohibited by the SFSF (such as those in the following paragraph) .\u00a0", "No funds may be used to provide financial assistance for pupils to attend private schools, except (according to H.Rept. 111-16 ) as authorized by ESEA, IDEA, the Adult and Family Literacy Act, or the Perkins Act. LEAs are prohibited from using State Fiscal Stabilization Funds for: (1) maintenance costs; (2) stadiums or other facilities used primarily for athletic contests or other exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public; (3) the purchase or upgrade of vehicles; or (4) the improvement of stand-alone facilities whose purpose is not the education of children.", "Public IHEs that receive State Fiscal Stabilization Funds must use the funds for: (1) education and general expenditures, and in such a way \"to mitigate the need to raise tuition and fees for in-State students,\" or (2) modernization, renovation, or repair of IHE facilities that are primarily used for instruction, research, or student housing, including modernization, renovation, or repairs that are consistent with a recognized green building rating system. It should be noted that these required uses of funds appear to apply only to public IHEs. Non-public IHEs meeting the aforementioned criteria may receive funds from the 18.2% of state funds available for public safety and other government services, so it is unclear how these IHEs may use any funds received. The ARRA includes several prohibitions on the use of funds by IHEs that apply to all IHEs. Funds may not be used to increase an IHE's endowment. In addition, funds may not be sued for: (1) the maintenance of systems, equipment, or facilities; (2) modernization, renovation, or repair of stadiums or other facilities primarily used for athletic contests or other exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public; or (3) modernization, renovation, or repair of facilities used for sectarian or religious instruction or in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are religious in nature.", "In applying for funds from the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, the ARRA requires states to submit an application to the Secretary that provides information required by the Secretary as well as five assurances (discussed below), baseline data demonstrating states' current status with respect to each of the five assurances, and a discussion of how the State Fiscal Stabilization Funds will be used, including whether the state will use funds to meet maintenance of effort requirements under ESEA and IDEA. The four assurances that the state must provide focus on state support for education, equity in teacher distribution, data collection, standards and assessments, and support for struggling schools. Each of the five assurances is discussed below.", "1. Maintenance of effort: The state must agree to maintain support for elementary and secondary education and for public institutions of higher education (not including support for capital projects or for research or development or tuition and fees paid by students) at least at the level of support provided in FY2006 for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. 2. Achieving equity in teacher distribution: The state must provide an assurance related to the equitable distribution of teachers between high- and low-poverty schools. The state must take actions to comply with requirements in ESEA, Section 1111(b)(8)(C) related to the provision of highly qualified teachers in schools receiving Title I-A funding to eliminate inequities in the distribution of teachers between high- and low-poverty schools and ensure that low-income and minority children are not taught at higher rates than other students by inexperienced, unqualified, or out-of field teachers. 3. Improving collection and use of data: The state is required to establish a longitudinal data system as described in Section 6401(e)(2)(D) of the America COMPETES Act. 4. Standards and assessments: The state must agree to enhance the quality of its state assessments used to measure student achievement in reading, mathematics, and science through activities described in ESEA, Section 6112(a), including collaborating with institutions of higher education or other organizations to improve the quality, validity, and reliability of state assessments. Second, the state must agree to comply with requirements in the ESEA and IDEA related to the inclusion of children with disabilities and limited English proficient students in state assessments, the development of valid and reliable assessments for those students, and the provision of accommodations to facilitate their participation in state assessments. Third, the state must agree to improve state academic content standards and student academic achievement standards consistent with requirements in the America COMPETES Act. The applicable requirements in the America COMPETES Act focus on identifying and making changes to a state's secondary school academic content and academic achievement standards in order to align these standards with the knowledge and skills necessary for success in credit-bearing postsecondary education coursework, the 21 st century workforce, and the Armed Forces without the need for remediation. 5. Supporting struggling schools: The state must ensure compliance with requirements related to schools identified for corrective actions and restructuring under ESEA Title I-A.", "As noted earlier, the ARRA requires the Secretary to reserve $5 billion to provide State Incentive Grants and, at his or her discretion, establish an Innovation Fund. The Secretary may reserve 1% of the funds not being used for Innovation Fund to provide technical assistance to states in meeting the aforementioned assurances. The remaining funds will be used to provide State Incentive Grants in FY2010 to states that have made \"significant progress\" in meeting last four assurances discussed above. By historical standards, this is an unusually large amount of funding to be allocated at the Secretary's discretion.", "In order to receive a State Incentive Grant, states must submit an application to the Secretary. The application must describe (1) the state's progress in meeting the last four assurances discussed above; (2) strategies the state is using to ensure that economically disadvantaged students, students from major racial and ethnic groups, students with disabilities, and students with limited English proficiency (hereafter referred to as subgroups of students) are making progress toward meeting state student academic achievement standards; (3) the achievement and graduation rates of public elementary and secondary education students and strategies being employed to ensure the aforementioned subgroups of students are making progress toward meeting state student academic achievement standards; (4) how the state would use its grant funding to improve student academic achievement; (5) and the state plan for evaluating state progress in closing achievement gaps. The Secretary will determine which states receive grants and the amount of those grants based on information provided in the state application and other such criteria determined by the Secretary, which may include a state's need for assistance in meeting the last four assurances discussed above. Each state that receives a State Incentive Grant must use at least 50% of the grant to provide subgrants to LEAs based on each LEAs relative share of funding under Title I-A for the most recent year.", "The Secretary is permitted to use up to $650 million of the $5 billion reserved for additional programs to establish an Innovation Fund. The Innovation Fund will be used to provide academic achievement awards to LEAs or partnerships between a nonprofit organization and one or more LEAs or a consortium of schools (hereafter referred to as eligible entities). To be eligible to receive an award, an eligible entity must: (1) have \"significantly closed\" the achievement gaps among the aforementioned subgroups of students and students overall; (2) have exceeded the state's annual measurable objectives for two or more consecutive years or demonstrated success in \"significantly\" increasing student achievement based on another measure; (3) have made \"significant improvement\" in other areas (e.g., graduation rates, recruitment of high-quality teachers) that can be demonstrated with \"meaningful\" data; and (4) demonstrate that they have established partnerships with the private sector and that the private sector is contributing matching funds to help bring \"results to scale.\" Funds received by eligible entities will be used to allow eligible entities to expand their work and serve as best practice models, work in partnership with the private sector and philanthropic community, and identify and document best practices that can be shared and replicated.", "States receiving funds under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund are required to submit a report to the Secretary based on a timetable established by the Secretary that discusses how funds were used, how funds were distributed, the estimated number of jobs saved or created using the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, tax increases that were averted, the state's progress in meeting the aforementioned assurances, increases in tuition and fees at public IHEs, changes in enrollment in public IHEs, and each modernization, renovation, and repair project funded. The Secretary is required to submit a report to the relevant authorizing and appropriating committees no later than six months following the submission of the state reports that evaluates the information contained in the state reports and the uses of funds that states included in their application for funds. In addition, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to evaluate the State Incentive Grants and Innovation Fund, if applicable, programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Accountability", "paragraphs": ["In its consideration of education-related provisions in economic stimulus funding proposals, some of the debate in Congress has centered on the extent to which states and LEAs should be given added flexibility with respect to certain fiscal accountability requirements that current statutes place on states and/or LEAs with respect to the use of federal education funds. A related issue is whether funds provided under the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund could be treated in some cases as \"non-federal\" funds in determining whether states and LEAs meet certain fiscal accountability requirements.", "A long-standing principle of federal aid to elementary and secondary education is that federal funding should add to, not substitute for, state and local education funding \u2013 i.e., that federal funds should provide a net increase in financial resources for specific types of educational services (such as the education of disadvantaged pupils or pupils with disabilities), rather than effectively providing general subsidies to state and local governments. All of the fiscal accountability requirements included in federal elementary and secondary education programs are intended to provide that all federal funds represent a net increase in the level of financial resources available to serve eligible pupils, and that they do not ultimately replace funds that states or LEAs would provide in the absence of federal aid.", "One or more of three types of fiscal accountability requirements are applicable to major federal K-12 education aid programs. The first two of these are common to many federal assistance programs, while the third is unique to ESEA Title I-A. To meet the first requirement, maintenance of effort (MOE) , recipient LEAs must provide, from state and local sources, a level of funding (either aggregate or per pupil) in the preceding year that is at least a specified percentage of the amount in the second preceding year. A second fiscal accountability requirement provides that federal funds must be used to supplement, and not supplant (SNS) , state and local funds that would otherwise be available for the education of pupils eligible to be served under the federal program in question. SNS provisions prohibit states and/or LEAs from using federal funds: (1) to provide services that state and/or local funds have provided or purchased in the past, (2) to provide services that are required to be provided under federal, state, or local law, or (3) to provide services for some pupils (e.g., those eligible under specific federal programs) that are provided to other pupils with non-federal funds.", "The third, distinctive, fiscal requirement under ESEA Title I-A is comparability \u2014services provided with state and local funds in schools participating in ESEA Title I-A must be comparable to those in non-Title I-A schools of the same LEA. (If all of an LEA's schools participate in Title I-A, then services funded from state and local revenues must be \"substantially comparable\" in each school of the LEA.) Since the comparability requirement only applies to ESEA Title I-A, and is not currently a subject of debate or proposed waiver authority with respect to the ARRA, it will not be discussed further in this report.", "With respect to current major federal K-12 education programs, for MOE , the requirement is that in order to be eligible to receive ESEA Title I-A grants, LEAs must spend, from state and local sources, in the preceding year an amount equal to at least 90% of the amount in the second preceding year, on either an aggregate or per pupil basis (whichever is more beneficial to the LEA). The ESEA provision is based on total state and local funding for public K-12 education, not funding for specific purposes. If the requirement is not met, the LEA still receives a grant that is reduced by the proportion to which the requirement is not met. The MOE requirement for Title I-A and other ESEA programs may be waived by the Secretary in cases of \"exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances\" or a \"precipitous decline in the financial resources\" (ESEA Section 9521).", "In the case of IDEA, MOE applies to both SEAs and LEAs, and in general is based on 100%, not 90%, of previous spending levels. However, the IDEA includes a provision allowing LEAs, and possibly some states, to reduce funding by an amount of up to 50% of annual increases in IDEA allocations, if these funds are used for specified purposes. In addition, the MOE provision under IDEA is based on spending for special education services for pupils with disabilities, not total state and local spending. As under the ESEA, if the MOE requirement is not met, the SEA or LEA still receives a grant that is reduced by the proportion to which the requirement is not met. In addition, the state MOE requirement under IDEA may be waived by the Secretary in cases of \"exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources of the State\" (IDEA, Section 612(a)(18)(C)(i)). Further, the state SNS requirements under IDEA may be waived only if \"the State provides clear and convincing evidence that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\" (FAPE) and the Secretary of Education concurs with this evidence (IDEA Section 612(a)(17)(C)). Beyond this, it might be argued that IDEA incorporates an effective MOE at the level of services to individual pupils, with its requirement that FAPE be provided to pupils with disabilities in participating states.", "In contrast to MOE, SNS is applied to both SEAs and LEAs under Title I-A, and there is generally no authority for the Secretary of Education to waive SNS under ESEA, and only a very restrictive authority to do so under IDEA, as it contingent upon the requirement in the previous sentence. Authority to waive SNS, as well as MOE, under ESEA programs was granted to areas affected by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes for FY2006 and 2007. In particular, the broad waiver authorities included in ESEA Title IX, Part D, and the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 ( P.L. 106-25 , as amended) specifically exempt all three fiscal accountability provisions from authority to be waived (beyond the specific MOE waiver authority noted above)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "P.L. 111-5", "paragraphs": ["The ARRA implicitly applies current statutory provisions regarding MOE and SNS to increased appropriations for ESEA Title I-A and the IDEA. For the State Fiscal Stabilization program, a MOE based on state-source revenues for public K-12 education and higher education in FY2006 would apply to states, but there is no SNS requirement at any level and no MOE requirement for LEAs with respect to funds provided under this program. The MOE requirement for the Fiscal Stabilization program could be waived or modified by the Secretary of Education for any of FY2009-FY2011 if the Secretary determines that the state receiving the waiver will not provide a lower percentage of the total funds available for elementary and secondary education than in the preceding fiscal year. ", "In addition, under the ARRA, states or LEAs may, with prior approval of the Secretary, treat State Fiscal Stabilization Fund grants used for education as \"non-federal funds\" for purposes of meeting MOE requirements under any ED program, including ESEA Title I-A and the IDEA, for FY2009, FY2010, or FY2011. In determining whether to provide approval to allow states and LEAs to use State Fiscal Stabilization Funds as non-federal funds to meet MOE requirements, ED has indicated that it will be \"concerned\" if a state has reduced the proportion of total state revenues that are spent on education. If this proportion has been reduced, the Secretary will consider whether the reductions were due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances, the extent to which available financial resources have declined, and whether there have been changes in the demand for services. ", "Required levels of state and local funding in subsequent years will not be reduced as a result of this provision. This might allow approved states to reduce their level of spending for K-12 education without jeopardizing their eligibility for funding under the IDEA or Title I-A and other ESEA programs.

After a measure is enacted, however, it is the responsibility of the executive branch (e.g., U.S. Department of Education) to develop allocations and implement the law.
