In contrast, the SPM's thresholds are based on consumer expenditures for food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, and it uses five years of data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey in calculating needs and thresholds. Developing the SPM thresholds starts with spending data for families with exactly two children. These data are refined by using approximately the 33rd percentile of families' expenditures on food, clothing, shelter, and utilities.

Work expenses, including child care, are capped at the amount of earnings from work of the lowest-earning family member.

These differences can be explained by the SPM's resource definition. The SPM includes tax credits and in-kind benefits that help families with children (in effect, boosting the measure of family income).

Additionally, the SPM does not directly value health insurance provided publicly or privately. Further, poverty has historically been measured in the United States as an \"absolute\" measure, based on how many people fall below a set standard of living.

This represents a disconnection between the way needs were specified in the thresholds (which represent a level of need) and the definition of resources available for meeting those needs. The official measure captures the effects of some but not all government programs intended to provide relief for the poor because the income used in the official measure is money income before taxes. The programs that are captured are those that provide money income benefits before taxes: Social Security, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and any state or local relief programs based on money income. The programs that are not captured are the EITC and the Child Tax Credit, which, despite their large effects for low-income workers with children, are not considered because they are tax credits and only reflected in after-tax income; and a host of noncash benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), housing subsidies, and subsidized medical care. Many of these programs did not exist when the official measure was developed in the 1960s. The official measure captures neither the needs incurred nor the resources brought in by household members who are not related by birth, marriage, or adoption. These include unmarried partners and their children (if any are present) and foster children not legally adopted. While the official measure is adjusted for overall inflation, it does not consider the extent to which the prices of basic necessities have shifted in relation to all goods and services.

Families' FCSU spending, moreover, is not held to be any fixed percentage of families' overall income (unlike the official measure, where the thresholds were fixed at three times the cost of food in the 1960s and updated for overall inflation since then). That means if FCSU spending grows as a portion of family income, the SPM thresholds will rise to reflect that spending, even if family income does not rise. Conversely, if family income rises, and a greater portion of family income was spent on goods other than FCSU, the SPM thresholds would reflect only the changes in FCSU spending. 3.

For the purposes of estimating benefits, the Census Bureau assumes 12 months of participation when the respondent reports having received them. This assumption may overestimate the value of benefits received. To compute the benefit amounts received, the Census Bureau refers to WIC program information from the USDA, and uses age information reported in the CPS ASEC to determine which household members receive benefits.

On one hand, poor health can affect people's quality of life, affect their ability to earn more income, and change their spending habits. Thus, it affects people's economic behavior, which, it can be argued, is relevant for measuring poverty. On the other hand, the causes of poor health are not always linked to monetary factors. Health issues are often caused by physical phenomena unrelated to economics, which can lead to the argument that health care should not be included in a poverty measure but rather considered as a separate indicator of well-being. Moreover, the choices about whether to be insured and what kind of insurance to purchase heavily influence levels of spending on health care, both for the healthy and the sick. At the same time, it seems incongruous to consider a person who is healthy (and who therefore does not need expensive health care) as poorer than a sick person who receives expensive health care but otherwise has the same resources as the healthy person. ", "To resolve this conundrum, the SPM does not include health expenses as part of the threshold\u2014as medical needs vary greatly and not always predictably. Instead, it subtracts MOOP from the resource definition, as those resources are considered to be necessary expenditures (if and when they are incurred) and are not available to be spent on the needs defined in the thresholds.

The SPM treats cohabiting unmarried couples and any children they may have as part of the same unit and assigns thresholds and computes family income accordingly. This is done to more accurately reflect the way that people within households incur expenses and share resources to meet them.

Over time, means-tested benefits paid in noncash forms or through the tax code have grown to account for most of what the federal government spends on low-income assistance. For example, in FY2015 the federal government spent $5.5 billion on veterans' pensions, $6.4 billion on TANF cash assistance, and $62.1 billion on Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These cash benefits are included in both the official poverty measure and the SPM.

While it was designed to be a universal program and not targeted specifically to the poor, it has a large antipoverty effect nevertheless. While most of those kept above poverty by Social Security were ages 65 and older (17.1 million), a substantial minority were younger: 7.5 million were age 18 to 64, and 1.5 million were children under age 18.

Of these, none individually have as large an impact on the estimated poor population as Social Security.

As a result, the profile of the poor population as identified by the SPM is different from that identified by the official poverty measure. Fewer children are identified as poor in the SPM because many government assistance programs, such as WIC, TANF, and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), are targeted toward families with children. Conversely, more working-age adults are in poverty in the SPM because they are more likely to have work expenses (including child care expenses). These expenses are partially offset by EITC, but only working families receive it. Working families with children could get ACTC, but they have to have qualifying children. Slightly more of the aged are below poverty under the SPM than under the official measure because they are more likely to incur MOOP, which are subtracted from income. While MOOP can be high for the aged, their effect on poverty rates is mitigated by the fact that homeowners without a mortgage (such as aged persons who have paid off their mortgages and still live in that house) have lower housing expenses\u2014and in turn lower poverty thresholds\u2014than do mortgage-paying homeowners and renters.

That is, barring illegal trading, they cannot be used to meet any expense that arises, but only the needs for which they are specified. While the FCSU amounts in the thresholds are based empirically on spending patterns, it should not be assumed that every family's needs are the same.

The SPM imputes taxes in the year they are earned, but in reality the credit will not appear in the family's income until the following year. Furthermore, tax credits are given as a lump sum, but poverty is a spell phenomenon. Both the SPM and the official poverty measure examine resources in a full calendar year compared with a threshold based on the calendar year. The economic status of families, however, can change throughout the year. A family may experience poverty because one or more workers in the family lost a job and months passed before the worker was able to find another one, putting the family in a poverty spell for that duration. The tax credit, therefore, may or may not provide relief during the poverty spell, depending on the spell's timing in the year and the severity of expenses faced by the family throughout the year.

A relative poverty measure is one in which poverty is defined with respect to some percentile of the income distribution (e.g., half of median income), while an absolute measure uses a fixed dollar cutoff updated for inflation over time. ", "Relative poverty measures keep pace with changes in the income distribution over time and identify the economically worst-off portion of the population, but they may not necessarily be tied to a particular level of well-being. Because relative poverty measures are based on the income distribution, it is possible for poverty to increase even when incomes throughout the distribution rise if the distribution of income becomes wider. This potential disconnection between the poverty rate and levels of well-being is considered to be a weakness of relative measures. ", "Absolute poverty measures are set to a fixed income amount representing a level of economic well-being at a point in time, adjusted periodically for inflation. They are consistent over time in representing the number of people below a resource level, and are more sensitive over time than relative measures to detecting the shares of the population unable to obtain this level, and presumably, economic well-being. ", "The SPM includes aspects of both relative and absolute measures in its computation, and gauging whether the SPM is closer to one or the other is an unresolved question. The SPM thresholds are based on roughly the 33 rd percentile of expenditures on FCSU, using the five most recent years of CE data. In this sense, the SPM can be thought of as relative because the thresholds are computed based on a percentile within the distribution of expenditures. On the other hand, the thresholds are not computed using overall income, but rather expenditures, and only for a limited set of basic goods (FCSU, plus 20% extra for miscellaneous expenses). It is theoretically possible for incomes to rise at a different rate than expenditures on basic goods, which if true would imply that the SPM is not a relative measure. Moreover, expenditures on FCSU are driven not only by income but also by prices, which can be affected by factors other than the income distribution. ", "The question of whether the SPM is relative or absolute has meaning for those trying to evaluate whether the SPM accurately describes the poor population both in a single year and over time. It also highlights the value judgments involved in determining what is meant by \"poverty\" and in expressing that determination using a concrete metric. In the case of the official poverty measure, the level of well-being is characterized by the likely nutritional impact of the Economy Food Plan, with fewer than 1 in 10 families on that plan meeting their recommended nutritional requirements, and about half of families on that plan failing to get two-thirds of them (see footnote 27 ).
