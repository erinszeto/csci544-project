The existenceof international terrorist groups and their supporters in South Asia is identified as a threat to bothregional stability and to the attainment of central U.S. policy goals. Al Qaeda forces that fled fromAfghanistan with their Taliban supporters remain active on Pakistani territory, and Al Qaeda isbelieved to have links with indigenous Pakistani terrorist groups that have conducted anti-Westernattacks and that support separatist militancy in Indian Kashmir. Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Ladenand his lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri, are widely believed to be in Pakistan. A significant portionof Pakistan's ethnic Pashtun population is reported to sympathize with the Taliban and even AlQaeda. The United States maintains close counterterrorism cooperation with Pakistan aimedespecially at bolstering security and stability in neighboring Afghanistan. In the latter half of 2003,the Islamabad government began limited military operations in the traditionally autonomous tribalareas of western Pakistan. Such operations have since intensified in coordination with U.S. andAfghan forces just across the international frontier.", "The relationships between international terrorists, indigenous Pakistani extremist groups, andsome elements of Pakistan's political-military structure are complex and murky, but may representa serious threat to the attainment of key U.S. policy goals. There are past indications that elementsof Pakistan's intelligence service and Pakistani Islamist political parties provided assistance toU.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). A pair of December 2003 attempts toassassinate Pakistan's President Musharraf reportedly were linked to Al Qaeda. Lethal, but failedattempts to assassinate other top Pakistani officials in summer 2004 also were linked to AlQaeda-allied groups. Security officers in Pakistan have enjoyed notable successes in breaking upsignificant Al Qaeda and related networks operating in Pakistani cities, although numerous wantedmilitants remain at large.", "The 9/11 Commission Report contains recommendations for U.S. policy toward Pakistan,emphasizing the importance of eliminating terrorist sanctuaries in western Pakistan and near theAfghanistan-Pakistan border and calling for provision of long-term and comprehensive support tothe government of President Musharraf so long as that government remains committed to combatingextremism and to a policy of \"enlightened moderation.\" Legislation passed by the 108th Congress( S. 2845 ) seeks to implement this and other Commission recommendations.", "The United States remains concerned by the continued \"cross-border infiltration\" of Islamicmilitants who traverse the Kashmiri Line of Control to engage in terrorist acts in India and IndianKashmir. India also is home to several indigenous separatist and Maoist-oriented terrorist groups. Moreover, it is thought that some Al Qaeda elements fled to Bangladesh. The Liberation Tigers ofTamil Eelam (LTTE) of Sri Lanka have been designated as an FTO under U.S. law, while Harakatul-Jihad-I-Islami/Bangladesh, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)/United Peoples Front,appear on the State Department's list of \"other terrorist groups.\""], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Recent Developments", "paragraphs": ["In early 2005, the United States began advertizing in mass-circulation Urdu-languagenewspapers and on radio and television stations in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province topromote a rewards program for wanted Al Qaeda suspects. In May, Al Qaeda fugitive Abu Farajal-Libbi, a Libyan native wanted in connection with lethal December 2003 attempts to assassinatePresident Musharraf, was captured in the northwestern Pakistani city of Mardan. Informationprovided by Libbi reportedly led to the arrest of six suspected Al Qaeda members, including twoArabs and four Pakistanis, and the targeted killing of an alleged Al Qaeda bomb expert near theAfghan border. Musharraf claimed that Pakistan had \"broken their [Al Qaeda's] back\" with recentarrests. Two months later, in the wake of deadly July bombings in Britain and Egypt, Musharrafagain declared that Al Qaeda's ability to operate in Pakistan had been destroyed. (7) Debate over the whereaboutsof fugitive Al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden continues to focus on the rugged Afghan-Pakistaniborder region: Pakistani officials generally insist there is no evidence that bin Laden is hiding there,but numerous U.S. officials have suggested otherwise. In June, Director of Central Intelligence Gossclaimed to have \"an excellent idea of where [bin Laden] is\" and suggested that \"sanctuaries insovereign states\" and \"our sense of international obligation\" present obstacles to his capture. (8) The Pakistani president hasissued contradictory statements on the topic.", "Efforts to kill or capture Al Qaeda and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan-Pakistanborder continue to bring mixed results. An apparently resurgent Taliban has suffered majorbattlefield losses in eastern and southern Afghanistan during the spring and summer of 2005, butU.S. and Afghan officials continue to claim that insurgents are able to cross into Afghanistan toattack U.S.-led forces before returning to Pakistan and, in June, Afghan officials were complainingof a \"steady stream of terrorists\" entering their country from Pakistan. The Afghan-Pakistani riftdeepened, spurring President Bush to make a personal call to Musharraf in an effort to smoothrelations between two key U.S. allies in the region. In July, Pakistan reported moving 4,000additional troops to the border region, bringing the total to some 80,000, and Prime Minister Azizvisited Kabul, where he vowed \"seamless cooperation\" with the Afghan government in fightingterrorism and Islamic extremism. Still, U.S. officials continue to urge Islamabad (and Kabul) to \"domore\" to end insurgent operations in the region and some reports indicate that Taliban recruiting andtraining continues to take place on Pakistani territory without government interference. (9) ", "Pakistan's western tribal regions continue to be the site of tensions and sporadic Islamicmilitant-related violence. Pakistani military operations in South Waziristan wound down in 2004. Late in that year, the regional Pakistani corps commander declared that \"peace has been restored inWana,\" the area where the bulk of combat had taken place. Attention has become focused on theNorth Waziristan district, where scores and possibly hundreds of \"unwanted foreigners\" have foundrefuge. The Islamabad government is using a carrot-and-stick approach, offering economic andinfrastructure development incentives to encourage cooperation from tribal chieftains whilethreatening use of force in those areas where militants are given haven. Yet cooperative triballeaders have come under lethal attack by militants and resistance to Islamabad's cooperation withU.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan remains widespread. On July 15, U.S. forces based in Afghanistanexchanged heavy weapons fire with militants just across the border in Pakistan, killing 24 of them. Thousands of Pakistani tribesmen later denounced the U.S. action and Pakistan told the United Statesthat border violations would not be tolerated. (10) ", "Pakistan continues to struggle with a virulent strain of belligerent Islamism that someanalysts say threatens the survival of the country. In December 2004, President Musharraf called his\"biggest fear\" the extremism, terrorism, and militancy that has \"really polluted society in Pakistan.\" He also conceded that some of Pakistan's religious schools are part of the problem: \"There are many[madrassas] which are involved in militancy and extremism.\" (11) Major sectarian bombattacks in May again raised questions about the ability of Pakistan's security forces to maintain orderin the country's urban centers (where, not incidentally, the great majority of top Al Qaeda fugitiveshave been found). Positive news did come with July announcements that the Islamabad governmentwould reinvigorate its efforts to curtail indigenous terrorism by detaining suspected militants,shuttering the offices of extremist groups, and regulating the activities of the country's thousands ofreligious schools, some of which are involved in the teaching of militancy.", "Pakistan-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation continues apace. In November 2004, thePentagon notified Congress of three possible major Foreign Military Sales to Pakistan involvingeight P-3C maritime reconnaissance aircraft, 2,000 TOW anti-armor missiles, and six Phalanx navalguns. The deals could be worth up to $1.2 billion for Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, the primecontractors. The Department of Defense characterized the P-3Cs and TOW missiles as havingsignificant anti-terrorism applications (a claim that elicited skepticism from some analysts), and itasserted that the proposed sales would not affect the military balance in the region. India's externalaffairs minister later \"cautioned the United States\" against any decision to sell F-16 fighter jets toPakistan, adding that the \"U.S. arms supply to Pakistan would have a negative impact on thegoodwill the United States enjoys with India, particularly as a sister democracy.\" (12) Yet, in March 2005, theBush Administration announced that the United States would resume sales of F-16 fighters toPakistan after a 16-year hiatus (see CRS Report RS22148, Combat Aircraft Sales to South Asia ).", "Separatist-related violence and terrorism in Kashmir has increased in the summer of 2005. The India-Pakistan peace initiative begun in April 2003 continues, most concretely with a formalcease-fire agreement along the Kashmiri Line of Control (LOC) and the entire international border(the cease-fire has held for nearly two years). In April 2005, a new bus service was launched in thedisputed Kashmir region and the Indian and Pakistan leaders called the bilateral peace process\"irreversible.\" However, while New Delhi indicates that rates of militant infiltration across the LOCare down significantly as compared to past years, ongoing separatist-related violence in India'sJammu and Kashmir state has claimed scores of lives and Indian officials have renewed criticismsthat Pakistan has not acted to eliminate the \"terrorist infrastructure\" on Pakistani territory.", "In India's northeastern states , decades-old separatist movements continue. After twoAssamese separatist leaders reportedly surrendered in February, United Liberation Front of Assamterrorists conducted a series of coordinated bomb attacks in March, spurring Indian security forcesto launch a 2,000-man operation against militants there in April. In May, New Delhi signed a trucewith the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, a leading Assamese separatist group designatedas terrorists by the Indian government. Moreover, rebels continue to make deadly assaults ongovernment forces in Manipur. (13) Meanwhile, attacks perpetrated by Maoist \"Naxalites\" operating in India (the two largest organizations being U.S.-designated terrorist groups) became morenumerous and have cost scores of lives 2005. Maoist militants are said to have expanded theiroperations into more than half of India's 28 states, spurring some observers to issue dire warningsabout India's deteriorating internal security circumstances. New Delhi vows to bolster thecapabilities of security forces battling the militants. (14) Other recent terrorist violence in India included a July incidentin which six militants, including a suicide bomber, were killed in the midst of an unsuccessful attackon the site of a controversial temple that is claimed by both Hindus and Muslims in the Uttar Pradeshcity of Ayodhya. Ensuing protests by Hindu activists led to thousands of arrests. The culpritsreportedly were linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist group. (15) ", "India-U.S. counterterrorism cooperation appears set to further expand. In June, the UnitedStates and India signed a ten-year defense framework agreement which lists \"defeating terrorism andviolent religious extremism\" as one of four key shared security interests, and which calls for abolstering of mutual defense capabilities required for such a goal. (16) ", "On August 17, about 350 small bombs exploded almost simultaneously across Bangladesh ,killing at least two people and injuring more than 125 others. No one claimed responsibility for theattacks, but leaflets produced by the banned militant Jamatul Mujahideen and calling for Islamic lawin Bangladesh were found at most sites. Numerous suspects subsequently were arrested, includingmany suspected members of the Jamatul Mujahideen. The United States offered law enforcementassistance to Dhaka in its ongoing investigation of the blasts. (17) After meeting with U.S.Assistant Secretary of State Christina Rocca, on May 12, 2005, in Dhaka, Bangladesh ForeignMinister M. Morshed Khan reportedly stated that he was optimistic that Bangladesh would receiveAmerican assistance for capacity building to improve the law and order situation inBangladesh. (18) It wasalso reported that the two discussed the need to better protect the coastal zone from piracy and tobuild up Bangladesh's capacity to face any terrorist challenges. (19) During her visit, Roccareportedly urged Bangladesh to \"go after those who would undermine its long tradition of tolerance,moderation and peace.\" Rocca welcomed Bangladesh's ban on the Jamatul Mujahideen and theJagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh for their alleged role in recent bombings. (20) Foreign Minister MorshedKhan met with Secretary of State Rice during his visit to Washington later in May 2005. At thattime, he reiterated Bangladesh's commitment to work with the United States in the war against terror.Rice described Bangladesh as \"a democratic force and a voice of moderation.\" (21) Foreign Minister Khanreportedly described the U.S. view of Bangladesh as \"an unavoidable partner\" in bridging religiousdivides across the world.\" (22) Bangladesh recently assumed the Chair of the BIMSTECgrouping comprised of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Burma, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The June1, 2005 BIMSTEC meeting in Dhaka reportedly reviewed progress of a joint working group onterrorism which met in Delhi in December 2004. (23) ", "Assistant Secretary Rocca also traveled to Nepal during her May 2005 trip to South Asia.There is rising concern among some analysts that King Gyanendra's February 1, 2005 takeover hasbroadened the divide between the king and democratic elements in the country and thereby weakenedthe government's ability to fight the Maoists. Such a situation favors the Maoists as it appears topreclude a unified front against them. Violence has increased in recent months and the death toll ofthe conflict with the Maoists is now thought to exceed 11,500. India may be increasingly concernedthat the conflict in Nepal could spill over into neighboring areas. Maoist tactics are reportedlychanging with increased daytime attacks and increased use of roadblocks and blockades. In August,Kathmandu accused Maoist rebels of \"executing\" 40 captured soldiers in the deadliest incident sincethe king's February power seizure, spurring analysts to again conclude that the government'scounterinsurgency efforts are making little headway. (24) ", "The Sri Lanka peace process has come under new threat after the August 12 assassinationof Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, an ethnic Tamil known for his vehement anti-rebelstance. Kadirgamar also was one of President Kumaratunga's closest allies. The Liberation Tigersof Tamil Eelam (LTTE) denied playing any role in the murder, but the cease-fire may not hold. (25) The peace process hadalready been stalled with growing instability as divisions within the LTTE ranks has devolved intointernecine warfare and targeted assassinations amongst the Northern and Eastern factions. TheLTTE leadership has also attempted to apply pressure on both the Sri Lankan Government and theNorwegian-backed Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) by staging isolated attacks on Sri Lankanunits accompanied by monitors. The LTTE also announced in May 2005 that it is looking atacquiring an air capability, which is in violation of the cease-fire and could be destabilizing due tothe possibility that such capabilities could be used in terrorist suicide-bombings. Divisions withinthe Sri Lankan government have hampered talks as well, as there are internal disagreements overnegotiating strategies and possible concessions to the LTTE in any eventual peace agreement. TheU.S. Administration has voiced continuing support for negotiations and the possibility of peace inSri Lanka and continues to call on the LTTE to disarm and disavow violence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and Pakistani Extremism(26)", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Al Qaeda-Taliban Nexus", "paragraphs": ["Among the central goals of Operation Enduring Freedom are the destruction of terroristtraining camps and infrastructure within Afghanistan, the capture of Al Qaeda and Taliban leaders,and the cessation of terrorist activities in Afghanistan. (27) Most, but not all, of these goals have been achieved. However,since the Taliban's ouster from power in Kabul and subsequent retreat to the rugged mountain regionnear the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, what the U.S. military calls its \"remnant forces\" have beenable to regroup and to conduct \"hit-and-run\" attacks against U.S.-led coalition units, often in tandemwith suspected Al Qaeda fugitives. These forces are then able to find haven on the Pakistani sideof the border. (28) Onesenior Pakistani official was quoted as saying that South Waziristan, a district of the traditionallyautonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), had by mid-2002 become \"the hub of AlQaeda operations in the whole world.\" Three years later, some analysts continue to call Pakistan \"theglobal center for terrorism and for the remnants of Al Qaeda.\" (29) Al Qaeda founder Osamabin Laden and his lieutenant, Egyptian Islamic radical leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, are believed bymany to be in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, an area roughly the size of Virginia. Pakistani officials generally insist there is no evidence that bin Laden is hiding in the borderregion, (30) but numerousU.S. officials have suggested otherwise. (31) In June 2005, Director of Central Intelligence Goss claimed tohave \"an excellent idea of where [bin Laden] is\" and suggested that \"sanctuaries in sovereign states\"and \"our sense of international obligation\" present obstacles to his capture. (32) The Pakistani presidenthas issued contradictory statements on the topic of bin Laden's whereabouts. (33) Some analysts speculatethat bin Laden's capture in Pakistan could create a backlash among his sympathizers there and somereports suggest growing U.S. frustration with the lack of progress in finding \"high value targets\" inthe region. (34) ", "Pakistan-Afghanistan Relations. The frequencyof attacks on U.S.-led coalition forces in southern and eastern Afghanistan increased throughout2003 and, in October of that year, then-U.S. Special Envoy and Ambassador to Afghanistan ZalmayKhalilzad warned that resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda forces presented a serious threat to Afghanreconstruction efforts. In the wake of spring 2004 military operations by Pakistan near the Afghanborder, the Afghan foreign minister praised Pakistan for its role in fighting terrorism, but AfghanPresident Karzai expressed concern that militants trained on Pakistani territory continue to cross intoAfghanistan to mount anti-government attacks there. (35) Karzai paid a visit to Islamabad in August 2004, where PresidentMusharraf assured him that Pakistan would not allow extremists to use Pakistani territory to disruptupcoming Afghan elections. Just days before those October 2004 elections, Islamabad announcedhaving moved extra troops and \"quick reaction forces\" near the Afghan border to prevent militantinfiltrations. Although the top U.S. general in Afghanistan had earlier expressed concerns that AlQaeda-linked operatives were actively encouraging militants to disrupt the elections, the successfuland mostly peaceful polling led him to later declare that the Taliban were no longer a meaningfulthreat to Afghan stability. (36) ", "However, the influence of Pashtun tribal animosities and lingering pro-Taliban sentiments-- combined with reports that some elements of Pakistan's security apparatus and Islamist religiousparties remain sympathetic to anti-U.S. forces -- have some analysts concerned that the Musharrafgovernment is insufficiently committed to pacifying the border. (37) Political tensions relatedto Afghan instability and Pakistan's role again rose in 2005, reaching alarming levels in mid-year. In January, a \"misunderstanding\" led to a cross-border exchange of artillery and machinegun firebetween Afghan and Pakistani troops. (38) In April, a top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan claimedthat Pakistan was preparing to launch military operations in North Waziristan near the Afghanborder. A Pakistani general later denied the claim and called the comments \"highlyirresponsible.\" (39) AMay Newsweek magazine report claimed that a Koran had been desecrated at the U.S. facility atGuantanamo Bay, allegedly spurring violent anti-U.S. protests in both Afghanistan and Pakistan(senior U.S. and Afghan officials later disputed the connection). (40) Subsequent questions wereraised about a possible role of Pakistan's intelligence service in sparking the riots; some Pakistanistrategists may oppose a long-term U.S. presence in Afghanistan, viewing it as inimical toIslamabad's interests in the region. (41) ", "Revived Taliban insurgent activity killed many hundreds in Afghanistan during the springof 2005. In May, a U.S. Army colonel in Kabul commended Pakistan's \"considerable\" militaryefforts in Waziristan, but said insurgents continue to cross into Afghanistan to attack U.S.-led forcesbefore returning to Pakistan. (42) By June, Afghan officials were complaining of a \"steady streamof terrorists\" entering their country from Pakistan, and the Afghan president made a personal appealto his Pakistani counterpart to halt the exfiltration. President Musharraf issued assurances of fullsupport for the Kabul government, but Afghan authorities reported arresting three Pakistani nationalsminutes before they planned to kill the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad,in Kabul. The Afghan-Pakistani rift deepened, spurring President Bush to make a personal call toMusharraf in an effort to smooth relations between two key U.S. allies in the region. (43) In July 2005, Pakistanreported moving 4,000 additional troops to the border region, bringing the total to some 80,000, andPrime Minister Aziz visited Kabul, where he vowed \"seamless cooperation\" with the Afghangovernment in fighting terrorism and Islamic extremism. Still, U.S. officials continue to urgeIslamabad (and Kabul) to \"do more\" to end insurgent operations in the region and some reportsindicate that Taliban recruiting and training continues to take place on Pakistani territory withoutgovernment interference. (44) ", "Al Qaeda and Related Groups in Pakistan. Linksbetween Al Qaeda and Pakistani Islamic militant groups, while possibly extensive, are believed tobe mostly informal, with existing Pakistani religious extremists facilitating Al Qaeda activities inthat country without being considered \"members.\" (45) Al Qaeda reportedly was linked to several anti-U.S. andanti-Western terrorist attacks in Pakistan during 2002, although the primary suspects in most attackswere members of indigenous Pakistani groups. (46) With the post-9/11 capture of numerous Arab Al Qaeda leaders(most of them in Pakistani cities), there are indications that a new wave of ringleaders is made upof Pakistani nationals. (47) President Musharraf's further efforts to crack down on outlawed groups -- along with his suggestionsthat Pakistan may soften its long-held Kashmir policies -- may have fueled even greater outrageamong radical Islamists already angered by Pakistan's September 2001 policy reversal, whenMusharraf cut ties with the Afghan Taliban regime and began facilitating U.S.-led anti-terrorismoperations in the region. (48) Musharraf and his top lieutenants themselves became targets ofAl Qaeda and Al Qaeda-linked violent extremism: (49) ", "On December 13, 2003, a remote-controlled bomb destroyed a Rawalpindibridge less than one minute after Musharraf's motorcade had passed over it. A U.S.-suppliedelectronic jamming device is believed to have delayed detonation.", "On December 25, 2003, dual suicide car bomb attacks on Musharraf'smotorcade in Rawalpindi failed to harm the Pakistani president, but killed 15 people, including theattackers. (50)", "On June 10, 2004, militants attacked the motorcade of a top Pakistan Armycommander and Musharraf ally in Karachi, killing ten, but leaving the generalunharmed.", "On July 30, 2004, a suicide bomber killed eight other people in a failed attemptto assassinate the Prime Minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz, who was unharmed.", "The F.B.I. played a role in the investigations into attempts on President Musharraf's life andthe United States has undertaken to provide improved training to Musharraf's bodyguards. Nonetheless, it is considered likely that future assassination attempts on Musharraf will occur. (51) Low-level Pakistanisecurity officers and soldiers were convicted for involvement in the attacks on Pakistani leaders,heightening concerns that the Musharraf government is finding it difficult to control domesticextremism, especially among some elements of Pakistan's security apparatus. (52) As more evidence arisesexposing Al Qaeda's deadly new alliance with indigenous Pakistani militants -- and militaryoperations continue to cause death and disruption in Pakistan's western regions -- concern aboutPakistan's fundamental political and social stability has increased. (53) ", "The United States also notes past indications of links between Al Qaeda and Pakistani armyofficers, intelligence agents, weapons experts, and militant leaders. There also have been reports thatPakistan allows Taliban militants to train in Pakistan for combat in Afghanistan and that Al Qaedacamps near the Afghan Pakistani border remain active. (54) Signs of collusion between some elements of Al Qaeda,Lashkar-e-Taiba, and influential Pakistanis fuel skepticism among those who doubt the sincerity ofPakistan's commitment to moderation. For example, of three major Al Qaeda figures captured inPakistan, one (Abu Zubaydah) was found at a Lashkar-e-Taiba safehouse in Faisalabad, suggestingthat some LeT members have facilitated the movement of Al Qaeda members in Pakistan. (55) Another (Khalid SheikhMohammed) was seized at the Rawalpindi home of a member of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), one ofPakistan's leading religious Islamist political parties. In fact, at least four top captured Al Qaedasuspects had ties to JI. In August 2004, Pakistan's interior minister asked the JI leadership to explainwhy several important Al Qaeda fugitives were captured in the homes of party workers, and a leaderof the ruling Muslim League party acknowledged that terrorists were linked to \"individual\" JIleaders. JI chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed responded by denying that the party had any ties to Al Qaeda. When asked about the issue, President Musharraf expressed \"the greatest disappointment ... thatthere are some political elements\" in Pakistan that \"keep on instigating\" foreign terrorists. He deniedimplicating any specific religious parties as a whole while conceding that individual terroristsuspects have been JI members. (56) ", "During the time that Islamabad was actively supporting the Afghan Taliban regime it hadhelped to create, Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency is believed to have haddirect contacts with Al Qaeda figures. (57) Sympathetic ISI officials may even have provided shelter to AlQaeda members in both Pakistan and Kashmir. (58) At least one source suggests the ISI collaborated with Al Qaeda'sshift into South Waziristan in 2002. (59) Two senior Pakistani nuclear scientists reportedly met withOsama bin Laden in 2001 to conduct \"long discussions about nuclear, chemical and biologicalweapons.\" (60) In July2005, six Pakistan army officers, including two colonels, were convicted on charges of plotting withAl Qaeda members. (61) Moreover, known Islamic extremists with ties to Al Qaeda appear to have remained active onPakistani territory. For example, longtime Pakistani terrorist chief Fazlur Rehman Khalil, whoco-signed Osama bin Laden's 1998 edict declaring it a Muslim's duty to kill Americans and Jews,has lived openly in Rawalpindi, not far from Pakistan's Army General Headquarters. (62) Khalil is the leader ofHarakat ul-Mujahideen, one of the many Pakistan-based terrorist groups opposed to both thecontinued rule of President Musharraf and to U.S. policy in the region.", "Mid-2004 saw significant developments in the fight against Al Qaeda-linked militants inPakistan, including the capture or killing of several allegedly senior Al Qaeda operatives and otherwanted fugitives (Al Qaeda suspects Masrab Arochi, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, and MohammedNaeem Noor Khan were captured in Pakistani cities in June and July; see \"Notable Al Qaeda FiguresCaptured or Killed in Pakistan,\" below). Pakistan's interior minister said that security agencies hadcaptured 12 foreign and 51 Pakistani \"terrorists\" between mid-July and mid-August 2004. As manyas ten of these were suspected Al Qaeda members whom the Pakistani government said wereplanning attacks on Pakistan government and Western targets, including the U.S. Embassy, tocoincide with Pakistani Independence Day. (63) In mid-August 2004, Pakistan published pictures of six\"most-wanted terrorists\" along with offers of major monetary rewards for information leading totheir capture. (64) InSeptember, Pakistan reported having killed one of these fugitives, suspected top Al Qaeda operativeAmjad Farooqi, and two other militants during a 4-hour gunbattle in the southern city of Nawabshah. Farooqi was described as having been the chief Al Qaeda contact in Pakistan and a longtimeassociate of Khalid Sheik Mohammed. (65) Within days, Pakistan said 11 more militants had been captured,including members of Jaish-e-Mohammed wanted in connection with a May 2002 car bombing inKarachi that killed 11 French military technicians. Pakistan's interior minister declared that thearrests had \"broken the back of Al Qaeda in Pakistan,\" a claim identical to that made by another topPakistani official two years earlier. In September 2004, then-Deputy Secretary of State Armitagecalled the activities of Pakistani security forces \"very noteworthy\" and \"extraordinarilyappreciated.\" (66) ", "While developments in 2004 marked notable strides in Pakistani and multilateral efforts toeliminate Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist elements in the region, the problem for Pakistan isfar from resolved. Reports indicate that Pakistan's western border regions -- especially thetraditionally autonomous Wazir districts of the FATA -- remain a sanctuary for scores or evenhundreds of non-Pakistani militants with Al Qaeda links or sympathies. (67) Pakistani forces continueto hunt suspected Al Qaeda members in both urban areas and western border regions. (68) In a controversial turn,the Islamabad government has made large cash payments to Pashtun tribal commanders in an effortto sever Wazir ties to Al Qaeda (see \"Pakistani Military Operations\" section below). (69) ", "In 2005, the United States has bolstered efforts to capture wanted Al Qaeda fugitives in partwith local-language television, radio, and newspaper advertising offering large monetary rewardsfor information leading to the arrest of 14 most wanted terrorists. (70) An apparent rift betweenArab Al Qaeda members and their Central Asia (primarily Uzbek) allies reportedly has beenexploited by U.S. and Pakistani intelligence services; such internal Al Qaeda conflict may haveallowed for the capture of Abu Faraj al-Liby in May 2005. (71) The arrest spurredPresident Musharraf and Pakistan's interior minister to (again) insist that their security forces had\"broken the back\" of Al Qaeda in Pakistan. (72) Yet, in June 2005, a senior fugitive Taliban leader appeared onPakistani television to claim that Osama bin Laden and Taliban chief Mullah Omar were both aliveand in good health, spurring the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan to claim that the twofugitives were not in Afghanistan. (73) ", "Following deadly July 7, 2005 bombings in London, and subsequent confirmation that atleast two of the culprits had made recent visits to Pakistan, Islamabad was faced with renewedinternational scrutiny of the country's links to Islamic extremism. President Musharraf launched anew nationwide crackdown on suspected militants and officials began investigating possible tiesbetween the London attack and Pakistan-based terrorist groups with known links to Al Qaeda. Bymonth's end, Musharraf was again declaring that Al Qaeda's operational structure in Pakistan hadbeen destroyed and he excluded the possibility that the terrorist network could have carried outrecent attacks in Britain or Egypt.

Manyanalysts locate the genesis of this now serious problem in the Islamization process initiated by Z.A.Bhutto after 1971 and greatly accelerated by Gen. Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. Some also hold theUnited States complicit, given its overt support for Zia, an authoritarian military leader whorepresented a \"frontline ally\" against Soviet expansionism. Zia sought greater domestic politicallegitimacy in part by strengthening the country's conservative religious elements which would laterplay a major role in Pakistan's Afghan and Kashmir policies. (78) ", "Pakistan has in the past demonstrated inconsistency in its efforts to rein in Islamic militantsoperating inside its borders. The United States has for many years been aware of the existence ofoutlawed groups both in Pakistan-held Kashmir and within Pakistani cities. In July 2000 testimonybefore the House International Relations Committee, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official calledPakistan's record on combating terrorism \"mixed,\" noting that \"Pakistan has tolerated terrorists livingand moving freely within its territory\" and is believed to have provided \"material support for someof these militants, including the Harakat ul-Mujahidin, a group that [the United States] hasdesignated as an FTO [Foreign Terrorist Organization].\" (79) ", "In the past, sectarian and Kashmir-oriented militant groups in Pakistan generally operatedwithin their own distinct geographic and functional spheres, separate from one another and also frommostly non-Pakistani militants who came to the region intent on fighting an international jihad.

The United States officially designates LeT and JeM as terroristgroups; SSP appears on the State Department's list of \"other selected terrorist organizations.\" (81) Following Al Qaeda's2001-2002 expulsion from Afghanistan and ensuing relocation of some core elements to Pakistanicities such as Karachi and Peshawar, some Al Qaeda activists are known to have joined forces withindigenous Pakistani Sunni militant groups, including LeT, JeM, SSP, and Lashkar-i-Jhangvi (LJ),an FTO-designated offshoot of the SSP that has close ties to Al Qaeda. (82) The United Nations listsJeM and LJ as \"entities belonging to or associated with the Taliban and Al Qaedaorganization.\" (83) ", "In his landmark January 2002 speech, President Musharraf vowed to end Pakistan's use asa base for terrorism, and he criticized religious extremism and intolerance in the country. In thewake of the speech, about 3,300 extremists were detained, though most of these were soon released(including one man who later tried to assassinate Musharraf). (84) Among those releasedwere the founders of both Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. Although officially banned,these groups continued to operate under new names: LeT became Jamaat al-Dawat; JeM becameKhudam-ul Islam. (85) In November 2003, just two days after the U.S. Ambassador expressed particular concern over thecontinuing activities of banned organizations, Musharraf moved to arrest members of these groupsand shutter their offices. Six groups were formally banned, including offshoots of both the JeM andSSP, and more than 100 offices were raided. Musharraf vowed to permanently prevent bannedgroups from resurfacing, and his government moved to seize their financial assets.

From 800 to as many as 3,000 arrests were madein nationwide sweeps when security forces raided numerous mosques and religious seminaries. However, there is widespread scepticism among analysts that Musharraf's most recent initiatives willlead to more effective action; many contend that such assurances have been given by the Pakistanileader numerous times in the past without meaningful result.

Secretary of State Powell identified these as\"programs that do nothing but prepare youngsters to be fundamentalists and to be terrorists.\" Thereis, however, little evidence that madrassas are producing known anti-Western terrorists.

In September 2004, Musharraf reportedlyassured an audience of leading Pakistani religious seminarians that his government would notinterfere in the affairs of madrassas and was under no foreign pressure to do so.

(101) WhilePresident Musharraf has in the past pledged to crack down on the more extremist madrassas in hiscountry, there is little concrete evidence that he has done so. According to two observers,Musharraf's promises \"came to nothing. His military government never implemented any programto register madrassas, follow their financing or control their curricula.\" (102) Many speculate thatMusharraf's reluctance to enforce reform efforts is rooted in his desire to remain on good terms withPakistan's Islamist political parties, which are seen to be an important part of his political base.

Pakistan's Islamists denounce Pakistani military operations in western tribal areas, resistgovernmental attempts to reform religious schools that teach militancy, and harshly criticizeIslamabad's cooperation with the U.S. government and movement toward rapprochement with India. The leadership of the MMA's two main constituents -- the Jamaat-i-Islami and theJamiat-Ulema-Islami-Fazlur -- are notable for their rancorous anti-American rhetoric; they have attimes called for \"jihad\" against what they view as the grave threat to Pakistani sovereignty thatalliance with Washington entails. (104) One senior MMA leader went so far as to suggest thatWestern governments may have \"engineered\" the 7/7 London bombings. (105) In addition to decryingand seeking to end President Musharraf's cooperation with the United States, many also are viewedas opposing the U.S.-supported Kabul government. In September 2003, Afghan President Karzaicalled on Pakistani clerics to stop supporting Taliban members who seek to destabilize Afghanistan. Two months later, the Afghan foreign minister complained that Taliban leaders were operatingopenly in Quetta and other cities in western Pakistan. In the wake of a March 2004 battle betweenthe Pakistan Army and Islamic militants in the traditionally autonomous western FederallyAdministered Tribal Areas (FATA), Pakistan's interior minister accused MMA politicians of givinga \"free hand\" to terrorists.

In June 2003, in what may havebeen a response to increased U.S. pressure, Islamabad for the first time sent its armed forces into theFederally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in search of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters who haveeluded the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan. By September 2003, Islamabad had up to 25,000troops in the tribal areas, and a major operation -- the first ever of its kind -- took place incoordination with U.S.-led forces on the Afghan side of the border.

In the same month, the Vice Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff told a Congressional panelthat the Islamabad government had \"taken some initiatives to increase their military presence on theborder, such as manned outposts, regular patrols, and security barriers.\" By August 2004, 75,000Pakistani troops were in the western border areas.

More than 130 people were killed in the fighting, including 46 Pakistani soldiers, but no\"high-value\" Al Qaeda or Taliban fugitives were killed or captured. Pakistani officials called theoperation a victory, but the apparent escape of militant leaders, coupled with the vehement and lethalresistance put up by their well-armed cadre (believed to be remnants of the Islamic Movement ofUzbekistan), led many observers to call the operation a failure marked by poor intelligence and hastyplanning. (123) Duringthe course of the battle, Pakistani troops began bulldozing the homes of Wazirs who were suspectedof providing shelter to \"foreign terrorists,\" and the United States made a short-notice delivery of2,500 surplus protective vests to the Pakistani military.

In December 2001, theUnited States designated both LeT and JeM as Foreign Terrorist Organizations shortly after theywere publically implicated by New Delhi for an attack on the Indian Parliament complex that killednine and injured 18. This assault spurred India to fully mobilize its military along the India-Pakistanfrontier. An ensuing 10-month-long standoff in 2002 involved one million Indian and Pakistanisoldiers and was viewed as the closest the two countries had come to full-scale war since 1971,causing the U.S. government to become \"deeply concerned ... that a conventional war ... couldescalate into a nuclear confrontation.\" (161) ", "Pakistan's powerful and largely autonomous ISI is widely believed to have providedsignificant support for militant Kashmiri separatists over the past decade and a half in what isperceived as a proxy war against India.

Some Indian officials have suggested that Al Qaeda may be active in Kashmir.

However, separatist-related violencespiked in Indian Kashmir in the summer of 2004, with shootouts and bombings causing scores ofdeaths.

Police blamed ULFAfor the blast. Six weeks later, a spate of bombings and shootings in Assam and Nagaland left at least83 people dead in what was called a joint operation by ULFA and NDFB. Although two seniorULFA leaders surrendered in February 2005, the rebels later launched a series of coordinated bombattacks across the Assam state. In a further sign that Assamese rebels remain a serious problem,2,000 Indian security forces moved against ULFA positions in April 2005.

Most notable of India's Maoist groups are the People's War Group (PWG),mainly active in the southern Andhra Pradesh state, and the Maoist Communist Center of WestBengal and Bihar. In September 2004, the two merged to form the Communist Party of India -Maoist. In 2004, for the first time and without public explanation, these groups appeared on the U.S.State Department's list of \"other terrorist groups\" (it is likely that the move was spurred by a U.S.interest in assisting both New Delhi and Kathmandu in efforts to combat Maoist insurgents inNepal (177) ).
