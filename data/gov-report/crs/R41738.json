{"id": "R41738", "title": "Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code: \u201cMunicipal Bankruptcy\u201d", "released_date": "2011-03-31T00:00:00", "summary": ["As cities and states have experienced varying degrees of financial difficulties in recent years, \"municipal bankruptcy\" has been mentioned relatively often in the popular press. The term is somewhat misleading, both in the word \"municipal\" and in the word \"bankruptcy.\"", "Many people think only of cities when they hear the word \"municipal.\" Upon learning that in the context of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code the term means more than just cities, some think that states may use the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code for municipal debtors: chapter 9. However, states are currently not eligible to be debtors under the Bankruptcy Code. The Code's definition of \"debtor\" includes only persons and municipalities. Its definition of \"municipality\" includes cities and counties as well as other political subdivisions, public agencies, and instrumentalities of a state. However, a municipality may not file under chapter 9 unless specifically authorized to do so by its state. To be eligible for chapter 9, a municipality must be insolvent.", "Chapter 9 is titled \"Adjustment of Debts of a Municipality.\" The Bankruptcy Code does not provide for the liquidation of a municipality's assets and distribution thereof to the creditors. Instead, it provides a legal mechanism through which municipalities may be protected from the claims of their creditors as they attempt to develop and negotiate a plan to adjust their debts. In this way, chapter 9 has similarities to chapter 11 reorganizations. However, a municipality retains more control in a chapter 9 case than does the debtor in a chapter 11. The oversight and involvement of the bankruptcy court is quite limited. The court cannot interfere with the municipality's political or governmental powers, its property or revenues, or its use or enjoyment of its income-producing property.", "There are only a few sections of the Bankruptcy Code that were specifically written in chapter 9; however, many other sections of the Code are explicitly made applicable to a chapter 9 case. Among these is \u00a7 365, which allows executory contracts to be assumed or rejected in a bankruptcy proceeding. Collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) are executory contracts. The expense incurred in meeting the obligations of CBAs may be a substantial budget consideration for many municipalities. While chapter 11 includes a section that specifically addresses the standards that must be met before a court can allow rejection of a CBA, no such section exists in chapter 9. Instead, based on two chapter 9 cases (In re County of Orange, California and In re City of Vallejo, California) it appears that municipalities may reject CBAs if they meet the less stringent standards established in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco and Bildisco.", "Although of current interest, chapter 9 is a provision of the Bankruptcy Code that is rarely used. Since 1979, the number of chapter 9 filings per year has averaged less than 10. Most of those have been by small government agencies such as municipal utilities, school districts, or single-purpose entities.", "Although chapter 9 has provided significant relief in the two major cases named above, it is not a panacea for a municipality's financial problems. It can be a lengthy and expensive procedure. Additionally, the debtor's ability to adjust debts, particularly pension or general obligation debt, may be limited by the state's constitutional or statutory restrictions since a plan of adjustment cannot require the municipality to take an action that is not lawful."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides a legal mechanism through which municipalities may be protected from their creditors as they attempt to develop and negotiate a plan to adjust their debts. Although chapter 9 was enacted as part of the Bankruptcy Code pursuant to Congress's power under Article I, \u00a7 8, clause 4, municipal bankruptcies are different from the bankruptcies of individuals and businesses. There is no provision for liquidation of a municipality's assets to satisfy creditors, there is no \"bankruptcy estate,\" and the bankruptcy court has limited authority over the conduct of the municipality during the pendency of the case. Furthermore, creditors do not have the ability to file a petition for the municipality\u2014an \"involuntary case.\" Many of these limitations are in the code to preserve the states' autonomy under the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.", "The recent recession has caused fiscal distress for states and municipalities as well as for individuals and businesses. In 2009, there were more filings by municipalities under chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code than in 2007 and 2008 combined. Despite this seemingly dramatic increase in chapter 9 filings, chapter 9 is, and has been, a relatively seldom used provision of the Bankruptcy Code, generally averaging fewer than 10 filings per year. Many of those filings have been by small government agencies such as municipal utilities, school districts, or single-purpose entities (e.g., a hospital or convention center). ", "Reports of significantly decreased revenues and increased expenses in both cities and states as well as predictions of a significant number of municipal bond defaults in the coming years have sparked interest in municipal bankruptcy, as well as calls for allowing states to use the Bankruptcy Code as a means of adjusting their own debts. Under the current Bankruptcy Code, there is no provision that would allow states to file for bankruptcy protection; however, less than 100 years ago, municipalities were not eligible to file for bankruptcy protection. A brief legislative history is provided in the Appendix ."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Who Can File Under Chapter 9?", "paragraphs": ["Only municipalities may file under chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, and it is the only chapter under which a municipality may file even if that municipality is incorporated. Not all municipalities can file. A municipality must be specifically authorized by its state to file under chapter 9. The municipality must be insolvent and must be willing to negotiate a plan to adjust its debts. It generally must also show that it has negotiated in good faith with its creditors.", "Challenges to an entity's eligibility to file under chapter 9 are a prime area for litigation by creditors following a chapter 9 filing. The municipality carries the burden of proving that it is eligible to file under chapter 9. If it is not, then the case will be dismissed. Litigation of challenges to chapter 9 eligibility can be a time-consuming process.", "Most people, hearing the term \"municipality,\" probably think of cities and towns. However, under the Bankruptcy Code, the term encompasses a broader variety of entities. Section 101(40) of the Bankruptcy Code states that the term \"means political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a State.\" Thus, although states are not included in the definition, counties are, since counties, like cities, towns, villages, etc., are political subdivisions of a state. Public agencies or instrumentalities of a state include such entities as school districts, water districts, and highway authorities. ", "Since 1994, municipalities have only been eligible to file under chapter 9 if they were specifically authorized to do so by their states. Not all states authorize their municipalities to file under chapter 9. Georgia law explicitly prohibits the state's municipalities from filing. Iowa restricts chapter 9 authorization to those municipalities that become insolvent as a result of an involuntarily incurred debt. In 14 states, municipalities must get approval from a state authority before filing a chapter 9 petition. Twenty-three states have no law addressing authorization to file under chapter 9; therefore, unless a specific law were passed by the state explicitly authorizing their filing, municipalities in those states would be unable seek protection under chapter 9.", "Simply being a municipality that is authorized by its state to file under chapter 9 is not sufficient for being an eligible chapter 9 debtor. The municipality must also be insolvent. Insolvency in a municipal bankruptcy is determined on a cash flow basis rather than being defined as the condition where liabilities exceed assets; Section 101(32)(C) defines \"insolvent\" as the financial condition of either generally not paying undisputed debts as they become due or the inability to pay debts as they become due. However, fiscal distress is not sufficient if the municipality has the means of either increasing revenue or reducing costs.", "To be eligible for chapter 9 protection, an insolvent municipality must be filing for such protection in good faith. Although a municipality is no longer required to submit a plan of adjustment with its bankruptcy petition, it must evidence a desire to implement a plan of adjustment rather than filing under chapter 9 in an attempt to either evade or delay payments to its creditors. Unless it has reason to believe that a creditor may attempt to get an avoidable transfer, the municipality generally must show that it has negotiated with its creditors in good faith or that it is impractical to do so prior to filing the petition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are the Benefits of Chapter 9 for the Municipal Debtor?", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Automatic Stay", "paragraphs": ["The automatic stay goes into effect when the chapter 9 petition is filed.

In a chapter 11, if a trustee is appointed, the trustee takes the place of the debtor in possession, with the same powers and duties.

As a result, the municipality, with the approval of the court, may assume executory contracts that are beneficial to the municipality and reject those that are too burdensome. Generally, the standard bankruptcy courts use in approving a debtor's assumption or rejection of an executory contract is the business judgment rule, a standard that generally defers to the debtor's judgment as to what is best for its operations. However, in evaluating assumption or rejection of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the courts use a higher standard.", "In a chapter 11 bankruptcy, rejection of a CBA is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code. This section requires that three conditions be met before a court can grant a motion to reject a CBA: (1) the debtor must meet the requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113(b)(1) by (a) presenting a proposal that both treats all parties equitably and proposes changes necessary for reorganization, and (b) providing the bargaining unit's representative with information needed to evaluate the proposal; (2) the representative must have refused to accept the debtor's proposal without good cause; and (3) \"the balance of equities [must] clearly favor[] rejection.\" Section 1113, which is not among the Bankruptcy Code sections named in \u00a7 901(a) as applicable in chapter 9, was added to the Bankruptcy Code following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 holding in National Labor Relations Board v. Bildisco and Bildisco . Bildisco held that rejection of a CBA required a higher standard than the business judgment rule, but its requirements were not as stringent as those of \u00a7 1113.", "Under the Bildisco standard, a CBA may be rejected only if the court finds that the agreement is burdensome to the debtor and that, after balancing the equities, rejection is favored.

Recently the city of Vallejo, CA, was successful in rejecting CBAs in its chapter 9 case, with both the bankruptcy court and the district court finding that the Bildisco standard was applicable in the case.
