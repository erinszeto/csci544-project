The General Services Administration (GSA) is the federal government's primary real property agency, with 11 regional offices that oversee GSA owned and leased federal buildings and courthouses. As of September 21, 2007, one leased building remained closed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in GSA's Southeast Region 4, which includes Alabama and Mississippi. In GSA's Greater Southwest Region 7, one GSA facility remained closed in Louisiana. GSA courthouse facilities in New Orleans, LA, which were temporarily relocated to Houston, TX, reopened in New Orleans on January 9, 2006. The 109th Congress authorized $38 million to GSA's Federal Buildings Fund for repairs to damaged federal facilities (119 Stat. 2782).

Sixteen of the damaged federal buildings owned by GSA provided 1.7 million square feet of office space, and the remaining 67 GSA-leased facilities totaled 1.3 million sq. ft. in rented space. GSA, through its Public Buildings Service (PBS), is the primary federal real property and asset management agency, with 11 regional offices that oversee GSA owned and leased federal buildings and courthouses. GSA is also responsible for the design and construction of federal courthouses within GSA's 11 regional districts. GSA's Southeast Region 4 includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Tennessee. As of September 21, 2007, one leased facility remained closed (see Table 1 ). The states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas comprise GSA's Greater Southwest Region 7, with one GSA-owned facility remaining closed to the public (see Table 2 ), as of September 21, 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Buildings", "paragraphs": ["GSA field personnel began advanced preparations to secure GSA buildings as soon as weather predictions indicated that Hurricane Katrina would make landfall. Preparations included fueling generators, shutting down electrical systems, placing sand bags, and boarding up the lower levels of multi-storied buildings. Although not all GSA owned and leased facilities suffered major structural damage in the affected areas, there was no supporting critical infrastructure, such as water, electricity, sewage systems, or even accessible roads to reach the federal facilities. There were also related environmental concerns that might affect the health and safety of federal employees in the affected areas. More than 30 GSA technical and building specialists conducted building inspections to assess when federal facilities might be reopened. GSA used trailers and obtained emergency 180-day leases in surrounding areas to provide temporary office space. A related problem was that many federal employees were forced to evacuate to areas located away from federal facilities when their homes were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.", "In order to accommodate workers who formerly resided and worked in New Orleans and relocated to Baton Rouge, GSA leased temporary office space in this general area. According to GSA regional specialists, it was a difficult task to find suitable office space for all of its federal tenants, and the administration was forced to use leasing and relocation priorities. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, GSA first leased all available office space in Baton Rouge, which was urgently needed by the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Leased office space in Baton Rouge was obtained by GSA for the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration. GSA signed a lease in the Baton Rouge area to house Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service employees formerly located in New Orleans. GSA officials also leased available office space in Lafayette, LA; Shreveport, LA; and Jackson, MS, to accommodate other federal tenants. GSA completed inspections of administration-leased facilities as soon as possible to determine the extent of structural damage. When GSA specialists determined that the leased properties were not fully habitable, the agency notified landlords that existing leases would be terminated within 15 days after notification. GSA officials also stated that, in many instances, it was difficult for the agency to locate landlords who had relocated elsewhere."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Courthouses", "paragraphs": ["According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit returned the court's operations to its New Orleans headquarters at the John Minor Wisdom Court of Appeals on January 9, 2006.

Both courthouses suffered wind damage, broken windows, and roof leaks, but the buildings' structures are intact. On December 12, 2005, GSA reported that both the Hale Boggs and the John Minor Wisdom courthouses had reopened to the public. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit relocated to the U.S. Federal Courthouse in Houston, TX, for a three-month period, with court business resuming on September 21, 2005. Many judges and court employees lost their homes in the New Orleans area, and temporary housing was obtained for them in Gonzalez, LA, centrally located between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. GSA-leased court space in Houma, LA, was also acquired for district court judges and court staff who were formerly located in the Hale Boggs U.S. Federal Courthouse.", "The Dan M. Russell, Jr. U.S. Federal Courthouse for the Fifth Circuit, Gulfport, MS, was also closed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Preliminary reports indicated that the building was intact, but had sustained severe water and wind damage. Court operations were initially suspended for 30 days and relocated to Jackson, MS. Housing was sought for judges and staff throughout the district who lost their homes because of Hurricane Katrina. On December 12, 2005, GSA reported that the courthouse had resumed partial operations. A fourth GSA-owned courthouse, the John A.
