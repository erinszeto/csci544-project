The AKP is trying to recast itself from anIslamist-rooted party to a centrist \"conservative democratic\" party. Although some AKP actions fuelsecularist suspicions of a hidden Islamist agenda, the high priority that the party gives to attainingEuropean Union (EU) membership may mitigate fears about its intentions and support its centristambitions.", "The government remains focused on the economy. With the aid of the International MonetaryFund (IMF), it has undertaken major macroeconomic reforms, achieved solid growth, and reducedinflation. The IMF has reviewed the government's economic performance positively and is expectedto approve a new three-year stand-by agreement for 2005-2007.", "The government also has been challenged by terrorism and is dealing with both Kurdish terrorism, a radical religious terrorist threat with possible international links, and remnants of leftistterrorism.", "In order to obtain a date to begin accession talks with the European Union (EU), the Turkish parliament has passed many reforms to harmonize Turkey's laws and Constitution with EUstandards. The EU is expected to scrutinize implementation of the reforms carefully before settinga date for accession talks. The situation on Cyprus is not expected to affect EU decision-making.", "U.S.-Turkish relations were shaken on March 1, 2003, when the Turkish parliament rejected a resolution to allow the deployment of U.S. troops to Turkey to open a northern front against Iraq. Bilateral ties have been strained by other developments in Iraq. The Turkish parliament's October2003 decision to authorize the deployment of Turkish peacekeepers to Iraq helped to improve ties,even though the offer was not accepted. However, Turkey continues to be concerned about thesituation in Iraq and U.S. actions there, which fuel anti-Americanism.", "Turkey remains important to the United States. Turkish air bases were used in the Afghan war and its airspace in the Iraq war. Its ports, airbases, and roads are used to resupply coalition forcesand for reconstruction efforts in Iraq. U.S. troops rotate to and from Iraq via Turkey. Turkey willbe an important transit route for pipelines carrying energy resources from the Caucasus and CentralAsia to the West, and the often sabotaged oil pipeline from Iraq to Turkey could be helpful to Iraq'srecovery. Turkish and U.S. intelligence agencies are cooperating closely in the war on terrorism. Turkish peacekeepers have served in many hot spots in support of U.S. policies, and commandedthe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.

In November 2002, the Justice and Development Party (AKP), a party with Islamist roots, won 363 out of 550seats in parliament and formed the first single-party government in Turkey in over a decade. (1) Deputyparty leader Abdullah Gul became the first AKP prime minister. He ceded the position to partyleader Recep Tayyip Erdogan in March 2003, after parliament lifted a ban on Erdogan's politicalparticipation and he won a seat in parliament. (2) Gulthen became Deputy Prime Minister and ForeignMinister. ", "Prime Minister Erdogan and the AKP appear to be securely in power and, with its parliamentarymajority, AKP has been able to pass its legislative program. Divisions within the AKP evident onMarch 1, 2003, when parliament rejected a government resolution to approve the deployment of U.S.forces to Turkey to open a northern front against Iraq, have faded. (3) Although AKP's parliamentarygroup is cumbersome, it is not ripe for fissures mainly because of the strength of Erdogan'spersonality and his popularity with the grass roots, and partly because Members enjoy the perquisitesof office. Erdogan's power and charisma are making AKP increasingly similar to traditional Turkishpersonality-dominated political parties. ", "To avoid the short lives of a series of earlier Islamist political parties, the AKP claims thepopular center-right of the political spectrum. Erdogan rejects the Islamist label, preferring to callhimself and his party \"conservative democrats.\" Some of his statements could be part of anAmerican debate regarding church-state relations. For example, he has said, ", "\"While attaching importance to religion as a social value, we do not think it right to conduct politics through religion, to attempt to transformgovernment ideologically by using religion.... Religion is a sacred and collective value.... It shouldnot be made a subject of political partisanship causing divisiveness ... to make religion an instrumentof politics and to adopt an exclusionary approach to politics in the name of religion harms not onlypolitical pluralism but also religion itself.\" (4)", "The priority that Erdogan and other party leaders give to beginning accession talks with the European Union (EU) aids the AKP's political repositioning. EU reforms and the values theyimpose would pull the entire country to the center and to Western values. For example, the EUrequires equal freedoms for all believers -- for Muslims who are not Sunni and not accepted asMuslim by the AKP's more passionate Islamists, for Christians, Jews, and others who heretoforehave not been treated equally in Turkey. (For more on reforms, see European Union below.) ", "However, Erdogan's attempt to distance AKP from its Islamist roots is undermined when some party officials and Members of Parliament raise issues with religio-political overtones that generatefriction with the secular establishment in the military, political opposition, and elements in themedia. For their part, secularists create discord when acting preemptively to counter real orsuspected signs of encroaching Islamism. There have been many instances of such tension. Headscarves are a major issue. In Turkey, a head scarf can simply be a sign of religious piety or it can bean assertive expression of opposition to secularism. The wearing of head scarves is banned in publicbuildings, such as parliament and universities. The military is particularly sensitive to this matter. On April 23, 2003, armed forces' commanders declined to attend a reception because the Speaker'swife wears a head scarf, and they did not know if she would attend. (She did not.) In August 2003,Chief of Staff General Hilmi Ozkok pointedly did not invite any officials' wives to a reception. InOctober, President Ahmet Necdet Sezer invited wives of all his guests except those of AKP deputieswho might wear head scarves to a Republic Day reception. Even some ardent secularists criticizedthe President's action as divisive. Erdogan refuses to enter this fray, saying that he is waiting for asocial/national consensus to emerge on the issue. He was \"saddened\" by the President'sdiscrimination, but attended the reception briefly with most members of his cabinet to avoid furthertension. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled, once again on June 29, 2004, that Turkey'sban on wearing head scarves in state schools does not violate freedom of religion, but rathersafeguards the principle of secularism necessary for the protection of the democratic system. (5)", "There have been other controversies about AKP's supposed \"Islamist agenda.\" Foreign Minster Gul sent a circular to embassies encouraging contact with Turkish non-governmental organizationsabroad, including the National View ( Milli Gorus ), which promotes an Islamic state in Turkey. AnAKP-dominated parliamentary committee voted to add 15,000 new positions in the Directorate ofReligious Affairs, which oversees mosques, reportedly horrifying AKP leaders and defyinggovernment promises to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of public employment cuts. (6) TheFinance Minister said that no such appointments would be made. (7) Finally, on three occasions, thePrime Ministers (first Gul, then Erdogan) and Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul have expressedreservations about the expulsion of allegedly fundamentalist soldiers from the armed forces atmeetings of the Supreme Military Council (YAS), insisting that those expelled be afforded the rightto judicial review. (8)", "Of potentially long-term consequence for Turkey's secular identity is education. The most heated disputes involve the AKP's attempts, in October 2003 and May 2004, to have the governmentexert greater control over the Higher Education Board and to allow graduates of religious ( imamhatip ) vocational high schools equal access to universities as those of normal high schools. Opponents viewed the bills as an effort to boost attendance at religious schools or to enable imamhatip graduates to qualify for government positions. Secularists on the Board, in opposition parties,universities, and the Office of the Chief of the General Staff, argued that the initiative was aimed atundermining \"the basic principles of the republic,\" and they denounced it. (9) The prominence of themilitary command in the debate raised concerns about the country's political stability and highlighteddifferences between civil-military relations in Turkey and the rest of Europe at a time when the AKPgovernment is seeking EU accession talks. Some questioned why AKP decided to raise the issueat this time since the military's sensitivities are well known. With municipal elections just over andnational elections years off, AKP's stated rationale of needing to reward grassroots wasunconvincing. President Sezer vetoed the bills, asserting that they were \"incompatible with the spiritof the Constitution, which is based on the Ataturk (Mustafa Kemal, founder of the Turkish Republic)principles....\" (10) Although it could have overriddenthe vetoes by passing an identical bill again, thegovernment withdrew the bills from consideration. It may resubmit the bill again.", "Aside from the education bills, Erdogan has generally been politically adroit considering that the Turkish armed forces are the constitutional guarantors of Turkey's secularism and have displacedcivilian governments several times in the past. For example, he acceded to Chief of Staff GeneralHilmi Ozkok's request that the National Security Council (MGK) be headed by a military figure forone more year before it passed to a civilian in August 2004 as required by EU-related reforms. (Formore on the MGK changes, see European Union , below.) Erdogan has benefitted from having themoderate, enlightened, discreet Ozkok as chief of staff. Ozkok consults privately with governmentofficials, voices his opinions at closed National Security Council meetings. At an April 2004 newsconference, he noted that the Turkish Armed Forces \"should not be expected to adopt a standregarding every issue or to share everything with the public.\" (11) Ozkok supports Turkey's EUambitions as the fulfillment of Ataturk's vision of Turkey as a modern, European state, even if thismeans a diminished role for the armed forces and the continuation in office of what the militaryviews as an Islamist government. The imam hatip bill provoked the general to issue rare publiccriticism of a government action. ", "In addition to the military, Erdogan and the AKP often clash with President Sezer, a popular former judge and ardent secularist, who wields his veto power liberally. (12) Sezer's vetoes havedelayed, but not prevented, passage of parts of the government program. He has been moresuccessful in blocking AKP's appointees to the government, many of whom he views asnon-supportive of the secular state. (13) However,the AKP reportedly has placed many of those deniedpresidential approval in government positions not requiring presidential action.", "March 28, 2004, Municipal Elections. (14) AKPwon 41.6% of the vote in the municipal elections -- a strong showing which exceeded the combinedtotal of 38% of the vote won by its next three rivals. Strikingly, AKP won 57 out of 81 mayoralraces, including 12 out of 15 races in major metropolitan areas. In other words, AKP confirmed itsdominance of the center-right, the most popular segment of the Turkish political spectrum. ", "There are several reasons for AKP's victory: First, its success in sustaining the country's economic stability has created widespread optimism. Second, its steady pursuit of EU membershipis very popular because of people's expectations of economic advancement with accession. (15) Third,its national leaders, including the charismatic Erdogan who spoke in 55 cities, campaignedenergetically and throughout the country. Finally, AKP profited from generally tame, uncriticalmedia coverage of its tenure. AKP also courted its Islamist grassroots by choosing 80% of itsmayoral candidates from the National View movement. The party fielded almost no women mayoralcandidates ostensibly in order to avoid raising the visibility of the controversial head scarf issue. Women who wear head scarves ran for less prominent local assembly seats and won.", "AKP made noteworthy inroads into opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) strongholds on the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts and into the Kurdish Democratic People's Party (DEHAP)cities in the southeast. The retrogressive, poorly led, center-left CHP nationalistically opposes thegovernment's Cyprus policy and many of its other policies, but has not truly led opposition to them. It made no electoral headway by taking these positions, receiving 18.2% of the vote, down from19.4% in the 2002 national election. This \"leftist\" party failed to draw the working class and middleclass vote and is now said to be a party of fierce secularists, the upper middle class, and the Alevis,a heterodox sect mixing Turkish customs with Shi'a Islam whose secularism provides shelter fromdominant Sunni Islam. CHP leader Deniz Baykal has kept his position by outmaneuvering partydissidents, not by policy achievements. DEHAP had allied with four small leftist parties to fieldcandidates jointly as the Union of Democratic Forces, but together they polled fewer votes thanDEHAP alone had won in 2002. AKP won 37% of the vote in the southeast. In other words, AKP'sconservatism (or Islamism) trumped Kurdish nationalism. The combined votes of all of the so-called\"left\" parties fell from 30% in 2002 to 25% in 2004. ", "Nonetheless, the election results failed to herald the demise of the opposition. The center-right True Path Party (DYP) and the far-right Nationalist Action Party (MHP) made comebacks,registering some gains and rising to 10.3% and 10.4% of the vote, respectively, primarily due to theirjingoistic dissent from AKP's compromises on Cyprus. Were this a national election, they wouldhave passed the threshold for entry into parliament."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economy", "paragraphs": ["Turkey appears to have recovered from the severe recession of 2000-2001.

The rate of inflation was the lowest in decades, exports grew30% to $48 billion, and interest rates dropped.

Imports outstrip exports, despite export growth. The goal ofearning $4 billion in revenues from privatization of state enterprises was not met in 2003, with only$2.2 billion gained, and government expectations of $3 billion in revenues from privatization in 2004are probably unrealistic. In June 2004, the court halted the sale of the Turkish Oil RefineryCorporation (TUPRAS) to a Russian firm for about $1.3 billion. Earlier, the government hadcanceled the sale of the state tobacco monopoly after bids were deemed too low, while protractedpreparations for the sale of 51% of the state telecommunications monopoly (TURK TELECOM)have not been concluded. Moreover, corruption scandals involving the Uzan family, accused ofdefrauding Motorola of billions of dollars, probably have affected sales to Western investors.", "Despite the effects of privatization difficulties on revenues, the government increased pension payments and the minimum wage, prompting the IMF to seek and obtain offsetting budget cuts andincreases in tax revenues. The IMF continues to encourage Turkey to improve tax administrationto combat tax evasion and to undertake social security reforms, saying such measures would boostpolicy credibility and underpin the success of the reform program.

Officials plan to sign a new three-year stand-byagreement to cover the period 2005-2007.", "Turkey remains economically vulnerable because its public debt consumed about 75% of gross domestic product (GDP) as of December 2003. Although the ratio of debt to GDP is diminishing,much of the debt is short-term and rolled over at fluctuating interest rates. (18) The need to pay downthe debt, especially the part carrying high interest rates, is the reason for IMF demands a 6.5% budgetsurplus.", "Turkey relies heavily on borrowing partly because of lack of alternative sources of capital. It has very low foreign direct investment -- only 0.15% of the world's foreign direct investmentinflows in 2002. (19) Foreign investors have beenwary of investing in Turkey because oftime-consuming bureaucratic procedures and problems with transparency and rule of law in businessrelationships. The average time between authorization and investment reportedly is two years. Turkey ranked 77 out of 133 countries on the 2003 Transparency International CorruptionPerceptions Index.

For a long time, terrorism in Turkey referred mainly to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and its successor groups. From 1984-1999, the Turkish armed forces fought a war against PKK insurgents (Turkish Kurds)who sought autonomy or independence. The PKK operated mainly in southeast Turkey, althoughit also attacked elsewhere in Turkey and Turkish targets in Europe. The PKK has appeared toflounder since its leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured and imprisoned in 1999.", "In April 2002, the PKK renamed itself the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress (KADEK), but retained many of the same leaders. In November 2003, KADEK dissolved itself andthe People's Congress of Kurdistan (KONGRA-GEL) was established. KONGRA-GEL claims tobe a purely political organization embracing the Kurds of Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. ItsConstitution calls for \"a durable solution to the Kurdish Question\" by \"promoting democratic forces\"and does not mention independence or autonomy. (21) As the PKK transformed itself into KADEK andKONGRA-GEL, its military wing, the People's Defense Forces, was termed \"independent\" and didnot dissolve or disarm. Turkish officials and media refer to PKK successor groups jointly with thePKK, e.g., PKK/KADEK or PKK/KONGRA-GEL. On November 14, 2003, the U.S. StateDepartment spokesman said, \"The PKK/KADEK, under any alias, is a terrorist organization, and noname change or press release can alter that fact\" and, on January 13, 2004, the Departmentdesignated KONGRA-GEL as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.", "The PKK/KADEK/KONGRA-GEL was relatively inactive as a terrorist group until recently, and its capabilities may be doubted. Although the State Departments and Turkish authorities allegethat about 4,000 PKK members have taken safe haven in northern Iraq, that number dates frombefore Ocalan's capture and, given the possible dispersal of followers since then, the real strengthof the group may be lower or different. (22) Moreover, KONGRA-GEL appeared to suffer a schism in2004 involving Ocalan's brother Osman and others, which may have distracted it from the fight. (23) Another sign of PKK decline may have been apparent in KONGRA-GEL/PKK's support for theUnion of Democratic Forces, which included the Kurdish party DEHAP and performed poorly inthe March 2004 municipal elections. ", "KONGRA-GEL announced that it was ending a five-year unilateral cease-fire on June 1, 2004, and warned foreign investors and tourists against coming to Turkey. There has since been anupsurge in incidents in southeast Turkey, which Turkish officials attribute to the return of militantsfrom northern Iraq. Turkish Kurds in the southeast, benefitting from reforms such as Kurdishlanguage broadcasting and other language and cultural rights, do not want a return to war. Fourformer Turkish Kurdish parliamentarians released from prison in June called for the KONGRA-GELto continue the cease-fire -- an unusual public display of dissent.

They nonetheless remain an obsession of the Turkish military, which views a PKK with a possibly nonviolent, political agendaas the same as an active terrorist PKK.

In November 2003, local Turkish terrorists reportedly connected to the Al Qaeda international network perpetrated foursuicide bombings in Istanbul: two targeting synagogues, one the British consulate, and one a localoffice of HSBC, an international bank based in London.

All of the suspects wereTurks, and several have been charged with trying to overthrow the constitutional order, i.e., withtreason.

(26) These operatives weresaid to have trained in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 1990's, and to have fought in Bosnia andChechnya.

Prime Minister Erdogan stated that the attacks had been planned and organized abroad. (29) The attacks marked a significant increase in the operational capabilities of domestic terror groupsand in their financial resources, seeming to confirm assumptions of foreign assistance withintelligence, explosives, and finances. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman observed that thesophistication of the attacks, the multiple attacks, and their coincidental timing were consistent withthe pattern of previous Al Qaeda attacks. (30) Otheroutside links may have been evident when severalsuspects were captured at the Iranian border and the Syrian government handed over 22 others,although only one of them was charged. A telephone caller to a Turkish news agency claimed jointresponsibility for all four bombings in the name of Al Qaeda and IBDA-C.

A statement in the name of Al Qaeda sent to a London-based Arabicnewspaper claimed responsibility. The indictment of the surviving bomber charged that he hadreceived training at a Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LT) camp in Kashmir and had subsequently fought inChechnya. LT may have ties to Al Qaeda.

(113) The funds were provided in the FY2002supplemental appropriations approved in P.L. 107-206 , August 2, 2002. ", "For FY2003, the Administration requested $17.5 million in FMF and $2.8 million in International Military Education and Training Funds (IMET), which were appropriated in P.L. 108-7 ,February 20, 2003. As part of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, P.L.108-011 , April 16, 2003, Turkey was to receive $1 billion in ESF to support not more than $8.5billion in direct loans or loan guarantees. The Conference Report, H.Rept.108-76 , April 12, 2003,provided that the $1 billion remain available until September 30, 2005. However, the funds may notbe made available if the Secretary of State determines and reports that Turkey is not cooperating withthe United States in Operation Iraqi Freedom, including the facilitation of humanitarian assistanceto Iraq, or has unilaterally deployed troops into northern Iraq. The President will determine the termsand conditions for issuing the assistance, and should take into consideration budgetary and economicreforms undertaken by Turkey. Under the terms of a loan agreement signed by the United States andTurkey on September 22, 2003, the loan will mature in 10 years and have a four-year grace periodfor repayment. Funds may be disbursed in four equal installments over 18 months; none have beendisbursed so far. Minister of State Babacan has said that they are not needed, while Prime MinisterErdogan suggests that \"the political condition\" that Congress attached to the loan is the reason thatthe funds have not been drawn down.", "For FY2004, the Administration requested $50 million in FMF and $200 million in ESF. There were no economic or military assistance earmarks for Turkey in the Consolidated AppropriationsAct, P.L. 108-199 , January 23, 2004, and, in FY2004, Turkey will receive an estimated $40 millionin FMF, $99,410,000 in ESF, and $5 million in IMET. (114)", "For FY2005, the Administration has requested $50 million in ESF, $34 million in FMF, and $4 million in IMET. H.Rept. 108-599 , July 13, 2004, for H.R. 4818 , the ForeignOperations Appropriations Act for FY2005, passed on July 15, calls for a $50 million reduction inassistance for Turkey, noting that $1 billion appropriated in P.L. 108-011 remains unexpended. H.R.4818, Sec. 578 would prohibit use of funds made available to Turkey to lobby against H.Res. 193 , which would reaffirm support for the Genocide Convention (and mentionthe Armenian genocide). State Department spokesman Richard Boucher has said that theAdministration opposes the measure. House leaders have observed that the provision is not neededbecause law already prohibits use of U.S. aid for lobbying and said that they will insist that confereesdrop it. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, Majority Leader Tom DeLay, and Majority Whip Roy Bluntissued a statement declaring, \"Turkey has been a reliable ally of the United States for decades, andthe deep foundation upon which our mutual economic and security relationship rests should not bedisrupted by this amendment.\" (115)"], "subsections": []}]}]}}
