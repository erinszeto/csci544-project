The cost of additional vaccine in 2004, when it was specifically requested by the U.S.government, would have to be borne by the U.S. government in this special circumstance. Somevaccine policy experts voiced concern about the possibility of a surplus, and discussion ensued aboutfinancial responsibility for vaccine doses that had not yet been delivered. A news report suggestedthat HHS would use federal funds designated for state immunization programs to purchase theinvestigational flu vaccine doses from Germany, thereby reducing the amounts available to supportchildhood immunization programs in states.

She also noted thatFY2005 appropriations had not yet been signed by the President and therefore were not available atthe time the purchase was arranged.

Inaddition, HHS launched an unprecedented effort to license the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine in less thanone year, with the company saying it could supply 10 to 20 million doses for the U.S. market for2005-2006.

Manufacturers mustsuccessfully grow the particular virus or other organism of interest while avoiding the growth ofother organisms that might contaminate the final product. Several peculiarities of the influenza virusitself and its production process make flu vaccine production especially complicated. There arenumerous points at which the process could fail, and has failed in recent years.", "The influenza virus changes over time. From year to year, the dominant strains of virus incirculation change, which is why we may get sick every year from flu, in contrast with havinglifelong immunity to more stable viruses such as measles. Each year in late winter, the FDA, withinput from the National Vaccine Advisory Committee and using surveillance information from theWorld Health Organization (WHO) and CDC, reviews virus strains in global circulation and selectsthree that are most likely to cause serious illness in the United States during the subsequent winterseason (i.e., one year hence). The chosen strains are incorporated into that next winter's trivalent fluvaccine, which typically contains at least one new strain each year. Strain selection may be basedon both the dominance and severity of strains in circulation, but may be limited by certain obstacles. For example, an especially virulent strain called Fujian was an obvious choice for the 2003-2004flu vaccine, but it could not be successfully grown in eggs in time to include it in the vaccine. Thisproblem was eventually surmounted, and based on its continuing circulation, the Fujian strain wasincluded in the 2004-2005 flu vaccine.", "To make large amounts of virus for vaccine production, the virus must be grown in fertilizedeggs. Large numbers of fertilized eggs are required each year to support vaccine production. Theymust be specially produced, assuring the health of the laying hens, appropriate sanitation, care intransport, incubation, and other actions as required by the FDA to assure vaccine safety and efficacy. This endeavor is far more complicated than the production of unfertilized eggs for food. Relianceon eggs and is a rate-limiting step in flu vaccine production, requiring many weeks for growing thevirus and extracting it from the eggs, and introducing contamination risks.", "Each year the current flu vaccine production system is a race against the clock. Strains mustbe selected by February in order that they can be grown, purified, processed and made into vaccine. Under optimal conditions vaccine is made in batches from August through November, barely makingit to market ahead of the annual influenza epidemic. Breakdowns in the process, especially oneoccurring in the fall as with the Chiron vaccine, can subvert the entire production volume. It isdifficult, if not impossible, to start over within a given season, so as with the Chiron situation, alarge-scale process failure can lead to complete loss of the entire season's vaccine production fromthat supplier."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities to Streamline Vaccine Production", "paragraphs": ["The flu vaccine production process can be optimized in a number of ways. A promisingoption is replacement of the cumbersome egg-growth step with cell culture methods, in which thevirus is grown in tubes or vats of certain cells. With this technique, growth is faster, more controlled,takes up less space, and introduces fewer contamination problems than using eggs. Cell culturetechniques could make the annual flu vaccine production cycle less prone to failures and moreamenable to re-starting production within a season if problems do arise. In other words, cell culturetechniques can provide surge capacity within existing infrastructure. This technique is not currentlyFDA-approved for flu vaccine production, but is in early stages of clinical trials, funded by theNational Institutes of Health (NIH). Potential problems must be evaluated, such as the risk of cellcomponents and genes getting into the vaccine or the virus. Also, for existing flu vaccinemanufacturers to use this method they would have to renovate existing facilities or construct newones, and would have to develop consistency in meeting good manufacturing practices (GMPs) andother standards if they are to reliably produce vaccine each year.", "Flu vaccine production can also be optimized by using reverse genetics to produce \"vaccinestrains,\" strains of influenza virus with the right combination of traits to stimulate immunity, and togrow well in eggs. Currently, obtaining strains with the right characteristics for vaccine productionis a trial-and-error process; strains are grown together in batches and sampled in a search for thosewith the desired traits. With reverse genetics, the desired parts of the viral genome are cloned andcombined to create the needed traits more quickly and reliably. Reverse genetics is not currentlyapproved for vaccine production, but NIH-funded clinical trials are currently underway using thetechnique to produce vaccine for the strain of avian influenza (\"bird flu\") now circulating in Asia,in the event that it becomes a serious human pathogen. The safety and efficacy of flu vaccineproduced using this technique remains to be evaluated. In addition, there are potential consumeracceptance concerns, especially in Europe, because the vaccine virus produced is a geneticallymodified organism.", "Another opportunity to optimize annual flu vaccine production rests with steady enhancementof global influenza surveillance, which could improve the speed and accuracy of strain selection.", "Ultimately, the influenza virus holds two trump cards for which science does not offersolutions on the near horizon. First, there is a limited ability to predict how the virus will modifyitself into each year's dominant circulating strains. Once these strains emerge, there is a race againsttime to produce vaccine while the strains are actually causing illness somewhere on the planet. Second, the regular drifts of the viral genome (and the more cataclysmic shifts that define apandemic) are inherent in its genes, and the resulting evasion of the human immune response isinherent in our genes.
