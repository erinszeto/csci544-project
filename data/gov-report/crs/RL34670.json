As the U.S. military has increased operations in Iraq, the size of the DBA program has grown.

Nearly $200 million in cash and medical benefits were paid to DBA claimants in 2008.", "Congress has become increasingly concerned with the costs involved in the DBA program because the federal government usually reimburses its contractors for their DBA premiums. The Department of State (DOS) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have seen some cost savings since adopting single-source models for their DBA insurance in which contractors for each agency are required to purchase insurance from a single company selected by the agency. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is currently testing such a model for its DBA system. For the rest of the Department of Defense (DOD), however, including the Army's large Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) contract, individual contractors are free to select their own DBA insurers and negotiate their own rates, and one contractor, KBR, has been criticized by DOD auditors for failing to demonstrate that it sought to control DBA premium costs when selecting an insurer.", "Although not directly related to the Defense Base Act, Congress has expressed concern over negligent contractor behavior that may jeopardize the health and safety of both contractors and government personnel.

P.L. 111-84, the NDAA for FY2010, authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reduce or deny award fees due to such incidents, as defined in Section 823 of P.L. 111-84.", "The NDAA for FY2009 (P.L. 110-417) includes a provision that requires DOD to change the way its contractors provide DBA coverage for their workers. In a report issued pursuant to this legislation, DOD concluded that making improvements to the current open-market DBA insurance system would best meet the criteria for reform recommended by Congress and the agency. The report also found advantages that could result from having the federal government self-insure, with third-party administration, for DBA costs. However, there may be limitations to the utility of the report as a guide for Congress in making overall changes to the DBA program.", "This report provides an overview of the DBA and the systems used to provide DBA insurance at DOS, USAID, DOD, and USACE.

Particularly when faced with high premiums, some insurance consumers choose not to purchase insurance from an insurance company but instead choose to \"self-insure.\" Self-insurance is a very broad term, possibly covering any situation in which an entity chooses to retain a risk rather than purchasing insurance. Self-insurers can cover a spectrum from (1) entities who essentially ignore a risk and take few, if any, steps to financially prepare for a loss; to (2) entities who consider and evaluate risks, while perhaps setting up some sort of savings or reserve accounts to pay for future losses; to (3) entities who set up a legally licensed insurance company, known generally as a captive insurer, to whom actuarially determined premiums are paid but ownership of the insurer is retained by the insured, so both profits and risks are also retained by the insured.", "Because the DBA mandates workers' compensation insurance for federal contractors overseas, the first self-insurance option, essentially ignoring the risk, is generally not an option. Under the DBA, however, employers do have the option to self-insure if they meet certain financial criteria and are approved to do so by DOL. Under the federal regulations, self-insurers are not required to go so far as to set up captive insurers in order to self-insure. Nearly 170 employers are listed by DOL as authorized self-insurers. Firms may also self-insure under most state workers' compensation laws, and according to the Self-Insurance Institute of America, more than 6,000 corporations and their subsidiaries self-insure their workers' compensation risks. Many self-insurers still purchase some form of insurance, typically a \"catastrophic\" policy that would take effect if extraordinarily high losses occurred, and federal rules actually require such a policy. Many self-insurers also hire third-party administrators, who undertake much of the administrative burden of dealing with claims but without assuming any of the financial risk.", "Choosing to self-insure is a decision taken on a wide variety of business grounds. In general, those self-insuring are seeking to reduce insurance costs and ensure the availability of insurance. Self-insurance can reduce costs through three primary mechanisms. First, any profits that would have flowed to the insurer could be captured by the self-insurer; second, the self-insurer may be able to save on administrative costs, either by undertaking the administration in-house or finding a more efficient third-party administrator; and third, if the self-insurer is a relatively low-risk, its costs would be lower if it were not pooled with other, higher risk parties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DBA Waivers", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Labor may, at the request of a federal agency, grant a waiver that exempts a firm from the DBA if the firm can demonstrate that an alternative workers' compensation system that provides benefits in the case of disability or death is in place to cover the firm's employees.

In September 2007, the USAAA released its audit report.", "Army auditors found that KBR, the LOGCAP contractor, paid approximately $284.3 million in DBA premiums during the period from FY2003 through FY2005. These premiums rose steadily each fiscal year from approximately $4.7 million in FY2003 to approximately $164.7 million in FY2005. As a result of these premiums, the auditors concluded that DBA insurance represented a \"significant and recently increasing cost element\" of the overall LOGCAP contract.", "USAAA found that whereas total LOGCAP DBA costs rose between FY2003 and FY2005, DBA premiums for Iraq and Kuwait as a percentage of total payroll increased from FY2003 to FY2004 and then declined in FY2005 and FY2006. The audit also found that these rate fluctuations appeared inconsistent with the risks associated with providing DBA insurance for this contract. In addition, the audit found that the LOGCAP contractor reported accident rates that were lower than the U.S. private industry average yet it was paying higher than industry-average worker's compensation premiums.", " Table 6 provides the LOGCAP DBA premiums for Iraq and Kuwait for the period between FY2002 and FY2006.", "Army auditors found that the Department of the Army paid \"substantially\" more in DBA premiums than was expected to be paid out in DBA claims. The auditors found that while $284.3 million in DBA premiums were paid under the LOGCAP contract between FY2003 and FY2005, just under 26% of these premiums went to pay the $73.1 million in DBA claims and potential future claims arising from cases during this period. Table 7 provides data on LOGCAP DBA premiums and potential claims for the period between FY2003 and FY2005. ", "One explanation offered by the USAAA for what it deemed as these \"excessive\" premiums was the practice of basing DBA premiums on total payroll costs, including costs such as overtime pay and hazard pay while basing DBA benefit amounts, usually two-thirds of pre-injury wages, only on base pay. ", "Auditors found that between January 1, 2003, and September 30, 2005, KBR paid $23.1 million in premiums on the special incentive payments made to its employees for the hazard pay component of its payroll. In addition, DBA benefits, but not the wages used to calculate DBA premiums, are capped, and thus a portion of the total premium is paid on salary above the cap that will not be replaced by DBA disability benefits. Because of this, KBR is essentially paying insurance on payroll that does not need to be insured because it can not, by law, be replaced under the provisions of the DBA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defense Contract Audit Agency Audit of DBA Insurance Under LOGCAP", "paragraphs": ["The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audited the costs billed to the DOD by KBR for DBA insurance under LOGCAP in 2003.

Stephenson testified that the DCAA could find no evidence that KBR attempted to use a competitive bidding process to secure DBA insurance or ensure that the rates it paid were competitive. Because of this lack of evidence, DCAA reported that it was unable to determine the reasonableness of the DBA rates paid by KBR in 2003 or subsequent years. In addition the DCAA audit found that KBR was not verifying the actual labor costs of its subcontractors and thus was paying DBA premiums on estimated rather then actual labor costs.", "As a result of its audit of KBR's DBA insurance under LOGCAP in 2003, the DCAA recommended to the Department of the Army that, unless KBR can provide some evidence that its purchase of DBA insurance was competitive, that the Department of the Army determine if KBR should be required to reimburse the federal government for some of the DBA insurance costs it billed under LOGCAP in 2003.

On May 15, 2008, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing on DBA issues that focused on DBA costs involved in the LOGCAP contract as well as the possibility of the DOD adopting a single-source model for DBA insurance similar to what is currently used by DOS, USAID, and USACE as part of its pilot program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "P.L. 110-417, the FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act, as an Outline for Possible DBA Reform", "paragraphs": ["Section 843 of the FY2009 National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to adopt a department-wide DBA insurance provision that will minimize costs, ensure that premium prices are tied to expected claims, minimize risk to DOD, and provide for a competitive DBA marketplace. Although this legislation does not require DOD to adopt any specific DBA strategy, an earlier version of the bill ( H.R. 5658 ) provision passed by the House provided an outline of several policy options that DOD was required to consider when formulating its overall DBA strategy.", "In H.R. 5658 , the House-passed version of the bill, Section 850 contains policy options that fall into three broad categories of DBA reform that are similar to those mentioned in reviews of the DBA performed by the GAO, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the USAAA, and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The three categories of policy options are", "using a single contracted source, or a limited set of contracted sources, for all DOD DBA contracts, similar to the model used by DOS, USAID, and the USACE pilot program; using a rating system to set premiums based on past claims incurred, similar to the experience rating systems used in many private insurance lines; and having the federal government self-insure for all DBA costs similar to what is currently done with the workers' compensation for injuries and death related to war hazards under the WHCA and workers' compensation for federal employees under the FECA program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Single-Source Contract for DBA Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Currently, DOS, USAID, and USACE use single-source contracts to provide DBA insurance for their contractors. Under this model, all agency contractors purchase DBA insurance from a single source selected through a competitive bidding process. This process allows a single insurer to pool the risks of multiple contractors and contracting activities with the goal of using this pooled risk to reduce the premiums paid by all contractors.", "Because of the different nature of the contracts issued by DOS, USAID, USACE, and DOD, it is difficult to compare premiums to determine if DOD would experience cost savings from a single-source contract for DBA insurance. Currently, across all geographic areas and activities, DOD pays lower average premiums then does USACE. However, the highest premiums paid by DOD are double those paid under USACE's single-source contract. In addition, both DOS and USAID have lower negotiated premium rates under their single-source contracts than USACE does under its contract.", "A report issued by the Majority Staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee found that underwriting gains were significantly higher for major DBA contracts independently negotiated than for the single-source contracts used by DOS and USAID. CBO estimates that adopting a single-source model for all DOD DBA insurance would result in savings of $33 million in the first year and a 10-year cost savings of $362 million.", "Although there are indications that adoption by DOD of a single-source model for DBA insurance could result in cost savings, the size and complexity of the DOD and its contracts may result in difficulties in that agency adopting the system used by the smaller DOS and USAID. It is not known if a single insurer would be willing or able to take on all of the DOD's DBA business. USAAA reports that only one insurance carrier bid to provide coverage under the LOGCAP contract, and an earlier effort by DOD to find a single carrier for all DBA contracts in Iraq resulted in no carriers placing bids. Similarly, a DOD survey of the four largest DBA insurers found that all opposed a single source contract system and none would bid for such a contract if it were offered by DOD. This problem is not unique to DOD as in their most recent contract solicitations, DOS, USAID, and USACE each only received a single bidder for their DBA insurance. ", "USACE reports that even with a single source for all DBA insurance under its pilot program, the agency is still required to provide administrative support and bear administrative costs. The CBO concurs with this assessment and notes that although it estimates overall cost savings if DOD were to adopt a single-source model for DBA insurance, these cost estimates do not take into account the costs to DOD involved in setting up and administering the system and that these costs \"could greatly diminish savings.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experience Rating for DBA Insurance", "paragraphs": ["In its audit of DBA insurance for the LOGCAP contract, USAAA concluded that the premiums being paid by KBR did not reflect either the expected claims to be paid or the risks involved in the covered activities, especially given KBR's relatively low accident rates. USAAA also found that LOGCAP DBA rates were subject to large annual fluctuations and were a major component of the overall cost of the LOGCAP contract. The use of experience ratings, in which current premiums are based on past claim rates, could bring DBA premiums more into line with the risks faced by DBA contractors.", "Experience rating is common in the insurance industry and is a feature of many workers' compensation systems governed by state laws. Under an experience rating system, a base premium can be increased if a customer has a history of claims that indicate a greater risk to the insurer or be lowered if the claims history indicates a reduced insurance risk. The proprietary nature of individual insurance arrangements between contractors and carriers and that neither DOL nor any of the contracting agencies has any authority to regulate DBA claims makes it difficult assess what factors are currently used to set current DBA premiums.", "There may be difficulties in using experience ratings to determine DBA premiums. The fluctuations in the price of premiums charged under the LOGCAP program may indicate difficulties in accurately estimating insurance risk in a war zone. One such difficulty involves the determination of whether a claim should be paid under the DBA or the WHCA. For example, USAAA reports that KBR's insurance broker was concerned with the probability of increased DBA claims due to a plane crash and the current DOS insurance contract allows for higher premiums for security contracts that involve aviation. However, under some circumstances a plane crash would be covered not by the insurer under the DBA but rather by the federal government under the WHCA. In addition, in response to USAAA's audit of the DBA insurance under the LOGCAP contract, the U.S. Army Sustainment Command stated that it \"may prove difficult to find insurance carriers who use retrospective rating plans in determining DBA insurance premiums for countries where war risk hazards have been recognized by the DOS.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Self-Insurance", "paragraphs": ["The DBA is a privatized workers' compensation system in which individual contractors either purchase insurance from private carriers or self-insure. However, because the terms of many federal contracts allow the contractors to bill the federal government for the cost of DBA insurance, DBA insurance costs are often ultimately paid by the federal government. One option for DBA insurance reform would be to eliminate the private nature of DBA insurance and have the federal government act as the sole DBA insurer and pay 100% of all DBA administrative and claim costs. Having the federal government self-insure for DBA insurance would be similar to the way workers' compensation insurance is handled for injuries and deaths caused by war hazards under the WHCA and for federal employees under the FECA program.", "Under a federal self-insurance system, benefits would likely be paid from a trust fund in a manner similar to the way that FECA and WHCA benefits are paid from the federal Employees Compensation Fund. The federal government could administer the program itself or hire a third-party administrator.", "There are several potential advantages to having the federal government self-insure for DBA hazards. First, rather than paying insurance premiums, the federal government would only be responsible for paying the actual cost of claims and administration. Given that claims make up just over 25% of total costs paid for DBA insurance under the LOGCAP contract, the federal government could potentially see cost savings through self-insurance. In addition, issues involving premium loading and the charging of DBA insurance premiums on non-covered components of payroll such as hazard pay would be eliminated if the federal government self-insured.", "Second, the use of the federal government as self-insurer would eliminate the need to distinguish between DBA and WHCA claims, because every claim would be paid by the federal government. There is evidence that the current process, in which the federal government identifies WHCA claims after they have been paid as DBA claims and then reimburses insurers for claim and administrative costs, results in the federal government paying significant amounts that do not go directly to claimants. Over the past six years under the WHCA, the federal government has paid more in reimbursements to insurers for expenses ($19.7 million) than it has paid in compensation to claimants ($12.1 million).", "There is also evidence, including testimony provided by DBA and WHCA claimants at a 2009 House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing, that in some cases, claimants with injuries that clearly fall under the statutory requirements of the WHCA must first navigate procedural and other requirements of their contractors' DBA insurers before their cases are eventually transferred to DOL. In some cases, DBA insurers controvert claims or oppose specific benefits for claims that are likely to end up at the DOL under the WHCA. Under the current system, insurers have the right and responsibility to investigate all claims and controvert or oppose claims and benefits they feel are not their responsibility or that fall outside of the DBA. However, this can cause delays for claimants, including claimants with clear WHCA cases that will eventually be paid by the DOL.", "Having the federal government self-insure for DBA hazards would change the historic private nature of the DBA program and place the program at odds with the privatized LHWCA program. In addition, federal self-insurance for DBA claims would go against current trends in state workers' compensation programs. Exclusive state funds, in which the state pays all workers' compensation claims, are being replaced either by state funds that compete on the open market with private carriers, or by systems in which all workers' compensation insurance is provided privately.", "The DOD, in its 2009 report to Congress on DBA insurance alternatives, stated that a self-insurance system, in which none of the costs of employee-injuries or deaths would be paid by the employer, could result in moral hazard. Contracting firms with no financial stake in the health and safety of their employees may take additional risks or compromise procedures without any fear of ultimately having to pay, through higher insurance premiums, for the negative consequences of these actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Analysis of DBA Reform Options", "paragraphs": ["In September 2009, in response to Section 843 of the NDAA, the DOD reported to Congress the results of its review of various possible acquisition strategies for providing DBA insurance to its contractors.

Minimize overhead costs associated with obtaining DBA insurance; 2. Minimize the costs of coverage consistent with realistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of incurred claims by contractors; 3. Provide for a correlation of premiums paid in relation to claims incurred that is modeled on the best practices in government and industry for similar kinds of insurance; 4. Provide for a low level of risk to the DOD; 5. Provide for a competitive marketplace for insurance required by the DBA to the maximum extent practicable; and 6. Consider implementation issues.", "The DOD's analysis of the four alternatives evaluated against the six criteria resulted in the highest rankings for Alternative A: improvements to the existing open-market DBA system; and Alternative D: federal self-insurance with third-party administration. Specifically, improving the existing open-market system was predicted to best minimize overhead and coverage costs; provide the best correlation of premiums paid to claims incurred; and provided the lowest risk to DOD. Federal self-insurance with third-party administration was predicted to best provided for a competitive marketplace and be the easiest to implement.", "Although the DOD's analysis of four major policy alternatives is comprehensive, there are limitations to its utility as a guide for Congress in making changes to the overall DBA system. The DOD report only focuses on DOD contractors and while these make up the bulk of DBA-covered firms, other contracting agencies, such as DOS and USAID may have different experiences and issues than DOD and DOD's recommended policy changes may not be as successful if applied across the entire federal government.", "Two of the six criteria used to evaluate the four alternatives also serve to limit the utility of the DOD analysis. Congress required DOD to consider the how each alternative provided for a competitive DBA marketplace. This requirement may have biased the study against policy options, such as self-insurance or single or limited-source contracts for DBA insurance which, by definition, do not support a competitive marketplace but which may still be viable policy options for Congress to consider.", "In its analysis, DOD added an additional criteria based on the ease of policy implementation. Evaluations of alternatives against this criterion were based, in part, on how quickly policy changes could be made and whether or not federal laws or regulations would need to be changed. it is understandable that DOD would consider this criterion necessary, given the time and cooperation within the executive branch and with the Congress that regulatory and statutory changes would require. However, when looking at alternatives for making changes to the national DBA program, Congress may not want to limit itself to alternatives that provide for easy implementation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improvements to the Current Open-Market DBA System", "paragraphs": ["The DOD report identified making improvements to the existing open-market DBA system as one of the preferred alternatives. Specifically, the DOD report suggests four improvements to the current DBA insurance system. First, all approved DBA carriers should have access to comprehensive data on losses and costs. In its discussions with industry representatives, the DOD found that some carriers felt that they were at a competitive disadvantage without this data as more than 75% of the DOD DBA market is covered by a single carrier, AIG. In addition, unlike in conventional workers' compensation insurance, there is no national clearinghouse, such as the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), for loss and cost data.", "Second, the DOL should be given the authority to establish a program of assigned risk pools for the DBA program and require that large insurers provide coverage to pool members. An assigned risk pool would assure that small contractors, those that are high-insurance risks, or contractors otherwise unable to secure DBA insurance would be covered at reasonable rates and that all major DBA insurance carriers would share the risks of providing insurance to these contractors.", "The DOD also recommends requiring that insurance carriers separate out the pricing of DBA insurance from other types of insurance, such as accidental death and dismemberment and ransom insurance.
