Commitments to specific carbon emissions targets over time, or to a specific schedule of carbon costs (whatever form they may take) may be greatly affected by the success of the underlying measures relied upon to achieve them. Notwithstanding the best efforts of federal policy makers, it is possible that, given the uncertainties each faces, few if any of the major measures proposed to moderate U.S. carbon emissions will achieve their anticipated impacts in a 20-year time frame. As Congress considers implementing CO2 policies, keeping a close eye on the technology and market developments associated with every key measure could be a priority.

In the electricity sector, these measures typically include some combination of energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear power, advanced fossil-fuel power generation, carbon capture and sequestration, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and distributed energy resources. Figure 1 illustrates the CO 2 abatement potential of these measures in the electricity sector as estimated in a widely cited analysis by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). In the EPRI example, overall CO 2 emissions associated with the electricity sector would be reduced below 1990 levels by 2030. Other studies have generated their own projections, with alternative targets and assumptions leading to distinct trajectories for CO 2 emissions and different contributions from the various abatement measures.", "Analyses like that in Figure 1 are important for understanding the potential opportunities and limitations of specific technological measures which may be needed to meet CO 2 abatement goals. However, with their focus on technical potential, such studies often have difficulty conveying in a straightforward way the key infrastructural, environmental, regulatory, or operational uncertainties which might affect how much of that potential could practically be achieved. These uncertainties, nonetheless, are of critical concern to legislators overseeing existing carbon-related programs or considering future CO 2 abatement policies. In addition to their technical aspects, Congress faces a need to gauge the overall viability of specific CO 2 abatement measures\u2014what are their prospects for helping to achieve CO 2 targets in the electricity sector.

Unlike large physical infrastructure, however, such as power plants or electric transmission lines, conservation impacts do not necessarily \"scale up\" to achieve greater impacts simply by increasing the size or funding of a given conservation program. Efficiency potential is also extremely diffuse\u2014existing literally at the individual light socket level in nearly every household.

Transmission owners, in agreement with the DOE, have pointed to transmission grid constraints as the single greatest impediment to aggressive wind power expansion.", "Although there is sufficient evidence showing that wind generation can be reliably integrated into the electricity system, ... obstacles to new generation sources continue to exist due to the lack of adequate transmission system access.

While such plans put a needed focus on some of the specific requirements for a U.S. transmission upgrade, marshaling the level of investment to expand transmission capacity quickly could stress the supply and price of materials, labor, and other resources. Any wind power project requiring the construction of extensive new transmission infrastructure from remote to populated areas also could face concerted community opposition to the siting of those transmission lines.

(Technology is currently available for capturing CO 2 from certain industrial processes, such as ammonia production, or natural gas processing, but the volumes of CO 2 emitted from coal-fired power plants dwarf any current industrial process in use today.) Various new CCS technologies have been tested successfully in laboratories, and some are being demonstrated in limited capacity field trials, but they are costly and face technical challenges to reaching commercial scale. Consequently, analysts disagree as to whether, when, and how CCS technology might be widely available in the United States at a cost competitive with commercially available technologies for generating electricity\u2014particularly natural gas turbines. Policies that impose costs on generators for CO 2 emissions, such as carbon taxes or cap-and-trade programs, presumably, would benefit CCS competitiveness, but they, too, are highly uncertain and constrained by other economic factors. As one study notes, \"[t]he success of a cap-and-trade program in spurring widespread CCS deployment depends on a wide range of factors that cannot be controlled or even predicted in advance.\"", "A review of recent studies reveals a broad range of opinion as to how quickly CCS could be commercially deployed on large scale.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2005 report on CCS technology states that \"many integrated assessment analyses ... foresee the large-scale deployment of CCS systems within a few decades from the start of any significant regime for mitigating global warming.\" A coalition including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and other public interest groups asserts that \"the best-case scenario is that [CCS] technology would be ready by 2030.\" Referring to IEA's long term projections for carbon control, the OECD states that \"there must be significant doubt as to whether or not it is feasible to achieve the assumed contribution from CCS by 2030.\"", "Given the range of expectations for CCS technology readiness, policy makers may not be able to establish to their satisfaction the contribution this technology may make to CO 2 emissions abatement.

So I'm hopeful that carbon capture and storage could be part of the solution, but ... one just has to put a big question mark on it.\" Echoing this view, Nobel laureate Steven Chu, Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and nominee for Secretary of Energy, reportedly has remarked, \"it's not guaranteed we have a solution for coal.\" Accordingly, the key uncertainty for policy makers regarding CCS is if and when the technology might be available for widespread deployment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Plug-in Electric Hybrid Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["A recent development in advanced vehicle technologies is the potential introduction in the next few years of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). PHEVs, like commercially available hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), would combine an electric motor and battery pack with an internal combustion engine to improve overall fuel efficiency. PHEVs would use a much higher-capacity battery pack than a typical HEV, however, and would be able charge the vehicle on grid power rather than solely by the combustion engine during operation. With their larger batteries, PHEVs could achieve an all-electric range of 20 to 40 miles (the average commuting distance). By using grid electricity rather than gasoline in this way, PHEVs could lower overall fuel-cycle pollutant emissions\u2014including CO 2 emissions\u2014from vehicles. Accordingly, many analysts and policy makers believe PHEV's offer substantial opportunities to reduce the nation's overall CO 2 emissions. A 2007 joint EPRI-Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) study, for example, concluded that, through the widespread adoption of PHEV technology, \"cumulative [CO 2 ] savings from 2010 to 2050 can be large.\" The Obama-Biden presidential campaign pledged to \"[p]ut 1 million plug-in hybrid cars ... on the road by 2015.\"", "While PHEVs are an innovative technology, there are important questions about the impact PHEVs may have on CO 2 emissions over the next 20 ot 30 years. One key uncertainty is whether such vehicles would be purchased in sufficient numbers (approximately 50% of new car sales by 2025, according to the EPRI/NRDC study) to have a significant carbon impact despite their high cost. PHEVs are projected to retail for over $40,000 per vehicle in the near-term compared to approximately $28,000 for an HEV and $23,000 for a conventional vehicle. As a point of reference, conventional HEVs accounted for 2.4% of new vehicle sales in the United States through November 2008. Of greater uncertainty, perhaps, are the projected carbon emissions of power plants operating to supply PHEV electricity. As a general rule, PHEVs only reduce net carbon emissions if the power plants supplying them produce relatively little carbon per kWh. But some studies show that, if the U.S. generation portfolio does not significantly reduce its overall carbon intensity, widespread adoption of PHEVs through 2030 may have only a small effect on, and might actually increase, net CO 2 emissions. Thus, the carbon abatement potential of PHEVs is largely dependent upon the concurrent implementation of renewables, nuclear power, and CCS\u2014each of which face great uncertainties of their own as discussed above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Distributed Energy Resources", "paragraphs": ["Distributed energy resources are small-scale power generation technologies located near homes or businesses to provide an alternative to, or an enhancement of, conventional grid power.

Distributed energy resources (DER) offer potential benefits to customers in terms of energy costs, power reliability, and power quality. DER technologies also can help mitigate CO 2 emissions because some use renewable energy sources, or, as in the case of CHP systems, they make more efficient use of fossil fuels than the utility power generation they displace.", "Among DER technologies, CHP is the most widespread, accounting for nearly nine percent of U.S. electric generating capacity in 2007. CHP is also viewed as having the greatest near-term potential to reduce CO 2 emissions. A 2008 report from Oak Ridge National Laboratory concludes that, by achieving 20 percent generation capacity from CHP by 2030 (an \"aggressive target\"), the United States could avoid 60 percent of the projected increases in CO 2 emissions during that time. A 2007 study by McKinsey & Company further concludes that much of this added capacity could be installed at negative marginal cost.

As a United Kingdom government study stated,", "The complexity and novelty of some of the technologies, together with their need to be integrated into the built environment, often by players new to the energy business, means there is a significant gap between potential and delivery. Moreover, many of the technologies are not yet cost-competitive at their current state of development and with current fuel and carbon prices.", "Analysts also question whether policies imposing costs on CO 2 emissions would substantially increase DER adoption due to the existing alignment of carbon reduction and cost reduction objectives, even without carbon costs, and the fundamental economics of renewables.

For the measures discussed in this report, the key uncertainties can be summarized as follows:", "Energy efficiency \u2014Can the United States overcome socioeconomic barriers to achieve four times more potential savings than ever before? Renewable energy \u2014Will there be enough transmission for wind power? Is there enough land to grow the needed biomass? Nuclear power \u2014Could the United States build new plants fast enough to matter? Advanced coal power \u2014Will banks fund them and regulators approve them?

It is beyond the scope of this report to examine each of these proposals, but they include the broadest range of policy instruments at government's disposal: higher efficiency standards, new regulatory authorities, tax incentives, direct subsidies, research and development (R&D) grants, environmental rules, public information campaigns, and a host of other policy instruments. Specific examples include calls for more federally-funded CCS demonstration projects and proposals for federal preemption of state siting authority to promote new transmission development. While they run the gamut, it remains to be seen which proposals may be pursued by Congress and what effects they would have. Consequently, the overall success of a multi-measure CO 2 mitigation scheme such as that proposed by EPRI in Figure 1 , and its economic underpinnings, is inherently unpredictable.", "The cost of building and operating coal plants with and without CCS systems, the cost of natural gas, nuclear power and renewable sources of power, the cost of emissions offsets from outside the utility sector, and ultimately the market price of CO 2 itself are all variables that will dictate the decisions of future power plant developers.

This report does not independently assess the likelihood of particular measures meeting any specific CO 2 reduction target.

It is, therefore, entirely possible that a portfolio of CO 2 measures such as those in Figure 1 , implemented under the optimum subset of policies currently under debate, could achieve the types of carbon reductions projected. Indeed, EPRI has characterized its CO 2 scenario as \"very aggressive, but potentially feasible.\" Other CO 2 abatement analyses have also been developed in good faith with a similar belief in their practicality. Successfully reducing U.S. carbon emissions to 1990 levels, say, by 2030 would validate the overall policy approach as well as the specific measures comprising it.

Nuclear industry expansion, for instance, could easily fail to materialize, or the transmission grid could expand too slowly for sustained wind power development. In such a case legislators might need to revisit both the enabling policies for the underperforming measures and for the carbon strategy as a whole.", "One obvious solution could be to rely on more successful measures to compensate for the underperforming ones. As the OECD study posits, \"if CCS and/or end-use efficiency fail to achieve the required targets, it follows that other technologies, including nuclear power, will need to make bigger contributions to fill the gap.\" But based on a review of the relevant research cited in this report, such an approach may simply not be realistic. Since the CO 2 targets of the individual measures are already viewed by some analysts as \"ambitious,\" \"aggressive,\" or \" a major challenge,\" and there are questions as to whether the initial targets can be achieved, increasing those targets may stretch credibility and sharply increase the uncertainty of the overall CO 2 mitigation effort. Alternatively, legislators could revisit measure-specific policies to see if more intervention could improve their particular prospects. Larger tax credits for renewable energy, for example, could potentially improve the competitiveness of biomass generation, thereby encouraging biomass investment. Such an approach might still encounter difficulty making up for early underperformance of a measure in the out years, as CO 2 emissions are cumulative, but any improvement would arguably be helpful.

Alternatively, Congress might refocus its efforts on a single measure (e.g., CCS or nuclear power) restructuring its policies to expand the implementation of that specific measure far beyond its original targets. Congress could also reset its national CO 2 targets, deferring reduction goals until they are more in line with the maturation and implementation of the key CO 2 reduction technologies. In this case, legislators would signal acceptance that near-term targets could not be met and hope for greater success later in the century.

Numerous studies support the potential of specific measures to lower CO 2 emissions, but also identify key implementation uncertainties which may impact their overall viability. Congress is considering policies to address these uncertainties, but which policies may be implemented and how effective they may be cannot be known at this time.", "As the nation's CO 2 mitigation policies continue to develop, the inherent uncertainty associated with specific carbon measures may be a critical concern. Commitments, either domestic or international, to specific carbon emissions targets over time, or to a specific schedule of carbon costs (whatever form they may take) may be greatly affected by the success of the underlying measures relied upon to achieve them. The reverse is also true; a schedule of carbon costs may also influence the success of CO 2 abatement measures. Therefore, policy makers may benefit from a complete and integrated understanding of measure-specific uncertainties and the range of carbon outcomes they imply. As one study has concluded, \"explicitly including uncertainty in both technical change and in climate damages is important for understanding the relationship between technical change, climate change, and policy.... [O]ptimal policy is different ... when uncertainty is taken into account.", "As Congress considers implementing CO 2 policies, keeping a close eye on the technology and market developments associated with every key measure may be an oversight priority. Success or failure of any particular measure may be apparent early on in its implementation, affording an opportunity through quick action to make policy adjustments to improve a measure's chances for success, or to abandon it in favor of more promising options. Perhaps more importantly, given the complexity and scale of the carbon control problem, Congress may also find it useful to expect the unexpected in the electricity sector. Apart from the measures discussed in this report, new technologies, consumer behavior, or infrastructure developments (e.g., a rush to natural gas) may emerge rapidly and unexpectedly to change fundamental aspects of the nation's carbon emissions trajectory. One way or another, electricity supply will balance with demand\u2014but perhaps in unanticipated ways. The recent volatility in global oil prices is a relevant example of unexpected structural changes in energy markets. Balancing responses to energy market volatility and unexpected structural changes against the need for a predictability in R&D and private capital investment may be essential to maintaining the nation on course to meaningful atmospheric CO 2 reduction."], "subsections": []}]}}
