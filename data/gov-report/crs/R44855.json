Many new regulations\u2014mandated or authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203) or promulgated under the authority of bank regulators\u2014have been implemented in recent years. In addition, economic and technological trends continue to affect banks. As a result, Congress is faced with many issues related to the bank industry, including issues concerning prudential regulation, consumer protection, \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) banks, community banks, regulatory agency design and independence, and market and economic trends. For example, the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10) and the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155) propose wide-ranging changes to the financial regulatory system, and include provisions related to many of these banking issues.", "Prudential Regulation. This type of regulation is designed to ensure banks are safely profitable and unlikely to fail. Regulatory ratio requirements agreed to in the international agreement known as the Basel III Accords and the Volcker Rule are examples. Ratio requirements require banks to hold a certain amount of capital on their balance sheets to better enable them to avoid failure. The Volcker Rule prohibits certain trading activities and affiliations at banks. Proponents argue the rules appropriately balance the need for safety and soundness with regulatory burden. Opponents argue that current rules are overly complex, unduly burdensome, and difficult to enforce.", "Consumer Protection. Certain laws and regulations protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices. Regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and certain mortgage lending rules are contentious issues in this area. Observers disagree over whether CFPB authorities, structure, regulations, and enforcement actions appropriately balance the benefit of protecting consumers and the potential costs of unnecessarily burdening banks and restricting credit availability. A similar debate is about whether mortgage rules appropriately protect consumers and effectively align certain market incentives or unnecessarily reduce the availability of mortgages.", "\"Too Big To Fail\" Banks. Regulators also regulate for systemic risks, such as those associated with TBTF financial institutions that may contribute to systemic instability. Dodd-Frank Act provisions include enhanced prudential regulation for TBTF banks and changes to resolution processes in the event one failed. Proponents of these changes assert they will eliminate or reduce excessive risk-taking at, and bailouts for, these large banks. Opponents assert that market forces and bankruptcy law are more effective and less distortionary than the new regulations and resolution authorities.", "Community Banks. The number of relatively small banks has declined substantially in recent decades. Some analysts assert market forces and removal of regulatory barriers to interstate branching and banking are having a large effect, given that small banks are exempt from many recent regulations and have been consolidating for decades. Others assert small institutions have limited resources and are being unnecessarily burdened by regulation, especially because such banks are unlikely to contribute to systemic risk.", "Regulatory Agency Design and Independence. How regulatory agencies are structured and promulgate rules are also issues. Some assert that financial agencies' relatively high degree of independence from the President and Congress results in too little accountability in rulemaking; thus, their leadership structures, funding, and rulemaking procedures should be altered. Opponents of such measures maintain that financial regulator independence should be maintained because it allows regulations to be promulgated by technical experts with some insulation from political considerations.", "Recent Market and Economic Trends. Changing economic forces may also pose issues to the banking industry. Increases in regulation could drive certain financial activities into a relatively lightly regulated \"shadow banking\" sector. Innovative financial technology may alter the way certain financial services are delivered. Interest rates are likely to begin rising soon after a long period of low rates, which could present risks to banks. Competition and regulatory differences between banks and nonbanks with different charter types is an ongoing issue."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Banks play a central role in the financial system by connecting borrowers to savers and allocating capital across the economy. As a result, banking is vital to the health and growth of the U.S. economy. In addition, banking is an inherently risky activity involving extending credit and taking on liabilities. Therefore, banking can generate tremendous societal and economic benefits, but banking panics and failures can create devastating losses. Over time, a regulatory system designed to foster the benefits of banking while limiting risks has developed, and both banks and regulation have coevolved as market conditions have changed and different risks have emerged. For these reasons, Congress often considers policies related to the banking industry.", "Recent years have been a particularly transformative period for banking. The 2008-2009 financial crisis threatened the total collapse of the financial system and the real economy. Many assert only huge and unprecedented government interventions staved off this collapse. Others argue that government interventions were unnecessary or potentially exacerbated the crisis. In addition, many argue the crisis revealed that the financial system was excessively risky and the regulatory system had serious weaknesses. ", "Many regulatory changes were made in response to perceived weaknesses in the financial regulatory system, including to bank regulation. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( P.L. 111-203 ; Dodd-Frank Act) in 2010 with the intention of strengthening regulation and addressing risks. In addition, U.S. and international bank regulators agreed to the Basel III Accords\u2014an international framework for bank regulation\u2014which called for making certain bank regulations more stringent.", "In the ensuing years, some observers have raised concerns that the potential benefits of the regulatory changes (better-managed risks, increased consumer protection, greater systemic stability, etc.) are outweighed by the potential costs (e.g., reduced credit availability for consumers and businesses, and slower economic growth). Meanwhile, market forces and economic conditions continue to affect the banking industry coincident with the implementation of new regulation. ", "This report provides a broad overview of selected banking-related issues, including prudential regulation, consumer protection, \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) banks, community banking, regulatory agency structures and independence, and recent market and economic trends. It is not an exhaustive look at all bank policy issues, nor is it a detailed examination of any one issue. Rather, it provides concise background and analyses of certain prominent issues that have been the subject of recent discussion and debate.

Furthermore, some argue that in the presence of deposit insurance, commercial banks may be subject to moral hazard \u2014a willingness to take on excessive risk because of external protection against losses. In addition, failures can cause systemic stress and sharp contraction in economic activity if they are large or widespread. To make such failures less likely\u2014and to reduce losses when they do occur\u2014regulators utilize prudential regulation. These \"safety and soundness\" regulations are designed to ensure banks are safely profitable and to reduce the risk of failure. This section provides background on these regulations and analyzes selected issues related to them, including", "regulatory requirements related to capital ratios, including leverage ratios and risk-weighted capital ratios; and restrictions on permissible activities, such as the Volcker Rule (which restricts proprietary trading)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A bank's balance sheet is divided into assets, liabilities, and capital. Assets are largely the value of loans owed to the bank and securities owned by the bank. To make loans and buy securities, a bank secures funding by either issuing liabilities or raising capital. A bank's liabilities are largely the value of deposits and borrowings the bank owes savers and creditors. Capital is raised through various methods, including issuing equity to shareholders or issuing special types of bonds that can be converted into equity. Capital\u2014unlike liabilities\u2014does not require repayment of a specified amount of money, and so its value can fluctuate. ", "Banks profit in part because many of their assets are generally riskier, longer-term, and more illiquid than their liabilities, which allows the banks to earn more interest on their assets than they pay on their liabilities. The practice is usually profitable, but does expose banks to risks that can potentially lead to failure. While the value of bank assets can decrease, liabilities generally cannot. Capital, though, gives the bank the ability to absorb losses. When asset value declines, capital value does as well, allowing the bank to meet its rigid liability obligations and avoid failure.", "Based on these balance sheet characteristics, failures can be reduced if (1) banks are better able to absorb losses or (2) they are less likely to experience unsustainably large losses. To increase the ability to absorb losses, regulators can require banks to hold a minimum level of capital, liquidity, or stable funding. These levels are expressed as ratios between items on bank balance sheets and are called regulatory ratio requirements . To reduce the likelihood and size of potential losses, regulators prohibit banks from activities that could create excessive risks, implementing permissible activity restrictions .", "Banks have been subject to ratio requirements for decades. U.S. bank regulators first established explicit numerical ratio requirements in 1981. In 1988, they adopted the Basel Capital Accords proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)\u2014an international group of bank regulators that sets international standards\u2014which were the precursor to the ratio requirement regime used in the United States today. Those requirements\u2014now known as \"Basel I\"\u2014were revised in 2004, establishing the \"Basel II\" requirements that were in effect at the onset of the crisis in 2008. In 2010, the BCBS agreed to the \"Basel III\" standards. Pursuant to this agreement, U.S. regulators finalized new capital requirements in 2013, with full implementation expected by 2019; finalized a liquidity requirement for large banks in 2014, with full implementation expected in 2017; and proposed a funding ratio for large banks in 2016.", "Restrictions on permissible activities have also evolved over time and generally were made more stringent following the crisis to address potential weaknesses. Historical examples of such restrictions are found in Sections 16, 20, 21, and 32 of the Banking Act of 1933 (P.L. 73-66)\u2014commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall generally prohibited certain deposit-taking banks from engaging in certain securities markets activities associated with investment banks, such as speculative investment in equity securities. Over time, regulators became more permissive in their interpretation of Glass-Steagall, allowing banks to participate in more securities market activities, directly or through affiliations. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed two provisions of Glass-Steagall, further expanding permissible activities for certain banks. ", "The financial crisis elevated the debate over what activities banks should be allowed to engage in. Certain provisions in Dodd-Frank placed restrictions on permissible activities to reduce banks' riskiness. Section 619 of Dodd-Frank\u2014often referred to as the \"Volcker Rule\"\u2014differs from Glass-Steagall provisions in important ways. However, it was generally designed to achieve a similar goal of separating proprietary trading \u2014owning and trading securities for the bank's own portfolio with the aim of profiting from price changes\u2014from depository banking. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Ratio Requirements14", "paragraphs": ["Banks are required to satisfy several different regulatory ratio requirements. A detailed examination of how these ratios are calculated is beyond the scope of this report. This examination of the policy issue only requires noting that capital ratios fall into one of two main types\u2014a leverage ratio or a risk-weighted ratio. A leverage ratio treats all assets the same, requiring banks to hold the same amount of capital against the asset regardless of how risky each asset is. A risk-weighted ratio assigns a risk weight\u2014a number based on the riskiness of the asset that the asset value is multiplied by\u2014to account for the fact that some assets are more likely to lose value than others. Riskier assets receive a higher risk weight, which requires banks to hold more capital\u2014to better enable them to absorb losses\u2014to meet the ratio requirement.", "In regard to the simple leverage ratio, most banks are required to meet a 4% leverage ratio. The required risk-weighted ratios depend on bank size and capital quality (some types of capital are considered to be less effective at absorbing losses than other types, and thus considered lower quality). Most banks are required to meet a 4.5% risk-weighted ratio for the highest-quality capital and a ratio of between 6% and 8% for lower-quality capital. Banks are then required to have an additional 2.5% of high-quality capital on top of those levels as part of the \"capital conservation buffer.\" The largest banks are required to hold more capital than smaller, less complex banks. These ratios for large banks will be covered in the \" Enhanced Prudential Regulation \" section below.", "Some observers argue that it is important to have both a risk-weighted ratio and a leverage ratio because the two complement each other. Riskier assets generally offer a greater rate of return to compensate the investor for bearing more risk. Without risk weighting, banks would have an incentive to hold riskier assets because the same amount of capital must be held against risky and safe assets. Therefore, a leverage ratio alone may not fully account for a bank's riskiness because a bank with a high concentration of very risky assets could have a similar ratio to a bank with a high concentration of very safe assets. ", "However, others assert the use of risk-weighted ratios should be limited. Risk weights assigned to particular classes of assets could potentially be an inaccurate estimation of some assets' true risk, especially since they cannot be adjusted as quickly as asset risk might change. Banks may have an incentive to overly invest in assets with risk weights that are set too low (they would receive the high potential rate of return of a risky asset, but have to hold only enough capital to protect against losses of a safe asset), or inversely to underinvest in assets with risk weights that are set too high. Some observers believe that the risk weights in place prior to the financial crisis were poorly calibrated and \"encouraged financial firms to crowd into\" risky assets, exacerbating the downturn. For example, banks held highly rated mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) before the crisis, in part because those assets offered a higher rate of return than other assets with the same risk weight. MBSs then suffered unexpectedly large losses during the crisis. ", "Another criticism is that the risk-weighted system involves \"needless complexity\" and is an example of regulator micromanagement. The complexity could benefit the largest banks that have the resources to absorb the added regulatory cost compared to small banks that could find compliance costs more burdensome. Community bank compliance issues will be covered in more detail in the \" Regulatory Burden on Community Banks \" section later in the report.", "In addition to the specific issue of whether to use both leverage and risk-weighted ratios or just a leverage ratio, the role regulatory ratios in general play in bank regulation is a broader issue. Prudential regulation involves requirements besides capital ratios, such as liquidity requirements, asset concentration guidelines, and counterparty limits. Some argue that capital is essential to absorbing losses and, as long as sufficient capital is in place, banks should not be subject to some of these additional regulatory restrictions. However, others believe that the different components of prudential regulation each play an important role in ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions and are essential complements to bank capital. ", "Finally, whether the benefits of prudential regulation\u2014such as the increase in bank safety and the increase in financial system stability\u2014are outweighed by the potential costs of reduced credit availability and economic growth is an issue subject to much debate. Capital is typically a more expensive source of funding for banks than liabilities. Thus, requiring banks to hold higher levels of capital may make funding more expensive, and so banks may choose to reduce the amount of credit available. Some studies indicate this could slow economic growth. However, no economic consensus exists on this issue, because a more stable banking system with fewer crises and failures may lead to higher long-run economic growth. In addition, estimating the value of regulatory costs and benefits is subject to considerable uncertainty, due to difficulties and assumptions involved in complex economic modeling and estimation. Therefore, this issue is unlikely to be conclusively resolved quickly or easily."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["If Congress decides to reduce regulatory reliance on risk-weighted ratios, it could provide a statutory exemption for banks that otherwise demonstrate they are operating in a safe manner from being subject to risk-weighted ratios. These banks' regulatory burden could be further reduced by exempting them from other prudential regulation, such as liquidity requirements, stress-testing, and dividend limitations. Exempted banks could include those that satisfy a higher simple leverage ratio, or receive a high safety and soundness rating from the bank's prudential regulator.", "Another possible set of changes would be to change the risk weights assigned to specific asset classes. For example, in the case that an asset type was assigned a risk weight that was too high and would likely cause unwanted market distortions, Congress could mandate that asset type be assigned a lower weight. "], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Volcker Rule29", "paragraphs": ["The Volcker Rule generally prohibits depository banks from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring a hedge fund or private equity fund. Proponents argue that proprietary trading would add further risk to the inherently risky business of commercial banking. Furthermore, because other types of institutions are very active in proprietary trading and better suited for it, bank involvement is unnecessary for the financial system. Finally, proponents assert moral hazard is problematic for banks in these risky activities. Because deposits\u2014an important source of bank funding\u2014are insured by the government, a bank could potentially take on excessive risk without concern about losing this funding. Thus, support for the Volcker Rule has often been posed as preventing banks from \"gambling\" in securities markets with taxpayer-backed deposits.", "Some observers doubt the necessity of the Volcker Rule. They assert that proprietary trading at commercial banks did not play a role in the financial crisis, noting that issues that played a direct role in the crisis\u2014including failures of large investment banks and insurers and losses on loans held by commercial banks\u2014would not have been prevented by the rule.", "The effectiveness of the Volcker Rule in reducing bank risk is also disputed. While the activities prohibited under the Volcker Rule pose risks, it is not clear whether they pose greater risks to bank solvency and financial stability than \"traditional\" banking activities, such as mortgage lending. Furthermore, taking on additional risks in different markets might diversify a bank's risk profile, making it less likely to fail. Some suggest that restricting certain activities only at depository bank subsidiaries and allowing them at completely separate nonbank subsidiaries may appropriately protect deposits while allowing diversification in the larger organization.", "Some contend that the Volcker Rule imposes a regulatory burden that could affect banks' involvement in beneficial trading activities and reduce financial market efficiency. The rule includes exceptions for when bank trading is deemed appropriate\u2014such as when a bank is hedging against risks and market-making. This poses practical supervisory problems. For example, how can regulators determine whether a broker-dealer is holding a security for market-making, as a hedge against another risk, or as a speculative investment? Differentiating among these motives creates regulatory complexity and compliance costs that could affect bank trading behavior.", "In addition, whether relatively small banks should be exempt from the rule is a debated issue. Some observers contend that the vast majority of community banks do not face compliance obligations under the rule and do not face an excessive burden by being subject to it. They argue that community banks subject to compliance requirements, those with traditional hedging activities, can comply simply by having clear policies and procedures in place that can be reviewed during the normal examination process. In addition, they assert the community banks that are engaged in complex trading should have the expertise to comply with the Volcker Rule.", "Others argue that the act of evaluating the Volcker Rule to ensure banks' compliance is burdensome in and of itself. They support a community bank exemption so that community banks and supervisors would not have to dedicate resources to complying with and enforcing a regulation whose rationale is unlikely to apply to smaller banks."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["Several different approaches are available if Congress decided to amend the prohibitions mandated by the Volcker Rule. If it is determined that any ban on proprietary trading by commercial banks is unnecessary, unduly burdensome, or too difficult to enforce, then Congress could repeal the rule and not replace it with different prohibitions. If instead the issue is that the rule as currently formulated is problematic, then Congress could repeal the rule and replace it with different provisions, perhaps similar to those in the Glass-Steagall Act. Finally, if it is only the rule's applicability to small banks that is problematic, Congress could enact an exemption for a certain class of banks.

Unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices are prohibited. Fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in credit transactions based upon certain borrower characteristics, including sex, race, religion, or age, among others. In addition, banks are subject to consumer compliance regulation, intended to ensure that banks are in compliance with relevant consumer-protection and fair-lending laws. ", "For many observers, the onset of the financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the regulatory system as it related to consumer protection. In particular, many observers assert mortgages that were made using weak underwriting standards and arguably deceptive practices precipitated the crisis when the borrowers defaulted at increasingly high rates. In response, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB\u2014a new regulatory agency focused on consumer protection in financial transactions with wide-reaching authorities to regulate consumer financial products such as mortgages. In addition, other Dodd-Frank provisions directed agencies\u2014including banking regulators and the CFPB\u2014to implement new mortgage lending rules and amend existing ones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB Regulation45", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulators\u2014the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2014were charged with the two-pronged mandate of regulating for both safety and soundness (prudential regulation, discussed in previous sections) as well as consumer compliance. The CFPB was established with the single mandate to implement and enforce federal consumer financial law while ensuring consumers can access financial products and services. The CFPB also works to ensure the markets for consumer financial services and products are fair, transparent, and competitive.", "To achieve these outcomes, the CFPB was granted certain regulatory authorities over banks, as well as certain other nonbank providers of consumer products and services. Those powers vary based on whether a bank holds more or less than $10 billion in assets. Regulatory authorities related to consumer compliance fall into three broad categories: supervisory , which includes the power to examine and impose reporting requirements on financial institutions; enforcement of various consumer-protection laws and regulations; and rulemaking , which includes the power to prescribe regulations pursuant to federal consumer-protection laws that govern a broad and diverse set of consumer financial activities and services. ", "For banks with more than $10 billion in assets, the CFPB is the primary regulator for consumer compliance, whereas safety and soundness regulation continues to be performed by the prudential regulator. As a regulator of larger banks, the CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authorities. A large bank, therefore, has different regulators for consumer protection and safety and soundness.", "For banks with $10 billion or less in assets, the rulemaking, supervisory, and enforcement authorities for consumer protection are divided between the CFPB and a prudential regulator. The CFPB may issue rules that apply to smaller banks, but the prudential regulators maintain primary supervisory and enforcement authority for consumer protection. The CFPB has limited supervisory and enforcement powers over small banks. It can participate in examinations performed by the prudential regulator on a sampling basis. Also, the CFPB may refer potential enforcement actions against small banks to the banks' prudential regulators, but the prudential regulators are not bound to take any substantive steps beyond responding to the referral.", "The CFPB has been a controversial product of the Dodd-Frank Act. Some observers question if the CFPB as an institution is structured appropriately to achieve the correct balance between independence on the one hand and transparency and accountability on the other. The CFPB is led by a director rather than a board and is funded by the Federal Reserve rather than the traditional appropriations process. Some argue that a single director leads to a lack of diversity of viewpoints, and that funding outside the traditional appropriations process could result in a lack of accountability at an agency. The CFPB's relatively narrow mandate and the \"for cause\" removal protection for its director are also contentious issues. However, supporters of the CFPB argue other aspects of its structure provide sufficient transparency and accountability, including the director's biannual testimony before Congress and the cap on CFPB funding. They further argue it is important to ensure the CFPB is somewhat insulated from political pressures and can focus on the technical aspect of policymaking. This issue as it relates to all financial regulators is further examined in the section entitled \" Regulatory Agency Design and Independence \" found later in this report.", "Another policy issue is whether the CFPB's rulemaking and enforcement have struck an appropriate balance between protecting consumers and ensuring that consumers have access to financial products. The CFPB has implemented rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, but regulations it has promulgated under its general authorities\u2014such as oversight of auto lending and a rule that extends credit card-like protections to prepaid cards\u2014are at the center of this debate. Some observers assert lenders have been subject to unduly burdensome regulations and overzealous enforcement by the CFPB in recent years, resulting in costs that outweigh the benefits. They argue that CFPB regulation increases the cost of providing certain financial products to the point that institutions reduce the availability of needed credit sources. However, the CFPB came under new leadership on November 27, 2017, and has indicated it will review aspects of its regulation and enforcement. Some observers have since asserted that certain alterations in CFPB regulation and enforcement since the leadership change have made the agency too lenient toward certain financial service providers and unduly weakened consumer protections.", "Other observers believe the CFPB has struck an appropriate balance in its rulemaking between protecting consumers and ensuring that credit availability is not restricted due to overly burdensome regulations on financial institutions. Analysis of whether or the degree to which recent rulemakings have restricted the availability of credit is complicated by the concurrent effects of economic conditions and the financial crisis on credit conditions. Also, many significant CFPB rulemakings have been in effect only since early 2014 or later, and the lack of a track record and data is an additional barrier to conclusive examination of the issue.", "A third issue is whether the $10 billion asset threshold at which the CFPB becomes a bank's primary regulator for consumer compliance is set at an appropriate level. Many think having two separate agencies handle supervision for prudential regulation and consumer protection compliance would be unnecessarily burdensome for small banks. However, there is disagreement over the size at which that becomes the case. Supporters of raising the threshold argue it would appropriately reduce the regulatory burden on banks that are still relatively small, and \"would still be examined by their primary regulators who are required by law to enforce the CFPB rules and regulations,\" and the change would only mean banks \"wouldn't have to go through yet another exam with the CFPB in addition to the ones they already have to go through with their primary regulators.\"", "Critics of raising the threshold argue it exempts large institutions that warrant closer supervision.

Agency accountability could be increased by bringing it into the appropriations process or altering features of its leadership (e.g., by removing the director's \"for cause\" protections or replacing the directorship with a commission or board).

Very large institutions may be deeply interconnected with other financial institutions, and stress at one institution could quickly spread throughout the financial system. The resultant contagion effects could potentially cause devastating economic and social outcomes. If a TBTF bank believed government would intervene in such an event, the TBTF bank may take on excessive risks.

Generally, U.S. banks and BHCs holding more than $50 billion in assets are required to hold more capital than other banks. Enhanced liquidity standards require certain large BHCs to maintain enough liquid assets\u2014assets that can be easily converted into cash at low cost\u2014sufficient to cover net cash outflows that might occur during a 30-day period during a time of financial stress.

Furthermore, proponents argue that even if market participants are better able to identify risk accurately than are regulators, market participants have a higher tolerance for risk than society as a whole because they are unlikely to internalize the systemic risks associated with a TBTF firm's failure. In addition, regulators potentially have greater access to relevant information on risk than creditors and counterparties of large, complex, and potentially opaque firms. Finally, proponents assert that the practices required by the enhanced prudential regulation are \"best practices\" that any sophisticated, well-managed bank should follow to prudently manage risk.

They cite regulator inability or unwillingness to prevent excessive risk-taking at certain firms leading up to the crisis. In addition, they argue that regulators may have adapted to weaknesses raised by the last crisis, whereas the next crisis is likely to pose a novel set of problems. Some argue that large firms are \"too complex to regulate,\" meaning regulators are incapable of identifying or understanding the risks inherent in complicated transactions and corporate structures. This has implications for whether simple or complex rules would be more effective. One response to addressing this complexity is to make the regulatory regime more sophisticated, but some critics argue that this approach is likely to backfire and simple regulations are more likely to be robust. Others have argued that large firms are \"too big to jail,\" meaning regulators cannot take effective supervisory actions against firms if those actions would undermine the firm's financial health, and thus its financial stability.", "Furthermore, critics argue that creating a special prudential regulatory regime is counterproductive. They contend that placing a bank in the regime is signaling to market participants that the bank has a protected status and would not be allowed to fail. Thus, the government is in effect making TBTF status explicit, which potentially exacerbates the moral hazard problem. Instead of increasing the cost of being TBTF, firms in the special regulatory regime could end up borrowing at a lower cost than other firms (because, in effect, these firms would enjoy a lower risk of default).", "Even if an enhanced prudential regime worked at reducing large bank risk-taking as planned, from a systemic risk perspective it could partly backfire in other ways. If financial intermediation and risky financial activities are pushed out of banks that are regulated for safety and soundness, the activity may simply migrate to more lightly regulated institutions and markets. The result could be a less regulated, less systemically stable financial system. This issue is discussed in more detail in the \" Potential Migration to Shadow Banking \" section.", "Enhanced prudential regulation of large banks may face similar questions concerning cost and benefit trade-offs covered in the \" Regulatory Ratio Requirements \" section: the benefits of safer banks and a more stable system may come at the cost of credit availability and economic growth. The issue is further complicated in relation to TBTF banks because if their funding costs are too low in the absence of enhanced regulation, then increasing costs for these institutions may correct a TBTF market distortion.

Critics of the $50 billion asset threshold argue that many banks above that range are not systemically important. In particular, critics distinguish between regional banks (which tend to be at the lower end of the asset range and, it is claimed, have a traditional banking business model comparable to community banks) and Wall Street banks (a term applied to the largest, most complex organizations that tend to have significant nonbank financial activities). Others dispute this characterization, arguing that some regional banks are involved in sophisticated activities, such as being swap dealers, and have large off-balance-sheet exposures.

An example of such a regime existed prior to the crisis in which the FDIC had the authority to resolve deposit-taking institutions that failed.

Many of the largest financial institutions are organized as bank-holding companies (BHCs)\u2014parent companies that own many (sometimes thousands) of subsidiary companies that include at least one deposit-taking commercial bank as well as other subsidiaries, such as broker-dealers, asset managers, and investment advisors.

Proponents argue that such a resolution regime offers an alternative to propping up a failing BHC with government assistance or suffering the systemic consequences of a protracted and messy bankruptcy. They point to the similarities between the OLA and the FDIC's resolution regime, and note the successes of the FDIC's resolution process of large depositories\u2014such as Wachovia and Washington Mutual\u2014during the crisis. Those failures arguably were less disruptive to the financial system than the failure of Lehman Brothers\u2014a nondepository that went through the bankruptcy process\u2014even though Wachovia and Lehman Brothers were similar in size.

In addition, critics assert that the OLA gives policymakers too much discretionary power, which could result in higher costs to the government and preferential treatment of favored creditors during the resolution. In other words, it could enable \"backdoor bailouts\" that could allow government assistance to be funneled to the firm or its creditors beyond what would be available in bankruptcy, perpetuating the moral hazard problem. The normal FDIC resolution regime minimizes the potential for these problems through statutory requirements of least-cost resolution and prompt corrective action, but some expect that a resolution regime for TBTF firms would at times be required to subordinate a least-cost principle to systemic risk considerations. Therefore, a resolution could be more beneficial to creditors than the bankruptcy process.", "As an alternative to a special resolution regime, some observers call for amending the bankruptcy code to create a special chapter for complex financial firms to address problems that have been identified, such as a speedier process and the ability to reorganize. To some extent, these concerns are addressed in the bankruptcy code.

If those short-term incentives spur the receiver to avoid creditor losses, the only difference between a resolution regime and a \"bailout\" might be that shareholder equity is wiped out, which may not generate enough savings to avoid costs to the government.

Small banks also tend to operate within a smaller geographic area. In addition, small banks are generally more likely to practice relationship lending wherein loan officers and other bank employees have a longer-standing and perhaps more personal relationship with borrowers.

Many regulations, including some regulations resulting from Dodd-Frank, include an exemption for small banks or are tailored to reduce the cost for small banks to comply. In addition, during the rulemaking process, bank regulators are required to consider the effect of rules on small banks under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 ( P.L. 96-354 ) and the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act ( P.L. 103-325 ).

Due to the role of large institutions in the crisis, policymakers have been particularly focused on the systemic risk posed by large banks and ensuring that they are not \"too big to fail.\" As previously noted, the Dodd-Frank Act attempted to address this problem by imposing heightened prudential regulatory standards on the largest banks relative to small and medium-sized banks. Sometimes the argument is extended to assert that because small banks did not cause the crisis and pose less systemic risk, they need not be subject to new regulations. Opponents of these arguments note that systemic risk is only one of the goals of regulation, along with prudential regulation and consumer protection. They contend that precrisis prudential regulation for small banks was not stringent enough, as hundreds of small banks failed during and after the crisis.", "Another potential rationale for easing regulations on small banks would be if there are economies of scale to regulatory compliance costs. While regulatory compliance costs are likely to rise with size, those costs as a percentage of overall costs or revenues are likely to fall. In particular, as regulatory complexity increases, compliance may become relatively more costly for small firms. To give a simplified example, imagine a bank with $100 million in assets and 25 employees and a bank with $10 billion in assets and 1,250 employees each determine they must hire an extra employee to ensure compliance with new regulations. The relative burden is larger on the small institution that expands its workforce by 4% than on the large bank that expands by less than 0.1%. From a cost-benefit perspective, if regulatory compliance costs are subject to economies of scale, then the balance of costs and benefits of a particular regulation will differ depending on the size of the bank. For the same regulatory proposal, economies of scale could potentially result in costs outweighing benefits for smaller banks. Empirical evidence on whether compliance costs are subject to economies of scale is mixed.", "Some argue for reducing the regulatory burden on small banks on the grounds that they provide greater access to credit or offer credit at lower prices than large banks for certain groups of borrowers. These arguments tend to emphasize potential market niches small banks occupy that larger banks may be unwilling to fill, such as low-income or rural communities and other underserved markets. Empirical evidence is also mixed. Data that support these arguments include the fact that community banks held 71% of total deposits in rural counties in 2011, compared with 19% of overall deposits nationwide.

Often at issue in this debate are the so-called regional banks \u2014banks that are larger and operate across a greater geographic market than the community banks that have less than $10 billion or $1 billion in assets, but also smaller and less complex than the largest, most complex organizations with hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars in assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["If Congress decides that additional regulatory relief should be provided for small banks, it could continue to be provided under the current system of ad hoc exemptions.

However, experts disagree over whether greater discretion for financial regulators is appropriate.", "Some observers assert financial regulators should not be subject to a rigid legal structure when performing CBA. They claim that attempts to quantify the effects of financial regulation are imprecise and unreliable. These attempts entail making causal assumptions that are contestable and uncertain, and often face issues concerning data availability and accuracy. Also, financial regulation intends to induce behavioral, microeconomic, and macroeconomic responses, and these effects may be harder to quantify than regulations in other industries that lead to more measurable effects. ", "Others assert that financial regulators should be subject to stricter CBA requirements than they are now. They argue that requisite, quantitative CBA\u2014when it might yield a wide range of estimates or disagreements over accuracy between technical experts\u2014is necessary because it disciplines agencies in regard to what rules they implement, and allows for an objective assessment of whether a regulation is likely to achieve its goals and at what cost. Some claim that the challenges of performing CBA for financial regulations are not greater than for regulations for other industries, arguing that estimations of benefits and costs\u2014although challenging\u2014are possible."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["Congress has several alternatives available if it decided to change CBA requirements for financial regulators.

Similarly, Congress could require a certain degree of quantification be part of the analysis. In addition, certain findings in these CBAs could trigger a requirement to get a waiver from Congress before the rule can go forward.

CRA is an oversight tool that Congress can use to invalidate a final rule issued by a federal agency. It was enacted in response to concerns expressed by Members of both parties about Congress's ability to control what many viewed as a rapidly growing body of administrative rules. Many felt that as Congress delegated more power to agencies to implement law, the traditional oversight tools Congress possessed were not adequate. ", "The CRA requires agencies to report to Congress on their rulemaking activities and provides Congress with a special set of expedited parliamentary procedures that can be used to consider legislation striking down agency rules it opposes. These \"fast track\" parliamentary procedures, which are available primarily in the Senate, limit debate and amendment on a joint resolution disapproving a rule and ensure that a simple majority can reach a final up-or-down vote on the measure. Members of Congress have specified time periods in which to submit and act on a joint resolution of disapproval invalidating the rule. If both houses agree to such a joint resolution, it is sent to the President for his signature or veto. If a CRA joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, either by being signed by the President or by being enacted over his veto, the agency final rule in question \"shall not take effect (or continue).\" The act also provides that if a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted, a new rule may not be issued in \"substantially the same form\" as the disapproved rule unless the rule is specifically authorized by a subsequent law. The CRA prohibits judicial review of any \"determination, finding, action, or omission under\" the act.", "Observers have argued that the structure of the CRA disapproval process often renders the CRA largely unworkable as an oversight mechanism. A President is most likely to veto a joint resolution that attempts to strike down a final rule proposed by his or her own Administration or by a like-minded independent agency, and a supermajority is necessary to override a presidential veto\u2014something that has been historically rare. Therefor e, Congress typically has the opportunity to successfully block rules from taking effect only in period s between the start of a new Admin i stration \u2014and only when the new Administration's regulatory policy positions are more aligned with those of the sitting Congress than those of the previous A dministration\u2014and the expiration of the specified time period Congress has to act on a CRA resolution. The beginning of the 115 th Congress generally meets those criteria, and 14 disapproval resolutions had been enacted as of May 18th, 2017, but only one disapproval resolution had been enacted in the preceding 20 years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislative Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["If Congress decided to alter the CRA disapproval mechanism, it could change it from a resolution of disapproval to a resolution of approval . Such a change would mean that instead of rules automatically going into force unless Congress enacted a measure stopping them, some or all rules would become effective only upon the enactment of a law approving them. This mechanism would increase congressional oversight of which regulations would go into effect, but may politicize or unduly slow the promulgation of technical rules that would, on net, benefit society.

"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Migration to Shadow Banking", "paragraphs": ["Credit intermediation is a core banking activity and involves transforming short-term, liquid, safe liabilities into relatively long-term, illiquid, higher-risk assets. In the context of traditional banking, credit intermediation is done by taking deposits from savers and using them to fund loans to borrowers. Because bank assets are illiquid, an otherwise-solvent bank might experience difficulty meeting short-term obligations without having to sell assets, possibly at \"fire sale\" prices. Also, if depositors begin to feel their deposits are not safe, many of them may choose to withdraw their funds at the same time. Such a \"run\" on a bank could cause it to fail. Long-established government programs mitigate liquidity- and run-risk. The Federal Reserve is authorized to act as a \"lender of last resort\" for a bank experiencing liquidity problems, and the FDIC insures depositors against losses. Banks are also subject to prudential regulation\u2014as discussed in the \" Prudential Regulation \" section\u2014to ensure that risks are well managed and kept at reasonable levels.", "However, certain financial markets and instruments allow nonbank institutions to also perform similar credit intermediation to banks. Some observers are concerned that this nonbank credit intermediation\u2014sometimes called shadow banking \u2014poses significant risks, because it can be performed without the government \"safety nets\" available to banks or the prudential regulation required of them. The lack of an explicit government safety net in shadow banking means that taxpayers are less explicitly or directly exposed to risk, but also means that shadow banking may be more vulnerable to a panic that could trigger a financial crisis. Furthermore, some argue that the increased regulatory burden placed on banks in response to the financial crisis\u2014such as the changes in bank regulation mandated by Dodd-Frank or agreed to in Basel III\u2014could result in a decreasing role for banks in credit intermediation and an increased role for relatively lightly regulated nonbanks.", "Many contend the financial crisis demonstrated how these risks in the shadow banking sector can create or exacerbate systemic distress. Money market mutual funds are deposit-like instruments that are managed with the goal of never losing principal and that investors can convert to cash on demand. Institutions can also access deposit-like funding by borrowing through short-term funding markets\u2014such as by issuing commercial paper and entering repurchase agreements. These instruments can be continually rolled over as long as funding providers have confidence in the solvency of the borrowers. During the crisis, all these instruments\u2014which investors had previously viewed as safe and unlikely to suffer losses\u2014experienced run-like events as funding providers withdrew from markets. Also, nonbanks can take on exposure to long-term loans through investing in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or other asset-backed securities (ABS). During the crisis as firms faced liquidity problems, the value of these assets decreased quickly, possibly in part as a result of fire sales.", "Since the crisis, many regulatory changes have been made related to certain money market, commercial paper, and repurchase agreement markets and practices. However, some observers are still concerned that shadow banking poses risks. Furthermore, because banks now face more stringent prudential regulation, certain credit intermediation activities may \"migrate\" to nonbanks and the shadow banking system, where institutions are less burdened by regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Technology, or \"Fintech\"165", "paragraphs": ["Fintech usually refers to technologies with the potential to alter the way certain financial services are performed. Banks are affected by technological developments in two ways: (1) they face choices over how much to invest in emerging technologies and to what extent they want to alter their business models in adopting technologies, and (2) they potentially face new competition from new technology-focused companies. Such technologies include online marketplace lending, crowdfunding, blockchain and distributed ledgers, and robo-advising, among many others. Certain financial innovations may create opportunities to improve social and economic outcomes, but there is also potential to create risks or unexpected financial losses. ", "Potential benefits from fintech are greater efficiency in financial markets that creates lower prices and increased customer and small business access to financial services. These can be achieved as innovative technology replaces traditional processes that have become outdated. For example, automation may be able to replace employees, and digital technology can replace physical systems and infrastructure. Cost savings from removing inefficiencies may lead to reduced prices, making certain services affordable to new customers. Some customers that previously did not have access to services\u2014due to such things as lack of information about creditworthiness, or geographic remoteness\u2014could also potentially gain access. Increased accessibility may be especially beneficial to traditionally underserved groups, such as low-income, minority, and rural populations.", "Fintech could also create or increase risks. Many fintech products have only a brief history of operation, so it can be difficult to predict outcomes and assess risk. It is possible certain technologies may not in the end function as efficiently and accurately as intended. Also, the stated aim of a new technology is often to bring a product directly to consumers and eliminate a \"middle-man.\" However, that middle-man could be an experienced financial institution or professional that can advise consumers on financial products and their risks. In these ways, fintech could increase the likelihood that consumers engage in a financial activity and take on risks that they do not fully understand.", "Certain innovations can likely be integrated into the financial system with little regulatory or policy action. Technology in finance largely involves reducing the cost of producing existing products and services, and the existing regulatory structure was developed to address risks from these financial activities. Existing regulation may be able to accommodate new technologies while adequately protecting against risks. However, there are two other possibilities. One is that some regulations may be stifling beneficial innovation. Another is that existing regulation does not adequately address risks created by new technologies.", "Some observers argue that regulation could potentially impede the development and introduction of beneficial innovation. Companies incur costs to comply with regulations. In addition, companies are sometimes unsure how regulators will treat the innovation once it is brought to market. A potential solution being used in other countries is to establish a regulatory \"sandbox\" or \"greenhouse\" wherein companies that meet certain requirements work with regulators as products are brought to market. ", "Some are concerned that existing regulations may not adequately address certain risks posed by new technologies. Regulatory arbitrage\u2014conducting business in a way that circumvents unfavorable regulations\u2014may be a concern in this area. Fintech potentially could provide an opportunity for companies to claim they are not subject to certain regulations because of a superficial difference between how they operate compared to traditional companies. ", "Another group of issues posed by fintech relates to cybersecurity. As activity increasingly utilizes digital technology, sensitive data are generated. Data can be used to accurately assess risks and ensure customers receive the best products and services. However, data can be stolen and used inappropriately, and there are concerns over privacy issues. This raises questions over ownership and control of the data\u2014including the rights of consumers and the responsibilities of companies in accessing and using data\u2014and whether companies that use and collect data face appropriate cybersecurity requirements.

It accomplished this in part using unprecedented monetary policy tools such as quantitative easing \u2014large-scale asset purchases that significantly increased the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. Recently, as economic conditions have improved, the Federal Reserve has begun to raise its target rate, and increased attention has been given to how and when the Federal Reserve will normalize monetary policy. ", "A rising interest rate environment\u2014especially following an extended period of unusually low rates achieved with unprecedented monetary policy tools\u2014is an issue for banks because they are exposed to interest rate risk . A portion of bank assets have fixed interest rates with long terms until maturity, such as mortgages, and the rates of return on these assets do not increase as current market rates do. However, many bank liabilities are short-term, such as deposits, and can be repriced quickly. So although certain interest revenue being collected by banks is slow to rise, the interest costs paid out by banks can rise quickly. In addition to putting stress on net income, rising interest rates can cause the market value of fixed-rate assets to fall. Finally, banks incur an opportunity cost when resources are tied up in long-term assets with low interest rates rather than being used to make new loans at higher interest rates.", "The magnitude of interest rate risks should not be overstated, as rising rates can increase bank profitability if they result in a greater difference between long-term rates banks receive and short-term rates they pay\u2014referred to as net interest margin . Nonetheless, banks and regulators recognize the importance of managing interest rate risk, carefully examine the composition of bank balance sheets, and plan for different interest rate change scenarios.", "While banks are well practiced at interest rate risk management through normal economic and monetary policy cycles, managing bank risk through the next period of interest rate growth could be more challenging because rates have been so low for so long and achieved through unprecedented monetary policy tools. Because rates have been low for so long, many loans made in different interest rate environments that preceded the crisis have matured. Meanwhile, all new loans made in the last eight years have been made in a low interest rate environment. This presents challenges to getting a mix of loans with different rates. In addition, because the Federal Reserve has used new monetary policy tools and grown its balance sheet to unprecedented levels, accurately controlling the pace of interest rate growth may be challenging. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charters and Competition", "paragraphs": ["An institution that makes loans and takes deposits\u2014the core activities of traditional commercial banking\u2014can have one of several types of charters, including a national bank charter, a state bank charter, a federal savings association (also called a \"thrift\") charter, or a credit union charter. Each charter type determines what activities are permissible for the institution, what activities are restricted, and which agency will be the institution's primary regulator (see Table 3 ). A rationale for this system is that it gives institutions with different business models and ownership arrangements the ability to choose a regulatory regime appropriately suited to the institution's business needs and risks.", "The differences between institution business models and the attendant regulations are numerous, varied, and beyond the scope of this report. This examination of the issue only requires noting that (1) under each charter, an institution is subject to regulatory treatment and restrictions that differ from other charter types in certain ways and (2) these various institutions are to some degree in competition with each other for business, because although the business models may vary, all involve taking deposits and making loans. As a result, each type of institution has a stake in proposed changes to regulation related to all charter types. Institutions may assert some regulation that they are subject to puts them at a competitive disadvantage, whereas the other types of institutions oppose these assertions. Often, an effort by institutions of one type to relax their regulations will be resisted by institutions of other types. ", "The friction between credit unions and community banks is an illustrative example. The two types of institutions are similar in certain ways\u2014notably, they typically serve a small group of customers and engage in relationship banking, which involves familiarity with customers and local market conditions. However, there are key differences. For example, credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives with the purpose of serving the financial needs of members. Banks provide services to the general public for profit. On the basis of the differences, regulation of credit unions and banks differs. For example, credit unions face limits on the amount of member business lending they can do, whereas banks have no equivalent limitation. Meanwhile, banks are subject to regulatory evaluation under the Community Reinvestment Act ( P.L. 95-128 ) to determine how well they are meeting the credit needs of the community in which they operate. When credit unions advocate for easing business lending restrictions, banks object, arguing that it would allow credit unions to engage in activity beyond their mandate and expand into a business line more appropriate to banks. When banks argue that the Community Reinvestment Act should be extended to other types of institutions, credit unions object, arguing they already serve the credit needs of the community.", "These regulatory differences between these institutions are just two of many examples of institutions with different charter types disagreeing on what appropriate regulation should be. A broader and long-standing issue underlying these debates is to what degree the government should offer different charters\u2014with different benefits and responsibilities\u2014for businesses that engage in similar activities and whether the difference between the charters should be narrowed. The banking regulators try to minimize their regulatory differences through joint rulemaking and coordination through the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council\u2014an interagency body that prescribes uniform principles, standards, and report forms\u2014and commercial banks and thrifts no longer have separate regulators. However, differences remain between their regulations that Congress has considered addressing.
