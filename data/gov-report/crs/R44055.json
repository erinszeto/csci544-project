This is interesting because, in recent decades, the employment-population ratio has tracked the unemployment rate closely in the United States, though moving in opposite directions. Based on this pattern, the expectation was that falling unemployment would be met with a rising employment-population ratio; but this has not been the case. The new pattern points to significant changes in the labor force participation rate (i.e., a decline) that counterbalance the effects of a lower unemployment rate on adult employment.

As such it provides information about the magnitude of employment (relative to population), and the degree to which an economy is using a key productive resource (labor). This is important to labor market analysis, but has broader economic significance as well (i.e., to national output and growth).", "That the employment-population ratio gauges employment against population , and not the labor force , is an interpretational advantage over several other labor market indicators, including the unemployment rate. As the U.S. economy recovers from the most recent recession, considerable discussion has centered on the unemployment rate and how its decline should be interpreted. Analysts have debated the extent to which a falling unemployment rate indicates a strengthening labor market, or signals an exodus of discouraged workers from the labor force. ", "Unlike the unemployment rate, which assesses the job status of workers in the labor force, the employment-population ratio places employment in the context of a much broader group of potential workers (i.e., the adult population). This feature provides the employment-population ratio a degree of stability, because movement in and out of the labor force only registers in the numerator of the ratio. When the employment-population ratio rises, it means that a larger percentage of the adult population has a job. By contrast, the unemployment rate can fall without a corresponding rise in employment if unemployed workers leave the labor force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounts for Working-Age Population Differences and Growth", "paragraphs": ["Placing employment in the context of the adult population permits more meaningful comparisons over time and across countries than mere employment levels. Consider, for example, that approximately 136.6 million workers were employed in the United States in February 2000.

Despite the addition of 11.7 million workers, the employment-population ratio in February 2015 (59.3%) was 5.3 percentage points below the ratio for February 2000 (64.6%), indicating that the adult population grew faster than employment over that period. Similarly, controlling for population facilitates international comparisons, particularly between countries with markedly different population sizes. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summarizes the Net Impact of Market Forces on Employment", "paragraphs": ["The employment-population ratio has additional value as a summary measure when the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate send conflicting signals about employment growth. To see this, it helps to look at the employment-population ratio in terms of its principal components: (1) the rate at which the adult population participates in the labor market (i.e., the labor force participation rate), and (2) the proportion of jobseekers who are able to secure employment (i.e., employment rate of the labor force). In other words, the employment-population ratio describes concurrently the proportion of the adult population who want jobs and the success rate of this group in obtaining jobs . ", "This can be seen mathematically through a simple decomposition:", "That is:", "Because the labor force is the sum of all employed and unemployed workers (i.e., labor force = employment + unemployment), the expression can be re-written in terms of the unemployment rate:", "That is:", "Changes in the employment-population ratio are therefore determined by changes in the labor force participation rate and changes in the unemployment rate (or, equivalently, by changes in the labor force participation rate and the employment rate). All things equal, a rise in the labor force participation rate or a decline in the unemployment rate will increase employment. When they occur together (i.e., a simultaneous rise in labor force participation and drop in the unemployment rate), the employment-population ratio will necessarily increase. This is intuitive, because when a larger share of the population are seeking employment and finding it with greater success, employment will rise. Similarly, a simultaneous decline in labor force participation rate and increase in the unemployment rate will cause the employment-population ratio to fall. ", "The net impact on employment is less clear when the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate are both rising or both falling . In these cases, the employment-population ratio is a particularly valuable summary measure of these competing forces on employment. Under the both falling scenario, for example, the share of adults looking for jobs decreases (i.e., the labor force participation rate falls) but the portion of jobseekers who successfully find employment increases (i.e., the unemployment rate falls). Under these conditions, the labor force participation rate and employment rate place countervailing pressures on employment. Because it accounts for both factors, the employment-population ratio reports their net impact on employment. This feature of the indicator was particularly useful to labor market assessments following the 2007-2009 recession, when declining unemployment coincided with declining labor force participation.

For one, the employment-population ratio does not provide the full picture of labor market conditions.

On its own, the employment-population ratio cannot be used to assess labor force flows. That is, additional information is needed to determine whether a drop in employment represents more people exiting employment or fewer new entrants.

In addition to providing a long-term view of the employment-population ratio, the figure illustrates the indicator's cyclical nature. Sharp declines in the ratio coincide with each of the 10 recessions shown in the figure, followed by growth during expansions. Between 1960 and 2000, the employment-population ratio more than recovered from each economic downturn and followed an upward trend. After peaking at 64.7% in April 2000, however, the trend reversed. Although the employment-population ratio continued to rise during periods of expansion, its gains were not sufficient to offset the large declines that occurred during the 2001 and 2007-2009 recessions.

After that point, the unemployment rate falls steadily, with little movement in the employment-population ratio.

Demographics such as age and gender have played an important role in the recent decline in the overall labor force participation rate.

By contrast, men's labor force participation has declined steadily since the 1950s, and the pace of decline accelerated during the most recent recession. In January 1950, 86.2% of men participated in the labor market. This rate fell to 77.8% in January 1980 and 71.2% in January 2010. In February 2015, men's labor force participation rate was 69.4%.

Despite an increase in their participation rate over the past 20 years, older individuals' (55 years and older) participation rate is more than 40 percentage points below the rate for their prime-age counterparts. At the same time, younger adults (i.e., those in the 16- to 24-year-old-age group)\u2014whose participation rates are relatively low\u2014are delaying entry into the labor market and their participation rates are drifting further downward. See Figure A-1 for additional details on labor force participation trends by age.", "The employment-population ratio for the prime-age population is interesting in this context because this group is much less likely to be affected by retirement trends and schooling decisions than older and younger age groups. Their labor force participation rates are, however, likely to respond to overall labor market conditions, like labor demand, among other factors. Comparing employment-population ratio trends of the prime-age population to the full adult population (i.e., 16 years and older) can therefore provide some information about whether and to what extent the ratio's slowdown is influenced by economic versus age factors.", " Figure 3 compares the standard employment-population ratio (for individuals 16 and older) and the employment-population ratio for the prime-age population.

Since reaching its low-point of 74.8% in December 2009, prime-age workers have recouped more than half of the 4.9 percentage point loss in ratio. By contrast, the full adult population has recovered less than a quarter of its 4.6 percentage point loss.
