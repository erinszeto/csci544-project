Johnathan Baldwin Turner, a professor at Illinois College, championed a more accessible \"industrial education.\" His \"Plan for a State University for the Industrial Classes,\" presented at an academic conference\u00c2\u00a0in 1850, contained many elements of the yet-to-be established land-grant university system. ", "In 1857, Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont introduced a bill to establish colleges of agriculture through grants of land to the states. The bill proposed giving federal land, or rights to such land, to the states for the purpose of establishing these colleges. The federal government was already giving land to states to encourage the development of railroads, for example through the Land Grant Act of 1850 (9 Stat. 466). However, granting land to states to establish institutions of higher education was a novel prospect. Congress passed Morrill's bill in 1859 by a slim margin, largely along a North-South divide, and it could not overcome a Presidential veto by James Buchanan. Morrill, who had never attended college himself, presented the bill once again in 1862. The political landscape had changed by then, with onset of the Civil War and accompanying absence of Members of Congress from the southern states. Further, the second introduction of the bill expanded proposed areas of study at the colleges to include military strategy in addition to agricultural and mechanical arts. This bill passed overwhelmingly, and President Abraham Lincoln signed it on July 2, 1862. This first Morrill Act, described in greater detail below, marked the beginning of the U.S. land-grant university system. Notably, Lincoln signed the Morrill Act just seven weeks after signing legislation to establish USDA (12 Stat. 387, enacted May 15, 1862).", "Between 1872 and 1890, then Senator Morrill introduced twelve bills focused on strengthening the early land-grant university system. Congress passed the last of those bills, and President Benjamin Harrison signed into law the Morrill Act of 1890 (26 Stat. 417). This second Morrill Act provided funding for the land-grant university system and prohibited racial discrimination in admissions policies. It led to the establishment of a group of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) known as the 1890 Institutions.", "The land-grant university system further expanded in 1994 with the addition of a group of tribal colleges and universities (TCUs) now identified as the 1994 Institutions. Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico introduced the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act in 1993. This act became Sections 531-335 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization ( P.L. 103-382 ), and President William J. Clinton signed it into law on October 20, 1994.

It designated that each state would receive 30,000 acres of federal land for each member of the Senate and House of Representatives it had in Congress at the time. In cases in which insufficient public land was available, states would instead receive land scrip , or certificates of entitlement to such public lands. Money from the sale of this land or land scrip was to be used to support at least one college with the primary purpose of teaching agriculture and the mechanical arts, to \"promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.\" The act prohibited states from using the funds for constructing or maintaining buildings. ", "The Morrill Act of 1890 (26 Stat. 417; 7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.) responded to the need to finance the institutions established through the first Morrill Act. Today, the second Morrill Act is most recognized for its role in the establishment of HBCU land-grant institutions. It provided each state and territory with annual appropriations for the endowment and maintenance of the land-grant colleges. This money was to be used for instruction in specific academic disciplines, and for facilities for such instruction. The second Morrill Act prohibited racial discrimination in admission policies of institutions receiving these funds ( 7 U.S.C. 323 ) . However, it permitted states and territories to meet this requirement by establishing separate institutions \"of like character\" for white and non-white students. In such cases, annual appropriations would be divided \"equitably\" between the two institutions in a manner proposed by the state or territory and reported to the Secretary of the Interior. This condition ultimately resulted in the establishment of 19 federally recognized 1890 Institutions, primarily in the southeastern states. ", "Just over 100 years after the Morrill Act of 1890 facilitated the addition of HBCUs, the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-382 \u00c2\u00a7531-535; 7 U.S.C. 301 note) added TCUs to the land-grant university system. This act originally designated twenty-nine 1994 Institutions, considered to be land-grant institutions established in accordance with the Morrill Act of 1862 except for the manner in which they would be funded. In lieu of land or land scrip, annual appropriations would endow and maintain them. The Native American Institutions Endowment Fund was created in the U.S. Treasury, and interest payments are distributed annually on a formula basis. Institutions may use these endowment payments at their discretion.

Discoveries achieved through this research at land-grant institutions have improved the lives of producers and consumers in diverse ways. ", "The Hatch Act of 1887 (24 Stat. 440; 7 U.S.C. 361a et seq.) instituted the research function of land-grant universities.

They would aid \" ... in acquiring and diffusing among the people of the United States useful and practical information on subjects connected with agriculture and to promote scientific investigation and experiment respecting the principles and applications of agricultural science ... \" The Hatch Act provided for appropriations to support original agricultural research at these stations, distributed to the states based on a formula in the law. Federal funds distributed in this manner are referred to as capacity grants or formula funds. The Hatch Act ultimately led to development of State Agricultural Experiment Stations (SAES) in each U.S. state, insular area, and the District of Columbia. In the modern day, not all of these stations are physical places, and may be represented instead through individual or groups of researchers at 1862 Institutions, or at associated agricultural or research sites within the state.

However, Section 251 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act (AREERA) of 1998 ( P.L. 105-185 ) gave these institutions access to separate competitive agricultural research funding. AREERA amended the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 to authorize USDA to award research grants to 1994 Institutions on a competitive basis. This provision requires that the 1994 Institution applying for these funds certify that the proposed research will be conducted in partnership with the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), an 1862 or 1890 Institution, or a cooperating forestry school. Congress has provided appropriations for this competitive grants program.

Many factors have influenced this shift in funding sources. These include expansion of markets and increasing globalization of trade; laws and legal decisions since the 1970s that paved the way for intellectual property rights for biological innovations and commercial products derived from federally sponsored research; technical advances in biotechnology innovation that have increased potential profitability of agricultural research; and declining state investment in agricultural research since the 1990s.", "A 2012 report by President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) states that private industry has an important role in agricultural research, and that public funding is essential to meeting agricultural research challenges.

While receiving a waiver allows an 1890 Institution to receive its allocation of federal funding, such a waiver reduces the total public support for the institution, from the combination of federal and state funding, compared with what it would receive if a complete match was provided.
