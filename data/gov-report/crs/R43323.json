The bill's defense cap, while about $31 billion below the amount requested for defense programs by President Obama, was more than $20 billion higher than the FY2014 defense cap that had been set by the Budget Control Act (BCA) of 2011 (P.L. 112-25).", "President Obama's FY2014 base budget request of $552.0 billion in discretionary budget authority for the Department of Defense (DOD) and defense-related programs of other agencies (excluding war costs), exceeded by $53.9 billion the legally binding cap on defense funding for FY2014 that was enacted in 2011 as part of the BCA. Similarly, in their initial actions on the annual defense funding bills for FY2014, the House and the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees of the Senate approved defense funding totals (excluding war costs) that were very close to President Obama's so-called \"base budget\" (i.e., nonwar) request, regardless of the BCA cap.", "For DOD's base budget, both the version of the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act passed by the House (H.R. 1960) and the version reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee (S. 1197) also exceeded the BCA cap, differing from the President's request by less than $50 million. For war-related operations (\"overseas contingency operations\" or OCO), the Senate committee version of the authorization bill made few changes to the Administration's $80.7 billion request, while the House-passed bill added $5.4 billion.", "Similarly, the versions of the FY2014 DOD Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2397) passed by the House and reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee\u2014in conjunction with funding for military construction and for defense-related spending in other agencies in other appropriations bills passed by the House and reported by the Senate committee\u2014would result in total DOD base budget appropriations that would exceed the BCA defense limit for FY2014 by nearly as much as President Obama's initial request.", "Because legislation to fund the federal government in FY2014 had not been enacted prior to the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013, DOD, like most other agencies, was then subject to a lapse in appropriations during which agencies are generally required to shut down. Under an OMB-defined exception for \"national security activities,\" all active-duty military personnel and many DOD civilian employees remained on their jobs through October 17, 2013, when H.J.Res. 59, the FY2014 Continuing Resolution (P.L. 113-46) was enacted, allowing DOD and all other federal agencies to resume their normal operations through January 15, 2014. The resolution set funding at an annualized level equal to that provided by the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-6) after reductions made on March 15, 2013, by the BCA-mandated sequestration process. Excluding war costs, the FY2014 CR funds DOD and defense-related programs of other agencies (which comprise the \"National Defense\" budget function) at an annual budget of $518 billion for about one-quarter of the year . That annual total amounts to a $34 billion or 6.2% decrease from the President's request for the FY2014 DOD base budget. However, it would exceed the BCA cap on National Defense spending in FY2014 by $21 billion (or about 4%).", "If the BCA had not been amended, Congress would have had to cut the Administration's National Defense request by $53.9 billion (about 9.8%) to meet the BCA cap of $498.1 billion. But the FY2014 Continuing Resolution (H.J.Res. 59), which President Obama signed into law on December 26, 2013, raised the BCA caps on defense and nondefense discretionary spending for FY2014 and FY2015 in addition to funding the operations of the federal government through January 15, 2014.", "For National Defense, the new FY2014 budget limit is $520 billion rather than the original BCA limit of $498 billion. DOD's share of this new, higher total amounts to about $497 billion rather than $476 billion DOD would have been allowed under the original BCA cap. If Congress appropriates to these new limits, there would no longer be a need for an additional $20 billion sequester in January 2014.", "For FY2015, the new limit, higher limits set by H.R. 59 (compared with the original BCA caps) are $521 billion rather $512 billion for National Defense and $498 billion rather than $489 billion for DOD. In each case, the FY2015 spending limit is increased by $9 billion over the original BCA limits. The spending cap in FY2015 thus would be $1 billion above the FY2014 level. In subsequent years, the original BCA spending limits would remain in force, rising by FY2021 to $590 billion for National Defense and $564 billion for DOD in nominal dollars.", "In sum, the effect of the Murray-Ryan budget agreement embodied in H.J.Res. 59 is to set a cumulative limit for National Defense spending in FY2012-FY2021 totaling $5.447 trillion, which is $32 billion higher than the original BCA limit for that period. For DOD, the spending caps would total $5.202 trillion rather than $5.176 trillion, a $30 billion increase over the current limit. The FY2014 Administration's DOD budget plan for that decade totals $5.533 trillion, exceeding the proposed new limits by $326 billion or 6%.", "On December 26, 2013, the President signed into law H.R. 3304, a compromise version of the FY2014 NDAA. It authorizes appropriation of nearly the amount the Administration originally requested for the DOD base budget, taking no account of the new BCA defense spending limit, which it would exceed by more than $30 billion. Like the earlier versions of the NDAA passed by the House and reported by the Senate committee, H.R. 3304 also includes provisions bearing on several controversial policy issues including the armed services' handling of sexual assault cases and the treatment of detainees currently held at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.", "DOD and the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are drafting FY2014 appropriations bills that would comply with the new spending caps by cutting about $32 billion from the Administration's FY2014 DOD budget request.

Ryan and Senator Patty Murray, chairs of the House and Senate budget committees, respectively, and co-chairs of the group appointed to develop a budget compromise to avoid a sequester in mid-January 2014, introduced the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, which raises defense and nondefense budget spending limits under the Budget Control Act (BCA) for FY2014 and FY2015. On December 12, 2013, the House passed the proposal as an amendment to H.J.Res.59, the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014, by a vote of 332-94. The Senate passed the bill on December 18, 2013, by a vote of 64-36 and President Obama signed it into law on December 26, 2013.", "For FY2014, the bill raised the original BCA budget limit for National Defense (budget function 050) by $22 billion to a total of $520 billion, or $2 billion above the level set in the Continuing Resolution (CR) of 2014. For the Department of Defense (DOD), the new FY2014 limit was set at $497 billion rather than the current limit of $476 billion, just above the CR. If Congress extended the current CR level for the full year at these new limits, then there would be no sequester in January 2014. For DOD, the new limits would essentially be a nominal freeze, setting DOD spending at $2 billion above the FY2013 post-sequester level. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are drafting FY2014 funding bills for DOD and other agencies that would conform to the newly revised budget caps. ", "For FY2015, the new budget limit for National Defense would be $523 billion, or $9 billion above the current $512 billion limit. Similarly, for DOD, the new FY2015 limit would be $498 billion compared to $489 billion in current law, or $9 billion higher than the current limit, and $1 billion above the new limit for FY2014. In later years, budget limits would be the same as current levels. Altogether, over the FY2012-FY2021 decade, National Defense spending would total $5.447 trillion, or $32 billion (or 6%) above the current limit. DOD spending would total $5.206 trillion rather than $5.176 trillion, a $30 billion or 6% increase over current limits. ", "In addition to these changes in budget limits, the Bipartisan Budget Act also reduces the cost of living adjustments (COLAs) provided to military retirees under the age of 62 from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to the CPI less 1% while also increasing contributions to retirement by new federal retirees. Military retirees would receive a \"catch-up\" increase at age 62 that would raise their benefit level to an amount including full CPI adjustments for each year when they received reduced COLAs. and then receive full CPI adjustments after that. According to CBO, this change would save the Department of Defense $6.235 billion over the decade. ", "This CPI adjustment would apply to nearly all military retirees including those receiving military disability benefits and to people receiving survivor benefits. (This provision would not affect \"REDUX\" military retirees who already receive reduced COLAs of the CPI minus 1% in return for receiving a $30,000 bonus at 15 years of service.) Some Members have raised concerns about this reduction in retiree benefits. If enacted, this proposal could be re-considered at a later date since it does not go into effect until December 1, 2015.", "There are several potential scenarios that Congress may face in January 2014. On January 15, 2014, the current CR ( P.L. 113-46 ) lapses so Congress needs to either extend the current CR or pass individual or an omnibus appropriations act to avoid a government shutdown. To avoid a sequester, Congress needs to appropriate defense spending that complies with BCA limits that are in effect.", "If the new limits are adopted, and if Congress provides defense spending at the current CR for the full year, then there would be no sequester because the new defense limit matches the CR. According to press reports, the Department of Defense is currently spending at that level. If Congress adopts the new limits but provides defense appropriations that exceed BCA limits, however, then OMB would levy a sequester to ensure compliance with BCA limits.", "Under current BCA spending limits (without assuming passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013), a sequester would reduce defense spending by $20 billion, about 3.8% overall in mid-January 2014 to bring appropriations into compliance with the BCA. (The percentage cut to affected accounts, excluding exempted military personnel, would be about 5.8%.) This estimate reflects the amount by which the current CR exceeds the estimated $476 billion cap set in the Budget Control Act. If the new limits are adopted and matched by appropriations, the threat of a sequester would disappear.", "In other words, to the extent that defense appropriations breach or exceed whatever BCA limits are in effect, OMB must levy a sequester of whatever size is necessary to ensure compliance with BCA limits.", "In action on the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), on December 12, 2013, the House, by a vote of 350 to 69, passed H.Res. 441 , which adopted H.R. 3304 , effectively a conference version of the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act.

In general, the CR allows DOD and other agencies to spend\u2014during that period\u2014at the rate at which each appropriations account was funded by P.L. 113-6 , the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, taking into account the amount sequestered by the March 1, 2013, OMB order mandated by the Budget Control Act, enacted in 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ). For DOD, the current CR provides about $495 billion.", "Before passage of the CR, DOD, like most other agencies, was subject to a lapse in appropriations during which agencies are generally required to shut down because Congress had not acted on legislation to fund the federal government in FY2014 prior to the start of the fiscal year on October 1, 2013. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), however, identified a number of exceptions to the requirement that agencies cease operations, including a blanket exception for activities that \"provide for the national security.\"", "As a result, during the lapse in appropriations, some DOD personnel were \"excepted\" from furloughs, including all uniformed military personnel and some civilians, while other civilian DOD employees were furloughed and, thus, not permitted to work. Normally, \"excepted\" military and civilian personnel would continue to work but would not be paid until after appropriations are provided by law. Shortly before and during the shutdown, however, Congress passed and the President signed into law two pieces of legislation that appropriated funds to pay all active-duty military and some DOD civilian personnel costs in the absence of an enacted appropriation, and to provide death gratuities:", "The Pay Our Military Act ( P.L. 113-39 ; H.R. 3210 ), signed by the President on September 30, 2013, provided funds to pay all active-duty military personnel, most DOD civilians and possibly some private sector employees working for DOD; The Honoring the Families of Fallen Soldiers Act, ( P.L. 113-44 ; H.J.Res. 91 ), signed by the President on October 10, 2013, provided funds to pay death gratuities to survivors of military personnel who die while on active duty.", "For military activities of the Department of Defense that are covered by the FY2014 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Obama Administration requested authorizations for discretionary budget authority (BA) totaling $632.7 billion, including the following:", "$526.6 billion for the so-called \"base budget\"\u2014that is, for costs not associated with combat activities; $80.7 million for war costs, officially designated overseas contingency operations (OCO); $18.9 billion for defense-related nuclear energy programs conducted by the Department of Energy; and $7.4 billion for other defense-related activities.

The House bill, passed by a vote of 315-108 on June 14, 2013, would authorize hundreds of millions of dollars more than requested for various purposes, including a military pay raise, shipbuilding, and ballistic missile defense. However, that gross increase was almost entirely offset by several reductions which, according to the House Armed Services Committee, would have no adverse impact on DOD programs because\u2014in each of the affected accounts\u2014previously appropriated funds could be used in lieu of the requested new budget authority.

To the extent that annual appropriations exceed or breach the BCA caps, a sequester would reduce funding to the level of the caps by across-the-board cuts.", "President Obama sent Congress his FY2014 budget request on April 10, 2013, more than two months later than the legally prescribed date for submission of the budget. Uncertainties surrounding the final outcome of the legislative battle over appropriations for the preceding year accounted for the delay. The FY2013 appropriations for DOD and all other federal agencies were not enacted until March 26, 2013, when the President signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 ( H.R. 933 / P.L. 113-6 ). The amounts specified in that legislation were not final but, rather, were the points of departure for further reductions (by a process of \"sequestration\") required to comply with the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA), which was enacted on August 2, 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ). BCA caps apply only to the defense base budget, not to OCO funding.", "If current law had not been amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 to change the BCA spending caps, the Administration's $552 billion national defense budget request for FY2014 (excluding war costs) would have to be reduced by $53.8 billion (about 9.8%) to a total of $498.1 billion in order to comply with BCA limits. If defense appropriations exceeded the BCA limit, they would have been reduced to the BCA level by an across-the-board sequester to currently appropriated levels that would begin in early to mid-January 2014.", "Although the President's FY2014 national defense budget request does not meet the defense limits originally set in the BCA that would avoid a sequester under current law, the Administration argues that the President's budget would achieve\u2014through a combination of revenue increases and reductions to entitlement programs\u2014the $1.2 trillion total reduction through FY2021 that would result from the annual BCA caps. As a part of the Administration's overall program, the BCA would be amended to defer application of the spending caps, thus accommodating the President's FY2014 defense budget request.", "Consistent with the President's budget request, the House-passed FY2014 budget resolution ( H.Con.Res. 25 ) proposed $552 billion for national defense (excluding war costs). Subsequently, the House Appropriations Committee reported\u2014and the House passed\u2014the three appropriations bills that would provide defense funding up to that level: Defense ( H.R. 2397 , passed July 24, 315-109), Energy and Water ( H.R. 2609 , passed July 10, 227-198), and Military Construction-Veterans Administration ( H.R. 2216 , passed June 4, 421-4). ", "To achieve the FY2014 savings mandated by the BCA, the House budget resolution proposes higher cuts to nondefense spending as well as changes to entitlement programs which would bring discretionary spending for the year to $967 billion, the discretionary total allowed by BCA. But, within that total, the BCA establishes separate limits (or caps) for defense and nondefense spending. The House-recommended defense levels exceed the BCA defense cap so, if they were to become law, a 9.8% sequester cut would be levied in January 2014, unless Congress amended the BCA to change the currently binding limits. ", "Similarly, the Senate's FY2014 budget resolution ( S.Con.Res. 8 ) sets the total for national defense at $552 billion\u2014as requested by the President\u2014and the defense-related bills reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee are consistent with this level. Like the House budget resolution, the Senate measure assumes that BCA's limit on overall discretionary spending for FY2014 would be met. In contrast to the House resolution, however, the Senate resolution proposes to compensate for defense spending above the BCA level with a combination of revenue increases and entitlement spending reductions similar to those proposed by the Administration. However, if the level of national defense spending allowed by the Senate resolution were to be enacted, there would have been a $53.8 billion sequester cut to discretionary spending in early January 2014\u2014if the original BCA caps had not been amended by law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sequestration Flexibility in FY2014 and FY2013 Experience", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials have contended that sequestration would have serious adverse impacts on the services' combat readiness and modernization not only because of the size of the funding cuts required but also because of the relatively arbitrary way in which the reductions are made. In a fiscal year in which a sequester is triggered to reduce spending to the levels enacted in the BCA, by law the reduction must be achieved by cutting a uniform percentage from the \"budgetary resources\" of every program, project, and activity (PPA) in every budget account, except for those budget accounts and PPAs that, by law, either are exempt from a sequester or are subject to a special sequester rule. \"Budgetary resources\" include new budget authority for both the base budget and OCO and budget authority appropriated in previous fiscal years but not yet obligated.", "The sequestration process allows DOD some flexibility in implementing a sequester in ways that DOD used to limit the impact on readiness, investment accounts, and war funding in FY2013 and which might have similar results if sequestration were to be required for FY2014:", "The President has authority to exempt the military personnel accounts from a sequester, as he did in FY2013 and as OMB informed Congress on August 9, 2013, he will do, should a sequester occur in FY2014. Exercising this option could allow DOD to avoid involuntary separations of military personnel, but does not reduce the total amount that must be sequestered from DOD funds and, thus, entails correspondingly larger cuts from other DOD accounts. House and Senate conferees on the FY2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-6 ) defined as a single PPA the entire Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account of each service and reserve component. Therefore, DOD has considerable flexibility in allocating cuts within those relatively large blocks of money. So, DOD could make proportionally larger reductions in some O&M-funded activities\u2014facilities maintenance and training, for example\u2014in order to allow proportionally smaller reductions in other O&M-funded activities such as operational training or support for front-line combat units. DOD could avoid or minimize sequestration cuts in funds for war operations in Afghanistan because, although Congress authorizes and appropriates separate amounts for base budget funding and OCO funding, most funding of both sorts is co-mingled in the PPAs that are subject to sequestration. Thus a service could reduce its O&M funding for OCO by a proportionately smaller fraction provided it was offset by a proportionately larger reduction in the service's base budget O&M spending. DOD did, however, choose to reduce OCO funding by $5.3 billion to meet the FY2013 sequester. This may have reflected a transfer into OCO accounts in mid-May 2013 to meet unanticipated higher needs (see below). In some of DOD's investment accounts, unobligated balances of funds appropriated in earlier budgets were reduced by proportionally larger amounts to allow proportionally smaller reductions to newly appropriated budget authority. Among the 21 procurement accounts, budget authority appropriated for FY2013 was cut by an average of 5.2% while unobligated funds were cut by an average of 11.2%. Since DOD budget authority appropriated for procurement and most other activities expires if not obligated within a certain number of years, sacrificing older budget authority allowed DOD to retain more budget authority that would be available for a longer period. After sequestration, DOD could and did use established reprogramming procedures, which require prior approval by the congressional defense committees in some cases, to shift funds among accounts. In May 2013, the department requested congressional approval of reprogrammings that shifted nearly $9 billion to meet more essential expenses by tapping funds that had been appropriated to other programs. This included shifting some $5.1 billion of OCO funding, about $3.0 billion of which came from cancelled lower priority OCO needs, with the remainder from the base budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sequestration Alternatives in FY2014", "paragraphs": ["In recent months, many observers, including DOD witnesses and some Members of Congress, have raised particular concerns about sequesters, arguing that because they require largely across-the-board cuts to programs, this would not reflect priorities in defense spending.

The projection also assumed that DOD would be given a free hand to allocate the reduction, rather than applying the sequestration formula of program-by-program cuts. Even making those assumptions, Hagel asserted, \"the cuts are too steep and abrupt to be mitigated by flexibility, no matter how broadly defined.\"", "Secretary Hagel described the five-page document presenting the projected BCA impact as a \"high-level summary\" of an early version of DOD's approach to accommodating lower annual budgets than the Administration had projected.
