In general, H.R. 3962 would require individuals to maintain health insurance and employers to either provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment, with some exceptions. Several insurance market reforms would be made, such as modified community rating and guaranteed issue and renewal. Both the individual and employer mandates would be linked to acceptable health insurance coverage, which would meet required minimum standards and incorporate the market reforms included in the bill. Acceptable coverage would include (1) coverage under a qualified health benefits plan (QHBP), which could be offered either through the newly created Health Insurance Exchange (the Exchange) or outside the Exchange through new employer plans; (2) grandfathered employment based plans; (3) grandfathered nongroup plans; and (4) other coverage, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Exchange would offer private plans alongside a public option. Based on income, certain individuals could qualify for subsidies toward their premium costs and cost-sharing (deductibles and copayments); these subsidies would be available only through the Exchange. In the individual market (the nongroup market), a plan could be grandfathered indefinitely, but only if no changes were made to the terms and conditions of that plan, including benefits and cost-sharing, and premiums were only increased as allowed by statute. Most of these provisions would be effective beginning in 2013.", "The Exchange would not be an insurer; it would provide eligible individuals and small businesses with access to insurers' plans in a comparable way. The Exchange would consist of a selection of private plans as well as a public option. Individuals wanting to purchase the public option or a private health insurance not through an employer or a grandfathered nongroup plan could only obtain such coverage through the Exchange. They would only be eligible to enroll in an Exchange plan if they were not enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, and acceptable employer coverage as a full-time employee. The public option would be established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), would offer three different cost-sharing options, and would vary premiums geographically. The Secretary would negotiate payment rates for medical providers, and items and services. The bill would also require that the Health Choices Commissioner to establish a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) program under which the Commissioner would make grants and loans for the establishment of not-for-profit, member-run health insurance cooperatives. These co-operatives would provide insurance through the Exchange.", "Only within the Exchange, credits would be available to limit the amount of money certain individuals would pay for premiums and for cost-sharing (deductibles and copayments).

CBO projects the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over the 10-year period of 2010-2019 and, by 2019, would insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population. The gross 10-year cost of the Exchange subsidies ($610 billion), increased federal Medicaid expenditures ($425 billion), and tax credits for small employers ($25 billion) would total $1.052 trillion.

This information is useful in setting the stage for understanding how and where H.R. 3962 would reform health insurance. The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in Division A of H.R. 3962 , passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009. Although most of the provisions would be effective beginning in 2013, the table in the Appendix shows the timeline for implementing provisions effective prior to 2013.", "Although the description that follows segments the private health insurance provisions into various categories, these provisions are interrelated and interdependent. For example, H.R. 3962 includes a number of provisions to alter how current private health insurance markets function, primarily for individuals who purchase coverage directly from an insurer or through a small employer. H.R. 3962 would require that insurers not exclude potential enrollees or charge them premiums based on pre-existing health conditions. In a system where individuals voluntarily choose whether to obtain health insurance, however, individuals may choose to enroll only when they become sick, known as \"adverse selection,\" which can lead to higher premiums and greater uninsurance. When permitted, insurers often guard against adverse selection by adopting policies such as excluding preexisting conditions. If reform eliminates many of the tools insurers use to guard against adverse selection then, instead, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the association that represents health insurers, has stated that individuals must be required to purchase coverage, so that not just the sick enroll.", "Furthermore, some individuals currently forgo health insurance because they cannot afford the premiums. If individuals are required to obtain health insurance, one could argue that adequate premium subsidies must be provided by the government and/or employers to make practical the individual mandate to obtain health insurance, which is in turn arguably necessary to make the market reforms possible. In addition, premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies may provide individuals with health insurance that they cannot afford to use. So, while the descriptions below discuss various provisions separately, the removal of one from the bill could be deleterious to the implementation of the others.", "The private health insurance provisions are presented under the following topics within Division A of H.R. 3962 :", "Individual and employer mandates: the requirement on individuals to maintain health insurance and on employers to either provide health insurance or pay into the Exchange, with penalties and taxes for noncompliance. Private health insurance market reforms. Immediate Reforms. Health Insurance Exchange, through which the following can only be offered: Public health insurance option. Premium and cost-sharing subsidies. CO-OP Program. Selected revenue provisions related to health insurance. Other Provisions Abortion. Medical malpractice. End-of-life care. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Americans obtain health insurance in different settings and through a variety of methods. People may get health coverage in the private sector or through a publicly funded program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance. Employers choosing to offer health coverage may either purchase insurance or choose to self-fund health benefits for their employees. Other individuals obtained coverage on their own in the nongroup market. However, there is no federal law that either requires individuals to have health insurance or requires employers to offer health insurance. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008.", "Individuals and employers choosing to purchase health insurance in the private market fit into one of the three segments of the market, depending on their situation\u2014the large group (large employer) market, the small group market, and the nongroup market.", "More than 95% of large employers offer coverage. Large employers are generally able to obtain lower premiums for a given health insurance package than small employers and individuals seeking nongroup coverage. This is partly because larger employers enjoy economies of scale and a larger \"risk pool\" of enrollees, which makes the expected costs of care more predictable. Employers generally offer large subsidies toward health insurance, thus making it more attractive for both the healthier and the sicker workers to enter the pool. So, not only is the risk pool larger in size, but it is more diverse. States have experimented with ways to create a single site where individuals and small employers could compare different insurance plans, obtain coverage, and sometimes pool risk. Although most of these past experiments failed (e.g., California's PacAdvantage ), other states have learned from these experiences and have fashioned potentially more sustainable models (e.g., Massachusetts' Connector ). There are private-sector companies that also serve the role of making various health insurance plans easier to compare for individuals and small groups (e.g., eHealthInsurance), available in most, but not all, states because of variation in states' regulations.", "Less than half of all small employers (less than 50 employees) offer health insurance coverage; such employers cite cost as the primary reason for not offering health benefits. One of the main reasons is a small group's limited ability to spread risk across a small pool. Insurers generally consider small firms to be less stable than larger pools, as one or two employees moving in or out of the pool (or developing an illness) would have a greater impact on the risk pool than they would in large firms. Other factors that affect a small employer's ability to provide health insurance include certain disadvantages small firms have in comparison with their larger counterparts: small groups are more likely to be medically underwritten, have relatively little market power to negotiate benefits and rates with insurance carriers, and generally lack economies of scale. Allowing these firms to purchase insurance through a larger pool, such as an Association, Gateway or an Exchange, could lower premiums for those with high-cost employees.", "Depending on the applicable state laws, individuals who purchase health insurance in the nongroup market may be rejected or face premiums based on their health status, which can make premiums lower for the healthy but higher for the sick. Even when these individuals obtain coverage, there may be exclusions for certain conditions. Reforms affecting premiums ratings would likely increase premiums for some, while lowering premiums for others, depending on their age, health, behaviors, and other factors.", "States are the primary regulators of the private health insurance market, though some federal regulation applies, mostly affecting employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI). The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that coverage sold to small groups (2-50 employees) must be sold on a guaranteed issue basis. That is, the issuer must accept every small employer that applies for coverage. All states require issuers to offer policies to firms with 2-50 workers on a guaranteed issue basis, in compliance with HIPAA. As of January 2009 in the small group market, 13 states also require issuers to offer policies on a guaranteed issue basis to the self-employed \"groups of one.\" And as of December 2008 in the individual market, 15 states require issuers to offer some or all of their insurance products on a guaranteed issue basis to non-HIPAA eligible individuals.", "Most states currently impose premium rating rules on insurance carriers in the small group and individual markets. The spectrum of existing state rating limitations ranges from pure community rating to adjusted (or modified) community rating, to rate bands, to no restrictions. Under pure community rating, all enrollees in a plan pay the same premium, regardless of their health, age, or any other factor. Only two states (New Jersey and New York) use pure community rating in their nongroup markets, and only New York imposes pure community rating rules in the small group market. Adjusted community rating prohibits issuers from pricing health insurance policies based on health factors, but allows it for other key factors such as age or gender. Rate bands allow premium variation based on health, but such variation is limited according to a range specified by the state. Rate bands are typically expressed as a percentage above and below the index rate (i.e., the rate that would be charged to a standard population if the plan is prohibited from rating based on health factors).", "Federal law requires that group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health coverage must limit the period of time when coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded. As of January 2009, in the small group market, 21 states had preexisting condition exclusion rules that provided consumer protection above the federal standard. And as of December 2008, in the individual market, 42 states limit the period of time when coverage for preexisting health conditions may be excluded for certain enrollees in that market. In fact, while there are a handful of federal benefit mandates for health insurance that apply to group coverage, there are more than 2,000 benefit mandates imposed by the states.", "One issue receiving congressional attention is whether a publicly sponsored health insurance plan should be offered as part of the insurance market reform. Some proponents of a public option see it as potentially less expensive than private alternatives, as it would not need to generate profits or pay brokers to enroll individuals and might have lower administrative costs. Some proponents argue that offering a public plan could provide additional choice and may increase competition, since the public plan might require lower provider payments and thus charge lower premiums. Some opponents question whether these advantages would make the plan a fair competitor, or rather provide the government with an unfair advantage in setting prices, in authorizing legislation, or in future amendments. Ultimately, they fear that these advantages might drive private plans from the market.", "The relative performance of health insurance organization by profit status has received some attention. Health insurance is provided by organizations that are either for-profit or non-profit in terms of their tax status. Some studies have suggested that non-profits perform better in key areas such as quality. For example, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 1999 found that non-profit health maintenance organizations (HMOs) scored higher on all 14 Healthplan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures studied. These results were generally replicated in a study published in 2006 of 272 health plans conducted by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). Health insurance co-operatives, a subset of non-profit plans, have performed particularly well as detailed in recent case studies of Group Health Cooperative of Seattle (GHC) and HealthPartners of Minnesota. ", "As of 2008, 47% of the enrollment in private health plans was in non-profit health insurance organizations. However, there are relatively few health insurance co-operative organizations in the United States. Some congressional attention has been focused on options to incentivize the creation of new health insurance co-operatives. Advocates of this position argue that co-operatives invest retained earnings back into the plan or to enrollees in the form of lower premiums, lower cost-sharing, expanded benefits, and innovations such as wellness programs, chronic disease management, and integrated care. Opponents of the proposal assert that co-operatives have not been successful in most of the country and that evidence is lacking that co-operatives would make health insurance more affordable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reforms Prior to Full Implementation on January 1, 2013", "paragraphs": ["Several provisions of the bill would take effect prior to the full implementation on January 1, 2013.

This provision would also apply to the individual market unless the Secretary determines that the application of this policy may destabilize the existing individual market. Health insurance issuers would have to submit a justification to the Secretary and the states for any premium increases prior to implementation of the increase. The bill would allow individuals through age 26 who were not otherwise covered to remain on their parents' group or individual plans, at their parents' discretion. In both the group and individual markets (prior to the complete prohibition in 2013), the bill would reduce the window that plans can look back for pre-existing conditions from 6 months to 30 days and shorten the period that plans may exclude coverage of certain benefits. The bill would prohibit acts of domestic violence from being treated as a pre-existing condition. For both the group and individual markets, plans would have to cover benefits for a dependent child's congenital or developmental deformity or disorder. For both the group and individual markets, the bill would prohibit aggregate dollar lifetime limits on benefits. The Secretary would issue guidance implementing the prohibition on rescission in the group and individual markets.

Current employment-based health plans would be grandfathered for five years, at which time any plan offered by an employer would have to meet (and could exceed) the requirements of the essential benefits package. Employers would have to contribute at least 72.5% of the lowest-cost QHBP or current employment-based plan they offered (65% for those electing family coverage) \u2014prorated for part-time employees. Salary reductions used to offset required employer contributions would not count as amounts paid by the employer. Employers would automatically enroll their employees into the plan for individual coverage with the lowest associated employee premium, unless the employee selected a different plan or opted out of employer coverage. Employers would be required to provide written notice detailing the employee's rights and obligations relating to auto enrollment. Employers would be required to provide certain information to show compliance with health participation requirements, including (1) certification as to whether the employer offered its full-time employees (and dependents) enrollment in a QHBP or current employment-based plan; (2) monthly premiums for the lowest cost plan; (3) name, address, and other information of each full-time employee enrolled in a plan; and (4) other information as required. The Secretary of HHS, in coordination with the Commissioner, could terminate an employer's election to provide health insurance if the employer was in substantial noncompliance with the health coverage participation requirements.", "As shown in Table 1 , employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that chose not to offer coverage would be subject to an excise tax equal to 8% of the average wages paid by the employer.
