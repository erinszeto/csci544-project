Monthly payments are calculated using a formula that takes into account the period of employment, a worker's average earnings over that period, and the application of \"dropout years.\"", "To be insured for SSDI benefits, a claimant must have worked a minimum amount of time in covered employment. First, a worker must be \"fully insured,\" which requires one quarter of coverage for each calendar year after the age of 21, with a minimum of six quarters and a maximum of 40 quarters. In 2014, each quarter of coverage requires $1,200 in earnings. Second, a recency of work test requires 20 quarters of coverage in the 40 quarters preceding the onset of a disability; that is generally five years of work in the last 10, although fewer quarters are required for younger workers.", "In calculating the SSDI benefit level, up to five years of a worker's lowest years of earnings are eliminated or \"dropped\" to minimize the effect of lower years of earnings on monthly payments. An eligible worker who becomes disabled has one year of earnings dropped (via the disability dropout year provision) for every five years of earnings, known as the one-for-five rule. A separate childcare dropout year (CDY) provision also disregards from benefit calculations up to two years in which a beneficiary received no income during periods when he or she was caring for a young child. The number of CDYs applied to a benefit calculation may be offset by the number of disability dropout years applied and vice versa. The CDY provision largely benefits a small subset of SSDI recipients with lower career earnings.", "This report provides (1) an overview of the SSDI program and how workers become insured for SSDI benefits, (2) an explanation of how benefit payments are calculated, and (3) a description of how the dropout year provisions affect the calculation of disability benefit payments.

In addition, the law also eliminates from benefit calculations one year of a SSDI beneficiary's lowest earnings for every five years of earnings (also known as the one-for-five rule), which equates to a maximum of five \"disability dropout years\" for an individual with 25 or more years of earnings. By statute, SSA also applies \"childcare dropout years\" (CDYs) for years in which a beneficiary has zero earnings due to leaving the workforce to care for an infant child.
