Note that media reports and comments from the Administration about appropriations activities typically cite figures representing the current-year discretionary totals rather than the program levels in the bill. Advance appropriations are funds that will not become available until after the fiscal year for which the appropriations are enacted (for example, funds for certain education programs like Title I Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies for the Education of the Disadvantaged that were included in the FY2008 act that could not be spent before FY2009 at the earliest, discussed later in this report).

Three programs that received the largest shares of the funding are discussed here; the balance of ARRA funding for existing programs was provided in smaller amounts to numerous other ED programs. Most of ARRA funds for existing elementary and secondary education programs were appropriated for programs that provide formula grants directly to states or local educational agencies (LEAs), while most funds at the postsecondary level were appropriated for Pell Grants, which go directly to students. For some programs, these appropriations provided a substantial increase over the amount of funding provided through the regular appropriations process in recent years. ARRA provided $10.0 billion for Title I-A, Education for the Disadvantaged, Grants to LEAs, a 69% supplement to the $14.5 billion in regular FY2009 appropriations for the program. Similarly, ARRA provided $11.3 billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part B Grants to States, a 98% supplement to the $11.5 billion in regular FY2009 appropriations.

After making reservations from the appropriation, including a $5.0 billion reservation for the Secretary of Education to provide State Incentive Grants and establish an Innovation Fund, $48.3 billion will be provided to governors through formula grants to each state that chooses to apply for funding through this program. Governors must use 81.8% of the funds received to restore state support for public elementary and secondary education and for public institutions of higher education (IHEs) to the greater of the FY2008 or FY2009 level for FY2009, FY2010, and FY2011. Governors are required to use the remaining 18.2% of the state allocation for \"public safety and other government services,\" which may include assistance for elementary and secondary education and public IHEs, and for modernization, renovation, and repair of public school and IHE facilities.", "Unlike most regular appropriations, ARRA made the stimulus funds available for obligation for two years, until the end of FY2010.

Some would contend that the ESEA authorizations of appropriations, as amended by NCLBA, represent a funding commitment that was promised in return for legislative support for the new administrative requirements placed on state and local educational systems. They would contend that the authorized levels are needed for implementing the new requirements, and that the differences between \"promised\" and actual funding levels represent a shortfall of billions of dollars. Others would contend that the authorized funding levels represent no more than appropriations ceilings, and as such are no different from authorizations for most education programs. That is, when the authorization amount is specified, it represents only a maximum amount, with the actual funding level to be determined during the regular annual appropriations process. In the past, education programs with specified authorization levels generally have been funded at lower levels; few have been funded at levels equal to or higher than the specified authorization amount.", "Five ESEA programs, as amended by NCLBA, had specific authorization levels for FY2002 through FY2007: Title I, Part A Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs); 21 st Century Community Learning Centers (21CCLC); State Grants for Innovative Programs; School Choice; and the Fund for the Improvement of Education. For FY2007, the aggregate authorization for these five programs was $28.9 billion, and the appropriation was $14.4 billion, or $14.5 billion less than the amount authorized.", "All current ESEA program authorizations expired after FY2007. They were automatically extended, however, for one additional year under section 422 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) (20 U.S.C. 1226a, providing for contingent extension of programs). Therefore, current ESEA programs were authorized through September 30, 2008. GEPA also specifies that the amount authorized to be appropriated for a program during the extension shall be the amount that was authorized to be appropriated for the program during the terminal fiscal year of the program. Thus, in the case of the five ESEA programs with specific authorization levels for FY2007, those authorizations remained the same for FY2008. Therefore, for FY2008, the aggregate authorization for the five programs was $28.9 billion, and the programs were funded at $15.7 billion, or $13.1 billion less than the amount authorized.", "The GEPA extension applied for one year only. For FY2009, all funding for ESEA programs is taken to be based on authorizations provided implicitly by appropriations, with funds used under the policies in effect at the end of the explicit authorization period. That is, if one assumes that appropriations will continue to be provided for ESEA programs despite an expired authorization, it may also be reasonable to assume that the use of these funds will continue to be governed by the same policies as they were when the ESEA was still explicitly authorized. Under these circumstances, the authorization levels for the five ESEA programs with specific authorization levels for FY2007 would continue to have the same authorization levels in FY2009. Thus, the aggregate authorization for these five programs would continue to be $28.9 billion; the programs were funded at $15.9 billion, or $13.0 billion less than the authorization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IDEA Funding Shortfall?", "paragraphs": ["From 1975 to 2004, the IDEA Special Education Part B Grants to States program authorized state payments up to a maximum amount of 40% of the excess cost of educating children with disabilities ages 3-21 that each state serves. Appropriations have never reached the 40% level. In 2004, Congress addressed the funding issue in P.L. 108-446 , which specified authorization ceilings for Part B Grants to States for FY2005 through FY2011. For FY2008, the authorized amount was $19.2 billion, and $10.9 billion was appropriated, or $8.3 billion less than the amount authorized. For FY2009, the authorized amount was $21.5 billion, and $11.5 billion was appropriated, or $10.0 billion less than the authorized amount. As with ESEA and NCLBA, some view these differences as funding shortfalls, while others see the maximum federal share and the specified authorizations as nothing more than appropriations ceilings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Forward Funding and Advance Appropriations", "paragraphs": ["Most appropriations are available for obligation during the federal fiscal year of the appropriations bill. For example, most FY2009 appropriations will be available for obligation from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. Several L-HHS-ED programs, including some of the larger ED programs, have authorization or appropriations provisions that allow funding flexibility for program years that differ from the federal fiscal year. For example, many of the elementary and secondary education formula grant programs receive appropriations that become available for obligation to the states on July 1 of the same year as the appropriations, and remain available for 15 months through the end of the following fiscal year. That is, FY2009 appropriations for some programs will become available for obligation to the states on July 1, 2009, and will remain available until September 30, 2010. This budgetary procedure is popularly known as \"forward\" or \"multi-year\" funding, and is accomplished through funding provisions in the L-HHS-ED appropriations bill.", "Forward funding in the case of elementary and secondary education programs was designed to allow additional time for school officials to develop budgets in advance of the beginning of the school year. For Pell Grants for undergraduates, however, aggregate program costs for individual students applying for postsecondary educational assistance cannot be known with certainty ahead of time. Appropriations from one fiscal year primarily support Pell Grants during the following academic year; that is, the FY2009 appropriations will be used primarily to support grants for the 2009-2010 academic year. Unlike funding for elementary and secondary education programs, however, the funds for Pell Grants remain available for obligation for two full fiscal years.", "An advance appropriation occurs when the appropriation is provided for a fiscal year beyond the fiscal year for which the appropriation was enacted. In the case of FY2009 appropriations, funds normally would have become available October 1, 2008, under regular funding provisions, but did not become available for some programs until July 1, 2009, under the forward funding provisions discussed above. However, if the July 1, 2009 forward funding date for obligation were to be postponed by three months\u2014until October 1, 2009\u2014the appropriation would be reclassified as an advance appropriation since the funds would become available only in a subsequent fiscal year , FY2010. For example, the FY2009 budget request for Title I, Part A Grants to LEAs was $14.3 billion. This amount included not only forward funding of $6.4 billion (to become available July 1, 2009), but also an advance appropriation of $7.9 billion (to become available October 1, 2009). Like forward funding provisions, these advance appropriations are specified through provisions in the annual appropriations bill.", "What is the impact of these changes in funding provisions? At the appropriations level, there is no difference between forward funded and advance appropriations except for the period available for obligation. At the program or service level, relatively little is changed by the three-month delay in the availability of funds, since most expenditures for a standard school year occur after October 1. At the scorekeeping level, however, a significant technical difference occurs because forward funding is counted as part of the current fiscal year, and is therefore fully included in the current 302(b) allocation for discretionary appropriations. Under federal budget scorekeeping rules, an advance appropriation is not counted in the 302(b) allocation until the following year. In essence, a three-month change from forward funding to an advance appropriation for a given program allows a one-time shift from the current year to the next year in the scoring of discretionary appropriations.
