Their construction, operation, and demolition are increasingly recognized as major sources of environmental impact. Without significant transformation of building construction and operations, that impact is expected to increase with population growth and changes in other demographic and economic factors. One strategy for achieving that transformation is most widely known by the term green building. However, the term is used differently by various proponents and practitioners, denoting a continuum of practices, from those differing minimally from standard practices, to those aimed at providing buildings with a minimum of environmental impact.", "In general, green building can be characterized as integrated building practices that significantly reduce the environmental footprint of a building in comparison to standard practices. Descriptions of green building generally focus on a number of common elements, especially siting, energy, water, materials, waste, and health. Serviceability or utility is also an explicit design element for a class of green buildings known as high-performance buildings.", "One of the most salient features of green building is integration of the various elements. Although individual elements can be addressed separately, the green building approach is more comprehensive, focusing on the environmental footprint of a building over its life cycle, from initial design and construction to operations during the building's useful life, through eventual demolition and its aftermath.", "The desire to integrate the various elements of green building has led to the development of rating and certification systems to assess how well a building project meets a specified set of green criteria. The best-known system is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Developed by the U.S. Green Building Council, it focuses on site, water, energy, materials, and indoor environment. Recently, green building practices have found their way into building model codes and technical standards.", "Green building has received substantial attention from government, industry, and public interest groups. Several federal laws and executive orders have provisions relating to green building. Among these are the energy policy acts (EPACTs) of 1992 and 2005 (P.L. 102-486 and P.L. 109-58), the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA, P.L. 110-140), and Executive Order 13693. EISA and other policy instruments require all federal agencies to implement green building practices. However, several agencies have programs and activities that have a focus that goes beyond reducing the environmental impacts of the facilities used by that agency\u2014for example, by performing research or facilitating the green-building activities of nonfederal entities. Among those agencies are the General Services Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Federal Sustainability, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Departments of Defense, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development.", "Green building raises issues relating to performance, cost, market penetration, and the approach itself. Among the questions Congress may face with respect to such issues are the following: How well are current green building programs working? How effective are current methods for coordinating the green building activities of different agencies? To what extent and by what means should Congress extend its efforts to facilitate and support the adoption and effective implementation of green building measures? What priorities should Congress give to the different elements of green building? What actions should Congress do to facilitate the growth of the scientific and technical knowledge base relating to green building?"], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The environmental impacts of human activity have been a source of controversy and concern for many years. Much of the focus over that time has been on impacts such as pollution and the destruction or degradation of wildlife habitats and ecosystems. Over the past few decades, however, concerns have increased greatly about greenhouse gases, resource depletion, and degradation of ecological services such as water supply. Over that time, the impacts of buildings have come under increasing scrutiny. ", "There are many different kinds of buildings\u2014residential, commercial, government, and those with special uses such as schools and hospitals\u2014and they form a large and core component of the nation's infrastructure. The construction, characteristics, operation, and demolition of buildings are now recognized as a major source of environmental impact, including direct effects on the humans who use them. U.S. buildings consume vast amounts of resources annually in the form of electricity for lighting and temperature control, drinkable water for indoor and outdoor use, and construction materials with diverse supply chains and manufacturing processes; they also produce substantial waste streams throughout their lifecycles, from construction to daily operations to demolition. Such resource use can impose high environmental and financial costs. For example, buildings account for about 40% of energy consumption in the United States, producing approximately 40% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and costing consumers more than $430 billion a year in energy bills. ", "A building's location and interaction with its surrounding environment also influences its ecological and human health impacts. Buildings create impermeable surfaces that can have substantial effects on stormwater management and associated health and environmental impacts. A building's proximity to public transportation affects the energy required to transport occupants to and from the premises. If an office is not accessible by walking or public transit, for example, occupants may need to commute by car, contributing to traffic delays, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions. Occupant health and productivity is also affected by building features that determine indoor air quality. Most people spend far more time indoors than outside, and the air in buildings often has substantially higher concentrations of pollutants than the air outside, contributing in extreme cases to a phenomenon known as \"sick building syndrome.\"", "These and other undesirable environmental and health impacts can be addressed for construction, renovation, and operations of both new and existing buildings. Green building is a tool for transforming the ways in which buildings are designed, built, operated, and demolished that has generated substantial interest in recent decades. Since emerging as a relatively novel concept in the 1990s, green building has grown into what many consider a respected approach to building, with an increasing number of stakeholders. They include, among others, private construction firms, building owners and occupants, green building certification and standards-developing organizations, federal and state lawmakers, local code officials, and a variety of government agencies. ", "This report discusses the concept of green building, major federal policies and programs relating to it, and associated issues. Topics covered include how green building is defined, what it consists of, the major areas of environmental impact it seeks to address, an overview of the tools available for ensuring that a building conforms to green criteria, outstanding issues in the implementation of green building, an overview of the major statutory and executive authorities that address it, and programs in federal agencies that involve one or more elements related to it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Is Green Building?", "paragraphs": ["Environmentally sensitive building is not a particularly recent phenomenon, but the modern practice of green building began emerging in the 1990s. One milestone in the United States was the formation in 1990 of the Committee on the Environment within the American Institute of Architects (AIA), followed within a few years by the founding of the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and other organizations. The most prominent federal green building project in that decade was the \"Greening of the White House.\" From those beginnings, the concept of green building has expanded to encompass both the movement to promote environmentally conscious design principles and the set of practices and strategies by which builders seek to reduce harmful impacts of the built environment.", "There is no single consensus definition of green building; efforts exist along a design and performance continuum. What some call green building is barely distinguishable from standard building practices. At the extreme, the term can be used in an almost meaningless way, purely as a marketing tool. Such practices are sometimes called \"greenwashing.\" ", "In contrast, some practitioners aim to provide buildings with environmental impacts that are greatly reduced from those of typical buildings. Examples include the so-called \"zero-impact\" building, which is intended to have no net environmental impact, including but not limited to net-zero energy use; and the \"minus-impact\" building, which would provide a net environmental benefit (see \" Net-Zero Buildings ,\" below). Most green building efforts have less ambitious reduction goals. ", "In general, green building might best be characterized as an integrated approach to building design, construction, and operations that significantly reduces the environmental footprint of buildings in comparison to standard practices. The environmental footprint is the overall impact of a structure or activity on the environment, including the human environment. ", "This characterization captures two common features of the various meanings given to the term. First, green is a relative concept\u2014a green building is one that is greener than average. Second, it is not limited to only one factor, such as energy consumption, but involves integration across several, as is discussed below. The green building approach can be applied to any class of building: large or small, commercial or residential.", "Green builders seek to achieve improvements in environmental performance through a variety of techniques and strategies, from the implementation of innovative technologies (such as energy-efficient heating and cooling systems) to design features intended to influence occupant behavior (such as placing stairways prominently to encourage their use). Some of these techniques will be discussed in more detail below. Decisions about which of these techniques will be used are often made in the design and planning phase, but can impact the environmental footprint of a building throughout its lifecycle. As a result, green building techniques are most often applied to new construction, through there is a growing incidence of green renovation and retrofit projects. ", "The term green building is often used interchangeably with others such as sustainable building , and that practice is followed in this report. However, the terms may also be used in ways that are not exactly synonymous. For example, sustainable building may be described as a form of green building, but with a more stringent goal of indefinitely maintaining environmental footprints that are small enough that they will not impede future human activity and the functioning of ecosystems. ", "Another term often used interchangeably with green building is high-performance building. However, high-performance building usually involves other factors such as security in addition to environmental ones. There are two federal statutory definitions: ", "a building that integrates and optimizes all major high-performance building attributes, including energy efficiency, durability, life-cycle performance, and occupant productivity,", "and", "a building that integrates and optimizes on a life cycle basis all major high performance attributes, including energy conservation, environment, safety, security, durability, accessibility, cost-benefit, productivity, sustainability, functionality, and operational considerations.", "Additional objectives may also be considered in the design of high-performance buildings, including aesthetics and historical preservation.", "The \" Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 \" (EISA) further refined the concept by establishing a detailed definition for high-performance green buildings (see \" Definitions of Green Building ,\" above)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of Green Building", "paragraphs": ["Descriptions of green building generally focus on specified elements, which in various documents may also be referred to by other terms such as attributes, life-cycle parameters, performance areas, or impact categories.

However, they are included explicitly among the objectives for high-performance buildings, which may also consider such others as disaster and climate resilience. These objectives have risen in prominence in the wake of a number of high-profile natural disasters, including Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that initiated the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown.", "The goals of a given green building project may vary depending on the needs of the stakeholders, including a building's expected occupants.

", "Energy is widely considered a crucial element because of the economic costs and environmental impacts associated with energy use. A 2010 study by the National Academies found the potential energy savings from widespread deployment of energy efficiency measures to be significantly higher for buildings than for transportation and industry. In a 2015 report on energy technologies, the Department of Energy estimated that buildings using the best available energy efficiency technologies would consume about half as much energy on average as those in the current building stock. ", "Federal law sets numeric requirements for reductions in energy use by federal buildings. The energy intensity of such buildings declined by more than 22% from 2003 to 2015. Nevertheless, 2015 consumption exceeded the federal goal.", "Given its importance, energy is sometimes mistakenly treated as the predominant or even the sole element to be considered in green building. However, while a green building almost always addresses the energy element, a building that focuses solely on energy may not be a green building: It could have other environmental impacts that outweigh any benefits from its reduced use of energy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water", "paragraphs": ["Reducing water usage in buildings can provide cost savings.

Landscaping can be planned to reduce or eliminate chemical pollutants from grounds maintenance and to recycle waste such as lawn clippings through mulching and composting.

Primary techniques for maintaining high IAQ include ensuring adequate ventilation; providing air filtration; and using materials without heavy metals, VOCs, asbestos, or other potentially toxic substances.

The orientation of building axes and surfaces, and the building's proximity to trees and other plantings, affect its heating and cooling requirements.

It also permits explicit assessment of and balance among potentially competing goals, and it allows planners to examine how different elements and stages interact and to develop an integrated strategy.

Addressing both energy efficiency and health requires either a compromise or technologies such as active ventilation with heat exchange. A green building approach reduces the risk of unanticipated problems by forcing an examination of how actions affecting each element impact others, so that an overall optimization can be achieved.

Use of concrete walls provides more insulation on average than use of wood, but has much higher net emissions of carbon dioxide over its life cycle.

It is arguably most objective when an independent entity conducts the assessment and awards the certification. Such a third party must be independent of the builder, contractor, and designer, as well as the organization that developed the rating system or standard. ", "A handful of organizations currently offer rating and certification for green buildings. By far the most prevalent certification system within the United States is LEED, developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). When it launched in 1998, LEED was among the first voluntary, consensus-based certification systems in the United States. It quickly became widely recognized as a benchmark for green building design. The number of LEED certifications has increased annually since the first certification was awarded in 2000. As of April 2017, more than 37,300 commercial buildings had been certified by LEED worldwide. USGBC has also expanded the categories of building certifications offered to include new commercial construction, existing buildings, building interiors, homes, schools, retail, healthcare, whole neighborhoods, and others (see textbox on \" Special-Use Buildings \"). Certification is also available for operations and maintenance of existing buildings (including buildings first certified when new), with a five-year recertification cycle.", "LEED focuses primarily on six green building elements: location and transportation, sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. It also has credit categories for innovation and for regional priority, which considers specific factors of importance to sustainability within a specified region.", "To be LEED-certified, a building must meet a set of mandatory basic requirements for most elements and must also receive a designated number of the total points that can be earned within each element from optional items. A building's total score determines its level of certification: Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. While this \"checklist\" approach has been criticized, it permits comparatively simple assessment of compliance and can facilitate the kind of integrated consideration of elements that many observers regard as a hallmark of green building. The LEED rating system is updated periodically; the most recent version, LEED v4, was released in November of 2013.", "Other rating and certification systems in use in the United States include the following:", "The Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) is a British system developed in 1990. Though BREEAM rating systems have been used internationally since then, only the BREEAM In-Use certification has been introduced in the United States, beginning in 2017. BREEAM In-Use is an online rating system for existing commercial building performance. Unlike LEED, BREEAM In-Use has no prerequisites; any existing building can use it to benchmark performance and certify subsequent improvements. BREEAM ratings are Acceptable, Pass, Good, Very Good, Excellent, and Outstanding, which are signified by between one and six stars. Rating levels are based on a building's score across nine impact categories: management, health and well-being, energy, transport, water, materials, waste, land use, and ecology and pollution. To remain valid, certifications must be renewed annually. Green Globes was developed in Canada by the Green Building Initiative. It is based on BREEAM, and has an associated standard (see \" Green Building Codes and Standards \"). A building may earn between one and four Globes based on the number of points earned out of a possible total of 1000. Points are distributed across six elements\u2014site, energy, water, materials and resources, emissions, and indoor environment\u2014plus project management. Like BREEAM In-Use, Green Globes has no mandatory provisions or prerequisites that must be met before certification can be considered; certification and rating level are based solely on the number of points earned. The International Living Future Institute's Living Building Challenge offers three certifications: Living Building Certification, Petal Certification, and Zero Energy Building Certification. Criteria for certification fall into seven performance areas, referred to as \"Petals\": place, water, energy, health and happiness, materials, equity, and beauty. Living Building Certification requires a building to meet requirements in all seven performance areas. Petal Certification requires compliance with no fewer than three of the seven Petals, one of which must be water, energy, or materials. Zero Energy Certification requires a building to generate all of its energy needs on site without using combustion. Unlike new-building certification under the other ratings systems, which occurs upon completion of construction, certification under the Living Building Challenge also requires a 12-month assessment of actual building performance.", "Different ratings systems emphasize different aspects of green building. Therefore, whether one or another is more appropriate may depend on local conditions and priorities. Systems also differ in the types of buildings for which they offer guidelines and certification; some focus primarily on new construction, while others are more geared toward existing buildings.", "In addition to the comprehensive green certification systems discussed above, some additional programs exist to certify that a building has taken steps to improve environmental performance for a single element or in a limited number of performance areas. These include Energy Star (energy-efficiency), Indoor airPLUS (indoor air quality), WaterSense (water efficiency), Zero Energy Ready Home (energy and air quality), and Passive House/ PHIUS+ (energy, water, and air quality).

Actual and perceived costs of implementing green building measures have a strong bearing on design and construction decisions. However, information on true costs is not always easy to obtain, and such informational barriers can distort perceptions about the economic benefits of green building. Moreover, researchers have noted that the flexibility inherent in designing individual green buildings makes generalizing about the cost performance of the market segment as a whole difficult. As a result, empirical evidence of the financial performance of green building investments is limited. ", "It is widely believed that the initial costs of green buildings are higher than for conventional buildings. A survey of construction industry professionals found that higher perceived initial cost was among the top three obstacles for green building in the United States. Such higher costs can result from several sources. Not only can many features, such as high-efficiency appliances and high-performance windows, be more expensive than conventional approaches, but design costs may be higher, and if the building is to be certified, the process may be time-consuming and expensive in its own right.

A DOE review of the existing literature on green-certified buildings concluded that the available evidence shows construction costs for green buildings to be comparable to those of conventional buildings. The use of integrated design may also result in some reductions in initial costs, and some evidence supports that claim. ", "Proponents of green building assert that operational cost savings will eventually recoup any initially higher investment. One way green buildings can create operational cost savings is by reducing usage of utility resources, and, in some cases, through selling site-generated renewable energy back to the grid. GSA, for instance, claims to have saved over $340 million in energy and water costs between FY2008 and FY2015 from efficiency improvements. More than two dozen studies support the contention that green certification is associated with reduced utility expenses. However, utility costs, such as electricity, gas, and water bills, only make up approximately 19% of a commercial building's operating costs, and evidence is mixed on whether green certification reduces overall operating expenses. There is also evidence to suggest that green-labeled buildings command price premiums on the real estate market, both in the amount that renters are willing to pay to use the space, and in terms of overall market value.", "Some features of real estate markets can, however, reduce incentives for investments in green building. For example, building owners, especially homeowners, often move after a few years, reducing the time they would require for a return on their initial investment through potential utility savings. The problem can be exacerbated if the building is rented or leased. The financial return on green building investments made by owners would depend on how much of a premium they could charge current or new tenants. The return for investments by tenants would depend on the length of their tenure\u2014only long-term tenants would be likely to benefit from making such an investment. This is sometimes called the principal/agent or split-incentive problem.", "Finally, many potential beneficiaries of green building renovations may be limited by constraints on the availability of capital for such investments, even outside the residential sector. Such constraints are reported to be a problem with respect to such significant users of energy as educational institutions, hospitals, and municipalities.", "Cost barriers to the use of green building may continue to decrease as the practice becomes more widespread and economies of scale lower the initial cost differential. Also, financial incentives, offered by some states and municipalities, may help to defray higher initial costs, making green building investments more financially attractive. Some observers argue that costs beyond simple monetary expenditures should be considered.

Indeed, there are well-publicized examples of certified green buildings that have been shown to be extremely resource-intensive postoccupancy. ", "Studies that have evaluated actual green building performance are discussed later in this section. However, even where greater resource-use efficiency can be demonstrated, savings may be offset by other factors. For example, green building efforts and related energy-efficiency initiatives appear to have helped reduce energy-use intensity (see \" Measurement \") in U.S. homes built since 2000. Yet, those homes use more total energy on average because they are 30% larger than older ones and have more electronic appliances and other devices.

Recent revisions of the LEED rating system have sought to address critiques centered on the one-time assessment nature of certification by requiring installation of building-level energy and water meters, the data from which are to be compiled and reported to USGBC for the first five years following certification. Other systems, such as BREEAM In-Use and the Living Building Certification, explicitly include performance parameters within the criteria for certification (see \" Green Rating Systems and Certifications \"). Building codes are also moving toward incorporating performance outcomes into requirements: the 2015 IgCC included an outcome-based compliance pathway for energy usage, allowing builders to meet requirements through actual performance. ", "Building systems may also be commissioned\u2014that is, independently assessed to ensure they are designed, installed, tested, and capable of being operated as planned. Available data support the contention that commissioning improves environmental performance, especially for energy use. The process can be used not only for new buildings, but also existing ones, either during retrofitting or continuing operations.", "In addition to certification and commissioning, an organization can develop an environmental management system (EMS), for which international standards are available. To be certified under the standards, an organization must have an explicit environmental policy that includes commitments to conform to relevant environmental requirements, continuously improve environmental performance, and prevent pollution, among other things. Such commitments are arguably far easier to meet if the EMS includes performance measurement.", "Networked building monitoring and diagnostic tools are becoming increasingly prevalent. Such tools can allow early fault detection in critical building equipment as well as providing resource use analytics, allowing building managers to more effectively respond to changing use patterns in real time. (See textbox \" Smart Buildings and the Internet of Things ,\" above.) For example, GSAlink, a GSA-developed building diagnostic tool, has been used to identify over 33,000 instances of sub-optimal equipment performance within GSA holdings alone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Studies", "paragraphs": ["Many studies have attempted to measure and evaluate green building performance. However, a lack of consensus on the criteria for defining green building, as well as on the outcomes to be measured, has made it difficult to compare results between studies. Generally, the evidence that green buildings perform significantly better than conventional buildings is mixed. Recent studies have shown green buildings to exhibit a wide range of measured energy performance, with some buildings performing far below design expectations. The selected studies discussed below primarily use LEED ratings as the criteria for inclusion. Because other rating systems are not as prevalent in the United States, little information is available on the performance of buildings constructed under those systems in the U.S. market.", "A study of energy use by more than 100 LEED-certified buildings found that, on average, they performed 24% better than other buildings. However, about one in seven performed worse than average. This study was criticized as misleading because of purported sample bias, inappropriate baselines for comparison, and other concerns. A follow-up assessment using the same data concluded that primary energy savings from LEED certification were nonexistent for lower levels of certification and 13% better than average for Gold and Platinum-certified buildings.", "A GSA study of 22 green federal buildings, most of which had received LEED certification, found that, on average, the buildings studied performed better than the national average in all measured performance areas, including energy use, water use, operating costs, occupant satisfaction, and carbon emissions. Some buildings performed worse than the national average in certain areas, however. ", "A study of the energy consumption of 11 LEED-certified Navy buildings found that 9 of the 11 buildings did not meet the federal requirement at the time of the study (30% electricity savings over the benchmark). Furthermore, the majority consumed more electricity than the national average. ", "An assessment of Arizona's LEED-certified new construction buildings supported the existence of the energy performance gap, as the majority of the sample underperformed both the design and the baseline energy-use simulations, highlighting a disconnection between the efficacy of the strategies employed and the modeling results. ", "Taken together, the findings in those studies do not appear to provide sufficient evidence of improvements in performance with LEED certification to conclude that such certification consistently reduces building energy consumption. However, sample sizes were small and may not be representative of the overall performance of green-certified buildings. Performance data is often proprietary and therefore often inaccessible to researchers conducting evaluations. Greater access to building performance data is frequently cited as a prerequisite to more comprehensive performance assessments.

However, methods for measuring the performance of green buildings are not yet well-developed for most elements. Some, such as energy and water use, are comparatively easy to measure quantitatively, for example through metering. Others may be difficult to quantify and may be possible to evaluate only on the basis of the presence or absence of certain features or through other more qualitative measures. Even for elements that are relatively simple to measure, such as energy usage, there may be disagreement about which of several possible metrics captures the most relevant information. For instance, energy use intensity (EUI), which is the primary metric used to evaluate federal building performance, has traditionally been defined as the amount of energy used per square foot. GSA's Green Building Advisory Committee has recently proposed two additional methodologies for measuring EUI: energy use per occupant and area-based EUI measuring energy used in commuter transportation to and from the building. As the Advisory Committee notes in its report, a building's energy use patterns may appear to vary based on which metric is used. However, a study by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory cautioned that a lack of accurate building occupancy data could complicate efforts to calculate occupancy-adjusted EUI. Furthermore, there is some evidence that commonly accepted metrics, such as an Energy Star score, are not highly correlated with the outcomes they are intended to measure. ", "Given the life expectancy of buildings\u2014in most cases far longer than occupancy by any given resident\u2014measurement of performance is important not only initially but over the building's entire lifespan. In the absence of such regular measurement and adjustment, environmental performance is likely to deteriorate over time for many elements. Eventually, some form of standard life-cycle assessment may be feasible for whole buildings. ", "EISA requires that federal agencies measure the performance of their buildings against specified targets, especially with respect to energy use. Targets are more stringent for new construction than existing stock. Energy performance is to be measured against a baseline of consumption levels in 2005. Determination of an accurate baseline may be difficult in the absence of adequate measurement of energy use. ", "Despite the recognized importance of measurement and the availability of options and resources for its application, uncertainties and gaps exist that can make effective application challenging. Consensus may not exist on specific measurement goals or metrics. Reliable and consistent data are often difficult to obtain. Measurement science relating to green building is an active area of research. In 2008, the National Science and Technology Council listed the development of appropriate measurement science as the top research need for progress in green building.

Scorecards included both numeric reports of agency progress, in the form of percentage reductions in target areas, as well as a color score of green, yellow, or red. The precise meaning of a score color differed slightly for each target area. Generally, however, a green score indicated that an agency had met or was on track to meet the target; yellow indicated that some progress has been made toward a target; and red indicated that the agency was neither on track to achieving a given target nor demonstrating significant progress.
