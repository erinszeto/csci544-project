Unlike other tax credit bonds, the interest rate on the BABs and RZEDBs is a rate agreed to by the issuer and investor and the issuers receive direct payments from the Treasury. In contrast, the Secretary of the Treasury sets the credit rate for the other TCBs. The credit rate differs across TCB programs.

The credit available from a TCB depends on the bond principal and credit rate. The method of determining the credit rate differs across types of TCBs: the credit rate for investor and issuer credit TCBs depends on a national credit rate set by Treasury, while the credit rate for direct payment TCBs is dependent on interest rate negotiations between the issuer and investor. Unlike interest on municipal bonds, which does not create a taxable income stream, the credit amount is included in the bond holder's gross income. The credit is limited to the bondholder's current tax liability and is therefore \"non-refundable.\" Unused tax credits may be carried over to the succeeding tax year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Investor Credit TCBs", "paragraphs": ["The credit rate for investor and issuer credit TCBs is dependent on a national credit rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury. That national credit rate is intended to allow issuers of TCBs to sell their bonds at par (face value) without additional interest expense. The rate calculation is ", "based on its [the Treasury Department's] estimate of the yields on outstanding bonds from market sectors selected by the Treasury Department in its discretion that have an investment grade rating between A and BBB for bonds of a similar maturity for the business day immediately preceding the sale date of the tax credit bonds.", "The credit rate published (by the U.S. Bureau of the Fiscal Service) on the issue sale date is the bondholder's annual rate of credit. ", "The relationship between the national credit rate set by Treasury and final credit rate applied to a bond issue is dictated by the federal tax code, and differs across types of investor and issuer TCBs. The credit on what are known as 100% credit TCBs provides for a benefit equal to the product of the national credit rate and the bond principal. For example, the annual tax credit rate for investor credit TCBs was 3.92% on September 8, 2016 (the term was 45 years). The bonds sold on that day would allow the taxpayer to claim a federal tax credit equal to 3.92% multiplied by the face value of the bond. Thus, a $100,000 bond issued on September 8, 2016, would yield an annual tax credit of $3,920 for the bondholder. ", "However, other credit rates may be reduced for some TCBs. CREBs and QECBs allow for a credit equal to 70% of the national credit rate. Thus, for these bonds, the investor receives 70% of the annual tax credit described above, or $2,744 (70% of $3,920). The method for determining the tax credit rate for investor tax credit TCBs is generally the same for 100% and 70% credit TCBs. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issuer Direct Payment TCBs", "paragraphs": ["Unlike investor credit TCBs, the benefit claimed for issuer direct payment TCBs depends on the interest rate established between the buyer and issuer of the bond, not the Secretary of the Treasury. The issuer and investor agree on terms either as a result of a competitive bid process or through a negotiated sale. As with investor credit TCBs, the relationship of the final credit rate and the negotiated interest rate may differ across types of TCBs. BAB and RZEDB credits are 35% and 45%, respectively, of a market-determined taxable bond interest rate for the specific issuer, not the Secretary of Treasury.", "For example, if the negotiated taxable interest rate is 8%, on $100,000 of bond principal, then a bond with 35% credit amount would produce a credit worth $2,800 (8% times $100,000 times 35%). The issuer has the option of receiving a direct payment from the Treasury equal to the credit amount or allowing the investor to claim the credit. The issuer would choose the direct payment option if the net interest cost was less than traditional tax-exempt debt of like terms. The interest cost to the issuer choosing the direct payment is $8,000 less the $2,800, or $5,200. If the tax-exempt rate of the bond is greater than 5.20% (requiring a payment of greater than $5,200), then the direct payment is a better option for the issuer.", "So long as the marginal tax rate of investors in the municipal bond market is lower than the credit rate of the direct payment TCB, then municipal issuers would likely chose the direct payment option. However, as the marginal tax rate rises, the alternative to direct payment TCBs, traditional tax-exempt bonds, is relatively more attractive to issuers and investors alike. Increases in statutory marginal tax rates would likely induce such an outcome, reducing the attractiveness of direct payment TCBs relative to traditional tax-exempt bonds.", "The direct payment TCB, in cases where the issuer claims the direct payment, is modeled after the \"taxable bond option,\" which was first considered in the late 1960s. In 1976, the following was posited by the then president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, Frank E. Morris:", "The taxable bond option is a tool to improve the efficiency of our financial markets and, at the same time, to reduce substantially the element of inequity in our income tax system which stems from tax exemption [on municipal bonds]. It will reduce the interest costs on municipal borrowings, but the benefits will accrue proportionally as much to cities with strong credit ratings as to those with serious financial problems.", "The taxable bond option has been well received by issuers and investors. A U.S. Department of the Treasury report on BABs, a direct payment TCB, estimated that over the lifetime of the program over $181 billion in BABs were issued.", "The implementation of annual sequesters, as provided for by the Budget Control Act of 2011 ( P.L. 112-25 ), diminished the credit rates of certain issuer direct payment TCBs.

Generally, a financial intermediary could buy the TCB, sell the principal to an investor looking for a longer-term investment, and sell the stream of credits to another investor seeking quarterly income. For example, assume a financial intermediary buys the $100,000 TCB presented above. The intermediary sells the right to the principal portion (the $100,000) of the TCB to a pension fund for $90,000 and sells the stream of credits ($1,980 every quarter for 15 years) to another investor for $90,000.

And for issuers, the interest cost should be less than, or at least equal to, the next best financing alternative.

Investors in the 35% bracket would require a credit rate on TCBs of 6.97% (4.53% divided by (1 - 0.35)). Generally, the TCB credit rate would have to exceed the after-tax return on municipal bonds and the after-tax return on taxable bonds of like term to maturity. The investor credit TCB rate is set at the higher amount to ensure the market for the bonds clears.", "The choice between a tax credit bond and a taxable corporate bond is not as dependent upon the bondholder's tax bracket. At comparable levels of default risk, TCBs and taxable bonds are equally attractive to purchasers that anticipate tax liability. However, an investor without tax liability that holds a tax credit bond would be allowed to claim a credit for future tax liability or carry forward the credit. For these investors, \"stripping\" the tax credits from the bond and selling them to an entity with tax liability would be an option.

TCBs under both the investor credit model and the issuer credit model are typically lower cost than the next best alternative, tax-exempt bonds. Proposals to reduce the issuer credit rate, to 25% or 28% for example, increase the likelihood that issuers will opt for traditional tax-exempt bond finance. Direct payment TCBs provide issuers with the option of receiving payments directly from Treasury as another option to tax-exempt bonds. The relative value of direct payment TCBs increases with the interest rate of the alternative tax-exempt bond, as that rate determines the payment otherwise required from the issuer. ", "TCB issuers may also establish a bond reserve fund (or sinking fund). A sinking fund provides for the eventual repayment of bond principal by devoting certain funds to regular payments on the bond issue. Generally, IRS rules allow reserve funds to accumulate just enough to repay the bond principal. The sinking fund provision for TCBs significantly reduces the interest cost to the issuer. On September 8, 2016, the allowable rate for the \"Permitted Sinking Fund Yield\" to repay the issue was 1.55%. The TCB rate was 3.92% on that day."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Influence of Economic Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The relative appeal of tax-exempt bonds and TCBs to investors and policymakers may vary significantly with underlying economic patterns. In normal economic conditions, tax-exempt bonds are offered at a lower interest rate than those of corporate bonds. For example, on September 2, 2016, the average high-grade taxable corporate bond rate was 3.24%, and the average high-grade municipal bond rate was 2.84% (see Figure 1 ). The municipal bond rate thus offers a considerable subsidy to the issuer, as without the tax exemption the issuer would have had to pay 40 basis points more for each dollar borrowed (3.24% is 0.40 percentage points greater than 2.84%). ", "However, from late 2008 to early 2009 and from early 2011 to early 2015, the gap between the interest rates of municipal and corporate bonds was much lower than its historical average, and in some cases the municipal bond rates were actually higher than the taxable high-grade corporate bond rates. Turmoil in the financial markets brought about by the Great Recession may have contributed to the increase in municipal bond rates. Another contributor to the high yields on municipal bonds may have been low demand for those bonds due to concerns about potential and actual defaults by municipalities like Chicago, Detroit, and Puerto Rico. ", "Beginning in 2015, the spread between corporate and municipal bonds returned near its historical average. This return to normal may be due to anticipated interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, as municipal bonds are anticipated to perform better as interest rates increase. However, the recent fluctuations in the rate spread make it difficult to predict the nature of the spread moving forward.", "The value of the TCB credit is a function of both the interest rate of the bond and the credit rate on the TCB as set by Treasury. However, because the credit rate of the TCB is intended to be such that the bonds are not sold at a discount, the relative value of TCBs to corporate bonds is less dependent on general economic conditions than is the value of municipal bonds over corporate bonds.
