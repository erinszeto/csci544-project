As the graph illustrates, set-asides within the CDF account, including earmarked funds, declined significantly during the period from a high of $713 million in FY2001 to a low of $57 million in FY2013. Much of this decline was attributable to the elimination of earmarked projects funded under the Neighborhood Initiative (NI) and Economic Development Initiative (EDI) programs. Conversely, Congress, at its discretion, has used the program's statutory framework to support disaster relief and recovery efforts. The program's framework also has been used to assist cities and states in responding to the 2008 recession. Two specific initiatives were involved: the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) and additional CDBG-formula funds appropriated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). NSP funds were used to help state and local governments acquire, rehabilitate, and resell abandoned and foreclosed homes (see \" Supplemental Appropriations \" section of this report for additional information). As part of the President's economic stimulus plan enacted under ARRA, Congress provided $1 billion in CDBG funds for FY2010 in support of job creation and retention activities.

Supporters of the program have pressed for increased funding, contending that the program's appropriations have declined in both current and constant dollars. Supporters noted that this decline or near stagnation in funding has been compounded by the increased number of communities gaining entitlement status and thus eligibility for a direct allocation of a share of funds dispensed to entitlement communities. Entitlement communities have been forced to share an ever-shrinking or stagnant slice of the CDBG formula pie with an ever-increasing number of eligible grant recipients. During the past decade, critics of the program have argued that increased funding has not been justified based on the program's performance as measured by its PART score and, more recently, the need to reduce domestic discretionary spending as part of a larger effort to reduce the federal budget deficit and the national debt.

The ACS five-year estimates are updated every year, allowing HUD to annually update data sources used to allocate CDBG funds. This allows allocations to reflect recent projected demographic changes.", "Prior to the FY2012 allocations, HUD used the 2000 Decennial Census as the data source for poverty, overcrowded housing conditions, and pre-1940 housing stock.

The decline is both a function of lower funding levels and an increase in the number of entitlement communities as more cities and counties achieve the population threshold necessary to be designated an entitlement community. For the period from FY2000 to FY2013, the number of jurisdictions that received a direct allocation as CDBG entitlement communities increased by 171, from 1,012 to 1,183. ", "Appendix A. CDF Set-Asides: FY2000 to FY2014", "Appendix B. CDBG Formula Grants Funding History", " Table B-1 is a tabulation of annual appropriations for the formula component of the CDBG administered by HUD. The table does not include:", "supplemental appropriations in response to presidentially declared disasters; special appropriations, including CDBG-related American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) or the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funds; and program set asides and earmarks such as, but not limited to, the Economic Development Initiatives and Indian CDBG funds that also have been funded under the larger Community Development Fund account.", "Appendix C. Distribution of CDBG Funds: FY2011 to FY2013 ", " Table C-1 identifies the FY2011, FY2012, and FY2013 actual distribution of CDBG formula funds awarded to states and entitlement communities, and insular areas. The table presents information at the state level, but each state total includes actual amounts allocated to the state and entitlement communities within each state. The number of formula recipients in each state, including the state itself, is identified in the last three columns of the table by fiscal year. Calculations for the three fiscal years were generated by HUD. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2012, P.L. 112-55 , decreased CDBG formula allocations by 10.8% below the amounts allocated to states and entitlement communities for FY2011, while the FY2013 formula allocation for entitlement communities and states increased by 4.6% above the amount appropriated for FY2012. FY2014 was not available before the publication of this report. "], "subsections": []}]}}
