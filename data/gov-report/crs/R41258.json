The Administration's FY2011 request for Everglades restoration for the Department of the Interior was $74.5 million, an increase of $6.0 million over the FY2010 appropriation. The request included $8.0 million for DOI under CERP and $8.0 million for the Modified Waters Delivery Project to Everglades National Park. Separate from the DOI request, the Administration also requested approximately $180 million for Everglades restoration within the Corps of Engineers budget, for total federal funding of approximately $255 million in the Administration's FY2011 request. ", "The level of commitment by the federal government to implement restoration activities in the Everglades continues to receive attention. Some observers measure commitment by the frequency and number of projects authorized under CERP, and the appropriations they receive. Because only three restoration projects have been authorized since the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) 2000, these observers are concerned that the federal commitment to Everglades restoration is waning. Others assert that the federal commitment to CERP and Everglades restoration has increased in recent years, evidenced by projects moving from design to construction phases as well as through additional funding provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. These observers note that in January of 2010, the first CERP project broke ground at Picayune Strand in South Florida. The federal government also recently broke ground on the Mod Waters construction project, which must be completed before appropriations can be made for CERP projects in the eastern Everglades.

Second, the LWCF funds acquisition and recreational development by state and local governments through a grant program administered by the NPS, sometimes referred to as stateside funding. Third, Congress has appropriated money from the LWCF to fund some related activities, with programs varying from year to year.

For all four agencies, most of the funds requested by the Administration were for acquisitions for particular management units. In seeking funds for acquisition projects for FY2011, for the first time the DOI agencies used consistent, merit-based criteria, according to the department. These criteria were designed to meet common conservation goals, such as developing additional recreational opportunities and maximizing landscape conservation for wildlife and habitat. The FY2011 FS budget justification also noted changes to the LWCF program, including the use of selection criteria to rank land acquisition projects. ", "The changes in part seek to address congressional concerns regarding the land acquisition process. For instance, the conferees on the FY2010 appropriations bill had expressed concern with the processes for acquiring lands, and provided several related directives to the agencies. Conferees directed the agencies to use funds for inholdings to acquire high-priority lands that are threatened by development, and address delays in conducting land appraisals, including by considering alternative organizational structures. The conferees expressed their intention that, to the maximum extent possible, there be a single set of policies among the four agencies for conducting land acquisitions. They directed the DOI and Agriculture Secretaries to jointly examine their acquisition policies and practices and to submit a report with findings and recommendations to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees.
