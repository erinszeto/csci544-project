In recent years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac jointly have been responsible for approximately 45% of residential mortgages outstanding.

To finance the MBS that they keep, the GSEs sell bonds to investors. Because of their close connection with the federal government and the implicit government guarantee, the GSEs' bonds have traditionally been considered safer than what is implied by their finances. Because of this perception of safety, the bonds pay interest rates that usually are only slightly more than the federal government pays. This ability to borrow relatively inexpensively allows the GSEs to be more profitable. ", "After years of profitability, the financial turmoil of 2008 caused the market to question the GSEs' financial strength. In September 2008, during extreme financial turmoil and growing concern over financial losses, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac individually agreed to be placed under voluntary conservatorship with FHFA. For the GSEs, as is the case for most financial companies, conservatorship is roughly the equivalent of bankruptcy reorganization. Under conservatorship, senior executives are replaced and stockholders have no input on management of the company. This happened to the GSEs. By law, the goal of conservatorship is to put the company on a sound financial footing, after which the company is returned to stockholder control. If this cannot be accomplished, the firm is placed in receivership, which is roughly the equivalent of dissolving a bankrupt company. In certain situations their receivership is mandatory and in others receivership is voluntary.", "From their start, the GSEs have been controversial because of the perceived conflicts between their public purpose and their responsibility to maximize stockholder value. As is discussed in more detail later, the advantages of GSE status has made it difficult for other companies to compete against the GSEs. Congress debated GSE regulatory reform in the 108 th , 109 th , and 110 th Congresses, eventually passing the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 ( P.L. 110-289 ).", "The GSEs' mission has changed over time. Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's current charters contain five purposes:", "1. To stabilize the secondary mortgage market for residential mortgages; 2. To respond \"appropriately\" to the capital market; 3. To increase the liquidity of mortgages (including mortgages for low- and moderate-income families); 4. To promote access to mortgage credit in all areas of the nation (including underserved areas); and 5. To \"manage and liquidate federally owned mortgage portfolios in an orderly manner, with a minimum of adverse effect upon the residential mortgage market and minimum loss to the Federal Government.\"", "It could be argued that between the time Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became GSEs and the time that they were placed in conservatorship, they accomplished these goals except, perhaps, for operating with minimum loss to the federal government. Even under conservatorship, they continued (with assistance from the federal government) to fulfill their mission, although it can again be contested that they have operated with minimal loss to the federal government.", "HERA temporarily authorized greater standby government support for the GSEs, including the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks), by allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase stock from the GSEs. In addition, HERA created a new, stronger GSE regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to replace the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO).", "As mentioned earlier, FHFA and the GSEs agreed to voluntary conservatorship, in which FHFA assumed control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Each GSE sold to Treasury $1 billion of senior preferred stock and gave Treasury warrants to purchase 79.9% of its common stock. Treasury agreed to purchase a maximum of $100 billion (later raised to $200 billion) additional senior preferred stock to maintain a positive net worth of each GSE. The first amendments to the agreements raised the support to a maximum of $200 billion each. The second amendments provided unlimited support from 2010 to 2012. This support does not count against the $200 billion maximums. The third amendments changed the 10% cash dividend paid to Treasury to have the GSEs pay all of their quarterly profits to Treasury. In the event that there are no profits in a quarter, no dividend is owed.", "In addition, the Federal Reserve has extended financial assistance to the GSEs by purchasing MBS and bonds. By law, conservatorship will end with their return to stockholder control if the GSEs become safe and solvent or with receivership if they are unable to pay their debts.", "Provisions in HERA require that a GSE be placed in mandatory receivership and its assets liquidated if (1) the GSE's assets have been less than its liabilities for 60 consecutive days, or (2) the GSE has not been paying its bills (except for debts subject to bona fide dispute) for the past 60 days. Thus far, mandatory receivership has been avoided because of the assistance from Treasury.", "The remainder of this report discusses alternatives available to Congress for restructuring or replacing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The list is not exhaustive\u2014it probably is impossible to develop a complete list. The options take as a starting point that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac return to financial health and are able to leave their current conservatorship. Unless modified by Congress or Treasury, the profit-sweep dividend on the senior preferred stock will prevent the GSEs from accumulating additional funds that could be used to return to stockholder control.", "In debating alternatives for the futures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Congress might wish to consider whether the five goals are still germane. For example, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-328 ) may have made the fourth point in the GSEs' charters (promoting mortgage credit throughout the nation) unnecessary because the act allowed interstate banking and led to more equal access to credit throughout the nation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's Business Models", "paragraphs": ["This section uses Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's business models to provide a basis for understanding their roles in the housing finance system and their problems.

They both", "sell bonds to purchase mortgages; purchase single-family mortgages that other companies have originated; guarantee investors that the mortgages will be paid and pool the mortgages to create MBS; charge sellers a fee to guarantee these mortgages; sell the MBS to institutional investors, or keep them in their own investment portfolios. If the GSE decides to keep the MBS, it uses the money raised by selling the bonds to finance these MBS. Otherwise it uses the proceeds from selling the MBS to purchase more mortgages.", "For many years, the GSEs were very profitable using this business model because they were widely viewed as having a close relationship to the federal government. Some called it an implicit federal guarantee of their bonds and MBS. This allowed the GSEs to guarantee their MBS and to finance their investment portfolios at lower cost than competitors, which had neither GSE charters nor a special relationship with the federal government. GSE profitability was increased by their charter provisions such as those exempting them from state and local income taxes, and by lower capital requirements than their non-GSE competitors. To enhance profits, the GSEs use a variety of techniques, some of which increased the riskiness of the GSEs' finances:", "Because short-term interest rates are normally lower than longer-term interest rates, the GSEs finance their investment portfolios of MBS by borrowing for short periods of time. This strategy could result in losses if interest rates were higher when this debt was refinanced. The GSEs reduced their vulnerability to increased interest rates by the use of financial derivatives. Having nationwide geographic diversification reduced the GSEs' credit or default risk. Regional declines in home prices\u2014such as the home price decline of approximately 25% between 1985 and 1990 in the \"Oil Patch\"\u2014were balanced by stable prices in other areas. The GSEs further reduced their risk by purchasing insurance from financial guaranty companies. The GSEs found profitable ways to satisfy the requirement in their charters that mortgages for more than 80% of the value of a house have credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance. For example, one GSE would purchase the first mortgage for 80% of a home's value, and the other GSE would purchase a second mortgage for 5% or even 15% of the same home's value. This resulted in larger mortgages and more fees for the GSEs, but increased the severity of losses when defaults occurred. Tax planning techniques, including purchasing tax-exempt bonds and low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), reduced the GSEs' tax liabilities. The risk of these strategies was that if the GSEs' earnings did not meet expectations, the benefits of tax planning expenditures may not be fully realized and could increase losses. Compared with many other types of financial institutions, the GSEs were required to keep less capital as a reserve against possible losses. This increased leverage made possible higher profits, but increased the risk of larger losses or financial failure compared to holding more capital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Liquidation and Alternatives", "paragraphs": ["If FHFA's conservatorship is not able to return the GSEs to financial health, there are at least two approaches that could avoid complete liquidation of the GSEs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\"Bad Bank\" Option", "paragraphs": ["First, the \"bad bank\" approach would mirror one technique used by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to resolve insolvent banks. The FDIC creates a \"bad bank\" to hold the problem assets, leaving the good assets with the original bank. Without the problem assets, the original bank is financially viable and possibly able to attract new capital. In the case of the GSEs, delinquent mortgages and MBS, with related guarantees, would be transferred to the new entity. The bad bank would need capital to purchase the nonperforming assets from the GSEs. Because the private sector would be unlikely to invest in the bad bank, the capital to purchase the assets would probably come from the federal government.", "The bad bank could require continuing funds from the government, but might continue in operation in the hope that as housing and financial markets recover, the value of the problem mortgages and MBS would increase to exceed the value of the guarantees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Senior Preferred Stock Dividends", "paragraphs": ["Second, the GSEs' senior preferred stock could be restructured so that dividend payments to Treasury become less of a financial burden to the GSEs.

These are returning control to the stockholders with no additional modification, imposing additional regulations on the GSEs, explicitly guaranteeing the GSEs' MBS, imposing utility-type profitability limits on the GSEs, merging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into the Federal Home Loan Bank System, and issuing additional GSE charters."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Option: Return Control to Stockholders", "paragraphs": ["Congress could decide to make little or no change to the GSEs' charters.

Dividends to preferred stockholders could resume. Dividends on the senior preferred stock owned by the federal government would continue. The GSEs would decide whether to retire the senior preferred stock held by the federal government. The boards of directors could resume common dividends. Bond payments would continue. As required by the contract with Treasury, the GSEs would shrink their portfolios by 15% annually until their portfolios were less than $250 billion.", "Return to stockholder control implicitly assumes that the GSEs would return to profitability. Since all quarterly profits are paid to Treasury as dividends, the GSEs cannot accumulate funds necessary to leave conservatorship. In agreeing to conservatorship, the GSEs each gave the federal government warrants to purchase 79.9% of their common stock for $0.00001 per share. Before effective control could be returned to common stockholders, the GSEs probably would need to reach some agreement with the federal government over the disposition of these warrants and the senior preferred stock. Based on similar past government intervention such as Chrysler in 1979, Continental Illinois in 1985, and more recently the troubled asset relief program (TARP), alternative dispositions of these warrants include federal government exercise, sale of the warrants through a federal government open market auction (which the GSEs could win), and federal government cancellation of the warrants. In the third quarter of 2013, with its stock trading at approximately $1.20, Fannie Mae had a market capitalization of approximately $2 billion. This would make 80% of the enterprise worth $160 billion. In the third quarter of 2013, Freddie Mac's stock price was $1.10 and its market capitalization was approximately $702 million, making 80% of Freddie Mac worth $561 million.

Arguably, the GSEs have led to many changes in the nation's mortgage markets that have improved efficiency and consumer choice, including", "standardizing mortgages, which has contributed to economies of scale and lower interest rates for homeowners; automating and standardizing underwriting, which has reduced the cost of obtaining a home mortgage; making widespread certain features such as assumable mortgages and mortgages without prepayment penalties, both of which facilitate refinancing; tapping new sources of funding including pension funds, trusts, and international investors, which has led to lower mortgage interest rates; eliminating state and local mortgage interest rate differentials, which has lowered mortgage rates in some parts of the nation, but possibly increased them in others; innovating in affordable housing and equal housing opportunity; and creating a liquid secondary mortgage market, which has lowered mortgage interest rates.", "Some might debate whether these innovations have been improvements, and others might claim to have invented them before the GSEs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Arguments Against", "paragraphs": ["There are at least three broad arguments against returning the GSEs to their former status. First, the GSEs' history includes previous financial and management problems. In 1982, Fannie Mae was in financial distress, and the government intervened after Congress passed the Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1982, which provided some tax benefits for Fannie Mae. In the early 2000s, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both had serious accounting and management issues that led to consent agreements with the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which then regulated them, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); and the GSEs' leaderships were replaced. Fannie Mae paid about $400 million in fines, and Freddie Mac paid $125 million in fines.", "Second, many, if not all, of the changes used as points in favor of returning the GSEs to stockholder control arguably would have occurred without Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, although possibly not as early. Other large mortgage market participants, such as banks and mortgage insurance companies, could have standardized and automated the lending process. Ginnie Mae, a government agency, issued the first MBS. These changes probably would have been sustained without the GSEs.", "Prior to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ( P.L. 103-328 ), banks were not allowed to operate in more than one state. Banks in one state might have many deposits relative to the demand for loans, and reduce interest rates, including those on home mortgages, to encourage borrowing. At the same time, banks in another state might have relatively few deposits compared to loan demand and would increase interest rates. Because of the ban on interstate banking, money could not easily flow between states to equalize interest rates. One of the GSEs' roles was to move funds to where demand for home mortgages was greatest. After Riegle-Neal permitted interstate banking, it was arguably inevitable that interest rates and mortgage interest rates would become uniform across the nation.", "Third, the conservatorship of the GSEs has changed the future financial environment of the GSEs such that returning to the previous system could be impossible.", "Having previously intervened, the federal government may be perceived as likely to provide any necessary future financial support to the GSEs to pay bonds, despite charter provisions that state that GSE debts are not guaranteed by the federal government. Attracting new common stockholders to recapitalize the GSEs could be difficult because of the federal government's taking control and stopping dividend payments to common stockholders.

The GSE support for affordable housing could continue.", "On the other hand, making changes to GSE regulation has been a very contentious issue whenever Congress debated it in the past; previous regulation failed to prevent the GSEs from going into conservatorship; and the federal government has expended large amounts of money to maintain the GSEs' financial viability.

The GSEs were not expected to lose money on mortgages purchased to meet the housing goals, but they were not guaranteed that the housing goals mortgages would be as profitable as other mortgages. Thus the implicit guarantee was provided at an implicit cost. One problem with implicit guarantees and implicit costs is that since their terms are not clearly defined, they are hard to value and hard to limit.", "A possible solution to this concern would be for the government to make the guarantee explicit and to charge an explicit guarantee fee. The exact terms of the guarantee could be stated. Homebuyers might directly pay this guarantee fee as they now pay the FHA's guarantee fee, or the GSEs could be charged the guarantee fee. In the latter case, the GSEs could decide how much of the fee to pass on to borrowers. By changing the guarantee fee to reflect changes in GSE risk, the federal government could provide an incentive to maintain prudent lending.", "Instead of guaranteeing the GSEs, the federal government could make the explicit guarantee available on all mortgages that met certain standards. This would be similar in effect to enlarging the FHA's guarantee program to cover more of the mortgage market. The federally guaranteed mortgages could be bundled and securitized.

Guarantees for mortgages that would be originated anyway would be an expense to the GSEs and a contingent liability for the government that would not increase homeownership.

The regulator is charged with balancing the economic interests of consumers against those of the monopoly provider.

Economic analysis generally favors competition with many firms. Over time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became virtual twins and essentially divided the conforming U.S. mortgage market between them. The result was, it could be argued, not much different from having a monopolist GSE that could charge high prices and make persistently large profits in the absence of competition. Prior to the financial turmoil that started in 2007, there were dozens of non-GSEs in the relatively small private label MBS market. With many GSEs competing and innovating in different ways, the losses caused by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have been more manageable and perhaps would not have required government intervention.", "One option to increase competition would be to split the GSEs into many more. If each GSE were split into, say, 10 equal parts (for a total of 20 housing GSEs), each of the 20 resulting GSEs would have mortgage portfolios of one-tenth its parent and have one-tenth of its parent's mortgage guarantees outstanding. Based on recent monthly volume reports, the baby Fannie Maes would each have a retained mortgage portfolio and outstanding guarantees of $320 billion; the baby Freddie Macs would each have a retained mortgage portfolio and outstanding guarantees of $196 billion.", "It might be that 20 identical GSEs would be under financial stress at the same time. One way to reduce the probability of this would be to split the GSEs in such a way that they were not all the same. To promote diversity among the new GSEs, they could be created with different geographic coverage, or to specialize in certain types of housing such as condominiums or multifamily rental housing. Existing stockholders would receive shares in the new GSEs. On the other hand, this specialization could leave new GSEs more vulnerable to declines affecting only certain types of housing.", "The GSEs would continue to be regulated.

Currently, each regional FHLBank is owned by its member banks; shares of the FHLBanks are not traded on a stock exchange. The 12 regional banks form a collective GSE that raises funds for loans (called advances) to the members, who pledge mortgages and MBS as collateral. The debt is the joint and several liabilities of the individual FHLBanks; if one bank were to become insolvent, the other banks would remain responsible for its debts. Freddie Mac was created as part of the FHLBank system to sell its mortgages on the secondary market and became a publicly traded, stockholder owned company in 1989.", "The FHLBank system could purchase Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could become a mortgage securitization facility (or facilities) within the FHLBank system.

If these are insufficient to meet the member's obligations to the FHLBank, the FHLBank can use its \"super lien,\" which gives it a priority claim over other unsecured creditors. FDIC research suggests that the FHLBanks have no incentive to risk-adjust the interest rate on advances.

The GSEs could, if Congress so desires, contribute to an insurance fund similar to the FDIC for banks. Either the existing GSE regulator, the FHFA, or a new regulator would oversee the GSEs. Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would retain all of their current assets and liabilities, there arguably would be no need to compensate existing stockholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the stockholders might object to the new competition.

In the early 1990s, the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) sought to relinquish its GSE status because of the financial burdens that came with its being a GSE and to make loans that it could not as a GSE. In 1996, Congress agreed to allow Sallie Mae to relinquish its congressional charter and give up its GSE status. Sallie Mae became a stockholder-owned company with no special privileges in 2004.", "If the GSE charters were repealed, Congress might wish to consider whether the GSEs' securitization of mortgages should be continued by a government agency. The GSEs have been able to compete against the government programs (FHA's mortgage insurance, the Veterans' Affairs mortgage guarantees, and the Department of Agriculture's rural housing programs) by creating a broader product than some government programs, and by competing on price.", "Some research has suggested that the GSEs' biggest competitive advantage against other private sector mortgage lenders derived from the close relationship with the federal government, which allowed the GSEs to borrow funds at lower rates compared to other mortgage lenders. Without GSEs and their funding advantage, investment bankers might securitize conforming mortgages that were formerly securitized by the GSEs. While there is little debate over the ability of the private mortgage market to operate in normal times, it is not clear that the private market would supply mortgage funding in times of stress. Since the GSEs entered conservatorship, there has been one private sector issue of MBS backed by mortgages that were too large for the GSEs to purchase. It could be argued, however, that at certain times a sharp reduction in the volume of new mortgages is an appropriate response to conditions.", "The impact of the GSEs on mortgage interest rates is much debated. The current spread between conforming and jumbo mortgages is greater than the historical average. A 2006 Federal Reserve study found that the GSEs did not reduce interest rates, but cites other studies that found interest rate reductions of 4 to 35 basis points with older studies finding greater reductions. (One basis point is 0.01%.) This research suggests that there could be a small increase in mortgage interest rates if the GSEs were to cease securitizing mortgages. On the other hand, this research uses the difference between mortgages that the GSEs can purchase and jumbo mortgages that the GSEs cannot buy.

The co-op would create MBS from mortgages purchased from members.

Typically, covered bonds have more collateral than the value of the bonds. If the value of the collateral declines (due to prepayment, default, foreclosure, etc.), the issuer must add additional collateral.

In the case of an insured depository institution such as a bank or thrift, covered bonds would increase the FDIC's losses. Presently, covered bonds may not exceed 4% of an FDIC-insured institution's liabilities. This limits the ability of insured depository institutions to issue covered bonds. Some have suggested that covered mortgage bonds could be issued using MBS from the GSEs or their successors.", "Covered bonds are popular in Europe, where the covered bond issuer typically originates the mortgage. Some analysts believe this aligns the interests of originators and bond holders.
