Before the 2001 tax law, the child tax credit was refundable only to some taxpayers with three or more children, but it now is refundable (up to certain limits) for those with earnings above $10,000. This report treats the direct payment component of these credits, but not the reduction in tax liability, as a welfare expenditure. Other tax benefits are excluded from the report because they are not refundable (make no direct payments). Further, in most cases they impose no income test for eligibility. Examples of these other tax benefits are the deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes on owner-occupied homes (equivalent to outlays of $61.4 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively, in 2004).

Medicaid must be continued for these persons if they need ongoing medical assistance to continue working and their earnings are not sufficient to provide the equivalent of SSI, Medicaid, and attendant care benefits for which they would qualify in the absence of earnings. States must also continue Medicaid coverage for persons who were once eligible for both SSI and Social Security payments and who lose SSI because of a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in their Social Security benefits. Similar Medicaid continuations have been provided for certain other persons who lose SSI as a result of eligibility for or increases in Social Security or veterans' benefits.
