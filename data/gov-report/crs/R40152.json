The forecast rise in 2017 net farm income comes after three consecutive years of decline from 2013's record high of $123.8 billion. Net farm income is calculated on an accrual basis. Net cash income (calculated on a cash-flow basis) is also projected to be up in 2017 but by a larger share (12.6%), driven largely by sales from previous years' inventory, to $100.4 billion.", "The 2017 net farm income forecast is substantially below the 10-year average of $86.4 billion and would be the second lowest since 2003 in inflation-adjusted dollars. This is primarily the result of the outlook for continued weak prices for corn, soybeans, and cotton. Most crops and livestock product prices remain significantly below the average for the period of 2011-2013, when prices for many major commodities attained record or near-record highs. Net farm income is down 49% since 2013; net cash income is down 26%. Farm-sector production expenses have fallen slightly over that period (-1%) but not nearly as quickly as commodity prices and revenue, thus contributing to lower aggregate income totals.", "Partially offsetting the decline in farm revenues is a rise in government payments since 2013 (+18%). In 2017, payments are projected at $13.0 billion, down slightly (-0.2%) from 2016. The Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC) revenue support programs for major field crops are expected to trigger payments of $8.4 billion in 2017, up 2.5% from 2016.", "U.S. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014, due to strong commodity prices and agricultural exports. In 2017 agricultural exports are forecast to be up 8%, at $139.8 billion, due largely to an improving economic outlook in several major foreign importing countries\u2014but still well below 2014's record of $152.3 billion. U.S. agricultural exports are projected to account for 33% of farm sector gross earnings in 2017.", "In addition to the outlook for slightly higher net farm income in 2017, farm wealth is also projected to be up 4% from 2016, to $3,075 billion. Farm asset values reflect farm investors' and lenders' expectations about long-term profitability of farm sector investments. The outlook for slightly higher farm income has reversed the decline in farmland values experienced in 2016. Because they comprise such a significant portion of the U.S. farm sector's asset base (81%), change in farmland values is a critical barometer of the farm sector's financial performance.", "At the farm household level, average farm household incomes have been well ahead of average U.S. household incomes since the late 1990s. In 2015 (the last year for which comparable data were available), the average farm household income (including off-farm income sources) of $119,880 was about 51% higher than the average U.S. household income of $79,263.", "The outlook for a slight rise in net farm income and farm wealth suggests that the farm economy has at least temporarily stabilized but with substantial regional variation. Relatively weak prices for most major program crops signal continued tough times ahead. Heading into 2018, the financial picture for the agricultural sector as a whole remains dependent on continued growth in domestic and foreign demand sources to sustain prices at current modest levels. Improvements in agricultural economic well-being will hinge on crop harvests and prices, as well as both domestic and international macroeconomic factors, including economic growth and consumer demand.", "This report is an update of the February 2017 version to take account of USDA's August 30, 2017, farm income update and the August 29, 2017, U.S. agricultural trade outlook update."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. farm sector is vast and varied.

The intensity and economic importance of each of these activities, as well as their underlying market structure and production processes, vary regionally based on the agro-climatic setting, market conditions, and other factors. As a result, farm income and rural economic conditions may vary substantially across the United States.

The downward trend in farm income since 2013 was primarily a result of the significant decline in most farm commodity prices since the 2013-2014 period. Farm prices for most feedstuffs\u2014feed grains, hay, and wheat\u2014declined during both 2015/16 and 2016/17 as U.S. and global grain stocks rebuild ( Table 4 and Figure 28 to Figure 31 ). In contrast, cotton and soybean prices showed resilience in 2016. The price outlook for 2017 is mixed. Poultry, hog, and milk prices are all projected to be higher in 2017, albeit well below their market highs of 2014/15 ( Table 4 and Figure 32 to Figure 35 ). Cattle prices are projected to be down slightly in 2017. Government payments in 2017 are projected to be down slightly (-0.2%) to $13.0 billion ( Figure 13 ). Lower marketing-assistance loan benefits and the end of the cotton ginning cost-share program, which paid $326 million in 2016, more than offset projected higher Price Loss Coverage (PLC) and Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program payments of $8.4 billion\u2014triggered by lower commodity prices. Outlays under the ARC and PLC programs (which are contingent on market prices) are intended to provide some relief for participating producers from the market downturn. Total production expenses ( Figure 14 ), at $355.1 billion, are projected to be up 1.3% in 2017, driven largely by replacement animal, labor, and interest costs. U.S. farm prices are supported in part by global demand for U.S. agricultural exports ( Figure 18 ), which are expected to rise to $139.8 billion (+8%) in 2017\u2014still well below the record of $152.3 billion set in 2014. Farm asset values are projected to be up, at $3,075 billion (+4%) in 2017, as land values strengthen.

The north-central drought expanded in late summer into Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and parts of southern Iowa. As a result of the north-central drought, USDA is forecasting substantially lower yield and output for spring-grown barley and wheat crops in the affected states. Overall, 2017 U.S. wheat production is estimated to be down nearly 25% from last year. This production shortfall, coupled with continued strong export demand for U.S. wheat, is behind an 18% increase in the U.S. wheat farm price during the 2017/18 crop year to $4.60 per bushel\u2014still below the $7.77 achieved in 2012 ( Figure 28 ). Reduced rainfall also appears to have lowered sorghum, oat, and forage-crop prospects in affected regions. However, the effect on the corn and soybean crops appears minimal.", "Corn and soybeans are the two largest U.S. commercial crops in terms of both value and quantity. These crops provide important inputs for the domestic livestock, poultry, and biofuels sectors. In addition, the United States is traditionally one of the world's leading exporters of corn, soybeans, and soybean products\u2014vegetable oil and meal. As a result, the outlook for these two crops is critical to both farm sector profitability and regional economic activity across large swaths of the United States as well as in international markets. For the past several years, U.S. corn and soybean crops have experienced remarkable growth in both productivity and output. Both crops had record harvests in 2014, above-average harvests in 2015, and record harvests again in 2016, thus helping to build stockpiles at the end of the marketing year ( Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) and pressure prices lower in U.S. and international markets ( Figure 28 through Figure 31 ) in 2017. ", "Planted acres for both feed grains (101.8 million acres) and wheat (45.7 million acres) were down in 2017 by 6.4% and 9.0%, respectively, from 2016. However, soybean-planted acres were estimated at a record 89.5 million (+7.3%). The 2017 yield outlook for both corn and soybean crops is above trend (although down from the previous year's record highs) for both, with expectations for the second-highest soybean yield (49.4 bu./ac.) and third-highest corn yield (169.9 bu./ac.) on record. The record soybean plantings coupled with the strong yield outlook combine for an expected record large soybean harvest of 4.4 billion bushels in 2017. As a result of the expected record harvest, soybean prices are projected to be lower (-3.2%) at $9.20 per bushel. Despite lower area, yield, and production, U.S. corn supplies are expected to continue to build in 2017, thus pushing the expected crop-year price down 4.5% to $3.20/bu. The corn and soybean price forecasts for 2017 are the lowest since the 2006 crop year for both crops.", "The length and severity of the California drought has important national implications for retail food prices. California production accounts for about one-third of U.S. vegetables, almost two-thirds of U.S. fruit and nuts, about 20% of U.S. milk, and a substantial portion of wine. Abundant precipitation during the 2016/17 winter has alleviated drought conditions in much of the northern portion of the state. However, the drought, which began in 2012, persists in the lower third of the state.", "The effects of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on U.S. agriculture are still being ascertained but have likely resulted in extensive crop damage. Harvey's impact focused on Texas and Louisiana. (Affected crops include upland cotton, rice, soybeans, sugar, and others.) Irma's impact focused on Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Alabama. (Affected crops include citrus, sugar, peanuts, upland cotton, soybeans, and specialty crops.) USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) announced on September 12, 2017, that it would collect harvested acreage information for a number of crops in affected states in preparation for the October Crop Production report. These additional data will help to better assess the full impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Livestock Outlook", "paragraphs": ["The changing conditions for the U.S. livestock sector may be tracked by the evolution of the ratios of livestock output prices to feed costs ( Figure 5 ). A higher ratio suggests greater profitability for producers. The cattle-, hog-, and broiler-to-feed margins all moved upwards in the first half of 2017. The hog sector, despite seeing its hog-to-feed ratio dip lower in early 2017, remains profitable. However, continued strong production growth of between 2% and 3% for red meat and poultry suggests that prices are vulnerable to any weakness in demand. ", "Milk prices and the milk-to-feed ratio turned sharply higher in 2017, suggesting improving profitability. However, this result varies widely across the United States with many small or marginally profitable producers facing continued financial difficulties. In addition, both U.S. and global milk production are projected to continue growing through 2017. As a result, milk prices could come under further pressure in the last half of 2017. With respect to the federal milk margin protection program (MPP) instituted by the 2014 farm bill (Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79 ), the formula-based milk-to-feed margin used to determine government payments is likely to remain above the $8.00 per hundredweight (cwt.) threshold needed to trigger payments ( Figure 6 ). The MPP margin differs from the USDA-reported milk-to-feed ratio shown in Figure 5 but reflects the same market forces.", "Similarly, U.S. hog and cattle herds and poultry flocks are expected to continue to expand into 2018. Cattle and hog expansion is primarily the result of a substantial lag in the biological response to the strong market price signals of late 2014. The U.S. cattle sector has been expanding since 2014. During the 2007 to 2014 period, high feed and forage prices, plus widespread drought in the Southern Plains\u2014the largest U.S. cattle production region\u2014had resulted in an 8% contraction of the U.S. cattle inventory ( Figure 7 ). Reduced beef supplies led to higher producer and consumer prices, which in turn triggered the slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle that started in 2014 (see the price-to-feed ratio for steers and heifers, Figure 5 ). The resulting continued expansion of beef supplies pressured market prices lower into 2017. However, projections of expanding domestic and international demand across all meat categories through 2018 is expected to largely stem the decline in prices and profitability in 2017 ( Figure 32 ).", "In 2014, the U.S. hog sector was hit by the rapid outbreak and spread of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv), which caused market worries about reduced U.S. pork production. The incidence of PEDv since the winter of 2014/15 has declined, and initial market fears have subsided. However, the related 2014 surge in hog prices elicited substantial producer response, and the resulting continued expansion of pork supplies through 2016 has weighed on market prices ( Figure 34 ). For pork, as with beef and poultry, projections of expanding domestic and international demand have supported prices and profitability in 2017. ", "During spring 2015, the U.S. poultry industry experienced a severe outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza. The outbreak ended by early summer 2015. More than 48 million chickens, turkeys, and other poultry were euthanized to stem the spread of the disease. Turkey and egg-laying hen farms in Minnesota and Iowa were the hardest hit. Commercial broiler farms were not affected. USDA estimates that egg production declined over 5% in 2015, pushing egg prices up 28% that year. The recovery in broiler and egg production was swift as prices fell 7% and 53% in 2016, respectively. In 2017, strong domestic and export demand is expected to push prices up by a projected 11.5% and 2.7% for broilers and eggs. ", "In sum, production of beef (+5.3%), pork (+2.2%), broilers (+1.5%), and eggs (+2.3%) are projected to expand relatively robustly in 2017. Meat and egg supplies are projected to continue growing in 2018 at 1.4% to 3.4%, respectively.
