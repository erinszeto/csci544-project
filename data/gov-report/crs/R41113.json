The state figures used in apportioning seats in the House of Representatives are based on the sum of the each state's resident population and the number of persons included in the overseas military and federal employees and their dependents who designate the state as their state of residency (i.e., where they would return to when their tour of duty was completed). The total figure for this number in the 2010 apportionment process was 1,039,648 for all 50 states.

As can be seen, when Puerto Rico is included as the 51 st state, it is allocated five seats in the House of Representatives. Without Puerto Rican statehood, California, Florida, Minnesota, Texas, and Washington would have been allocated the last five seats rather than Puerto Rico. It is fairly clear that with a population of almost 4 million people, Puerto Rico's statehood would have an impact on the apportionment process unless the size of the House is increased.", "The second comparison, and the more involved, is between the current allocation of seats based on the 2000 Census population and the allocation of the 2012 seats based on the, just released, 2010 apportionment population figures.

The Constitution also sets a minimum size for the House of Representatives (one Representative for every state) and a maximum size for the House (one Representative for every 30,000 persons). Congress is free to choose a House size within these parameters by changing the relevant law.", "Thus, the House size of 435 may be altered by changing statutory law rather than by enacting a constitutional amendment. Based on the 2010 apportionment population of 309,183,463 from Table 2 above, the House could be as large as 10,306 Representatives (based on the constitutional maximum of one Representative for every 30,000 persons). Statehood for Puerto Rico would raise the maximum to 10,430 Members.", "The House size was increased in every decade except one in the 19 th century to accommodate the growth of the country's population, but the permanent increases stopped after the 1910 census, when the House reached 435 Members. As noted previously, the House size was increased temporarily to 437 in 1960, to accommodate the admission of Alaska and Hawaii as states, but the total went back to 435 in 1963, with the new reapportionment following the 1960 census.", "Although one cannot say for sure why the House size has not been permanently increased since the 1910 census, the arguments most often raised center on efficiency and cost. Proponents of the status quo suggest that a larger House would work less efficiently and at greater cost, due to Member and staff salaries and allowances. Proponents of increasing the House size often argue that other legislative bodies seem to work well with larger memberships, and less populous districts might give minorities greater representation in Congress. Since 1940, the average population of a congressional district has more than doubled (from 303,827 in 1940 to 710,767 in\u00a02010)."], "subsections": []}]}}
