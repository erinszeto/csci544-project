Federal legislation affecting sex offender policy has largely centered on sex offender registration and notification, and therefore they are the focus of this report.", "All states have sex offender registration and notification laws; however, these laws vary widely. Congress has attempted to standardize these laws through legislation, most recently through the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a major component of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (Adam Walsh Act; P.L. 109-248) enacted in 2006. Among other things, SORNA created a three-tier classification system for sex offenders based solely on the crime of conviction. To date, 17 states, 3 territories, and many American Indian tribes have been found to have \"substantially implemented SORNA.\" SORNA stated that jurisdictions that fail to comply with its requirements risk having their annual Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funds reduced by 10%.

Researchers have developed classifications of sex offenders based on offense patterns and types of victims and offenses; these classifications include rapists, child abusers, Internet offenders, and female sexual offenders, among others. ", "In the United States, sex offender policy refers to how the government handles sex offenders both pre- and post-conviction; however, it is how jurisdictions manage sex offenders post-conviction, in particular after they have served sentences for crimes committed, that is a primary focus of policymakers and the public. Sex offenders are subject to a number of different management strategies including civil commitment, residence restrictions, registration and notification, and other policies aimed at preventing sexual offending. As mentioned, federal legislation on this issue has largely focused on sex offender registration and notification."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sex Offender Registration and Notification", "paragraphs": ["Sex offender registration is a critical way in which the public as well as state and federal authorities can track sex offenders before and after they have been released into communities. All states have sex offender registries, but they are not uniform in the information they collect, the manner in which they classify offenders, or the types of offenders they require to register (e.g., several states do not require juveniles to register under most circumstances). To be compliant with federal law, jurisdictions must register incarcerated sex offenders (for the registration offense) before they are released from custodial supervision, or within three business days from sentencing for the offense mandating registration in the case of a sentence that does not involve incarceration. ", "The term \"sex offender notification\" refers to the manner in which a jurisdiction disseminates relevant information about an offender to other jurisdictions and to the community. For example, the simple act of placing an offender's name on a public website is one mechanism for notifying the community. Just as all states have registries, all states have notification practices; and as with registries, notification varies from state to state.

Among other things, SORNA created a publicly available Internet gateway to the information housed in state registries, accessible by offender name and location. It also created a three-tier classification system for sex offenders based solely on the crime of conviction. To date, 17 states, 3 territories, and many American Indian tribes have been found to have \"substantially implemented SORNA,\" while other states have publicly objected to the requirements of SORNA. Federal law stipulates the following:", "An appropriate official shall, shortly before release of the sex offender from custody, or, if the sex offender is not in custody, immediately after the sentencing of the sex offender, for the offense giving rise to the duty to register\u2014", "(1) inform the sex offender of the duties of a sex offender under this subchapter and explain those duties;", "(2) require the sex offender to read and sign a form stating that the duty to register has been explained and that the sex offender understands the registration requirement; and", "(3) ensure that the sex offender is registered.", "Jurisdictions register offenders and notify the community according to a risk classification system. While federal law has attempted to standardize risk classification across the states, there is still considerable variation. For example, New York classifies offenders based on crime of conviction and several other factors while Pennsylvania classifies offenders based on crime of conviction alone. Risk classification has implications for the type of information that may be released about an offender and the duration of registration."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Registered Sex Offenders in the United States", "paragraphs": ["According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), as of December 2014, there are approximately 819,218 registered sex offenders in the United States.

Some state registries include individuals who are incarcerated, have been deported, or have moved out of state. ", "Some studies have described the demographics of sex offenders residing in the United States. One study used a sample of over 400,000 registered sex offenders and found that they were largely male (98%) and white (66%), and the mean age was 45 years old. While offenders in all registries were over 90% male, race varied widely across the states. For example, as of 2010 offenders registered in Alaska were 57% native and 36% white, while offenders registered in California were 46% white, 31% Hispanic, and 17% black. This study also reported that states varied widely in the ways in which offenses were captured in these registries and how the offenses were described to the public.

The following legislation highlights some of the major changes in federal sex offender registration and notification law and policy, most of which supplement or have been folded into SORNA:", "Jacob Wetterling Act: As part of the major omnibus crime bill of 1994 (Title IV of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994; P.L. 103-322 ), Congress passed the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Registration Act (Jacob Wetterling Act) to encourage and establish guidelines for states to create and maintain a sex offender registration system. Megan's Law : In 1996, Congress passed this law ( P.L. 104-145 ) to induce state and local law enforcement agencies to release relevant sex offender information that is necessary to protect the public (i.e., to notify the public). Congress also specified that \"information collected under a State registration program may be disclosed for any purpose permitted under the laws of the State.\" Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 : This law (Lychner Act; P.L. 104-236 ) amended the Jacob Wetterling Act to establish within the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) a national database to track certain sex offenders. It also required each sex offender who resides in a state that has not established a \"minimally sufficient sexual offender registration program\" to register with the FBI. Further, it provided that offenders required to register with the FBI must notify the FBI of changes in residence, and in turn, the FBI must verify the offender's address. Under this law, the FBI may release relevant information regarding an offender that is necessary to protect the public. This law also required the FBI to disclose offender information to federal, state, and local criminal justice agencies for purposes of law enforcement and community notification. Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998 (amendments to existing federal sex offender laws): In 1997, this appropriations act ( P.L. 105-119 ) made several changes to sex offender requirements for states, including a change to the requirement that a state must designate a law enforcement agency to handle sex offender registration and notification. It also directed states to participate in the FBI's national sex offender registry according to guidelines later issued by the Attorney General. This law also created new interstate requirements, including requiring each state to set up procedures for registering sex offenders from out of state and requiring registered sex offenders to register in states in which they worked or attended school if different from where they resided. The law also directed state courts to consider the recommendation of sex offender experts, victims' rights advocates, and representatives of law enforcement agencies when considering the status of a sexually violent predator. It also extended registration requirements to sex offenders convicted in federal or military courts and required federal and military authorities to ensure that offenders are notified of the registration requirement. Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act: In 1998, this law ( P.L. 105-314 ) required the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to create a Sex Offender Management Assistance Program to assist states with the costs of complying with registration requirements. Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act : As part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 ( P.L. 106-386 ), Congress passed the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act to require any individual who is required to register in a state to also notify each institution of higher education in that state at which the individual works or is a student, including notification of changes in enrollment or employment status. It also required that state procedures ensure that information collected on the individual is (1) promptly shared with the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over the institution and (2) entered into the respective state data system. It amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require certain institutions of higher education to advise the campus community about where sex offender registry data may be obtained. Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act: In 2003, this law ( P.L. 108-21 ) encouraged that the release of information on registered sex offenders also include the maintenance of the website containing such information. It also required the Department of Justice (DOJ) to create a national website that links all state websites containing registry data and authorized appropriations for FY2004-FY2007 to assist states in complying with new requirements. Further, it authorized the use of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) funding in assisting state and local law enforcement with sex offender registry management and offender compliance. Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA): In 2006, SORNA (Title I of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act; P.L. 109-248 ) absorbed and replaced many of the earlier registration and notification components noted above and amended federal standards for sex offender registration and notification in the states to make them more uniform and inclusive, among other things. It established the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending, and Tracking (SMART Office) within DOJ to administer the sex offender registration and notification standards, administer grant programs relating to the law's implementation, and assist jurisdictions and organizations involved in sex offender registration and notification activities. Of note, it implemented a 10% reduction in funding under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program for states that failed to comply with requirements of SORNA.

Among other things, it would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish \"the Angel Watch Center\" within ICE to receive and transmit information on travel by child-sex offenders and establish a system to maintain and archive all relevant information, including decisions not to transmit notification abroad and responses of destination countries to notifications. These actions would be seemingly duplicative of what is underway at DOJ and DHS; however, as GAO notes in its 2013 report, the three agencies currently involved in notification of foreign travel do not consistently share information with each other, and as a result \"USNCB and ICE were not able to notify their foreign counterparts about a large number of registered sex offenders traveling internationally from August to September 2012, and some of the notifications were not as comprehensive as possible.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Issues with Registration of Sex Offenders in the Military", "paragraphs": ["Military sex offense convictions trigger registration requirements as well; however, there is not a separate registry for federal and military sex offenders.
