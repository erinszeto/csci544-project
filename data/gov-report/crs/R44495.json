If the estimated cash inflows exceed the estimated cash outflows\u2014that is, if the insured loans are expected to earn more money for the government than they cost\u2014then the program is said to have a negative credit subsidy. A negative credit subsidy results in offsetting receipts, which, in the case of FHA, can offset other costs of the HUD budget.", "Historically, the MMI Fund has been estimated to have negative credit subsidy. The resulting offsetting receipts are usually the single largest source of offsets in the HUD budget. While the President's budget request estimates the amount of FHA offsetting receipts, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) does its own estimates, and the CBO estimates are the ones that are used by congressional appropriators to determine budget authority.

This is a slight increase from FY2016, when the MMI Fund's single-family programs were estimated to earn just over $7 billion.

", "The President's budget requested $160 million for FHA's administrative contract expenses, $30 million more than was provided in FY2016.

It sets forth spending and revenue levels, including spending allocations to House and Senate committees. These levels are enforceable by a point of order. After the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees receive their discretionary spending allocations from the budget resolution (referred to as 302(a) allocations), they divide their allocations among their 12 subcommittees (referred to as the 302(b) allocations). Each subcommittee is responsible for one of the 12 regular appropriations bills. While a budget resolution and subcommittee allocations alone cannot be used to determine how much funding any individual account or program will receive, they do set the parameters within which decisions about funding for individual accounts and programs can be made. ", "The House and the Senate did not adopt a budget resolution for FY2017. In its absence, the Senate Budget Committee chair filed budgetary levels in the Congressional Record that are enforceable in the Senate as if they had been included in a budget resolution for FY2017. Based on these levels, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported their initial 302(b) suballocations on April 18, 2016. They include $56.474 billion for the THUD subcommittee, which is approximately $1 billion less than the comparable FY2016 level ($57.301 billion). In the absence of a budget resolution in the House, the House Appropriations Committee chose to adopt \"interim 302(b) suballocations\" for the appropriations bills as they were marked up in full committee. These interim suballocations are not procedurally enforceable. A suballocation for the THUD subcommittee of $58.190 billion was included in H.Rept. 114-606 .", "The Budget Control Act and Sequestration", "In 2011, the Budget Control Act (BCA, P.L. 112-25 ) was enacted, which both increased the debt limit and contained provisions intended to reduce the budget deficit through spending limits and reductions. In part, the BCA was intended to accomplish deficit reduction by imposing statutory limits on discretionary spending each fiscal year from FY2012 through FY2021. The BCA specifies separate limits for defense and nondefense spending; HUD discretionary programs are subject to the nondefense discretionary limits. ", "In addition to the initial spending limits set in the BCA, the law tasked a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to develop a federal deficit reduction plan for Congress and the President to enact by January 15, 2012. When a plan was not enacted, the BCA required that a one-time sequestration of nonexempt discretionary spending occur in FY2013. (Sequestration is a process of automatic, largely across-the-board spending reductions.) In addition, the BCA required that the discretionary spending limits be lowered further for FY2014 through FY2021. Various amendments to the BCA have been enacted that have altered the discretionary spending reductions that were otherwise scheduled to occur under that law. Most recently, the enactment of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 had the effect of lessening the BCA reductions for FY2016 and FY2017, by establishing higher levels for those fiscal years' limits than otherwise would have been the case. Under current law, those BCA reductions are to resume for the FY2018 limits. ", "In each fiscal year, if discretionary funding is enacted that exceeds either of the limits (defense or non-defense), then sequestration will be imposed to reduce spending in the applicable category. In terms of mandatory funding, the BCA provided for reductions of nonexempt programs through sequestration each year through FY2021. This has subsequently been amended to occur through FY2024."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
