What constitutes a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee has been left by Congress for the Secretary of Labor to define and delimit. That process, begun in 1938, lapsed after 1975 and was renewed by the Bush Administration in 2003 (see 29 CFR 541).", "The first Section 13(a)(1) regulation appeared in 1938. Inter alia, it imposed two classification tests. First. To qualify as bona fide, a worker had to be paid at a rate befitting an executive or administrator. Second. The worker had to perform the actual work (duties) of an executive or administrator. A salary threshold was set at $30 a week. Initially, professionals were subject only to a duties test. In 1940, an earnings threshold ($50 a week) was set for professionals.", "Definitions were modified periodically (both the earnings and duties tests) so that they could serve, credibly, as indicators of who might be deemed an executive, administrator or professional for Section 13(a)(1) purposes. Updates were always contentious. With lower thresholds, greater numbers of workers would find themselves unprotected by the terms of the FLSA. Thus, it was in the interests of employers to keep the thresholds low\u2014and the duties tests as broad as possible. Workers, in turn, sought a higher threshold and a narrow definition of duties.", "The last general revision occurred in 1975, but the effort encountered significant objections from employers. In 1978, a further update was proposed; but, in 1981, it was withdrawn by the new Reagan Administration. It never reappeared. The thresholds remain at 1975 levels: $155 per week for executives and administrators and $170 for professionals\u2014with slightly lower levels for Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa. The duties tests have evolved, slowly, since 1938 but remain heavily anchored in regulations from the act's early history.", "On March 31, 2003, Wage/Hour Administrator Tammy McCutchen published in the Federal Register a proposed update of the Section 13(a)(1) regulation. The proposal sparked an intense public and legislative debate. (See, inter alia, H.R. 2660, H.R. 2673, H.R. 2665, H.R. 4520, S. 1485, S. 1611, and S. 1637 of the 108th Congress.) On April 23, 2004, DOL issued the rule in final form (Federal Register, April 23, 2004, pp. 22122-22274) to take effect the last week of August 2004.

On October 19, 1938, five days before the act was to go into effect, the Department announced that the Administrator, \"in consultation with the legal branch of the division,\" had reached a determination. The terms executive and administrative would have a single definition. Among other elements, they were to have the \"primary duty\" of \"management of the establishment\" and do \"no substantial amount of work of the same nature as that performed by nonexempt employees of the employer.\" The concept of professional was to be characterized by work that was \"predominantly intellectual and varied in character as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work\" and was to involve \"discretion and judgment both as to the manner and time of performance, as opposed to work subject to active direction and supervision.\" The education of a professional was to be based upon \"a specially organized body of knowledge as distinguished from a general academic education and from an apprenticeship\" or other routine training. He (or she) was not to do any \"substantial amount of work of the same nature as that performed by non-exempt employees of the employer.\"", "The entire regulation, including introductory comments by Andrews, took up two columns in the Federal Register .

No earnings threshold was set for a professional.", "In setting forth the Section 13(a)(1) regulations, Andrews had affirmed that the machinery, within the Department, was in place for contesting any aspect of the definitions that were deemed flawed, inviting citizen input. But, apparently protests were not forthcoming except, possibly, with respect to the concept of professional. Addressing the Associated Industries of New York meeting at Syracuse in late 1938, Rufus Poole, Assistant General Counsel for the Wage and Hour Division, asked:", "Have you ever tried to define a professional? That is hard enough, but engaged in a \"bona fide professional capacity\" is even harder. The dictionaries do not give us the answer. They indicate that sometimes the word \"professional\" is used to mean a person engaged in one of the learned professions\u2014that is medicine, law and the ministry. Then, the dictionaries talk about education and skill and even about one who engages in sports for money. We had to define this term so that employers and employees could use it....", "The concept of professional, he stated, was the \"only one that has been seriously questioned to date\" and, even here, DOL found that critics were not able to suggest \"a better definition.\" Poole added: \"There is a statutory duty on the Administrator to promulgate a definition. So we put out the best definition we could.\"", "Gradually, employers would voice concern with the Section 13(a)(1) structure: particularly with respect to \"certain high-salaried employees.\" \"As the statute now stands,\" Andrews stated, \"these persons are covered unless they fall within the definition of employees engaged in an executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\" Some employers had argued, Andrews reported, \"that certain employees who do not fall within these categories ... are, nevertheless, paid rather high salaries and are engaged steadily in work which is of a very responsible nature.\" But: \"The number of such employees is not know[n] nor is the extent to which the provisions of Section 7 of the act may impose changes in the personnel policies and the administrative practices of business enterprises.\" Andrews concluded: \"... any line of demarcation placing these high-salaried employees into a separate category for special treatment would have to be very carefully drawn....\"", "Meanwhile, legislation was introduced that would variously have modified Section 13(a)(1) especially with respect to treatment of professionals or higher wage employees or both, though this does not appear to have been a high priority, neither with DOL nor with Congress. Andrews indicated his support for \"certain clarifying amendments\" to the FLSA but opposed the measure reported from the House Labor Committee (H.R. 5435 of the 76 th Congress) as \"A Bill to Lower Wages and Establish Longer Hours of Work.\" The legislation was not adopted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hearings and Administrative Review", "paragraphs": ["During the fall of 1939, Andrews left the Department and was succeeded as Administrator by Colonel Philip B.

Apparently anticipating a relatively low-key review (since the EAP exemption appears to have sparked little controversy), the hearing was projected as a one-day affair (April 10) with the Division's Harold Stein designated to preside. In an accompanying press statement, the Division stated:", "Until recently the Wage and Hour Division had not received any formal application for such exemptions and hearing. The hearing now ordered is in response to the first petitions that were presented. They were granted promptly, which disposes of all pending petitions, and [were] the only ones which have been sent to the Division requesting amendment and hearing in connection with Section 13(a)(1) of the Act.", "The Division further advised that the hearing \"is confined to the wholesale distributive trades because those are the only interests which have petitioned for amendments and hearing on the definitions in question.\"", "As Fleming would later observe, \"the power to define is the power to exclude.\" The scope of the exemption (or of wage/hour protection) would rest on the manner in which the basic concepts surrounding the Section 13(a)(1) exemption were defined: not just the pivotal words executive, administrative or professional , but also the terms of the explanatory language associated with the regulation.", "When that reality was understood by the public, there was a move for more comprehensive hearings. Abraham Isserman, Counsel for the American Newspaper Guild, wrote to Fleming urging caution.", "From the way this hearing was announced, first impression was gained that persons employed in these categories in the newspaper industry would not be affected by this hearing.", "On reflection, however, it becomes apparent that if these categories are re-defined for the wholesale distributive trades, a precedent undoubtedly will be established which will have a tremendous weight in the other industries covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.", "Isserman suggested that the hearing could result, whatever its intent, in \"a fait accompli in the way of changed definitions in respect to which they would have had no opportunity for study and comment.\" He suggested a somewhat broader agenda than the announcement had stated and urged the Division to make clear to all interested parties the potential implications of the April 10 hearing.", "Fleming, in response, indicated that he had considered and rejected concerns such as those of Isserman prior to announcing the hearing.", "There is such a wide variation in the work and functions performed by executive, administrative and professional employees ... especially in the administrative and professional classes, that it appeared more practicable to hold separate industry hearings. It follows that a definition for one of these classifications in one industry is not necessarily to be treated as a precedent in others.", "Fleming invited Isserman and representatives of other worker interests to attend the hearing as observers or to submit oral or written comments. But, he also held out the possibility that hearings dealing with other industries might be conducted. Fleming extended the comment period with respect to the April 10 hearing and released the text of the changes proposed by the various industry groups.", "The hearing commenced as scheduled, but it extended intermittently through several months. \"In addition to the oral testimony, approximately 180 briefs, written statements and memoranda were received.\" Some proposals were sweeping in concept. The Division estimated that \"some 1,500,000 clerical or 'white collar' workers employed by all establishments in all industries\" were covered by the act and could be rendered exempt (i.e., ineligible for minimum wage and overtime pay protection), depending upon the manner in which the basic concepts were defined. Some argued for a series of regional differentials or earnings/coverage thresholds based upon the population of the communities in which the firms operated. How should on-the-job training be treated for overtime pay purposes? Or, \"the efforts of ambitious young men to improve their status by studying their employer's business after working hours?\" Other issues were also raised, some of which would reappear frequently through the next several decades.", "In his review of the evidence, Stein took pains to distinguish between the terms \"defined\" and \"delimited\" as they appear in Section 13(a)(1).

The work of an administrative employee, for example, would need to be \"non-manual.\" Limitation on the amount of time devoted to non-EAP duties must be no more than 20%.
