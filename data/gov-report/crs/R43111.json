From the contractor perspective, the government's online systems streamline the processes involved in fulfilling various administrative requirements, provide access to possible contracting opportunities, and are potential resources for market research.", "Congressional interest in the government's online procurement systems, and, relatedly, the federal acquisition process, flows from the institution's responsibilities involving government spending and oversight of executive branch operations. Congress monitors how well the federal acquisition process works, which includes several web-based systems, and also uses data and information available from some of the systems as resources for its oversight activities.", "The federal government's major, governmentwide web-based acquisition systems include Acquisition Central, Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS), Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) Portal (this system is known as the \"FFATA Portal\"), Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), FFATA Sub-Award Reporting System (FSRS), Interagency Contract Directory (ICD), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), System for Award Management (SAM), USAspending.gov, and Wage Determinations On-line (WDOL).", "Interest in the federal government's online acquisition systems is reflected in a variety of issues and topics. Over the years, questions have been raised regarding the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the contract award data available from FPDS and its successor, FPDS-NG. Recent efforts to remedy these problems include guidance issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in 2011, which provides instructions for calculating and reporting the accuracy and completeness of data submitted to FPDS-NG. The most recent information available regarding FPDS-NG data shows that, governmentwide, the four-year average (FY2008-FY2011) for completeness was 98.3% and for sample accuracy 94.0%.", "Another significant topic involving the government's web-based acquisition systems was the launch of the System for Award Management in 2012. The following three systems became part of SAM in July 2012: Central Contractor Registration (CCR, which includes Federal Agency Registration (FedReg)), Excluded Parties List System (EPLS), and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). When completed, SAM will also include five other online procurement systems, plus the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). A variety of issues and problems, including separate logins, overlapping data, the absence of a single, uniform level of service, and multiple vendors hosting the systems, prompted interest in developing an integrated system.", "Although this report does not focus on transparency, several issues discussed here are related to transparency. First, while the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website and FPDS-NG provide information about executive branch agencies' procurements, a database of federal agencies' contracts does not exist. In 2003, GSA established a working group to examine the feasibility, challenges, and anticipated benefits of posting federal contracts online. Ultimately, the working group concluded there were insufficient data to support recommending the establishment of a central system for posting contracts online. In 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD), GSA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) regarding posting contracts online. Comments submitted in response to the notice identified several challenges, and the matter was concluded when the agencies withdrew the ANPR. Second, transparency does not necessarily equate to comprehension. Generally, variation exists among the users of government procurement systems regarding their knowledge of government procurement and procurement data. Third, during the 113th Congress, two similar bills (H.R. 2061 and S. 994) with the same name (Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, or DATA Act) were introduced, either of which would enhance transparency of spending data, including certain procurement data.

Web-based procurement systems are essential for completing certain processes and fulfilling various requirements including, for example, publicizing contracting opportunities, helping to ensure that the government only does business with responsible contractors, capturing subcontracting information, and collecting and maintaining contract award data. Possible benefits conferred by the suite of acquisition systems include enhanced efficiency, improved access to information, mitigation of the administrative burden shared by federal employees and contractors, and the timely collection of accurate data. The government's reliance on web-based systems is not surprising for yet another reason: the magnitude of government procurement. Beginning with FY2008, the federal government has spent over $500 billion and conducted at least 5.7 million contract actions each fiscal year through FY2012. During the same time period, federal agencies dealt with at least 154,000 contractors each fiscal year. This figure does not include entities that competed for, but were not awarded, any government contract.", "Congressional interest in the executive branch's procurement systems (and, more broadly, government procurement) is fueled by a combination of its responsibilities. As the keeper of the federal purse and the body responsible for oversight of the executive branch, Congress takes a keen interest in how federal agencies spend the funds appropriated to them and, generally, how well the acquisition process works. While congressional oversight of government procurement includes overseeing web-based acquisition systems, these systems also serve as resources for congressional oversight efforts as well as legislative activities. Additionally, some online procurement systems may be useful when crafting responses to constituents who have commented on, or requested assistance related to, government procurement. Relatedly, Congress has demonstrated an ongoing interest in promoting the transparency of government spending data, including contract award information, for citizens and other interested parties.", "This report begins with an overview of major online procurement systems that support certain acquisition processes, or contain data about agencies' procurements.

Contracting officers, and other members of the government's acquisition workforce, post solicitations (and other documents, such as sources sought notices) on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. In turn, FedBizOpps is a resource for would-be government contractors seeking opportunities to sell their goods or services to the government. The System for Award Management streamlines the registration process for prospective and current contractors while providing a single repository of information for agency personnel to use, for example, to confirm business size, review contractors' certifications, and pay contractors. To aid in ensuring that the government does business only with responsible contractors, agency personnel also use SAM to determine whether a contractor is presently suspended or debarred, and query the Federal Awardee Performance Information and Integrity System (FAPIIS). Contracting officers submit performance information to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and, in turn, use information stored in the system when evaluating a contractor's past performance. ", "Some web-based acquisition systems may primarily serve other purposes and other users. Congressional staff and agency personnel may find the contract award data available on the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG) website useful when developing, or implementing, policy. A push for transparency led to the passage of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA, P.L. 109-282 ). FFATA mandated the development of a user-friendly system comprising a variety of government spending data, including procurement data. Another effort aimed at enhancing transparency involves FAPIIS. Subsequent to the establishment of FAPIIS, legislation was enacted which made the contents of this system, except for past performance data, accessible to the public.", " Table 1 contains information regarding 11 web-based acquisition systems and a related Department of Labor system.

FPDS was established in February 1978, and by fall 1982 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had published three reports that documented deficiencies in the completion and accuracy of data submitted by federal agencies. A decade later, during preparations for the transition from FPDS to FPDS-NG, GAO reported to the Director of OMB in late 2003 that FPDS data were \"inaccurate and incomplete.\" During the transition, agencies were asked to \"review their data and identify and correct any deficiencies\" before they transferred the data to FPDS-NG and certify \"the accuracy and completeness\" of their FY2004 data. Yet, in 2005, GAO shared its concerns with the OMB Director regarding the \"[t]imeliness and accuracy of data\" and \"[e]ase of use and access to data\" in FPDS-NG. In its 2007 report, the Acquisition Advisory Panel (AAP) catalogued several problems with FPDS-NG, including inaccurate data, unclear instructions, the system's failure to capture certain data, and validation rules that did not function as intended. An April 2008 review of \"complex service acquisitions\" by GAO revealed that \"the FPDS-NG field identifying major programs was typically blank.\" Other GAO studies revealed difficulties in identifying interagency contracts in FPDS-NG because of the way they were coded, and reported that \"some contracts were incorrectly coded as T&M [time and material] contracts while others were incorrectly coded as having acquired commercial services.\"", "Reports of procurement data problems have been met by efforts to ensure the data are accurate and complete, and reported in a timely manner. Most recently, the Administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama have provided guidance to agencies regarding data submitted to FPDS-NG. The latest guidance, which was issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) in 2011, complements and expands upon FAR 4.604. Under FAR 4.604(a), an agency's senior procurement executive \"is responsible for developing and monitoring a process to ensure timely and accurate reporting of contractual actions to FPDS [FPDS-NG].\" Additionally, the chief acquisition officer of the agency \"must submit to the General Services Administration (GSA), in accordance with FPDS [FPDS-NG] guidance, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an annual certification of whether, and to what degree, agency CAR [contract action report] data for the preceding fiscal year is complete and accurate.\"", "OFPP's 2011 memorandum provides instructions, sampling methodologies, and templates for agencies to use in calculating and reporting the accuracy and completeness of data submitted to FPDS-NG. Agencies are required to compute the accuracy of 25 \"key data elements,\" including date signed, extent competed, type of set aside, and place of manufacture. Governmentwide, the four-year average (FY2008-FY2011) for completeness was 98.3% and for sample accuracy 94.0%. Data were not provided for individual agencies, and these are the most recent data available.", "OFPP also stated in its memorandum that, in conjunction with GSA, it would carry out the following activities as part of its \"sustained efforts to improve procurement data quality throughout the year\":", "\"continue the interagency working group on data quality, focusing on emerging issues, challenges, solutions, guidance, and process improvements;\" \"revitalize the [online] community of practice ... to collect tools and agency best practices for improving data quality and host focused discussions on key issues; and\" \"collaborate with the Federal Acquisition Institute and the Defense Acquisition University to review and improve related workforce training and development and to develop a better understanding of how procurement data are used throughout the acquisition process.\"", "Additionally, policies, system limitations, and regulations can be sources of seemingly inaccurate, or incomplete, data; lead to unusual, or anomalous, results; or hamper transparency. Examples include the following:", "FPDS-NG does not contain classified data, or information about purchases for \"petroleum or petroleum products ordered against a Defense Logistics Agency Indefinite Delivery Contract.\" DOD's procurement data are not available immediately through FPDS-NG; the data are \"subject to a 90-day delay.\" When registering in SAM, a business may choose to identify itself as, for example, a woman owned business or minority owned business. Independent verification of these designations is not required, which leaves open the question of the accuracy of this type of information. Data in FPDS-NG are identified, or organized, as data elements, and, over the years, data elements have been added, deleted, or revised. It is possible that the inclusion of a recently added data element, or one that is scheduled to be removed, in a user's search could affect the results. For example, conducting a search for FY2007 procurement data that includes a data element added to FPDS-NG in FY2010 might yield anomalous results. Regarding transparency, some might argue that it is hampered by regulations that permit the use of a generic Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number. Generally, an entity is required to have a unique DUNS when registering in SAM. Under certain circumstances, an entity may use an authorized generic DUNS number (e.g., 123456787, which is identified as \"Miscellaneous Foreign Awardees\"), which precludes identification of the contractor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System for Award Management (SAM)", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned above, an initiative is underway to consolidate eight procurement websites, and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, into one system.

When discussing SAM, these websites are referred to as \"legacy systems.\"", "The history of SAM begins with the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE). Established by OMB in 2001 and housed within GSA, IAE \"was initiated to integrate, standardize, and streamline some of the many different acquisition data systems used throughout the government.\" The development and implementation of web-based acquisition systems occurred independently and, accordingly, without an overarching, comprehensive plan, as the federal government shifted from paper-based systems to web-based systems for its procurement processes. The mix of government procurement systems also included \"unique data systems\" that had been developed by some agencies for their own use. IAE's initial strategy was to \"adopt, adapt, acquire,\" which involved adopting existing data systems that had been developed by federal agencies (e.g., DOD's CCR), adapting existing systems (e.g., transforming FPDS into FPDS-NG), and acquiring systems to fulfill unmet needs (e.g., ORCA).", "Although IAE improved the acquisition systems it inherited, questions remained regarding, among other things, the efficiency, responsiveness, and coherence of the existing systems. Testifying at a congressional hearing in fall 2009, the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) described the problems associated with the multiple procurement systems.", "Each of the eight IAE systems was originally developed independently, used different software, and operated on different hardware platforms run by different contractors. In this complex and stove-piped environment, it was difficult to respond to policy or technology changes in a timely manner.", "Specific issues, or problems, included separate logins, which are \"inefficient and confusing\"; overlapping data, which is \"inefficient and creates opportunity for error\"; no single or uniform level of service, which could subject users to varying levels of service; and multiple vendors hosting the systems, which is \"more expensive than consolidated hosting.\"", "At the same hearing where he described the problems with the existing acquisition systems, the Federal CIO stated that consolidating the eight systems into \"an integrated platform for procurement\" would improve data quality, simplify access to procurement data, and improve the usability of the procurement systems.", "The effort to develop an integrated platform began in February 2010 when GSA awarded a contract to IBM US Federal to consolidate nine systems (eight procurement systems plus the CFDA) into SAM.

The performance issues and defects continue to impact end to end award management processes within the system, forcing users to rely on emergency system workarounds.", "Concerns about the operability of SAM also prompted GSA to re-establish temporarily its Excluded Parties List System website in fall 2012. Contracting officers use EPLS to determine whether prospective contractors have been excluded from receiving government contracts.", "DOD responded to SAM performance issues by issuing a class deviation from registration requirements and annual representations and certifications requirements for contractors. The Defense Department's memorandum noted that \"SAM has experienced performance issues that have affected the timely processing of awards,\" and added that GSA had been working aggressively to resolve the issues promptly. Reportedly, the Administrator of OFPP stated, in September 2012, that \"'GSA has a lot of thinking to do before they implement future phases of SAM....

Specifically, the Acting FAS Commissioner and the Deputy CIO have taken over management of SAM. The same announcement noted that the Acting Administrator of General Services has \"called for the development, reporting and monitoring of key metrics around the SAM implementation.\"", "While performance problems were not apparent publicly until implementation had begun, budget and schedule problems were identified earlier. In March 2012, GAO reported that the project has been plagued by cost increases, funding shortages, and schedule delays. Failure to \"adequately execute the SAM hosting strategy as initially planned\" and increased \"demand for help desk services\" contributed to higher development costs. GAO estimated that the cost of SAM-related contracts increased from $96.0 million (initial contract award amounts) to $181.1 million (GAO estimate). The increase in cost was due mostly to \"higher than expected hosting costs.\" While costs have been increasing, \"the program also did not receive funding increases it requested.\" GSA's response has been to modify and delay the schedule, and defer payments or revise contract requirements. GAO recommended that GSA \"[r]eassess the SAM business case to compare the costs and benefits of various alternatives,\" and, if it makes sense to continue the project, then \"reevaluate the hosting strategy\" and \"take steps to ensure that the SAM development contract payments are more closely aligned with the program schedule and delivery of capabilities.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Access to and Comprehension of Procurement Information and Data", "paragraphs": ["Public access to procurement information and data, which is often couched in terms of transparency, has grown over the years.

DOD, GSA, and NASA advocate a judicious approach to establishing contract-posting requirements, one that will appropriately conserve resources and identify information that should be protected from general release to the public. Our assessment is that any contract posting requirement, at a minimum, should involve \u2026 a high dollar threshold [regarding the value of a contract], a requirement for only the successful offeror to redact the contract and/or proposal that will be posted, and an incentive for the successful offeror to do so.", "Necessary protections for information and personnel involve, at a minimum, a FOIA analysis, which is time consuming and requires senior analysts and attorneys.
