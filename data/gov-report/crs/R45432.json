This flexibility results in variability across state Medicaid programs.", "In general, benefits are made available to Medicaid enrollees via two service delivery systems: fee for service (FFS) or managed care. Under FFS, the state Medicaid program pays health care providers for each covered service provided to a Medicaid enrollee. Under managed care, Medicaid enrollees receive most or all of their services through a managed care organization (MCO), which is under contract with the state and is paid primarily on a capitated basis (i.e., a set amount per enrollee regardless of the services used).", "For the most part, states establish their own payment rates for services rendered by Medicaid providers.

For example, states may provide supplemental payments to providers to support quality initiatives, graduate medical education (GME), and certain types of facilities (e.g., rural or safety-net providers), among other reasons. Often, providers receive supplemental payments in a lump sum. States make supplemental payments through FFS, managed care, and waivers, but the mechanism for making these payments differs according to the service delivery system.", "Most states make supplemental payments under FFS. Some of these payments are federally required, whereas others are optional for states. States make supplemental payments to many different Medicaid providers, such as hospitals, nursing facilities, physicians, and mental health facilities. Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments are the only type of FFS supplemental payment that states are required to make. States also are permitted, but not required, to make other non-DSH FFS supplemental payments, which typically are limited by upper payment limits (UPLs) for certain institutional providers. These UPLs are what Medicare would pay for the same or comparable services.", "All states and the District of Columbia make either DSH or non-DSH supplemental payments under FFS, and these payments represent a sizeable percentage of total Medicaid spending.

Pass-through payments are similar to FFS supplemental payments because they are not tied to any specific services for Medicaid enrollees. States have used pass-through payments to support safety-net providers that provide care for Medicaid managed care enrollees, among other reasons.

Through several regulations, CMS is phasing down states' use of pass-through payments in managed care. The following is a summary of the recent regulatory activity regarding pass-through payments.", "In 2016, CMS issued a managed care regulation that included a limit on the use of existing and future pass-through payments. The regulation required states to phase out pass-through payments to physicians and nursing facilities over a 5-year period and to phase out pass-through payments to hospitals over a 10-year period, beginning July 1, 2017. CMS noted that hospitals received a longer phasedown schedule because the pass-through payments from states to hospitals are \"significantly larger\" than the pass-through payments to physicians and nursing facilities. The regulation permitted states to eliminate or phase down pass-through payments before the end of the transition period. ", "In response to the 2016 final rule, states attempted to increase existing or implement new pass-through payments. In a final rule published in January 2017, CMS clarified that the intention of the 2016 final rule was to maintain existing pass-through payments at current levels and prohibit states from implementing new pass-through payments. Therefore, the rule established an aggregate limit on pass-through payments to physicians and nursing facilities; the limit was the amounts in place in managed care contracts and rate certifications as of the effective date of July 5, 2016.

The base amount is essentially the amount of inpatient and outpatient hospital services used by eligible populations, which CMS considers equivalent to the UPL calculations under FFS. ", "CMS explained that the transition periods for pass-through payments are intended to allow states to integrate existing pass-through payments to MCOs through delivery system and payment models that are tied to outcomes and quality. CMS clarified that examples of permissible payment structures include value-based purchasing models, delivery system reform efforts, and specific types of provider payments. ", "The regulation permitted states to direct existing pass-through payments to MCOs during the transition period if states also meet several other requirements, including achieving at least one of the goals or objectives within the state's managed care quality strategy and developing an evaluation plan to assess the directed payments' outcomes. CMS has reported that, as an example of a permissible directed payment, one state is directing managed care plans to make quality incentive payments to in-network hospitals to reduce potentially avoidable hospital readmissions for Medicaid enrollees. After July 1, 2022, for physicians and nursing facilities and after July 1, 2027, for hospitals, any payments that states direct MCOs to make to providers must be integrated into value-based purchasing models, delivery system reform or performance improvement efforts, and specific types of provider payments, such as fee schedules or uniform dollar or percentage increases. ", "On November 8, 2018, CMS published a proposed rule designed to offer additional flexibilities from the requirements of the 2016 and 2017 rules. Although the 2018 rule would not change the prohibition on states increasing existing pass-through payments, it would allow states to make new pass-through payments under certain circumstances. The proposed rule would allow states that are transitioning new services or populations from FFS to managed care to make new pass-through payments to hospitals, nursing facilities, or physicians, as long as the state had previously been making FFS supplemental payments for those services and the aggregate payment amount is less than or equal to the previous FFS supplemental payments. ", "There are no national data publicly available regarding the amount of pass-through payments. States report only the aggregate amount of payments to managed care plans in the CMS-64 form, not the amounts to specific providers or a breakout by payment type. As of May 6, 2016, CMS estimated that at least 8 states were making a total of $105 million in pass-through payments to physicians annually; 3 states were making a total $50 million in pass-through payments to nursing facilities annually; and 16 states were making a total of $3.3 billion in pass-through payments to hospitals annually.

These milestones initially are tied to reporting or process implementation; they then transition to outcomes-based milestones, such as improving care and lowering costs. For example, California's DSRIP program is assisting providers to better integrate physical and behavioral health and to improve care management for high-risk or high-cost populations. In New Jersey, each of the participating hospitals is focused on improving care for one chronic condition, including asthma, obesity, and diabetes.", "CMS has noted that DSRIP programs are intended to be time-limited.
