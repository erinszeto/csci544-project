Uranium milling operations generate uranium concentrate, also known as \"yellowcake\" uranium, and waste material, called tailings , which can harbor and liberate radioactive and non-radioactive constituents.", "Title I of UMTRCA authorized a remedial action program for uranium mill tailings sites that were inactive prior to 1978, which produced uranium concentrate under federal procurement contracts primarily for nuclear weapons and other defense purposes. Title II of UMTRCA authorized the regulation of uranium mills and tailings sites that were operating on or after the law's enactment, which largely produced uranium concentrate for civilian nuclear power plants. UMTRCA does not provide regulatory authority over uranium mining (the physical removal of uranium ore from the earth), waste material produced from uranium mining, or remediation of inactive uranium mine sites. The Department of Energy (DOE) is the federal agency responsible for implementing the remedial action program and administering long-term federal management of the tailings.", "The site remediation costs have exceeded costs originally envisioned by Congress, the agencies, and the licensees due to an evolving understanding of the complexities and risks posed by unintended releases of contaminants from uranium mill tailings. As part of the remediation action, the uranium mill tailings are enclosed in engineered repositories, located at disposal sites, which are designed to prevent unintended release of potentially hazardous constituents for hundreds of years. DOE's authority to perform surface remediation at Title I sites expired on September 30, 1998. Groundwater contamination has compounded the technical complexity and timeline of remedial actions at certain sites. Congress amended UMTRCA in 1988 to authorize DOE to perform groundwater remediation without expiration under the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Amendments Act (UMTRA).", "UMTRCA requires the transfer of both Title I and Title II disposal sites to long-term federal management. As of FY2019, the Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management (DOE-LM) administers long-term federal management at 31 Title I sites, excluding the site at Moab, UT. Title II sites are regulated by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an NRC agreement state and transferred to DOE-LM for long-term federal management when NRC, or the state, determines that applicable standards have been met. As of FY2019, six of 29 Title II sites have transferred to DOE-LM, and 23 Title II sites remain privately owned under an NRC or an agreement state license. DOE-LM expects to take long-term management responsibilities of the 23 remaining Title II sites by 2048.", "Under UMTRCA, Congress established that the federal government pay for long-term monitoring and maintenance costs at Title I sites, subject to annual appropriations to DOE-LM. For Title II sites, Congress intended that the licensee would pay for any long-term management costs with a one-time long-term surveillance charge (LTSC). In the event that the LTSCs are not sufficient to cover annual monitoring and maintenance costs, DOE-LM would be responsible to carry out long-term management responsibilities, subject to availability of annual appropriations.", "The long-term management efforts to stabilize tailings and monitor groundwater have proven more challenging, and expensive, than originally expected. The federal government will be responsible for long-term management of all UMTRCA sites once transferred to DOE-LM. Potential oversight issues for Congress may include understanding the decommissioning and transfer status of the remaining Title II sites, the adequacy of funding to complete decommissioning at certain sites if the licensee is unable to fulfill its obligations, and the adequacy of LTSCs to meet future management needs."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA, P.L. 95-604 ) in the wake of environmental and public health concerns about exposures to radiological and non-radiological waste material originating from Cold War\u00e2\u0080\u0093era uranium mill tailing sites.

Milling is common to a number of mineral extraction industries and refers to the physical and chemical processes necessary to concentrate minerals from mined ore. Uranium milling operations use a series of physical (crushing and grinding the mined ore) and chemical processes (acid or alkaline solutions, ion exchange) to concentrate the mineralized uranium ore into yellowcake uranium. Heap leaching, a specific type of uranium milling operation, involves sprinkling sulfuric acid or another solvent directly over the ore in large earthen collection pits. The acidic stream trickles through the ore and dissolves uranium and that stream is collected and processed. Yellowcake uranium produced from the milling process is subsequently converted and enriched for civilian nuclear power production ( Figure 1 ). ", "Tailings are the waste material produced from milling operations. The milling process produces tailings initially as a slurry material, which is disposed of in a settling pond. The slurry tailings material dries, resulting in a sand-like material. Milling operations produce a large quantity of tailings relative to the amount of uranium concentrate produced. NRC estimated that 2.4 pounds of yellowcake uranium oxide is produced from 2,000 pounds of uranium ore.", "Public health and environmental concerns from uranium milling has been associated with various aspects of historical operations and tailings disposal. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified four health exposure routes from uranium mill tailings: ", "1. Increased risk of lung cancer from the diffusion of radon gas indoors if tailings material is used for construction material, 2. Inhalation of radon gas or ingestion of small particles directly emitted from the mill piles into the atmosphere, 3. Exposure to gamma radiation produced by radioactive decay products within the tailings, and 4. Wind and water erosion and mobilization of radioactive and other constituents into surface and groundwater.

The majority of domestic uranium concentrate production prior to 1971 primarily supported the development of nuclear weapons and naval reactors. From 1947 to 1971, annual domestic uranium concentrate production ranged from 20 million pounds to 35 million pounds ( Figure 2 ). ", "After 1971, uranium mill operators produced uranium concentrate primarily for the production of civilian nuclear power. The 1970s were a period of growth for the U.S. nuclear power industry, as 59 nuclear reactors were first connected to the electricity grid between 1970 and 1979. NRC estimated in 1978 that over 109 uranium mills would be required by the year 2000 to support the fuel requirements of the growing reactor fleet. However, domestic uranium concentrate production in the United States decreased by roughly 92% from 1978 to 1993 ( Figure 2 ). By 2000, one active U.S. uranium mill, two partially active U.S. uranium mills, and three in-situ recovery (ISR) facilities combined to produce 4 million pounds of uranium concentrate. ", "Continued growth by the domestic civilian nuclear power industry did not materialize as anticipated in 1978. Numerous factors led to decrease of domestic uranium production. In particular, U.S. nuclear power growth was far less than envisioned by Congress and federal agencies in 1978, as U.S. nuclear plant orders virtually halted after that year and dozens of previous orders were canceled. While the number of operational uranium mills was less than originally envisioned, potential risks from the uranium mills that did operate continue to present technical and regulatory challenges. The awareness of the technical and economic challenges posed during the decommissioning and long-term management of uranium mill tailings have increased since 1978. As of the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. uranium concentrate facilities consisted of one uranium mill and six ISR facilities in operation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978", "paragraphs": ["The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA; P.L. 95-604 ) includes three titles: ", "Title I authorized the remediation of uranium mill tailings inactive prior to the law's enactment in 1978.

After the federal procurement contracts ended in the early 1970s, operations at some uranium mills ceased and licenses were terminated with few environmental remediation requirements. ", "Prior to 1978, federal agencies lacked legal authority to regulate uranium mill tailings. In 1966, federal agencies issued a \"Joint Federal Agency Position Regarding Control of Uranium Mill Tailings\" urging planning management and stabilization of the mill tailings as the responsibility of the individual owners. Yet without a legally binding regulatory program, DOE subsequently noted that actions resulting from the Joint Position were \"far from satisfactory.\"", "Multiple communities used uranium mill tailings as construction material for civilian building projects. The characteristically \"sandy\" uranium tailings were attractive to construct roads, sewers, farmlands, foundations in office buildings, schools, homes, and other structures. These sites became known as vicinity properties . In one instance, DOE reported that a uranium mill operator left a front-end loader on site for members of the public to take as much uranium tailings material as they could handle. NRC stated that 270,000 metric tons of uranium tailings at Grand Junction were used for building materials.", "In 1972, growing concerns about environmental and public health risks from uranium mill tailings used as construction material led to Congress appropriating funds for remedial action of contaminated sites near Grand Junction, CO.

Residual radioactive material was enclosed in engineered repositories consisting of multiple layers of relatively non-permeable materials and capped with rip-rap. These layers are intended to prevent the release of radon gas, limit downward infiltration and water seepage through the tailings piles, and minimize the erosion of repository by natural wind and water. The repository is designed to stabilize residual radioactive material for at least 200 years and up to 1,000 years.", "A disposal site identifies the location where the engineered tailings repository is sited, which is either at the original processing site or an alternative location.
