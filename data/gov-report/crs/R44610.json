Because the TPP includes Vietnam, a major apparel producer that now mainly sources yarns and fabrics from China and other Asian nations, the agreement could shift global trading patterns for textiles and demand for U.S. textile exports. Canada and Mexico, both significant regional textile markets for the United States, and Japan, a major manufacturer of high-end textiles and industrial fabrics, are also TPP members.", "U.S. textile manufacturers produce yarn, thread, and fabric for apparel, home furnishings, and various industrial applications. In 2015, the U.S. textile industry generated some $55 billion in shipments and directly employed about 232,000 Americans, accounting for approximately 2% of all U.S. factory jobs. More than a third of U.S. textile production is exported, with the bulk of the exports going to Western Hemisphere nations that are members of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). These free-trade agreements provide that certain exports from member countries may enter the U.S. market duty-free only if they are made from textiles produced in the region. This has encouraged manufacturers in Mexico and Central America to use U.S.-made yarns and fabrics in apparel, home furnishings, and other products. Exports to the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR countries contributed to a U.S. trade surplus of $1.6 billion in yarns and fabrics in 2015.", "The proposed TPP would eliminate some tariffs on textiles and apparel immediately, and phase out others over a decade or more. The agreement has the potential to affect U.S. textile exporters in at least three ways:", "It could enable some Asian apparel producers, principally Vietnam, to export clothing to the United States duty-free. This would eliminate much of the advantage now enjoyed by Western Hemisphere apparel producers in the U.S. market, and, because Vietnamese manufacturers make little use of U.S.-made textiles, could reduce demand for U.S. textile exports. The TPP would allow Western Hemisphere apparel manufacturers to use yarn and fabric made anywhere in the TPP region and still enjoy preferential access to the U.S. market. Thus, an enlarged Vietnamese textile industry could, at some future time, compete with U.S. exporters in Mexico and Central America. The U.S. manufacturers of industrial textiles may experience more direct competition from Japan, also a leading producer of industrial textiles. On the upside, U.S. exports of these products could increase because the agreement would eliminate tariffs on industrial fabrics that are currently as high as 20% in some TPP countries.", "Responding to concerns from domestic textile manufacturers, the proposed TPP agreement includes a \"yarn-forward\" rule of origin that would allow a garment to enter the United States duty-free only if yarn production, fabric production, and cutting and sewing of the finished garment all occur within the TPP region. However, nearly 190 fibers, yarns, and fabrics in short supply in TPP-member countries could be sourced from outside the region, including China.

Provisions concerning textile trade were a major point of contention during the TPP negotiations, attracting considerable congressional attention and debate. This report examines the potential implications of the proposed TPP agreement for U.S. textile manufacturing.", "The TPP marks the first FTA for the United States since the complete end of quotas on textile and apparel trade in 2005. Duty-free access to the U.S. market under TPP could be of considerable benefit to Asian manufacturers, which now face U.S. import duties on textiles and apparel of up to 32%.

About 40% of domestic textile output went into home textiles and floor coverings, while half was used in technical textiles such as conveyor belts and automotive floor coverings.", "Textile manufacturing occurs largely in highly automated factories. Apparel manufacturing, which is far more labor-intensive, is characterized by decentralized, globally dispersed production networks coordinated by lead firms that control design, branding, and other activities. Many of the world's largest apparel retailing and marketing firms are headquartered in the United States, but the United States imports far more clothing than it makes domestically. Today, more than 60% of clothing and other textile products purchased by U.S. consumers is produced outside the United States. U.S. apparel value added totaled about $11 billion in 2015, when apparel manufacturers directly employed about 135,200 workers (see Appendix A ).", "Unlike textile manufacturers, most U.S.-headquartered apparel firms have limited or no U.S. manufacturing capabilities. Some manufacture through a combination of facilities they own and third-party arrangements, often with foreign factories. Others rely entirely on arrangements with third-party suppliers, mostly in Asia. Large retailers frequently contract directly with apparel sourcing companies, which in turn portion out the production work to independent manufacturers. The United States was responsible for 1.3% of the $483 billion of global apparel exports in 2014, according to statistics from the World Trade Organization (WTO). China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Mexico were the top five apparel suppliers to the United States in 2015. Beyond manufacturing, countless other functions related to apparel are performed domestically, such as design, branding, and marketing of finished products.", "The U.S. home furnishings industry has fared far better against import competition than the apparel industry, mainly because manufacturing of carpets, curtains, and tablecloths is highly automated. For example, the development of larger, faster carpet-tufting machines contributed to a decline in employment at U.S. carpet and rug mills, from 49,200 workers in 2005 to 31,300 in 2015. The health of the carpet and rug mills industry is tied in large part to conditions in domestic housing and commercial building construction, raw material prices, and competition from foreign producers.", "The output of technical textile mills is used across various industrial sectors. According to one estimate, automotive manufacturers in the United States used about 330 million square yards of fabric in 2015 for headliners, fabric seats, airbags, seat belts, door panels, engine filters, and trunk liners.

After the raw fibers are shipped from the farm or the chemical plant, they pass through four main stages of processing (see Figure 1 ): ", "yarn production, in which fiber is spun into filament or yarn; fabric production, in which filaments and yarns are made into textile fabrics, primarily by weaving or knitting; finishing, which prepares the textiles for further use by processes such as bleaching, printing, dyeing, and mechanical or wet finishing; and fabrication, where the finished cloth is converted into apparel, household textiles, or industrial products.", "Worldwide, in 2015, the textile industry produced 94.9 million metric tons of textiles. Man-made fibers accounted for more than two-thirds of total production, up from about half in the 1990s. Most of the global growth in man-made textile manufacturing has taken place in China, which by 2015 accounted for about two-thirds of total production. The United States was responsible for about 4% of global production of man-made fibers in 2015. No other country produced more than 4% of the world's man-made fibers in 2015. Other important producers are India, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea, Turkey, and Japan. ", "Cotton is the most important natural fiber. In the 2015-2016 marketing year, India ranked as the world's largest producer of cotton, at nearly 5.8 million metric tons, followed by China and the United States. Pakistan, Brazil, Uzbekistan, and Turkey are also large cotton producers. Many of the leading cotton producers are also leading mill users of raw cotton. The top four consumers of cotton are China, India, Pakistan, and Turkey, which together account for more than two-thirds of world consumption. Mexico and the Central American and Caribbean countries are the leading customers for U.S. cotton. Consumption of cotton by U.S. textile mills peaked in 1997. Since then, U.S. mill use of cotton has dropped about 70% due to the decrease in domestic textile production caused by competition from imported textile and apparel products. ", "As for other natural fibers, two TPP negotiating partners, Australia and New Zealand, are among the world's leading wool-growing nations. Vietnam is a top-10 producer of silk, but accounts for only a small share of global production, well behind China and India.

The value of shipments totaled about $55 billion in 2015, down 1% from a year earlier. This amounted to 1.2% of total U.S. manufacturing shipments (see Appendix A ). ", "According to U.S. government data, there were 2,242 fewer establishments manufacturing textiles in 2014 than in 2004. Domestic manufacturers have invested heavily in technology to reduce operating costs. For example, modern industrial looms incorporate air-jets to weave at speeds of 2,000 picks per minute (compared with 200 picks in 1980, which at the time was considered fast). Some modern textile mills have become almost completely automated, churning out thousands of square yards every hour with as few as 10 or 20 employees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. textile industry invested $14.2 billion in plants and equipment between 2005 and 2014. ", "Because yarn and fabric production are capital- and scale-intensive, they demand higher worker skills than apparel production. As a consequence, the textile industry has been less prone to relocation to lower-wage countries than apparel manufacturing. Significant production remains in the United States, Japan, and South Korea, where skilled labor is available and manufacturers can raise the capital to finance weaving mills costing an estimated $12 million to $25 million and spinning mills costing $50 million to $70 million. ", "Among all U.S. manufacturing industries, textiles rank near the top in productivity increases. This can be attributed both to automation and to the closure of less efficient mills. While imports of textiles and apparel undoubtedly have contributed to lower industry employment, over the past decade more than 200,000 textile manufacturing jobs have been lost due to automation, according to private estimates.", "The yearly declines in textile industry employment began to level off around 2009, and the most recent year has shown a modest rebound. At the end of 2015, the domestic textile industry employed about 232,000 workers, accounting for about 2% of the 12.3 million domestic factory jobs (see Appendix A ). Average annual pay was approximately $41,500 in 2015, far below the average of $64,300 for all manufacturing. Figure 2 shows employment has declined by two-thirds since 1990. Over time, employment has fallen most rapidly during economic downturns, but has failed to return to prerecession levels during the ensuing recoveries. In 2015, textile manufacturers added more than 1,100 jobs over the previous year, the first significant employment gain in 20 years. Sustained industry employment growth will likely be hindered by factors such as automation, consolidation, and import competition. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the overall employee count in textile manufacturing to shrink to around 174,000 by 2024.", "Domestic textile production is primarily located in the southeastern states and in California, although every state has some textile manufacturing. In 2015, more than one-third of all textile jobs were located in Georgia and North Carolina. Appendix B compares textile employment in the top 10 states, which accounted for more than two-thirds of all textile jobs, in 2005 and 2015.", "In apparel manufacturing, employment has shrunk every year for more than two decades, as clothing manufacturers have transferred much of their production abroad, resulting in 820,000 fewer U.S. apparel manufacturing jobs in 2015 than in 1990 (see Figure 2 ).

Quotas on imports from more than 70 countries limited the quantities of textiles (such as cotton yarns and synthetic fabrics) and particular garments (such as T-shirts and sweaters) that could enter the United States and the European Union every year. The quota system made it necessary for buyers of textile and apparel products to source from countries for which quotas for particular products were available. This spread manufacturing to an ever-increasing number of countries, instead of concentrating it where production was cheapest.", "The expiry of the ATC on January 1, 2005, eliminated all textile and apparel quotas for members of the WTO, but did not eliminate import tariffs.

The major products sourced within the Western Hemisphere region are basic, low-value knitwear garments such as shirts, pants, underwear, and nightwear, with a focus on men's and boys' wear. U.S. imports of industrial fabrics from the CAFTA-DR region are relatively minimal, at $2.5 million in 2015.", "Apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere have two main comparative advantages in serving the U.S. market. One is geographic proximity, which confers lower transportation costs and faster delivery; transit times from the CAFTA-DR region to a U.S. port range from two to seven days, rather than about two weeks to a month from Asia. The other advantage is duty-free access for apparel manufactured from U.S. textiles.

If the proposed TPP agreement is implemented, it has the potential to change this situation. The Central American-Dominican Republic Apparel and Textile Council estimates the CAFTA-DR region could see a contraction of 15%-18% in industrial employment resulting from lost production orders in the first year after the TPP agreement is implemented. If apparel produced in Asian TPP countries gains duty-free access to the U.S. market, it could displace apparel manufactured with U.S. fabric in the Western Hemisphere, adversely affecting U.S. textile exports. Also, should Vietnam develop a larger textile industry, U.S. textile exports could be hurt, as the proposed TPP allows apparel producers in countries such as Mexico and Peru to use textiles made in any TPP member country and still enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market.

Natural fibers such as wool or cotton must be grown in the territory. Man-made fibers must be extruded in the trading area. Yarn Forward . Fibers may be produced in any country, but each component starting with the yarn used to make the textiles or apparel must be formed within the free-trade area. This rule is sometimes called \"triple transformation,\" as it requires that spinning of the yarn or thread, weaving or knitting of the fabric, and assembly of the final product all occur within the region.

According to an analysis by the National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO), the United States will phase out its tariffs over 10 to 12 years on the majority of the textile and apparel products it imported from Vietnam in 2012. The phase-out period is meant to give manufacturers in the CAFTA-DR region and other U.S. FTA partner countries in Latin America sufficient time to adapt before the most sensitive textile and apparel products can be shipped to the United States duty-free. If the proposed agreement is approved by Congress and foreign governments, the TPP will require that textiles and apparel meet a yarn-forward rule to qualify for duty-free treatment.

Several TPP members, including Vietnam, had opposed U.S. demands for a yarn-forward requirement, supporting instead a \"cut-and-sew\" rule that would allow them to enjoy preferential access for apparel that has been cut and sewn from fabric made in China or other countries not included in the TPP. Since U.S. apparel companies and retailers purchase the bulk of their garments from Asian countries outside the TPP, they favored the immediate elimination of tariffs upon implementation of the TPP agreement and more liberal rules of origin for textiles and apparel. Despite the inclusion of the yarn-forward rule, the leading apparel and retail industry trade groups, including the American Apparel and Footwear Association and the National Retail Federation (NRF), announced their support of the TPP agreement in February 2016.

For instance, the TPP provides an exception for products that are considered to be in short supply, or \"not commercially available,\" in the region. With a handful of exceptions, the 187 items on the short supply list could be sourced permanently from non-TPP countries like China. Five years after the date of the entry into force of the TPP, eight products would be removed from the short supply list.

The provision exempts some U.S. apparel imports from Vietnam from the TPP yarn-forward rule, provided Vietnam imports a specific quantity of U.S. fabrics. This would allow a limited amount of apparel cut, sewn, and assembled in Vietnam to enter the United States duty-free even if the garments include fabric from China and other non-TPP countries.", "Like most FTAs, the proposed TPP includes a textile and apparel safeguard that will allow the United States, or any other TPP member, to reimpose tariffs if import surges cause or threaten to cause serious damage to domestic industry. This option will be available only for up to five years after the agreement enters into force, and each safeguard action may last only for two years with a possible two-year extension. In addition, the United States may unilaterally suspend future tariff phaseouts after five years of implementation if it determines that Vietnam has failed to allow independent labor unions and granted them the right to strike by that time.", "Specific customs procedures to enforce each TPP country's commitments are also included in the proposed TPP.

The USITC forecasts that under the TPP, both output and employment in the domestic textile industry will shrink by 0.4% from 2017 to 2032.", "Whatever the actual effects of the TPP on the U.S. economy, it is imaginable that the proposed TPP agreement could result in apparel made in Vietnam displacing apparel from the Western Hemisphere in the U.S. market, weakening the export markets now served by U.S. textile producers in Mexico and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. An alternative scenario is that any TPP member country could over time shift sourcing of textile inputs from the United States to Japan, the one Asian TPP participant that currently has the textile production capacity to supply other TPP producers in this way, or to Vietnam should it develop a robust textile industry, and still enjoy duty-free access to the U.S. market. ", "If the proposed agreement is implemented, those segments of the U.S. textile industry that supply industrial textiles are likely to face greater competition from Japan, the subsector where U.S. manufacturers are most internationally competitive. According to one industry expert, Vietnam and other Asian TPP members are likely to source textiles, including industrial textiles, from Japan rather than the United States. The largest export markets for U.S. industrial fabrics in 2015 were Mexico and Canada; Vietnam accounted for less than 1% of the $2 billion in shipments of technical fabrics from the United States to the world. In 2015, Japan's largest export markets for industrial fabrics were China, Vietnam, and the United States. Although Vietnam has been expanding its reach into certain industrial fabrics, including tire cord and coated fabrics, it seems unlikely to be a significant global competitor in industrial fabrics in the near future.", "Appendix A.
