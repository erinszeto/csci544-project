However, some Members of Congress have expressed concern that financial reforms have been unduly burdensome, reducing the availability and affordability of credit. Congress has delegated authority to the bank regulators and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to address credit loss reserves. FASB promulgates the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which provides the framework for financial reporting by banks and other entities.", "Credit loss reserves help mitigate the overstatement of income on loans and other assets by accounting for future losses. Credit losses are often very low shortly after loan origination, subsequently rising in the early years of the loan, and then tapering to a lower rate of credit loss until maturity. Consequently, a firm's financial statements might not accurately reflect potential credit losses at loan inception. During the seven years leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the loan values held by the U.S. commercial banking system increased by 85%, whereas the credit loss reserves increased by only 21%. The ratio of loss reserves prior to the financial crisis was as low as 1.16% in 2006 and was more than 3.70% near the end of the crisis in early 2010.", "In response to banks' challenges during and after the crisis, in June 2016, FASB promulgated a new credit loss standard\u2014Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL). The new standard is expected to result in greater transparency of expected losses at an earlier date during the life of a loan. Early recognition of expected losses might not only help investors, but might also create a more stable banking system. CECL requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information in determining the expected credit loss, including current and future economic conditions. In addition to loans, CECL also applies to a broad range of other financial products. The expected lifetime losses of loans and certain other financial instruments are to be recognized at the time a loan or financial instrument is recorded. All public companies are required to issue financial statements that incorporate CECL for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Although adherence to CECL is required for all public companies, it is expected to have a more significant effect on the banking industry. The change to credit loss estimates under CECL is considered by some to be the most significant accounting change in the banking industry in 40 years.", "The banking regulators (Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) have issued preliminary guidance on CECL implementation. Banking regulators have also proposed changing the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) to Allowance for Credit Loss (ACL) as a newly defined term. The change to ACL is to reflect the broader range of financial products that will be subject to credit loss estimates under CECL.", "During congressional hearings, banking industry professionals have raised several concerns about CECL. According to one estimate, the transition to CECL will likely result in an increase in loan loss reserves of between $50 billion and $100 billion for banks. As these projections are in aggregate across the banking industry, some banks might need to significantly increase their credit reserves whereas others might need to adjust less.", "To mitigate the effect of CECL, regulators have given banks the option of phasing in the increased credit reserves over three years. In addition, the Federal Reserve has delayed stress tests that incorporate CECL for the largest banking organizations until 2021. Banks are expected to incur additional costs of developing new credit loss models and costs of implementation. Banks may need to retain historical information on more financial products to estimate credit losses under CECL. Adopting CECL may require upgrading existing hardware and software or paying higher fees to third-party vendors for such services. Participants in recent congressional hearings have raised concerns about CECL implementation issues. The difference in how credit loss estimates are calculated based on CECL and international accounting standards could potentially disadvantage U.S. banks, but CECL is considered less complex to implement.", "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises, are also to be subject to CECL credit loss estimates as they are subject to private-sector GAAP requirements even though they are currently in conservatorship under the Federal Housing Financing Agency."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Introduction", "paragraphs": ["Some observers asserted that leading up to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 banks did not have sufficient credit loss reserves or capital to absorb the losses and as a consequence supported additional government intervention to stabilize the financ ial system.

Consequently, a firm's financial statements might not accurately reflect the potential credit losses at loan inception.

Under the incurred loss method, (1) a bank must have a reason to believe that a loss is probable and (2) the bank must be able to reasonably estimate the loss. Any credit loss reserves set aside to absorb loan losses are, generally, estimated based on historical information and current economic events. The loss incurred on a loan cannot be recognized until the loss on a loan is probable, and the amount is estimable.", "In June 2016, FASB replaced the incurred loss methodology with the more forward-looking CECL methodology to provide more useful information on financial statements.

Upon initial adoption of CECL, the earlier recognition of losses might cause a onetime reduction in earnings. CECL will likely affect banks in various ways depending on how they currently model the allowance for loan and lease losses and other offset accounts. Each bank may apply different estimation methods to different pools of financial assets, but only one estimation method needs to be applied to each pool of financial assets. Although the regulators provide guidance on how CECL is to be implemented, they do not provide specific forecasts or models.

Curry, stated the current credit loss model (incurred loss model) used to make loss provisions for assets forces firms to make large loss provisions in the midst of a credit downturn when the earnings and lending capacity are already stressed. He also noted the current accounting standards preclude banks from recording the anticipated losses until incurred. A FASB board member also raised similar concerns stating that the loans in the U.S. commercial banking system increased by 85% in the seven years leading up to the financial crisis whereas the reserves to cover the losses increased by 21%.", "Since FASB's announcement of CECL, banking industry professionals have raised concerns about implementing CECL, including during congressional testimonies. One such congressional witness testified that CECL creates a \"redundant regulatory environment,\" especially when risk-based capital requirements were designed to address similar concerns. Risk-based capital establishes minimum regulatory capital based on a bank's activity. Another witness stated that implementing CECL would be costly, and it will make credit loss calculations more complicated and potentially reduce the amount of credit available to borrowers. Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Melvin L. Watt, stated that regulatory changes such as CECL will have an initial and ongoing impact on reported net income. Others have described the change in how credit losses are determined by adopting CECL \"as the biggest bank accounting change in 40 years.\"", "FASB officials acknowledged concerns similar to the ones raised during congressional testimonies. One such acknowledged concern is that to comply with CECL, it \"may require significant effort for many entities to gather the necessary data for estimating expected credit losses.\" FASB also acknowledged concerns surrounding limited credit availability, especially to less creditworthy borrowers or during an economically stressed environment. In response to these various concerns, FASB stated that CECL does not make a change to the economics of lending, but rather to the timing of when the losses are recorded. Despite FASB's acknowledgments, changing the timing of when losses are recorded does require developing new credit loss models to address the new standard and can lead to increased costs for banks and affect capital requirements. Under CECL, banks are required to take into consideration many unknowns that, in the case of some residential mortgages, may extend 30 years. "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effects on Banks", "paragraphs": ["A CECL model is supposed to take into consideration future economic conditions in determining potential losses on financial assets. For example, for a 30-year loan originated in 1988 it would be difficult to predict the appropriate amount to reserve for potential credit loss, as well as the timing and duration of each of the three recessions identified by the shaded bars in Figure 1 . Increases in the delinquency rate also varied during each of the three recessions. Similarly, the post-recession economic recovery would have been difficult to predict. ", " Figure 1 illustrates the delinquency rates on all loans made by commercial banks in the United States from January 1988 to December 2017. The incurred loss methodology did not consider the substantial decreases in delinquency rates from more than 6% in early 1991 to less than 3% in early 1994 and the increase again in delinquency rates of more than 7% in late 2009 and subsequent decline. Although 30-year projections of credit losses might not be precise, banks can adjust the credit loss models periodically to capture credit deteriorations and recovery. Adjustments to credit losses that consider long-term and short-term trends might prevent banks from increasing credit loss reserves during economic downturns or limiting credit availability to borrowers. ", "One the one hand, because CECL incorporates forward-looking information, it is possible that during economic downturns, banks might limit credit availability, especially if they have forecast a prolonged downturn and thus must maintain sufficient capital levels. Although the profit or repayment of principal on a loan is recognized over the life of a loan, CECL requires recognition of the possible loss on a loan at its inception, which could result in lower earnings than under incurred loss methodology (ALLL) at loan inception because it could lead to some lenders to increase their reserves. An increase in reserves is an expense that reduces the profitability of the bank. Reduced profitability for banks or limited credit availability could negatively affect businesses and consumers alike. On the other hand, setting aside sufficient credit loss reserves may enhance a bank's ability to absorb future loan losses and thus continue to lend at a higher rate than if it had not done so. If CECL better matches actual credit losses, then banks might be less likely to become distressed and ultimately fail. ", "As a consequence of CECL's changes, the banking regulators are proposing to replace ALLL with a newly defined term in the capital rules\u2014allowance for credit losses (ACL). If the proposed rules are adopted, ACL would be eligible for inclusion in a bank's tier 2 capital; subject to the current limits that include ALLL in tier 2 capital. Banks are required to maintain a certain level of capital (identified as tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3) based on the riskiness of the assets a bank holds. ", "ALLL includes asset valuation allowances that have been established through a charge against earnings to cover estimated credit losses on loans or other extensions of credit. Credit loss allowances under CECL cover a broader range of financial assets than ALLL. However, not every loss in the value of an asset would be included in the definition of ACL.

Regulators are encouraging banks to capture and maintain relevant historical data to model CECL, but they are not requiring banks to obtain or reconstruct data from previous periods at unreasonable costs. The additional data retention requirements may increase ongoing operating expenses for banks. It is, generally, not cost effective for smaller banks to periodically purchase hardware and software to stay current with emerging technology and changing regulatory requirements. Instead, to lower costs, smaller banks typically use a third-party vendor that provides service to multiple banks for a monthly or annual fee. To facilitate the data retention requirements, banks and third-party service providers might incur a onetime upgrade costs to purchase additional hardware and software.

Migrating to a new system could result in possible loss of some historical data due to system incompatibilities.

To facilitate the additional data retention requirements, third-party vendors might also need to upgrade their systems.", "If smaller banks migrate from their own internal models to a vendor-based CECL model, similar CECL models across multiple banks could potentially either overestimate or underestimate the amount of credit loss reserves in aggregate, which could create systemic risks among smaller banks.

An increase in credit loss reserves is an expense that reduces a bank's profitability. If a bank does not earn sufficient income to offset the increased credit loss reserves, then retained earnings will be declined. Retained earnings are part of bank's required Tier 1 capital. The primary function of bank capital is to act as a cushion to absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values that could otherwise cause a bank to fail. If retained earnings are affected, then banks might need to reduce their planned capital distributions if the decline caused their capital levels to be too close to the minimum requirements. Furthermore, because CECL is principles-based, neither FASB nor the financial regulators have prescribed a specific credit loss model; therefore, the effect on each bank will vary. ", "According to one estimate, the transition to CECL will likely result in an upfront increase in ACL of between $50 billion and $100 billion. The increased reserves are expected to affect common equity ratios across the banking system by 25-50 basis points (.25%-.50%). The expected cost for loss reserves over the life of loans is not expected to change. As these projected adjustments are in aggregate across the banking industry, some banks might need to increase their reserves significantly more than the projected 25-50 basis points whereas others might need to adjust less. Some banks have begun to disclose the preliminary impact of implementing CECL. In one instance, the bank indicated it would need to increase its credit reserves by 10% to 20% based on 2017 preliminary analysis. ", "Because CECL requires banks to consider current and future expected economic conditions to estimate credit losses, some banking organizations have expressed concerns about the difficulty in planning CECL's adoption due to uncertainty about the future economic conditions when CECL is adopted. Unexpected economic conditions could result in a higher than anticipated increase in credit loss recognition. In response to this uncertainty, the banking regulators are proposing to allow banks the option to phase in over a three-year period any adverse effects the adjustments would have on regulatory capital requirements. Banks that elect to phase in the regulatory capital requirements over three years would be required to disclose their three-year election. A bank cannot retrospectively elect the three-year phase-in option.", "The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the regulators to consider the impact of proposed rules on small commercial banks and savings institutions with total assets of $550 million or less and trust companies with total revenues of $38.5 million or less.

The Federal Reserve requires banks to have sufficient capital to withstand a severe adverse operating environment. Even under such conditions, banks are expected to continue lending, maintain normal operations and ready access to funding, and meet obligations to creditors and counterparties. ", "For the 2018 and 2019 stress test cycles, the regulators propose that banking organizations continue to use ALLL as calculated under the incurred loss methodology. Using ALLL instead of ACL is expected to promote the comparability of stress tests results across banks even if banks adopt CECL in 2019. In 2021, not only will all banking organizations be required to adopt CECL, but also stress tests are to use ACL. Banks that adopt CECL before the 2021 reporting period will be required to calculate credit losses based on the incurred loss methodology and CECL, potentially increasing these banks' operational costs in the short run.

Some selected ones are discussed below ", "Both the CECL model and IFRS 9 are expected credit loss models. CECL requires that the full amount of the expected credit losses be recorded for all financial assets at amortized cost. IFRS 9 requires recognition of credit losses for a 12-month period. If there is a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime expected credit losses are recognized. The amount of expected credit losses for assets with significantly increased credit risk might be similar under CECL and IFRS 9, because they both require credit losses over the life of the loan. FASB considers the time value of money to be implicit in CECL methodologies, whereas IFRS 9 requires explicit consideration of the time value of money. When similar characteristics exist among assets, CECL model requires the collective evaluation of credit losses.
