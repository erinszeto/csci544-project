The name qui tam is the shortened version of an oft abbreviated Latin phrase which roughly translates to \"he who prosecutes for himself as well as for the King.\" Qui tam comes to us from before the dawn of the common law. Reviled at various times throughout the ages as a breeding ground for \"viperous vermin\" and parasites, legislative bodies have authorized it when they consider the enforcement of some law beyond the unaided capacity or interest of authorized law enforcement officials. Best known of the contemporary members of the line is the federal False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3729-3733).

The test for whether attorneys' fees and expenses are appropriate is said to be analogous to that used for prevailing defendants under 42 U.S.C. 1988.

The 2009 Act added a new subsection to Section 3731 to afford the government the advantage of the date of the relator's complaint as a cut-off date for statute of limitations purposes.

The circuits are divided over the question of whether the Secretary of the Interior may by regulation set the penalty at $1 per head for each day of violation.
