The VA provides these benefits through three major operating units: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA).", "This report focuses on the VHA. The VHA is primarily a direct service provider of primary care, specialized care, and related medical and social support services to veterans through the nation's largest integrated health care system. Veterans generally must enroll in the VA health care system to receive medical care. Eligibility for enrollment is based primarily on previous military service, disability, and income. VA provides free inpatient and outpatient medical care to veterans for service-connected conditions and to low-income veterans for nonservice-connected conditions.", "The Obama Administration released its FY2011 budget on February 1, 2010. The President requested an overall funding amount of $48.8 billion for VHA for FY2011, an increase of $3.7 billion over the enacted amount in FY2010. Furthermore, as required by the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-81), the Administration requested $50.6 billion in advance appropriations for FY2012 for the three medical care accounts: medical services, medical support and compliance, and medical facilities.", "On July 15, 2010, the Senate Committee on Appropriations marked up its version of the MILCON-VA Appropriations bill for FY2011 (S. 3615; S.Rept. 111-226).

This amount includes $48.1 billion authorized in FY2010, an additional $120 million for the medical services and medical facilities accounts, and $590 million for the medical and prosthetic research account. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended amount was thus $120 million more than the President's request for VHA for FY2011.

On October 25, 1988, President Reagan signed legislation ( P.L. 100-527 ) creating a new federal Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs to replace the Veterans Administration effective March 15, 1989. ", "The VA provides a range of benefits and services to veterans who meet certain eligibility rules including hospital and medical care, disability compensation and pensions, education, vocational rehabilitation and employment services, assistance to homeless veterans, home loan guarantees, administration of life insurance as well as traumatic injury protection insurance for servicemembers, and death benefits that cover burial expenses. ", "The department carries out its programs nationwide through three administrations and the Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA). The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is responsible for health care services and medical and prosthetic research programs. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is responsible for, among other things, providing compensations, pensions, and education assistance. The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is responsible for maintaining national veterans cemeteries; providing grants to states for establishing, expanding, or improving state veterans cemeteries; and providing headstones and markers for the graves of eligible persons, among other things. ", "The VA has also announced that it has begun the process of transforming itself \"into a 21 st -century organization.\" The department has established six high priority performance goals to support this transformation: (1) reducing the disability claims backlog; (2) eliminating veteran homelessness; (3) automating the GI Bill benefit system; (4) establishing a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER ); (5) improving mental health care; and (6) deploying a Veterans Relationship Management System.", "The VA's budget includes both mandatory and discretionary spending accounts. Mandatory funding supports disability compensation, pension benefits, education, vocational rehabilitation, and life insurance, among other benefits and services. Discretionary funding supports a broad array of benefits and services including medical care. Figure 1 provides a breakdown of FY2010 budget allocations for both mandatory and discretionary programs. In FY2010 the total VA budget authority was approximately $110 billion; discretionary budget authority accounted for about 48.3% ($53.0 billion) of the total, with about 85% of this discretionary funding going toward supporting VA health care programs including medical research. For details on VHA appropriations from FY2005 through FY2010, see Appendix E . "], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Veterans Health Care System", "paragraphs": ["The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system. While Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are also publicly funded programs, most health care services under these programs are delivered by private providers in private facilities. In contrast, the VA health care system could be categorized as a veteran-specific national health care system, in the sense that the federal government owns the medical facilities and employs the health care providers. The VA's health care system is organized into 21 geographically defined Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) (see Figure 2 ). Although policies and guidelines are developed at VA headquarters to be applied throughout the VA health care system, management authority for basic decision making and budgetary responsibilities are delegated to the VISNs. As of FY2010, VHA operates 153 hospitals (medical centers), 135 nursing homes, 783 community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs), 6 independent outpatient clinics, and 299 Readjustment Counseling Centers (Vet Centers). In 2009, VA began a pilot Mobile Vet Center (MVC) program to improve access to services for veterans in rural areas, and the department has deployed 50 MVCs. VHA also operates 10 mobile outpatient clinics. ", "Congressionally appropriated medical care funds are allocated to the VISNs based on the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) system, which generally bases funding on patient workload. VISNs, in turn, allocate funds to the medical centers within their networks. Prior to the implementation of the VERA system, resources were allocated to facilities based primarily on their historical expenditures. While a thorough description of VERA is beyond the scope of this report, generally VERA has two types of funds known as General Purpose funds and Specific Purpose funds. ", "General Purpose funds encompass about 80% of VHA total budget allocations to the VISNs. The department generally allocates 94% of the congressional appropriation to the 21 VISNs within the first 45 days after enactment of the appropriation bill, with another 3% distributed within 90 days of enactment, and the remainder going to the VISNs over the remaining months of the fiscal year. General Purpose funds are comprised of 11 elements. These elements include basic care; complex care; adjustments for long stay patients; adjustments for high cost patients; geographic price adjustments; research support; education support; equipment; non-recurring maintenance; Priority Group 8 expansion; and mental health initiatives. Prior to FY2010, mental health initiatives were funded through the Specific Purpose fund. Beginning with FY2010 budget funding previously associated with the mental health initiatives, and funded through the Specific Purpose fund, has been incorporated into the overall mental health funding amount, and is now funded through the General Purpose fund. Table 2 provides VERA General Purpose fund allocations for the 21 networks in FY2010. It should be noted that VERA funding is not driven by veteran patient population alone, but is adjusted for differences in patient mix, high cost patients, and geographic costs, among other factors. Under VERA each network is provided an allocation that takes into account these unique characteristics and is also adjusted to account for those veterans who receive care in more than one network. ", "The Specific Purpose funds are given to the 21 VISNs during the fiscal year for specific activities including funding for prosthetics, state veterans nursing home per diems, clinical trainee salaries, readjustment counseling, homeless grant and per diem program, preventive and primary care transformation initiatives, and other specific purpose allocations to the program offices such as the foreign medical program which reimburses certain medical expenses of those veterans traveling abroad. ", "The VHA pays for care provided to veterans by private-sector providers on a fee basis under certain circumstances. This program pays non-VA health care providers to treat eligible veterans when medical services are not available at VA medical facilities or in emergencies when delays are hazardous to life or health. Fee basis care includes inpatient, outpatient, prescription medication, and long-term care services. Inpatient and outpatient care are also provided in the private sector to eligible dependents of veterans under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). The VHA also provides grants for construction of state-owned nursing homes and domiciliary facilities and collaborates with the Department of Defense (DOD) in sharing health care resources and services.", "Apart from providing direct patient care to veterans, VHA's other statutory missions are to conduct medical research, to serve as a contingency backup to the Department of Defense (DOD) medical system during a national security emergency, to provide support to the National Disaster Medical System and the Department of Health and Human Services as necessary, and to train health care professionals in order to provide an adequate supply of health personnel for VA and the nation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligibility for Veterans Health Care", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "\"The Promise of Free Health Care\"", "paragraphs": ["To understand the budget for VHA discussed in this report, it is important to understand eligibility for VA health care, the VA's enrollment process, and its enrollment priority groups (discussed later in this report). VA health care is not an entitlement program. Contrary to numerous claims made concerning \"promises\" to military personnel and veterans with regard to \"free health care for life,\" not every veteran is automatically entitled to medical care from the VA. Prior to eligibility reform in 1996, provisions of law governing eligibility for VA care were complex and not uniform across all levels of care. All veterans were technically \"eligible\" for hospital care and nursing home care, but eligibility did not by itself ensure access to care.", "The Veterans' Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, P.L. 104-262 , established two eligibility categories and required the VHA to manage the provision of hospital care and medical services through an enrollment system based on a system of priorities. P.L. 104-262 authorized the VA to provide all needed hospital care and medical services to veterans with service-connected disabilities, former prisoners of war, veterans exposed to toxic substances and environmental hazards such as Agent Orange, veterans whose attributable income and net worth are not greater than an established \"means test,\" and veterans of World War I. These veterans are generally known as \"higher priority\" or \"core\" veterans (see Appendix A , and discussed in more detail below). The other category of veterans are those with no service-connected disabilities and with attributable incomes above an established means test (see Appendix C ).", "P.L. 104-262 also authorized the VA to establish a patient enrollment system to manage access to VA health care. As stated in the report language accompanying P.L. 104-262 , \"the Act would direct the Secretary, in providing for the care of 'core' veterans, to establish and operate a system of annual patient enrollment and require that veterans be enrolled in a manner giving relative degrees of preference in accordance with specified priorities. At the same time, it would vest discretion in the Secretary to determine the manner in which such enrollment system would operate.\"", "Furthermore, P.L. 104-262 was clear in its intent that the provision of health care to veterans was dependent upon the available resources. The committee report accompanying P.L. 104-262 states that the provision of hospital care and medical services would be provided to \"the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations acts for these purposes. Such language is intended to clarify that these services would continue to depend upon discretionary appropriations.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Health Care Enrollment", "paragraphs": ["As stated previously, P.L. 104-262 required the establishment of a national enrollment system to manage the delivery of inpatient and outpatient medical care. The new eligibility standard was created by Congress to \"ensure that medical judgment rather than legal criteria will determine when care will be provided and the level at which care will be furnished.\"", "For most veterans, entry into the veterans' health care system begins by completing the application for enrollment. Some veterans are exempt from the enrollment requirement if they meet special eligibility requirements. A veteran may apply for enrollment by completing the Application for Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) at any time during the year and submitting the form online or in person at any VA medical center or clinic, or mailing or faxing the completed form to the medical center or clinic of the veteran's choosing (see Figure 3 ). Once a veteran is enrolled in the VA health care system, the veteran remains in the system and does not have to reapply for enrollment annually.

", "Generally, persons enlisting in one of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, and officers commissioned after October 16, 1981, must have completed two years of active duty or the full period of their initial service obligation to be eligible for VA health care benefits. Servicemembers discharged at any time because of service-connected disabilities are not held to this requirement. Also, reservists that were called to active duty and who completed the term for which they were called, and who were granted an other than dishonorable discharge, are exempt from the 24 continuous months of active duty requirement. National Guard members who were called to active duty by federal executive order are also exempt from this two-year requirement if they (1) completed the term for which they were called and (2) were granted an other than dishonorable discharge.", "When not activated to full-time federal service, members of the reserve components and National Guard have limited eligibility for VA health care services. Members of the reserve components may be granted service-connection for any injury they incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while attending inactive duty training assemblies, annual training, active duty for training, or while going directly to or returning directly from such duty. In addition, reserve component service members may be granted service-connection for a heart attack or stoke if such an event occurs during these same periods. The granting of service-connection makes them eligible to receive care from the VA for those conditions. National Guard members are not granted service-connection for any injury, heart attack, or stroke that occurs while performing duty ordered by a governor for state emergencies or activities.", "After veterans' status has been established, the VA next places applicants into one of two categories. The first group is composed of veterans with service-connected disabilities or with incomes below an established means test. These veterans are regarded by the VA as \"high priority\" veterans, and they are enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 (see Appendix A ). Veterans enrolled in Priority Groups 1-6 include", "veterans in need of care for a service-connected disability; veterans who have a compensable service-connected condition; veterans whose discharge or release from active military, naval, or air service was for a compensable disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; veterans who are former prisoners of war (POWs); veterans awarded the Purple Heart; veterans who have been determined by VA to be catastrophically disabled; veterans of World War I; veterans who were exposed to hazardous agents (such as Agent Orange in Vietnam) while on active duty; and veterans who have an annual income and net worth below a VA-established means test threshold.", "The VA looks at applicants' income and net worth to determine their specific priority category and whether they have to pay copayments for nonservice-connected care. In addition, veterans are asked to provide the VA with information on any health insurance coverage they have, including coverage through employment or through a spouse. The VA may bill these payers for treatment of conditions that are not a result of injuries or illnesses incurred or aggravated during military service (see discussion on premiums and copayments below).

This law also established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions.

To increase the VA's third-party collections, P.L. 105-33 also gave the VA the authority to change its basis of billing insurers from \"reasonable costs\" to \"reasonable charges.\" This change in billing was intended to enhance VA collections to the extent that reasonable charges result in higher payments than reasonable costs.
