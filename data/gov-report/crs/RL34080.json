A series of incidents have raised public concerns about the safety of these products. In September 2008, U.S. authorities said they broadened their testing of milk-derived products from China, following reports that melamine-contaminated baby formula has sickened tens of thousands of Chinese children. They also announced a recall of some coffee products that may contain melamine.", "Early in 2007, evidence emerged that adulterated pet food ingredients from China had caused the deaths of a large number of dogs and cats.

For imports, FSIS (which regulates the safety of most meat and poultry) relies on a very different regulatory system than FDA (which regulates the safety of all other foods). Although all imported food products must meet the same safety standards as domestically produced foods, international trade rules permit a foreign country to apply its own, differing, regulatory authorities and institutional systems in meeting such standards, under an internationally recognized concept known as \"equivalence.\"", "China officials assert that they have been moving aggressively to improve their food safety system and to close unsafe plants. China in late 2007 concluded a memorandum of agreement with the United States aimed at improving the safety of traded food and feed products. Nonetheless, some Members of Congress continue to express sharp criticism of both China's food safety record and U.S. efforts to insure import safety. In the 110th Congress, committees on both sides of Capitol Hill held hearings on food safety concerns generally and on the China situation. Numerous bills were introduced focusing on imported food safety or containing such provisions, which would apply equally to Chinese imports. These bills include H.R. 2997, S. 1776, H.R. 1148/S. 654, H.R. 2108/S. 1274, H.R. 3100, H.R. 3610, H.R. 3624, H.R. 3937, H.R. 3967, and S. 2418.", "A provision in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-85), passed in September 2007, requires an annual report to Congress with detailed data on FDA-regulated food imports.

Chinese importers remained subject to these conditions in 2008.", "While strongly defending its record, the Chinese government also has announced a variety of steps to improve the safety of its food and drug exports, including revisions in its regulations, new inspections, and the closure of problem plants. It also signed, in late 2007, a memorandum of agreement with the U.S. government pledging expanded cooperation to ensure the safety of many of its food and feed products. The FDA is moving to station some officials in China to provide closer oversight. At the same time, China has blocked the importation of some types of U.S. food products, ostensibly out of food safety concerns.", "These and other developments greatly heightened public and congressional scrutiny not only of China's own food safety regime, but also of the adequacy of U.S. import safeguards. During the 110 th Congress, a number of congressional committees held hearings on, or launched investigations of, food imports from China and elsewhere. Committees reviewed U.S. laws and regulations designed to ensure import safety. Many bills were introduced to clarify and expand federal authorities affecting both imported and domestic foods, and/or to reorganize agency responsibilities.", "This CRS report first provides information on the most recent Chinese-related food safety concern, the use of melamine in dairy ingredients.

Sanlu reportedly obtains its milk from middlemen who collect it from local farmers. Investigators believe that these middlemen deliberately were adding melamine to boost product protein content readings of milk that had been watered down to increase its volume.

Among other questions are whether the agreement might effectively give unfair preferential treatment for Chinese over other foreign imports; whether FDA will have adequate resources for oversight and enforcement; and whether the agency has the appropriate legal authority to share information about U.S. food companies or to demand certificates from foreign importers.", "On June 18, 2008, the United States and China issued a \"Joint Progress Statement\" on implementation of the agreement, noting that the two parties had established mechanisms for cooperation and communication on food safety events; developed \"concrete steps\" toward a system where AQSIQ will electronically certify to FDA that specific China-exported products to the United States meet FDA safety and quality standards; and agreed to train Chinese officials on U.S. regulatory requirements, focusing on inspections and laboratory testing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Bilateral Efforts", "paragraphs": ["FDA's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition (CFSAN) website indicates that it has been aggressively pursuing both formal and informal agreements with foreign government counterparts to achieve mutual recognition of equivalence of regulatory systems.

Roughly a third of these address aspects of shellfish or other seafood safety. FDA's agreements with China apparently do not include any for food, but are in place for lead in tableware.", "The Chinese have approved necessary visas to enable FDA to establish permanent offices in the country, FDA Associate Commissioner for Foods Acheson told a House hearing in September 2008. The agency intends to place about eight or nine staffers plus five Chinese nationals in three locations in China, with the first likely to open in October 2008, he added.

FDA said it issued the notice after targeted sampling during October 2006 through May 2007 \"repeatedly found that farm-raised seafood imported from China were contaminated with antimicrobial agents that are not approved for this use in the United States.\" The agents are nitrofuran, malachite green, and gentian velvet, which have been found to be carcinogenic to laboratory animals; and fluoroquinolones, which when used in food animals may increase antibiotic resistance in humans, the agency said.", "Under such an import alert, FDA detains all covered products until the importing firm demonstrates, through testing by an independent laboratory, that a representative sample of their product is free of these contaminants. Although the FDA has long issued these types of alerts for various imports, they generally are more limited in scope\u2014for example, to a particular firm or product.", "The import alert reiterated that approximately 80% of U.S. seafood consumption is from imports and that over 40% of these imports come from aquaculture operations. Shrimp and catfish are two of the top 10 most frequently consumed seafood products. China is the largest aquaculture producer in the world, with 70% of total production, and the third largest exporter to the United States. The alert observes: \"As the aquaculture industry continues to grow and compete with wild-caught seafood products, concerns regarding the use of unapproved animal drugs and unsafe chemicals and the misuse of animal drugs in aquaculture operations have increased substantially.\""], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Chinese Efforts to Address Food Safety", "paragraphs": ["Chinese government officials appear to have launched a series of major initiatives to bolster their food safety programs, notwithstanding their assertions, throughout 2007 and 2008, that their products are safe. To deal with the most recent crisis regarding tainted dairy products, the Chinese agriculture ministry announced on September 23, 2008, that it would require all milk dealers to register and would conduct regular inspections of milk to ensure there is no more tampering. Earlier, the Chinese said they had fired their top inspection official.", "In 2007, officials announced their intention to update a 1995 consumer food law, and in 2006 the Chinese legislature adopted a national framework for building an agricultural product safety system. The Chinese have said they do require registration of all land and processing facilities used for exported products, and exporters must have facilities that can test for pesticide residues. The government also says it does sample and test products for export to help ensure they meet foreign buyers' standards.", "China also has been encouraging investment, including foreign direct investment, in production and processing to improve technology, marketing and management skills, and transportation and infrastructure.

HACCP is a system of assessing risks, determining the points at which they might occur during production, and instituting measures to prevent them.", "At a May 31, 2007, news conference, a Chinese official also pointed to the death sentence handed down to the former head of the government's food and drug safety agency, as an example of its determination to improve product oversight. The agency head had been convicted of taking bribes for approving potentially dangerous drugs. He reportedly was executed on July 10, 2007.", "In late June 2007, one Chinese government agency reportedly announced the closure of 180 food manufacturers that it said had been using industrial materials such as dyes, mineral oils, hydrochloric acid, paraffin, and formaldehyde in a variety of food products, including flour, candies, seafood, pickles, and biscuits. Another agency reportedly claimed to have closed 152,000 unlicensed food manufacturers and retailers in 2006 for making counterfeit or low-quality products.", "According to U.S. agricultural attache reports, China's AQSIQ announced that it would begin affixing inspection and quarantine labels to all food product packages for export after inspection, effective September 1, 2007. USDA and other China experts observe that China has made its oversight of food exports the highest priority. They note that China has restricted eligibility to a relatively small proportion of its estimated 448,000 food processors.", "Other announcements have included a Chinese State Council regulation intended to intensify controls over food product producers and distributors, where more records would be made public, new higher fines would be levied on food exporters who violate regulations, and a \"blacklist\" would be established for both exporters and domestic importers who distribute unqualified food products. The regulation reportedly notes that local governments are mainly responsible for food safety oversight.", "Other reported actions include the designation of the equivalent of $1.6 billion to improve food and drug supervision by the SFDA, and new rules to tighten oversight of food and drug processors including their acquisition of raw materials. Meanwhile, another agency, the Standardization Administration of China, announced at a July 2007 press conference that it planned to revise by 2010 as many as 4,000 food safety standards, notably for food additives, dairy, meat, eggs, and fisheries. Whether these commitments applied to other Chinese bodies such as AQSIQ was uncertain.", "The same AQSIQ regulation (see above) also was to impose new requirements on importers into China. U.S. exporters already were encountering sanitary barriers to trade first imposed in July 2007 by Chinese officials. At that time, they announced that meat and poultry imports shipped by some U.S. companies were being suspended. These included chicken products that, China asserted, contained Salmonella bacteria (although U.S. interests have long noted that proper cooking destroys the bacteria), and pork products that contained an unapproved feed additive (which appears to be legal in the United States). Shortly after that, poultry exports from seven U.S. states were banned from China due to the presence of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI), a move that the United States asserted was not based on sound science. In early October 2007 China reportedly rejected 47 tons of U.S. frozen sardines that were said to be contaminated with Listeria .", "Some U.S. interests contended that these actions were in retaliation for U.S. complaints about the safety of Chinese goods. Others maintain that the Chinese are seeking to demonstrate to their own consumers that they are protecting them from unsafe products, including imported goods.

For example, Section 1009 in the Food Safety title (X) of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 ( H.R. 3580 ; P.L. 110-85 ), passed in September 2007, requires an annual report to Congress on the number and amount of FDA-regulated food products imported by country and type of food, the number of inspectors and inspections performed, and aggregated data on inspection findings, including violations and enforcement actions. Elsewhere, Division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 ( H.R. 2764 ), provides funding for the balance of the fiscal year for both FDA and FSIS. A provision of this act prohibits FSIS from implementing an FSIS rule that would allow certain poultry products to be imported from China. This proposal to permit some types of processed poultry had been published in the November 23, 2005, Federal Register .", "Approximately a dozen other food safety bills containing one or more provisions that address food import safety were pending in 2008.

Under some of these bills, certification could be denied or revoked if foreign safeguards are found to be insufficient, unsafe imports are discovered, or foodborne illnesses are linked to such products. A number of the bills also propose the collection of user fees from importers to cover the costs of inspecting foreign products at the borders.", "Some bills seek to require more physical inspections and testing by FDA at the border or within other countries, to authorize more research into inspection and testing technologies, or to restrict imports to specific ports. H.R. 3100 is another measure with import safety provisions. S. 2418 would require USDA to provide public notification whenever smuggled food products are identified in commerce, and to provide public notification on all recalled food products, using methods prescribed in the bill. The bill would require private laboratories that conduct tests on FDA-regulated imports to be certified by the agency, under a fee-funded process for certification and audits to be developed by FDA. Laboratories would have to submit to the agency the results of all tests they conducted. (These bills are described in more detail in CRS Report RL34198, U.S. Food and Agricultural Imports: Safeguards and Selected Issues , by [author name scrubbed].)", "In 2008, attention focused on two comprehensive safety bills, one by Senator Durbin ( S. 3385 ) and another a draft proposal being circulated by Representative Dingell. Title III of the Durbin bill is specific to imported foods, with provisions such as a requirement that each importer establish a food safety supplier verification program; authorization to permit importers to qualify for expedited review and entry if they exceed minimum safety standards; and explicit authority for HHS (FDA) to require export certificates for foods determined to be of higher risk, with certificates to be issued in the foreign countries of origin by qualified \"certifying entities.\"", "Title III also would direct FDA to establish a system to accredit qualified third parties that could certify that food facilities are in compliance with U.S. standards. Such parties could include foreign governments, states, and foreign or domestic cooperatives. Other notable provisions in the Durbin bill's import title would authorize HHS to enter into agreements with foreign governments that would enable FDA to inspect foreign facilities and to deny entry of food imports from those facilities that impede such inspections; give FDA additional authority to review foreign food safety systems; and require FDA to develop a comprehensive plan to improve the regulatory capacities of foreign governments.", "Import-specific provisions in the Dingell draft include a requirement for all importers of food, drugs, devices and cosmetics to register with the FDA and to pay an annual fee of $10,000; the establishment of a corps of inspectors dedicated solely to import inspections; more stringent country-of-origin labeling requirements; and limiting, within five years, all imports (of FDA-regulated foods and other products) to ports of entry that are located near a federal food testing laboratory. There are now a total of 13 FDA field laboratories but well over 300 ports of entry.", "Recent developments with food imports also spurred calls for implementation of mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) for fresh meats, produce and peanuts, taking effect as of September 30, 2008. The omnibus 2008 farm bill ( P.L. 110-246 ) maintained this date, but it added more covered commodities including chicken and modified some labeling and record-keeping requirements.
