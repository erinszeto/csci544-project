In past years, FHA was often the innovator in testing new mortgage products, but in recent years the private mortgage market has been offering mortgages that appealed to borrowers who otherwise may have sought FHA-insured home loans. As a result, the FHA share of the mortgage market declined. FHA reform measures were debated in previous sessions of Congress, but FHA reform proved controversial and these efforts stalled. Momentum for FHA reform grew as the downturn in the housing market worsened in 2008. Reform measures were introduced in the 110th Congress and some of the provisions were included in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, P.L. 110-289, enacted July 30, 2008. Title I of Division B of P.L. 110-289 is cited as the FHA Modernization Act of 2008, and it contains two subtitles. Subtitle A, the Building American Homeownership Act of 2008, makes several amendments to the FHA program that insures loans on single family homes under Title II of the National Housing Act. Subtitle B, the FHA Manufactured Housing Loan Modernization Act of 2008, makes several amendments to the FHA program that insures loans on manufactured housing loan program under Title I of the National Housing.

From 1934 through the end of FY2007, FHA has insured about 34.6 million home loans at a mortgage volume of about $2 trillion.", "Though FHA is a mortgage insurer rather than a lender, in earlier years, FHA was often the innovator in testing new mortgage products or processes:", "In 1959, FHA was authorized to acquire mortgages from lenders in order to avoid foreclosure, instead of taking title to the property after the foreclosure. In 1961, FHA was authorized to insure loans on condominiums. In 1968, the Special Risk Insurance Fund was created in FHA, and through that fund FHA was authorized to insure home loans to low- and moderate-income individuals who, because of credit problems, irregular incomes, or other factors, did not meet the general FHA credit requirements, but who appeared able to achieve homeownership through homeownership counseling. In 1974, FHA was authorized to insure loans involving \"experimental financing\" under which the payments of the borrowers would increase along with expected increases in borrower income. In 1988, FHA was authorized to insure reverse mortgages (referred to as home equity conversion mortgages), and FHA-insured reverse mortgages became the first reverse mortgages that were available on a nearly nationwide basis.", "By 1995, some argued that the FHA mortgage insurance program was no longer needed because the private market had matured to the point where it could offer a variety of programs to serve the needs of borrowers who previously had been using the FHA program. Until the recent turmoil in the mortgage market, that argument appeared to have some validity. For example, while FHA generally required downpayments of about 3% of the purchase price, the private market offered 100% financing through such products as so-called \"piggyback\" loans. One popular piggyback loan was known as the \"80 - 20 loan\" under which a borrower obtained a first trust for 80% of the price of the home and a 20% second mortgage for the balance of the purchase price. The private market is able to vary the percentage of mortgage insurance premiums required from borrowers according to the risk that the borrowers would default on the loans, so that more risky borrowers would pay higher insurance premiums. FHA requires the same amount of mortgage insurance from borrowers regardless of the risk that the borrowers might default. This prevented FHA from providing loans to more risky borrowers, so such borrowers were lost to the private market. In addition, FHA lost loans to the private market simply because the homes in some communities were priced higher than the statutory FHA loan limits, so FHA was not a viable option. According to data made available by the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the FHA share of the market had fallen from 16% in 2000 to less than 3% in 2005 and 2006.", "The past several Congresses have debated various FHA reform measures designed to modernize the program and permit FHA to offer products to risky borrowers at less cost to borrowers than many of the products offered on the private market.

HERA is omnibus legislation which contains three Divisions\u2014Division A addresses housing finance reform, Division B addresses foreclosure prevention, and Division C addresses tax-related provisions.", "Title I of Division B of HERA is cited as the FHA Modernization Act of 2008. It amends the National Housing Act in an attempt to make FHA more competitive with products available on the private market. It does not, however, attempt to compete with zero downpayment loans. HERA takes the opposite approach and increases the downpayment requirements for FHA-insured home loans. Given turmoil in the mortgage market, however, it is doubtful that the private market is presently offering any zero downpayment loans.", "The FHA Modernization Act of 2008 (the Act) contains two subtitles.
