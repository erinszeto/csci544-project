The committee is concerned that the Air Force plan to procure one aircraft per year over 10 years in order to recapitalize this fleet is not the most efficient way to move the capability to the field quickly, and may put the Compass Call mission at unacceptable risk of mission failure. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force to provide a briefing to the House Committee on Armed Services by February 1, 2019, on the Compass Call transition plan. This plan should include:", "(1) courses of action to accelerate the recapitalization of the EC\u2013130H fleet and Baseline 4 development and deployment for incoming EC\u201337 aircraft;", "(2) attendant timelines for each course of action;", "(3) cost estimates for each course of action;", "(4) recommended course of action and a plan to manage both fleets while supporting combatant commander requirements; and", "(5) an assessment of the potential for future cooperative development and procurement of EC\u201337B Compass Call aircraft by the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom and the Royal Australian Air Force in a way the leverages the best practices of the RC\u2013135 cooperative program arrangement with the Royal Air Force of the United Kingdom.

McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, stated the following:", "The committee supports the Air Force's efforts to recapitalize the aging EC\u2013130H Compass Call fleet with the EC\u201337 type aircraft. The committee notes that before it can carry on with the transition plan, the Department of Defense must first comply with the related provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114\u2013328) and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115\u201391). While the committee notes that Department has submitted the certification required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (Public Law 115\u201391), delays in satisfying the requirement has led to a work stoppage on the program lasting at least six weeks. The committee is concerned about the potential for further work stoppages should the Secretary of the Air Force fail to make a timely determination that the EC\u201337B has a high likelihood of meeting combatant requirements, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114\u2013328). The committee encourages the Secretary of the Air Force to make a timely determination for this requirement to avoid further program delays and cost overruns.", "Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of the Air Force, not more than 60 days after the determination required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114\u2013328) is made, to provide a briefing to the congressional defense committees on the Compass Call transition plan. This plan should include:", "(1) Courses of action to accelerate the recapitalization of the EC\u2013130H fleet and Baseline 4 development and deployment for incoming EC\u201337 aircraft;", "(a) attendant timelines for each course of action;", "(b) cost estimates for each course of action; and", "(2) Recommended course of action and a plan to manage both fleets while supporting combatant commander requirements.

The Committee recommends that the Secretary of the Air Force consider increasing the procurement of EC\u201337B aircraft to two per year if such a pace of recapitalization can be achieved without unduly disrupting the operational availability of Compass Call capability for the combatant commanders. (Page 188)", "In final action on the FY2019 DOD Appropriations Act (Division A of H.R. 6157 / P.L. 115-245 of September 28, 2018), Congress increased the requested amount for procurement of new EC-37Bs by $108 million for \"Program increase - accelerate fourth EC-37B aircraft.\""], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
