While the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA, or Act) sets forth the statutory provisions governing this area of law, several Supreme Court and lower court rulings have had a significant impact on the Act's regulatory scope. Most notably, since 2003, a series of Supreme Court decisions has invalidated several FECA provisions that were enacted as part of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), and in 2010, the Court invalidated a long-standing prohibition on independent expenditures funded from the treasuries of corporations and labor unions. Generally, the Court has overturned such provisions as unconstitutional violations of First Amendment guarantees of free speech.", "As a foundational matter, FECA distinguishes between a contribution and an expenditure: a contribution involves giving money to an entity, such as a candidate's campaign committee, while an expenditure involves spending money directly for advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate. Generally, the Supreme Court has upheld limits on contributions, while invalidating limits on expenditures. FECA regulates campaigns in three primary ways: contribution limits, source restrictions, and disclosure and disclaimer requirements.", "Contribution Limits", "Contribution limits refer to how much a donor can contribute as well as how they can contribute. Contribution limits include specific limits on how much money a donor may contribute to a candidate, party, and political committee, which are known as base limits. FECA also provides for related restrictions, including the ban on contributions made through a conduit; the ban on converting campaign contributions for personal use; and the treatment of communications a donor makes in coordination with a candidate or party as contributions. While the Supreme Court has generally upheld base limits, the Court has struck down FECA's aggregate limits, which capped the total amount of money a donor could contribute to all candidates, parties, and political committees; limits on contributions to candidates whose opponents self-finance; and limits on contributions by minors. In addition, based on Supreme Court precedent, an appellate court ruling provided the legal underpinning for the establishment of super PACs.", "Source Restrictions", "FECA contains several bans, referred to as source restrictions, on who may make campaign contributions. Source restrictions include the ban on corporate and labor union campaign contributions directly from treasury funds\u2014although the Supreme Court has held that limits on corporate and labor union independent spending are unconstitutional, the Court has upheld limits on contributions. Source restrictions also include the ban on federal contractor contributions\u2014known as the \"pay-to-play\" prohibition\u2014which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld against a First Amendment challenge in 2015; the ban on foreign national contributions and expenditures; and the restrictions on foreign national involvement in U.S. campaigns.", "Disclaimer and Disclosure Requirements", "FECA also sets forth disclaimer and disclosure requirements. FECA's disclaimer requirements mandate that statements of attribution appear directly on campaign-related communications. FECA's disclosure requirements mandate that political committees register with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and comply with periodic reporting requirements. In addition, the law requires other entities\u2014such as labor unions and corporations, including incorporated organizations that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code\u2014that make independent expenditures or electioneering communications to disclose information to the FEC. Generally, the Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of disclaimer and disclosure requirements against First Amendment challenges as substantially related to the governmental interest of safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process by promoting transparency and accountability.", "Criminal Penalties", "For knowing and willful violations of any provision of the Act, FECA sets forth criminal penalties, including specific penalties for violations of the prohibition on contributions made through a conduit. In most instances, the U.S. Department of Justice initiates the prosecution of criminal violations of FECA, but the law also provides that the FEC may refer an apparent violation to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution under certain circumstances."], "reports": {"section_title": "", "paragraphs": ["F ederal campaign finance law is composed of a complex set of limits, restrictions, and requirements on money and other things of value that are spent or contributed in the context of federal elections.

Next, organized by regulatory context, and integrating governing court precedent, this report analyzes three primary areas of FECA regulation: contribution limits; source restrictions; and disclaimer and disclosure requirements. In so doing, the report examines topics of recent interest to Congress, including the permissible uses of campaign funds; the scope of what constitutes a campaign contribution; the ban on foreign nationals making contributions and expenditures in connection with U.S. elections; and the restrictions on foreign nationals participating in campaigns. The report also outlines the criminal penalties that may be imposed under the Act for violations of its provisions. ", "As the Supreme Court's campaign finance jurisprudence informs the manner in which campaign financing may be constitutionally regulated, the report assesses pivotal rulings that may be instructive should Congress consider legislation in this area. In addition, the report examines significant lower court rulings, including an appellate court decision that provides the legal underpinning for the establishment of super PACs. Finally, the report analyzes two cases that were recently appealed to the Supreme Court.

In response to the Watergate scandal, in 1974, Congress substantially amended the Act, generally implementing limits on contributions and expenditures, and creating the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to administer and provide civil enforcement of FECA. As a result of a challenge to the constitutionality of the 1974 Amendments, the Supreme Court issued its seminal Supreme Court ruling in Buckley v. Valeo , holding, among other things, mandatory spending limits unconstitutional, and invalidating the original appointment structure of the FEC. Responding to the Court's ruling, in 1976, Congress amended FECA in order to, among other things, restructure the FEC and establish revised contribution limits, and again in 1979, in order to revise certain reporting requirements. ", "In 2002, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), which contains the most recent, comprehensive amendments to FECA. Among other provisions, BCRA prohibited corporate and labor union spending on certain advertisements run prior to elections, and restricted the raising and spending of unregulated or \"soft money\" in federal elections. ", "Since 2003, a series of Supreme Court decisions has invalidated several BCRA provisions. In addition, in 2010, the Court invalidated a long-standing prohibition on independent expenditures funded from the treasuries of corporations and labor unions. Generally, the Court has overturned such provisions as unconstitutional violations of First Amendment guarantees of free speech. Accordingly, the body of federal campaign finance law that remains was not originally enacted by Congress as a comprehensive regulatory policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Framework", "paragraphs": ["In Buckley , the Supreme Court established the framework for evaluating the constitutionality of campaign finance regulation. According to the Court, limits on campaign contributions\u2014which involve giving money to an entity\u2014and expenditures\u2014which involve spending money directly for electoral advocacy\u2014implicate rights of political expression and association under the First Amendment. The Court, however, afforded different degrees of First Amendment protection and levels of scrutiny to contributions and expenditures. ", "Contribution limits are subject to a more lenient standard of review than expenditures, the Court held, because they impose only a marginal restriction on speech, and will be upheld if the government can demonstrate that they are a \"closely drawn\" means of achieving a \"sufficiently important\" governmental interest. Unlike expenditure limits, which reduce the amount of expression, the Court opined, contribution limits involve \"little direct restraint\" on the speech of a contributor. Although the Court acknowledged that a contribution limit restricts an aspect of a contributor's freedom of association, that is, his or her ability to support a candidate, nonetheless, the Court determined that a contribution limit still permits symbolic expressions of support, and does not infringe on a contributor's freedom to speak about candidates and issues. Reasonable contribution limits, the Court announced, still permit people to engage in independent political expression, associate by volunteering on campaigns, and assist candidates by making limited contributions. Regarding whether a contribution limit is closely drawn, the Court reasoned that it was relevant to examine the amount of the limit. Limits that are too low could significantly impede a candidate or political committee from amassing the necessary resources for effective communication. The Court concluded, however, that the FECA contribution limit at issue in Buckley would not negatively affect campaign funding. ", "On the other hand, the Buckley Court determined that because they impose a substantial restraint on speech and association, expenditure limits are subject to strict scrutiny, requiring that they be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Specifically, under the First Amendment, the Court determined, expenditure limits impose a restriction on the amount of money that a candidate can spend on communications, thereby reducing the number and depth of issues discussed and the size of the audience reached. Such restrictions, the Court determined, are not justified by an overriding governmental interest. That is, because expenditures do not involve money flowing directly to the benefit of a candidate's campaign fund, the risk of quid pro quo corruption does not exist. Essentially, quid pro quo corruption captures the notion of \"a direct exchange of an official act for money.\" Further, the Court in Buckley rejected the government's asserted interest in equalizing the relative resources of candidates, and in reducing the overall costs of campaigns. Upon a similar premise, the Court rejected the government's interest in limiting a wealthy candidate's ability to draw upon personal wealth to finance his or her campaign, and struck down a law limiting expenditures from personal funds. When a candidate self-finances, the Court pointed out, his or her dependence on outside contributions is reduced, thereby lessening the risk of corruption.", "Importantly, the Court's most recent major campaign finance decision, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission , announced that only quid pro quo corruption or its appearance constitute a sufficiently important governmental interest to justify limits on contributions, as well as expenditures. In McCutcheon , the Court reasoned it has consistently rejected campaign finance regulation based on other governmental objectives, such as goals to \"level the playing field,\" \"level electoral opportunities,\" or \"equaliz[e] the financial resources of candidates.\" While acknowledging that the Court's campaign finance jurisprudence has not always discussed the concept of corruption clearly and consistently, and that the line between quid pro quo corruption and general influence may sometimes seem vague, the Court in McCutcheon said that efforts to ameliorate \"influence over or access to\" elected officials or political parties do not constitute a permissible governmental interest. ", "Although the Supreme Court's campaign finance jurisprudence has shifted over the years, as this report illustrates, reviewing courts have applied the basic Buckley framework when evaluating whether a campaign finance regulation violates the First Amendment. Therefore, in Buckley and its progeny, with some exceptions, courts have generally upheld limits on contributions, concluding that they serve the governmental interest of protecting elections from corruption, while invalidating limits on independent expenditures, concluding that they do not pose a risk of corruption."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contribution Limits", "paragraphs": ["As discussed, FECA sets forth limits and restrictions on campaign contributions in federal elections. FECA broadly defines a \"contribution\" to include money or anything of value given for the purpose of influencing an election for federal office. Specifically, FECA defines contributions to include \"any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value\" that is made \"for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office\" or a payment that is made for compensation of personal services that are rendered to a political committee free of charge. ", "As outlined above, FECA expressly defines contributions to include loans made to campaign committees; however, the Act exempts from such definition loans that are made from banks, so long as they are made in compliance with applicable law and \"in the ordinary course of business.\" Further, the Act specifies that a bank loan to a campaign committee must be evidenced by a written instrument, ensuring repayment on a date certain or in accordance with an amortization schedule, and subject to the lending institution's \"usual and customary interest rate.\" However, in the case of other loans made to a campaign\u2014for example, personal loans\u2014the outstanding balance is considered a campaign contribution. Therefore, the amount of an unpaid loan, coupled with other contributions made by an individual to a given candidate or committee, cannot exceed the applicable contribution limit. Once a loan is repaid in full, the amount of the loan is no longer considered a contribution.", "The following sections of the report provide an overview of FECA's limits and restrictions on contributions, including a discussion of key constitutional rulings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Specific Limits", "paragraphs": ["FECA provides specific limits on how much individuals can contribute to a candidate, and these limits are periodically adjusted for inflation in odd-numbered years. For example, in the 2017-2018 federal election cycle, an individual can contribute up to $2,700, per election, to a candidate.", " Table 1 , below, outlines the major federal campaign contribution limits applicable to the 2017-2018 cycle."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Constitutionality of Base and Aggregate Limits", "paragraphs": ["In Buckley , the Court upheld the constitutionality of FECA base limits, which limit the amounts of money an individual can contribute to a candidate, party, or political committee. In the years since, the Court has applied the principles articulated in Buckley to uphold what it considers reasonable contribution limits, while invalidating limits it determines are too low to allow a candidate to amass necessary resources for effective campaigning. For example, in Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC , the Court upheld a state law imposing limits on contributions made to candidates running for state office. While observing that contribution limits must be closely drawn to a sufficiently important interest, the Court announced that the amount of the limitation \"need not be 'fine tuned.'\" In contrast, in Randall v. Sorell , in a plurality opinion, the Court invalidated a Vermont law that provided that individuals, parties, and political committees were limited to contributing $400 to certain state candidates, per two-year election cycle, without providing for inflation adjustment. While unable to reach consensus on a single opinion, six Justices agreed that Vermont's contribution limits violated First Amendment free-speech guarantees. The plurality opinion written by Justice Breyer, joined by two other Justices, determined that the contribution limits in Randall were substantially lower than limits the Court had previously upheld, as well as limits in effect in other states, and that they were not narrowly tailored. The opinion also concluded that the limits substantially restricted candidates, particularly challengers, from being able to raise the funds necessary to run a competitive campaign; impeded parties from getting their candidates elected; and deterred individual citizens from volunteering on campaigns (because the law counted certain volunteer expenses toward a volunteer's individual contribution limit).", "In contrast to base contribution limits, FECA also provided for limits on the amount of money a donor could contribute in total to all candidates, parties, and political committees, which is referred to as aggregate contribution limits. In its most recent campaign finance decision, McCutcheon , the Supreme Court held that aggregate contribution limits are unconstitutional under the First Amendment. Characterizing them as an \"outright ban\" on further contributions once the aggregate amount has been reached, the Court determined that they violate the First Amendment by infringing on political expression and association rights, without furthering the governmental interest of preventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.", "In Buckley v. Valeo , the Court had upheld the constitutionality of a $25,000 federal aggregate contribution limit then in effect, characterizing that limit as a \"quite modest restraint\" that served to prevent circumvention of base limits. In other words, the Court determined that the aggregate limits constrained an individual from, for example, contributing large amounts to a particular candidate through \"the use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to contribute to that candidate.\" In McCutcheon , however, the Court invalidated a BCRA provision that imposed biennial limits on aggregate contributions, which were adjusted for inflation each election cycle. For example, during the 2011-2012 election cycle, the Act prohibited individuals from making contributions to candidates totaling more than $46,200, and to parties and PACs (with the exception of \"super PACs\") totaling more than $70,800. (The base limits on contributions established by BCRA were not at issue in this case and remain in effect.) ", "As a threshold matter, the plurality opinion in McCutcheon determined that, regardless of whether strict scrutiny or the \"closely drawn\" standard applies, the analysis requires the Court to \"assess the fit\" between the government's stated objective and the means to achieve it. Applying that analysis to FECA's aggregate contribution limits, the opinion observed a \"substantial mismatch\" between the two, and concluded that even under the more lenient standard of review, the limits could not be upheld. The plurality in McCutcheon concluded that Buckley's holdings on aggregate limits did not control because the Buckley Court had engaged in minimal analysis of aggregate limits, and further, the limits at issue in McCutcheon established a different statutory regime and operated under a distinct legal backdrop. The Court reasoned that, since Buckley , Congress had enacted other statutory and regulatory safeguards against circumvention of base limits. The opinion also outlined additional safeguards that Congress could enact to prevent circumvention of base contribution limits, such as targeted restrictions on transfers among candidates and political committees or enhanced restrictions on earmarking, but cautioned that the opinion was not meant to evaluate the validity of any particular proposal. Further distinguishing the holding in Buckley , the McCutcheon plurality emphasized that aggregate contribution limits restrict how many candidates and committees an individual can support, which creates an \"outright ban\" on further contributions. This ban, the opinion concluded, unconstitutionally restricts both free speech and association rights.", "Importantly, it was in McCutcheon that the Court announced that the prevention of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance is the only legitimate governmental interest for restricting campaign contributions. According to the opinion, the spending of large sums of money in connection with elections, but absent an effort to control how an officeholder exercises his or her official duties, does not give rise to quid pro quo corruption. Although McCutcheon did not expressly adopt a stricter standard of review for contribution limits, its announcement that only quid pro quo corruption or its appearance serve as a compelling governmental interest may affect the degree to which contribution limits are upheld in future rulings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Restrictions on Contributions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ban on Contributions Made Through a Conduit", "paragraphs": ["In addition to limiting the amount a donor may contribute to a campaign, FECA also places certain restrictions on the types of contributions that a donor can make. For example, FECA prohibits contributions made through a conduit\u2014that is, by one person \"in the name of another person\"\u2014and bans candidates from knowingly accepting such contributions. This provision serves to prevent an individual, who has already contributed the maximum amount to a given candidate, from circumventing contribution limits by giving money to someone else to contribute to that same candidate. Regulations the FEC promulgated under FECA further specify that a corporation is prohibited from reimbursing employees for their campaign contributions through a bonus, expense account, or other form of compensation.

Examples of such expenses include home mortgage, rent, or utility payments; clothing purchases; non-campaign-related car expenses; country club memberships; vacations; household food; tuition payments; admission to sporting events, concerts, theater performances, or other entertainment not associated with a campaign; and health club fees.

In contrast, FECA provides that a communication will be considered \"coordinated\" if it is made \"in cooperation, consultation or concert, with, or at the request or suggestion of\" the candidate or a party. In other words, if a communication\u2014such as a political advertisement\u2014is made in coordination with a candidate or political party, it is treated as an in-kind contribution to the corresponding candidate or party, or as a coordinated party expenditure, rather than as an independent expenditure. Like other contributions, in-kind contributions and coordinated party expenditures are subject to FECA limits and source restrictions, which are discussed in the next section of the report.", "The regulatory line between coordinated communications and independent expenditures is based on Supreme Court precedent. In various rulings, the Court has determined that the First Amendment does not allow any limits on expenditures that are made independently of a candidate or party because the money is deployed to advance a political point of view separate from a candidate's viewpoint. In other words, the Court has explained, without coordination or \"prearrangement\" with a candidate, not only is the value of an expenditure decreased, but so is \"the danger that expenditures will be given as a quid pro quo for improper commitments from the candidate.\" Accordingly, the Court has reasoned that independent expenditures do not raise heightened governmental interests in regulation. As the Court has emphasized, the \"constitutionally significant fact\" of an independent expenditure is the absence of coordination between the candidate and the source of the expenditure, and the independence of such spending is easily distinguishable when it is made \"without any candidate's approval (or wink or nod).\" Hence, individuals, political parties, political action committees (PACs), super PACs, and other organizations can engage in unlimited independent expenditures. Furthermore, as a result of the Court's ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , discussed further below, corporations and labor unions have a constitutionally protected right to engage in unlimited independent expenditures directly from their revenue funds or \"general treasuries\" and are not required to establish a PAC in order to conduct such spending.", "As summarized below, regulations promulgated under FECA set forth specific criteria establishing when a communication by an organization will be considered coordinated with a candidate or a party and thereby treated as a contribution. Specifically, the regulations set forth a three-prong test whereby if all prongs of the test are met\u2014payment, content, and conduct\u2014a communication will be deemed coordinated: ", "Payment . In general, the regulations provide that the \"payment\" standard is met if the communication is paid for, in whole or in part, by a person other than the candidate, a candidate committee, or party. ", "Content . The \"content\" standard addresses the subject and timing of a communication. The content standard does not require that a communication contain express advocacy (i.e., expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, using terms such as \"vote for,\" \"elect,\" or \"vote against\"). Generally, the regulations provide that the content standard is met if a communication is ", "an electioneering communication, which is defined to include a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a federal candidate, made within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary; a public communication that distributes or republishes, in whole or in part, candidate campaign materials, with certain exceptions; a public communication that expressly advocates election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or is the \"functional equivalent of express advocacy\"; or a public communication that, in part, refers to a candidate or party and, for House or Senate elections, is disseminated within 90 days before a primary or general election or, for presidential and vice presidential elections, is disseminated within 120 days before a primary or nominating convention or caucus. ", "Conduct . The \"conduct\" standard addresses interactions between the person paying for the communication and the relevant candidate or party. Generally, the regulations specify that the conduct standard is met if", "the communication is created at the \"request or suggestion of\" a candidate or party, or at the suggestion of the funder of the communication and the candidate or party assents to the suggestion; the candidate or party is \"materially involved\" in decisions regarding the communication; the communication is created after \"substantial discussions\" between the funder of the communication and the candidate or party; the funder of the communication employs a \"common vendor\" meeting certain criteria to create the communication; or a person who has previously been an employee or independent contractor of a candidate or party during the previous 120 days uses or conveys certain information to the funder of the communication. ", "Exceptions or \"Safe Harbors . \" FECA regulations also set forth several \"safe harbors\" exempting communications from being deemed coordinated. Below are a few examples, summarized. ", "Endorsements and Solicitations . A public communication in which a federal candidate endorses or solicits funds for another federal or nonfederal candidate is not considered coordinated with respect to the endorsement or the solicitation, unless the public communication \"promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes\" the endorsing candidate or another candidate running for the same office. Firewalls . The \"conduct\" standards are not met if the commercial vendor, former employee, or political committee established a firewall that meets certain requirements, including a prohibition on the flow of information between employees or consultants providing services for the funder of the communication, and employees or consultants providing services to the candidate or the candidate's opponent or a party. The firewall must be described in a written policy that is distributed to all relevant employees, consultants, and clients. Publicly Available Information . If information material to the creation of a communication was obtained from a publicly available source, the other \"conduct\" standards are not met, unless the communication was made at the \"request or suggestion\" of a candidate or party, or at the suggestion of the funder of the communication and the candidate or party assents to the suggestion.

Enacted as part of BCRA, the invalidated provision of law is known as the \"Millionaire's Amendment.\" The Millionaire's Amendment provided a complex statutory formula (using limits that were in effect at the time the Court considered Davis ) requiring that if a candidate for the House of Representatives spent more than $350,000 of personal funds during an election cycle, the individual contribution limits applicable to her opponent were increased from the then-current limit ($2,300 per election) to up to triple that amount (or $6,900 per election). Similarly, for Senate candidates, a separate provision generally raised individual contribution limits for a candidate whose opponent exceeded a designated threshold level of personal campaign funding that was based on the number of eligible voters in the state.

Some commentators have argued that the Supreme Court in McCutcheon may have signaled a willingness in future cases to evaluate contribution limits under a stricter standard of review than it has in the past. Should the Court decide to apply a stricter level of scrutiny to contribution limits in future cases, legislation providing for enhanced contribution limits would be less likely to survive constitutional challenges. Furthermore, a stricter standard of review could likewise result in successful challenges to existing contribution limits, including the limits on individual contributions to candidates and parties.", "Looking ahead, there are at least two cases recently appealed to the Supreme Court which, should the Court review, could potentially shed light on the constitutional bounds of contribution limits and provide Congress with guidance for evaluating legislative options. By a 2-to-1 vote, in Lair v. Motl , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (Ninth Circuit) upheld a Montana law establishing limits for how much individuals, political action committees, and parties could contribute to state candidates. The Ninth Circuit held that the limits were justified by and adequately tailored to the government's interest in avoiding quid pro quo corruption or its appearance. According to the Ninth Circuit, the state had sufficiently demonstrated a risk of actual or perceived quid pro quo corruption in Montana politics, including indications of attempts to exchange campaign contributions for legislative action. On appeal, the petitioners argue, among other things, that the Ninth Circuit decision conflicts with Supreme Court precedent requiring that a state provide evidence of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance and that showing a mere \"risk\" of such corruption is insufficient. Interpreting the Supreme Court's 2016 ruling in McDonnell v. U.S. \u2014a case arising in the context of federal public corruption law rather than campaign finance law\u2014to define quid pro quo corruption as \"1) a quid (things of value given to an official); 2) a pro (the unambiguous agreement connecting the quid to the quo ); and 3) a quo (an official act),\" the petitioners argue that Montana could not demonstrate such evidence. If the Court decides to review Lair , its ruling could clarify the extent to which the government is required to present evidence of quid pro quo corruption in order to justify contribution limits.", "Likewise, in Zimmerman v. City of Austin , a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) affirmed a lower court ruling that, among other things, upheld a base campaign contribution limit applicable to mayor and city council candidates of $300 per contributor, per election, adjusted annually for inflation, which was $350 at the time the suit was filed. Relying on Supreme Court precedent establishing that contribution limits are subject to \"less searching scrutiny\" than expenditure limits, the Fifth Circuit upheld the contribution limit, determining that the City of Austin had shown \"a sufficiently important interest in preventing either actual corruption or its appearance.\" Among other evidence, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the government had demonstrated that prior to the enactment of the limits, the citizenry perceived that large campaign contributions had a corrupting impact, thereby transforming the city government into a \"pay-to-play system.\" On appeal, the petitioner argues, among other things, that the City of Austin has not demonstrated a sufficient government interest for the contribution limit because a $350 limit is so \"severe\" that it belies perception that it was targeted to the threat of corruption and that furthermore, testimony at trial failed to evidence that any actual quid pro quo had occurred. A ruling by the Court in Zimmerman , depending on its contours, could clarify the extent of the burden on Congress to prove that any limits it may enact serve the governmental interest of avoiding quid pro quo corruption or its appearance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Source Restrictions", "paragraphs": ["In addition to limits on how much a donor may contribute to a campaign, federal campaign finance law contains several bans\u2014referred to as \"source restrictions\"\u2014on who may make campaign contributions.

Bellotti had reaffirmed that the government cannot restrict political speech because the speaker is a corporation. On the other hand, its 1990 decision of Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce had permitted a restriction on such speech in order to avoid corporations having disproportionate economic power in elections. In Bellotti , the Court struck down a state law prohibiting corporate independent expenditures related to referenda. In contrast, the Court in Austin upheld a state law prohibiting, and imposing criminal penalties on, corporate independent expenditures that supported or opposed any candidate for state office.

Notably, the Supreme Court, in a 2007 decision, FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL) , had narrowed the definition of an electioneering communication in order to mitigate concerns that the law could prohibit First Amendment protected issue speech, known as issue advocacy. In WRTL , the Court interpreted the term to encompass only express advocacy (for example, communications stating \"vote for\" or \"vote against\") or the \"functional equivalent\" of express advocacy. That is, the Court advised that communications that could reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate should not be considered electioneering communications. Despite the limiting principle imposed by WRTL , the Court in Citizens United observed that both prohibitions were a \"ban on speech\" in violation of the First Amendment. In comparison to the prohibitions at issue in Citizens United , which include criminal penalties, the Court pointed out that it has invalidated even less-restrictive laws under the First Amendment, such as laws requiring permits and impounding royalties.", "Also of note, the statute prohibiting corporate expenditures contained an exception that permitted corporations to use their treasury funds to establish, administer, and solicit contributions to a PAC in order to make expenditures. The Court, however, rejected the argument that permitting a corporation to establish a PAC mitigated the complete ban on speech that the law imposed on the corporation itself, explaining that as corporations and PACs are separate associations, allowing a PAC to speak does not translate into allowing a corporation to speak. Enumerating the \"onerous\" and \"expensive\" reporting requirements associated with PAC administration, the Court announced that even if a PAC could permit a corporation to speak, \"the option to form a PAC does not alleviate the First Amendment problems\" with the law.

Pay-to-play laws generally serve to restrict officials from conditioning government contracts or benefits on political support in the form of campaign contributions to the controlling political party or public officials. \"Pay-to-play\" can be viewed as a more subtle form of political corruption because it may involve anticipatory action, and potential future benefits, as opposed to any explicit, current quid pro quo agreement. This FECA prohibition applies at any time between the earlier of the commencement of contract negotiations or when the requests for proposals are sent out, and the termination of negotiations or completion of contract performance, whichever is later. FECA regulations further specify that the ban on contractor contributions applies to the assets of a partnership that is a federal contractor, but permits individual partners to make contributions from personal assets. The ban also applies to the assets of individuals and sole proprietors who are federal contractors, which include their business, personal, or other funds under their control, although the spouses of individuals and sole proprietors who are federal contractors and their employees are permitted to make contributions from their personal funds. As with corporate direct or \"treasury fund\" contributions, FECA provides an exception to the ban on government contractor contributions, permitting candidates to accept contributions from PACs that are established and administered by corporations or labor unions contracting with the government.

The 11-judge court held that the law comported with both the First Amendment and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. According to the D.C. Circuit, the federal ban serves \"sufficiently important\" government interests by guarding against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance, and protecting merit-based administration. Further, the court held that the ban is closely drawn to the government's interests because it does not restrict contractors from engaging in other types of political engagement, including fundraising or campaigning. The number of convictions for pay-to-play infractions, dating back to when the ban was first enacted in 1940, justifies its continued existence, according to the D.C. Circuit, because the risk of quid pro quo corruption and its appearance has not dissipated. According to the D.C.

Specifically, the law prohibits foreign nationals from \"directly or indirectly\" making a contribution or donation of money \"or other thing of value\" in connection with any U.S. election, or making a promise to do so, either expressly or implied; or a contribution or donation to a political party. Furthermore, as with other coordinated expenditures, this ban on contributions would include any communication that a foreign national makes in coordination with a candidate's campaign or political party, which would be treated as an in-kind contribution.

FECA regulations specify that it is unlawful to knowingly provide \"substantial assistance\" in the solicitation, making, acceptance, or receipt of a prohibited contribution or donation, or in the making of a prohibited expenditure, independent expenditure, or disbursement. Further, the regulations define \"knowingly\" to require that a person \"have actual knowledge\" that the source of the funds solicited, accepted, or received is a foreign national; have awareness \"of facts that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that there is a substantial probability\" that the source of the funds is a foreign national; or have awareness \"of facts that would lead a reasonable person to inquire\" whether the source of the funds is a foreign national, but fail to conduct a reasonable inquiry.", "In addition, FECA regulations further specify that foreign nationals are prohibited from directing or participating in the decisionmaking process of entities involved in U.S. elections, including decisions regarding the making of contributions, donations, expenditures, or disbursements in connection with any U.S. election or decisions concerning the administration of a political committee. In a series of advisory opinions, the FEC has provided specific guidance for compliance with the restrictions on foreign nationals. For example, the FEC has determined that a U.S. corporation that is a subsidiary of a foreign corporation may establish a PAC that makes contributions to federal candidates as long as the foreign parent does not finance any contributions either directly or through a subsidiary, and no foreign national participates in PAC operations and decisionmaking, including regarding campaign contributions.

A key element of a national political community, the court observed, is that \"foreign citizens do not have a constitutional right to participate in, and thus may be excluded from, activities of democratic self-government.\" Similar to the Court's decision in WRTL , discussed above, the district court in Bluman interpreted the ban on independent expenditures to apply only to foreign nationals engaging in express advocacy and not issue advocacy. In other words, under the court's interpretation, foreign nationals remain free to engage in \"speaking out about issues or spending money to advocate their views about issues.\" As to the parameters of express advocacy, the district court defined the term as an expenditure for \"express campaign speech\" or its \"functional equivalent,\" meaning that it \"is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.\""], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Constitutional Considerations for Legislation", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above in the section on contribution limits, some commentators have argued that the Supreme Court in 2014 in McCutcheon may have signaled a willingness in future cases to evaluate contribution limits under a stricter standard of review than it has in the past.

In addition, as discussed below, the Court appears to have consistently determined that the First Amendment does not require limiting disclosure requirements to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

First, the Court determined, disclosure provides the electorate with information as to the source of campaign money, how it is spent, and \"the interests to which a candidate is most likely to be responsive\"\u2014in other words, an informational interest. Second, the Court stated that disclosure serves to deter corruption and its appearance by uncovering large contributions and expenditures \"to the light of publicity,\" observing that voters with information regarding a candidate's highest donors are better able to detect \"post-election special favors\" by an officeholder in exchange for the contributions. Third, the Court identified disclosure requirements as an essential method of detecting violations to refer to law enforcement. In upholding the constitutionality of FECA's donor disclosure requirements for independent expenditures, the Court determined that so long as they encompass only funds used for express advocacy communications, the requirement is constitutional. Such donor disclosure \"increases the fund of information\" regarding who supports a given candidate, and that informational interest can be equally strong for independent spending as it is for spending that is coordinated with a candidate or party. ", "The Court in McConnell rejected a facial challenge to the enhanced disclosure requirements set forth in BCRA. According to McConnell , the Court in Buckley distinguished between express advocacy and issue advocacy for the purposes of statutory construction, not constitutional command, and therefore, the First Amendment did not require creating \"a rigid barrier\" between the two in this case. In other words, the Court determined, because electioneering communications are intended to influence an election, the absence of \"magic words\" of express advocacy does not obviate the government's interest in requiring disclosure of such ads in order to combat corruption or its appearance. Furthermore, as in Buckley , the McConnell Court held that disclosure requirements in BCRA serve the \"important state interests\" of providing voters with information, deterring corruption and avoiding its appearance, and assisting with enforcement of the law.", "Expanding on its holding in Buckley , in Citizens United , the Court upheld FECA's disclosure requirements for electioneering communications as applied to a political movie and broadcast advertisements promoting the movie. Citing Buckley , the Court determined that while they may burden the ability to speak, disclosure requirements \"impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities,\" and \"do not prevent anyone from speaking.\" Accordingly, the Court evaluated the requirements under a standard of \"exacting scrutiny,\" a less-rigorous standard than the \"strict scrutiny\" standard the Court has used to evaluate restrictions on campaign spending. Exacting scrutiny requires a \"substantial relation\" between the disclosure requirement and a \"sufficiently important\" government interest. Notably, in Citizens United , the Court expressly rejected the argument that the scope of FECA's disclosure requirements for electioneering communications must be limited to speech that is express advocacy, or the \"functional equivalent of express advocacy.\" In support of its determination, the Court pointed out that in Buckley and other cases, it has simultaneously struck down limits on certain types of speech\u2014such as independent expenditure communications\u2014while upholding disclosure requirements for the same type of speech. In response to the argument that disclosure requirements could deter donations to an organization because donors may fear retaliation once their identity becomes known, the Court stated that such requirements would be unconstitutional as applied to an organization where there was a reasonable probability that its donors would be subject to threats, harassment, or reprisals.", "Similarly, in a case upholding the constitutionality of a Washington State public records law, Doe v.

Categorizing the Washington statute as a disclosure law and therefore \"not a prohibition of speech,\" the Court evaluated its constitutionality under the First Amendment using the standard of exacting scrutiny. The Court upheld the law as substantially related to the governmental interest of safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process, and announced that public disclosure \"promotes transparency and accountability in the electoral process to an extent other measures cannot.\" Regarding the argument that the disclosure law would subject petition signatories to threats, harassment, and reprisals, the Court concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the assertion.", "In 2017, in Independence Institute v. Federal Election Commission , the Supreme Court summarily affirmed a three-judge federal district court ruling upholding the constitutionality of FECA's disclosure requirements for electioneering communications. In this case, the challengers of the law argued, among other things, that an ad they sought to run was constitutionally protected issue advocacy and therefore was exempt from disclosure requirements. Rejecting this argument, the district court observed that the Supreme Court has twice upheld the constitutionality of the FECA disclosure requirements for electioneering communications, first in McConnell , and once again in Citizens United , where the Court expressly held that the First Amendment does not require limiting disclosure requirements to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

", "Similarly, regarding disclosure requirements, as discussed above, the Court has generally upheld their constitutionality, determining that they serve the governmental interests of providing voters with information, deterring corruption and avoiding its appearance, and facilitating enforcement of the law. Should Congress decide to consider legislation providing for enhanced disclosure requirements, it is notable that the Court in Citizens United expressly held that the First Amendment does not require limiting disclosure requirements to speech that is the functional equivalent of express advocacy. Therefore, it appears that a court would likely uphold legislation providing for increased disclosure of funding sources for communications containing express advocacy, as well as issue advocacy, to the extent that such regulation can be shown to further the governmental interests identified by the Court."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Criminal Penalties", "paragraphs": ["In addition to a series of civil penalties, FECA sets forth criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations of the Act.
