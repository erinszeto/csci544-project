Since then, newer models have increased the range an electric vehicle can travel on a single charge, and charging stations have become more readily available. These developments have been spurred by a range of government incentives, both in the United States and abroad. Transit buses are the fastest-growing segment of vehicle electrification in China, while in the United States and the European Union, the pace of bus electrification is slower.", "In the United States, federal incentives for electric passenger vehicle purchases have remained largely unchanged for more than a decade and are based primarily on tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and recharging infrastructure investments, and spending on battery chemistry research to develop less-expensive technologies:", "The plug-in electric tax credit permits a taxpayer to take a credit of up to $7,500 for each vehicle that can be recharged from the electricity grid; it phases out after a manufacturer has sold 200,000 eligible vehicles, a threshold that has been met by Tesla and General Motors. A tax credit for installation of alternative fuel vehicle refueling property expired in 2017; it had allowed a tax credit of $1,000 for equipment installed at a residence and up to $30,000 for business installations. I nvestment in transportation electrification research and development (R&D) , which has led to the gradual reduction in the cost of producing lithium-ion batteries, is administered by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in cooperation with private industry. Although the Trump Administration has recommended large reductions in these programs, Congress has maintained annual funding for sustainable transportation of nearly $700 million in the past two fiscal years.", "Other programs that directly influence the level of vehicle electrification include the DOE Clean Cities Program, which supports local efforts to reduce fossil fuel-powered transportation, and the Department of Transportation's Alternative Fuel Corridors, which are designated Interstate Highway corridors with a sufficient number of alternative fueling stations, including electric vehicle chargers, to allow alternative fuel vehicles to travel long distances. The federal government also funds municipal transit bus electrification through Federal Transit Administration grants, which may be used for the purchase of all-electric buses. The pace of electrification also may be affected by proposals for less stringent federal standards for Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.", "Beyond these federal programs, states and electric utilities provide a range of incentives for electrification. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that 45 states and the District of Columbia offer incentives such as income tax credits for electric vehicle and charger purchases, reduced registration fees, and permitting solo drivers of electric vehicles to use carpool lanes. The California Zero Emission Vehicle program is spurring sales of electric vehicles in 10 states. Utilities can provide incentives to charge during off-peak hours, install public electric charging infrastructure, and utilize vehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage.

Therefore, the subsidy amount is larger (as a percentage of a vehicle's price) for less-expensive vehicles. Generally, taxpayers claim tax credits for vehicle purchases. If the purchaser or lessee is a tax-exempt organization, the seller of the vehicle may be able to claim the credit.

The most recent one-year extension of this incentive, for all types of alternative fuel refueling property, was estimated to reduce federal tax revenues by $67 million over the 10-year budget window. Making the credit permanent for all types of qualifying property would reduce federal revenue by an estimated $332 million between FY2018 and FY2027.

Expanded access to Level 2 charging at homes and workplaces could be a cost-effective solution to building out EV infrastructure in the near term. However, if electric vehicles are to be widely used for long-distance trips, a network of direct-current fast charger (DCFC) infrastructure (Level 3) is likely necessary. The tax credit is relatively small compared to the cost of a DCFC charging station. The high cost of this infrastructure, even if tax credits are extended, may continue to pose a barrier, especially if utilization rates are low. ", "Given the differences in the costs and benefits associated with Level 2 and DCFC chargers, tax incentives could be provided that reflect some of these differences. There are few DCFC public chargers, yet having access to such infrastructure may have strong network benefits. Broadly, access to charging infrastructure has been shown in some studies to be a driver of demand for EVs. If Congress wanted to encourage greater EV use, tax credits could be designed to provide a larger incentive for investments in public DCFC infrastructure, relative to Level 2 charging stations.", "Storage incentives are another policy option that could support investment in EV infrastructure. On-site battery storage systems can be installed to allow solar power to be used for EVs. Tax incentives for batteries that facilitate EV use could encourage more of this activity.

It has been estimated that increased power requirements will increase emissions from combustion vehicles by over 60 grams of CO 2 equivalent per mile, equal to reducing fuel economy of a 35 mpg vehicle to 29 mpg.

The number of ZEVs each automaker is required to sell is based upon its total light-vehicle sales in California.

Many of the barriers utilities face with respect to electrification infrastructure are regulatory, and the role of tax policy in addressing such barriers may be limited.", "Sluggish growth in energy demand has posed a challenge for the electric utility sector. The industry has recognized EVs as an opportunity for growth. For this reason, electric utilities may have their own market-based incentives (absent federal intervention) to invest in EV infrastructure and take measures to support consumer EV adoption. Further, electric utilities may support extending current-law vehicle and infrastructure tax credits. At the same time, preparing the grid for a surge in electric car ownership could require substantial capital investments, if peak demand is increased.

While 65% of electricity customers across the United States are customers of investor-owned utilities, most other users purchase electricity from cooperatives or municipal power providers. There are limited options for providing a direct federal tax benefit to cooperative or municipal utilities that do not pay federal income taxes. Further, in many states customers may purchase electricity from competing suppliers and pay the local electric utility for delivering it. A tax incentive to provide EV infrastructure might be made available only to utilities, to other electricity suppliers, or to both. Applicability of such an incentive would vary according to state policies or the type of utility.", "State regulatory commissions typically establish prices or rates that allow utilities to earn a rate of return that the regulator determines to be reasonable. This rate of return is fixed, such that additional tax incentives do not necessarily increase the return that a utility can realize. Federal taxes are an operating expense. In some states, tax incentives that reduce utilities' operating expenses result in lower rates for electricity customers (not higher returns for utilities). Hence, federal tax incentives may provide a limited near-term incentive for utilities to increase capital spending on EV infrastructure.

When it comes to the sale of electricity for the purpose of charging EVs, the states generally have regulatory jurisdiction over retail electricity transactions, though federal and municipal authorities may also play a role. State approaches to regulation vary considerably.", "Rules and regulations governing the retail sale of electricity generally originate with a state public utility commission. An electric utility is defined in federal law as any person, state, or federal agency \"which sells electric energy.\" This definition could potentially be interpreted to mean that electric vehicle charging station operators are electric utilities by virtue of the fact that they sell electricity, and are therefore subject to all laws, requirements, and regulations pertaining to electric utilities. ", "Should charging station operators be subject to regulation as electric utilities, or is regulatory reform necessary to accommodate this new class of electricity transactions? Faced with the question of whether or how to regulate the operators, states have taken a variety of approaches: ", "Some states have issued new guidelines or regulations that define the requirements for regulated utilities to operate charging stations. For example, some states (e.g., Oregon) allow existing regulated utilities to invest in and operate EV charging stations as separate, nonregulated ventures. Others (e.g., Texas) have effectively limited the operation of charging stations to electric distribution utilities by requiring operators to meet high technical and financial standards. Still others (e.g., Kansas) have prevented electric utilities from owning and operating charging stations altogether. Other states (e.g., New York) have exempted charging station operators from public utility regulations. This leaves questions as to which regulatory agency, if any, is responsible for regulating the charging station operators, as well as whether additional regulation is needed in order to ensure fair market practices. Finally, some states have refrained from taking action altogether. Without regulatory changes, private charging station operators in these states may be subject to regulation as a utility by the state's public commission. Lack of clarity about how operators will be regulated is seen by some as an impediment to the spread of the technology in these states. In some cases, EV service providers have avoided regulation as a utility by providing charging services for free, or by charging customers by the minute rather than by the amount of electricity used. ", "Whether public utilities or private companies may operate electric vehicle charging stations and whether station operators are subject to regulation as a utility may affect deployment of EV charging infrastructure. State jurisdiction over retail electricity transactions may limit the potential role of the federal government in regulating the provision of EV charging services.", "An additional consideration is the potential for electric vehicle batteries to be used for storage, referred to as vehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage. V2G storage would allow idle vehicle batteries to be used for grid services, such as demand response. The batteries could reduce vehicle owners' electricity demand during peak periods or provide electricity to the grid during peak periods in response to time-based rates or other financial incentives. In the United States, utilities are beginning to test V2G performance in demonstration projects. In addition to technology, other identified challenges include regulation, market, and end-user acceptance."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
