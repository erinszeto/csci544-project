The aerial refueling replacement program (KC\u2013X, KC\u2013Y and KC\u2013Z) plans to procure between 12 and 15 aircraft per year to eventually replace the current fleet of 513 aircraft. This method of recapitalization will take decades to complete, with the current fleet of Eisenhower-era tankers being 80 years old by the time the last legacy aircraft is retired. During this period, the Air Force will invest billions of taxpayer dollars in maintenance of an ever aging and increasingly unreliable fleet. Based on studies conducted by the Department of Defense, total fleet costs are anticipated to increase from $2.1 billion per year to $3 billion per year by 2040 due to increasing depot maintenance and forecasted modernization programs in avionics and aircraft systems. Additionally, the Department anticipates depot maintenance costs increasing from $320,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 in 2040 due to aging aircraft related maintenance. Never in the history of our Nation has the military purposely planned to maintain aircraft past 50 years, much less 80 years of operation so even these estimates may understate the actual cost. In addition to the cost of maintaining the aging tanker fleet, the cost per flying hour of a new tanker is almost half the cost of the existing fleet. The lower cost per flying hour alone will save the taxpayer $1,795,500,000 per year for a fleet of 513 aircraft (current total aircraft inventory) or $3,500,000 per plane per year replaced.", "To address these concerns, the Committee recommendation includes a general provision providing $439,615,000 and the option for choosing one vendor or dual sourcing for the aerial refueling Tanker replacement program. Along with this authority, the Committee believes that it is in the best interest of the taxpayer to pursue recapitalization at a rate of 36 aircraft per year vice 12 or 15 aircraft. This quantity will allow for recapitalization in one-third the time and thus allow for a rapid retirement of the current KC\u2013135 aircraft. This plan will result in avoiding a large sustainment and modernization cost of the legacy KC\u2013135 fleet by allowing them to retire earlier than is currently programmed. Additionally, having more than one aircraft provider will allow for competition to help control the procurement cost, promote cost reduction measures, and allow for a faster aircraft replacement rate.", "Further, the Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to, prior to the release of a draft or final request for proposal soliciting bids for an aerial tanker replacement aircraft, submit a report to the congressional defense committees that includes a description of key mission requirement and performance parameters that will be used as the basis for determining the key selection criteria in the source selection process; a full and complete characterization and definition of ''best value''; a description of the process that the Department of Defense intends to use to ensure open, balanced and trans parent communications with potential offerors; and a full description of the corrections made to the source selection process that addresses the issues raised by the Government Accountability Office in its ''Statement Regarding the Bid Protest Decision Resolving the Aerial Refueling Tanker Protest by the Boeing Company, B311344 et. al, June 18, 2008''. (Pages 276-277)", "The report also states:", "A major imperative of the Committee's funding recommendations is to improve the efficiency with which Department of Defense resources are expended. The Committee believes that one of the best ways to support United States forces is to improve the stability of acquisition programs and increase quantities to field new equipment more rapidly. In many cases, the procurement rates for new equipment are well below what could reasonably be described as economic order quantities. The practice of stretching out procurement schedules not only delays fielding modernized weapons but is costly as well. For example, in the case of the aerial refueling tanker, annual maintenance costs are expected to climb by $900,000,000, and Depot maintenance costs are expected to increase by $780,000,000. In contrast, the lower cost per flying hour for a new fleet of tankers will save taxpayers $3,500,000 per aircraft per year. The Committee also notes that the aerial refueling tankers are a crucial piece of our nation's ability to deploy and operate anywhere in the world. (Page 4)", "The report also states:", "FEE-FOR-SERVICE REFUELING", "The Committee provides no funding for the fee-for-service refueling pilot program due to concerns with the lack of a validated requirement for the program. The Air Force should instead focus on the KC\u2013135 tanker replacement program which is a Joint Requirements Oversight Council validated requirement. The Committee recommends $439,615,000 in title VIII of this Act only for the recapitalization of the aging KC\u2013135 fleet with a competitive procurement of a commercial derivative tanker aircraft. (Page 91)", "Senate", "The Senate Appropriations Committee, in its report ( S.Rept. 111-74 of September 10, 2009) on H.R. 3326 , recommends $409.6 million in research and development funding for the KC-X program\u2014a $30 million reduction from the Administration's request, with the reduction being for \"Contract award delay.\" The recommended funding is located in the Air Force's research and development account, as requested. (Page 197, line 88)", "Appendix B. Potential Longevity of KC-135 Fleet", "2004 DSB Report and 2006 RAND Analysis", "A 2004 Defense Science Board (DSB) task force report examined, among other things, the potential longevity of the KC-135 fleet. The 2006 RAND Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) on aerial refueling also examined the technical condition of the KC-135 fleet.", "The DSB report stated that airframe service life, corrosion, and maintenance costs factors would potentially determine the KC-135s operational life expectancy. Each of these factors is discussed briefly below.", "Airframe Service Life", "KC-135s, along with their associated B-52 bombers, were originally purchased to give the United States a strategic nuclear strike capability. As a result, both fleets of airplanes spent a significant amount of time during the Cold War on ground alert. Consequently, in 2004, the average KC-135 airframe had flown only about 17,000 hours of an estimated service life of 36,000 hours (KC-135E) or 39,000 hours (KC-135R). On this basis, the DSB report concluded that KC-135 airframes were viable until 2040 at \"current usage rates.\" The 2006 RAND AOA similarly concluded that the KC-135 fleet \"can operate into the 2040s,\" but not without risks.", "Corrosion", "The 2004 DSB report concluded that corrosion did not pose an \"imminent catastrophic threat to the KC-135 fleet\" and that the Air Force's maintenance practices were postured \"to deal with corrosion and other aging problems,\" but also stated:", "However, because the KC-135s are true first generation turbojet aircraft designed only 50 years from the time man first began to fly, concerns regarding the ability to continue operating these aircraft indefinitely are intuitively well founded.", "Maintenance Costs", "A 2004 GAO report stated that KC-135 flying hour costs increased in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) terms by 29% between 1996 and 2002. The DSB report agreed that KC-135 maintenance costs had increased significantly, but found that they had leveled off due to Air Force changes in KC-135 depot processes. The DSB report forecasted modest growth in maintenance costs in the future.", "Risks Of Flying Older Aircraft", "Some observers express about potential problems that may arise in flying 50- to 80-year-old tankers that could possibly ground the entire KC-135 fleet. The DSB report examined the issue and concluded that \"although grounding is possible, the task force assesses the probability as no more likely than that of any other aircraft in the inventory of the Services.\" The 2006 RAND analysis expressed a belief that it is possible that KC-135s will be able to operate into the 2040s, but the report expressed a lack of confidence that KC-135s could continue to be operated that long without risks of major maintenance cost increases, poor fleet availability, or possible fleet-wide grounding. The RAND analysis concluded that \"the nation does not currently have sufficient knowledge about the state of the KC-135 fleet to project its technical condition over the next several decades with high confidence.\" The analysis recommended more thorough scientific and technical study of the KC-135 to provide a more reliable basis for future assessments of the condition of the KC-135 fleet."], "subsections": []}]}]}]}}
