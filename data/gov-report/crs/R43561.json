(For the full list, see Appendix A .) \"Lawfully present\" was first defined by regulation in this context for the purposes of eligibility for the high risk pools for uninsured people with pre-existing conditions. Since then, all regulations regarding the ACA have referenced that definition for the health insurance mandate, the exchanges, and the premium credit and cost-sharing subsidies. The definition of lawfully present for the ACA is identical to the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) policy definition of \"lawfully residing\" for Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and is similar to the definition of \"lawfully present\" for Social Security eligibility. ", "Nonetheless, \"lawfully present\" is not a term that is widely used within the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The INA divides foreign nationals into two general types of legal statuses for admission to the United States: immigrants and nonimmigrants. Under the INA, other aliens may have permission to be in the United States, but they do not have an immigration status. The term \"lawfully present\" in the INA is only defined in regards to noncitizen eligibility for Social Security. The INA also defines the term \"unlawfully present\" specifically for purposes of determining inadmissibility, but that definition is not equivalent to the definition of \"lawfully present\" for purposes of the ACA.", "There are noncitizens who have temporary permission to remain in the Unites States under narrowly defined circumstances such as those with temporary protected status (TPS), withholding of removal, Deferred Enforced Departure, and parole \u2014often referred to as the \"quasi-legal population.\" This \"quasi-legal\" population is counted by researchers at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and at the Pew Research Center's Hispanic Trends Project\u2014the two main entities that estimate the unauthorized alien population\u2014as part of the unauthorized (illegal) population. Although these \"quasi-legal\" migrants comprise a small percentage of the total noncitizen population, most are considered \"lawfully present\" for the purposes of the ACA.

In other words, most individuals who do not maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage for themselves and their dependents will be required to pay a penalty, which is administered and collected through the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The ACA and its implementing regulations identify some exemptions from the mandate. ", "For those who do not maintain coverage and do not qualify for an exemption, the penalties are assessed through the federal tax filing process. If an individual fails to pay the penalty, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) can collect any penalties owed by reducing the amount of an individual's tax refund, but is prohibited from using other common methods of collection (e.g., garnishing the individual's wages).

These terms are used in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) but do not exist in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

For example, an individual will generally be treated as a nonresident alien if he or she has a closer connection to a foreign country than to the United States, maintains a \"tax home\" in the foreign country, and is in the United States for fewer than 183 days during the year. Another example is that an individual in the United States under an F-, J-, M-, or Q-visa\u2014students, teachers, trainees, and cultural exchange visitors\u2014may be treated as a nonresident alien if he or she has substantially complied with visa requirements. This treatment generally applies to foreign students (most foreign students are on F visas) for their first five years in the United States and to teachers and trainees for the first two years. ", "Additional examples of individuals who may be treated as nonresident aliens even if they would otherwise meet the substantial presence test include regular commuters from Canada or Mexico, among others. Furthermore, depending on where the individual is from, there may be an income tax treaty between that country and the United States with provisions for determining residency status.", "Resident aliens are subject to the same tax treatment as U.S. citizens, which includes being subject to tax on income from both U.S. and foreign sources. They are subject to the same rules as U.S. citizens regarding income tax withholding and making estimated tax payments throughout the year. To the extent such withholding or payments exceed an individual's income tax liability, he or she may receive a tax refund from the IRS, which could be reduced to collect the penalty for failure to comply with the individual mandate.", "Nonresident aliens are subject to different treatment. For example, some income earned by nonresident aliens is excluded from gross income and thus U.S. taxation, including foreign-source income, compensation paid by a foreign employer to a nonresident alien with a F, J, or Q-visa, compensation of employees of foreign governments and international organizations, and income exempt under an income tax treaty or other agreement. Since nonresident aliens are not subject to the individual mandate and therefore would not owe the penalty, their withholding and refund rules do not appear to be relevant.

Under the ACA, the open enrollment period for exchanges began October 1, 2013.

The subsidies go toward cost-sharing expenses, such as coinsurance and co-payments, and are paid to the insurance company and not directly to the enrollee.", "In order to claim the credit or subsidy, an individual's household income generally must be at least 100% but no more than 400% of the applicable federal poverty level (FPL). Household income is the family's adjusted gross income plus any excluded foreign income/housing costs, tax-exempt interest, and non-taxable Social Security benefits.

This is because the credit and subsidy are only available for months during which a person purchases health insurance through the exchanges and aliens who are not lawfully present are prohibited from buying insurance through an exchange. However, an individual who is not lawfully present may claim the credit or subsidy for an eligible family member. Thus, for example, a not-lawfully present parent may file a tax return claiming the premium credit if he or she has children who meet the credit's qualifications.", "In addition, the law provides specific rules for calculating the credits and subsidies for mixed-status families\u2014families where at least one member is an unlawfully present alien and at least one member is lawfully present or a U.S. citizen. For these families, the premiums used to compute the value of the credit and subsidies are reduced by any amount attributable to the non-lawfully present individual(s). Additionally, for determining whether the family meets the income/FPL criteria, family size and household income are reduced to account for the excluded family member(s).

However, in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius , the Supreme Court held that the withdrawal of all Medicaid funds from the states for failure to comply with the expansion of the program violated the Tenth Amendment (but also found that the withholding of just the funds associated with that expansion raised no significant constitutional concerns).", "Reportedly, 31 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid coverage, and another two states are considering expanding coverage, as of January 13, 2016.

Thus, in 31 states and the District of Columbia, all non-elderly U.S. citizens and certain noncitizens with income effectively up to 138% FPL are eligible for Medicaid. This reform not only expanded eligibility to a group that was not historically eligible for Medicaid (low-income childless adults), but it also raised Medicaid's mandatory income eligibility level for certain existing groups (e.g., individuals with disabilities and children age 6 through 18) to 133% of the FPL (effectively 138% of FPL) and is considered by some to be the most significant expansion of Medicaid eligibility in many years.

Notably, to be eligible for Medicaid, aliens must also meet the program's financial and categorical eligibility requirements. Most legal permanent residents (LPRs) entering the United States after August 22, 1996, are barred from Medicaid for five years, after which time they are eligible at the state's option.

This requirement is similar to and compatible with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) system established by Section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) verifies the name, social security number, and date of birth of the individual. For those attesting to be U.S. citizens, the attestation is considered substantiated if it is consistent with SSA data. For individuals who do not claim to be U.S. citizens but attest to be lawfully present in the United States, the attestation is considered substantiated if it is consistent with DHS data. The ACA requires such verification of all individuals seeking exchange coverage regardless of whether they would be federally subsidized or would pay premiums entirely on their own.", "Some argue that because the verification system does not include a biometric identifier, it could lead to identity theft; however, requiring applicants to provide documents with biometric identifiers could lead to the inappropriate denial of credits and subsidies to eligible persons. The system only verifies that the name, SSN, and date of birth match the SSA's records and that immigration documents match DHS records; as a result, a person (e.g., a U.S. citizen, a not-lawfully present alien) who is using the documents of an eligible person would not necessarily be denied access to an exchange or disallowed the premium credit and cost-sharing subsidies. Nonetheless, while all lawfully present noncitizens have documents with biometric identifiers, U.S. citizens do not necessarily have such documents, and, as a result, requiring such biometric identifiers could make it more difficult for some eligible U.S. citizens to gain access to an exchange and to claim the premium credits and cost-sharing subsidies.", "In an evaluation of the E-Verify system for employment, a system that is often compared to the system under the ACA because it electronically verifies both U.S. citizens and noncitizens, researchers estimated that 6.2% of all queries relate to unauthorized aliens, and that in about half (54%) of these queries the unauthorized aliens receive an inaccurate finding of being work-authorized, primarily due to identity theft. Thus, the researchers estimated that about 3.3% of all queries receive a false positive verification. In other words, it is estimated that of the unauthorized aliens that are run through the system, approximately 54% who are using false documents are not identified by the system.
