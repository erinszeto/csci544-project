The Administration estimates that collections from the filing fee would be $4 million in FY2016. Increase Minimum Amount in Controversy for Administrative Law Judge Adjudication of Claims to Equal Amou nt Required for Judicial Review. This proposal would increase the amount-in-controversy minimum required for administrative law judge adjudication to the same amount in controversy required for federal district court adjudication ($1,460 in CY2015). The proposal would better align the value of the claims appealed to the administrative law judge appeal level with the cost to adjudicate those claims. Appeals not reaching the amount-in-controversy minimum would be adjudicated by a Medicare magistrate (see proposal below). The amount-in-controversy minimum for administrative law judge adjudication would be adjusted annually consistently with the federal district court amount in controversy. Establish Magistrate Adjudication for Cl aims with Amount in Controversy Below New Administrative Law Judge Amount - in - Controversy Threshol d. This proposal would allow the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals to assign claim appeals when the claim value was below the federal district court minimum amount in controversy ($1,460 in CY2015) to attorney adjudicators. This proposal would allow the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals to assign higher amount in controversy and more complex appeal claims to administrative law judges, which would help the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals to reduce the appeal backlog and expedite future appeal processing. Expedite Procedures for Claims with No Material Fact in Dispute . This proposal would allow the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals to issue decisions without a hearing if there was agreement on the material facts of the appeal, such as appeals of claims in which Medicare does not cover a particular drug or device or if a finding in favor of the appellant would be outside an administrative law judge's authority. Remand Appeals to the Redetermination Level with the Introduction of New Evidence . This proposal would remand appeals to the first appeal level (redetermination) when new evidence was submitted for the record at the second or subsequent appeal levels. Exceptions may be made if evidence was provided to the lower-level adjudicator but erroneously omitted from the record or if an adjudicator denied an appeal on a new and different basis than was made at an earlier determination. This proposal would provide an incentive for appellants to include all evidence early in the appeals process and ensure the same record was considered at all appeal levels. Sample and Consolidate Similar Claims for Administrative Efficiency . This proposal would authorize the Secretary to use sampling and extrapolation to adjudicate claim appeals and to consolidate at all appeal levels similar appellant cases into a single administrative appeal. Entities that were appealing extrapolated overpayments or that had consolidated appeals previously would be required to file one appeal request for any remaining disputed claims.

Rebates for the first drug category (i.e., drugs still under patent or those once covered by patents) have two components: a basic rebate and an additional rebate.
